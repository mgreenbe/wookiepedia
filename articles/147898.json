The mission went awry, and Doneeta found himself siding with the Beast Riders against the Naddists, followers of the ancient Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd that were led by Queen Amanoa of Iziz. The battle ended with the arrival of Master Jeth, who defeated Amanoa and banished Nadd's influence from Iziz. Doneeta and his companions remained on the planet to oversee Amanoa's funeral, and he was present when the forces of Amanoa's husband, King Ommin, arrived to steal both her remains and those of Nadd, Ommin's Sith forefather. After the ensuing battle, Doneeta stayed behind while Jeth attempted to retrieve the sarcophagi, but when Jeth was captured by King Ommin, Doneeta and his companions called for assistance from the Galactic Senate on Coruscant.

Many of Qel-Droma's colleagues were against his plan, and Doneeta was among those who were sent to collect him from the Krath, only to find that Qel-Droma had embraced the dark side and had become a Sith Lord. Qel-Droma and the Krath began a holy crusade and joined forces with Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun to wage the Great Sith War upon the Republic. When the Sith Brotherhood invaded Coruscant, Doneeta was among the Jedi that helped capture Qel-Droma so that he could be tried for his various war crimes. However, Qel-Droma was freed by Exar Kun, and together they resumed their war of galactic conquest. Doneeta was later present on the library world of Ossus when the Sith Brotherhood caused a supernova that threatened to devastate the planet. He assisted in the evacuation proceedings by gathering many priceless Jedi artifacts before the conflagration hit. The Sith were ultimately overthrown by the Jedi when Qel-Droma\u2014who had renounced his allegiance to the Dark Lord\u2014led Doneeta and his companions to Kun's stronghold on Yavin 4.

When slavers came to Ryloth and abducted Doneeta and his family, the young Twi'lek fought in the defense of his family until he was beaten unconscious. The captors brought Tott and his family on board their starship and headed for the slave markets in the space city of Ereesus, but were intercepted by a team of Jedi Knights led by the Arkanian Master Arca Jeth, who defeated the slavers and freed Tott and his family. Awed by the battle prowess of Master Jeth, Tott hoped to become like him one day. Jeth also recognized young Doneeta's Force sensitivity, and offered to take him to his praxeum on Arkania for Jedi training. Though one of the few aliens at Jeth's school, Doneeta took to his studies diligently while undergoing instruction alongside Jeth's most gifted student, Ulic Qel-Droma, and Ulic's younger brother, Cay. The three trained together for many years, and Doneeta developed a close friendship with the brothers. In 4000 BBY, Jeth deemed their training nearly complete and sent Doneeta with the Qel-Dromas on their final test and first mission: to mediate a peaceful resolution to a centuries-long civil war fought between the citizens of the planet Onderon's only city, Iziz, and the Beast Riders of Onderon's wilderness. As Doneeta and Cay Qel-Droma boarded their ship, the Nebulon Ranger, Master Jeth gave Ulic specific instructions as his representative to find a nonviolent resolution and to raise arms only if necessary, before Ulic himself joined his brother and the Twi'lek.

Doneeta performed evasive maneuvers while preparing to retaliate, but was stayed by Ulic as the city's wall defenses covered their descent by unleashing turbolaser fire against the outlawed Beast Riders. Once they had safely landed inside the city walls, Doneeta and his companions were greeted by the queen's emissary, Novar, who immediately refused the Twi'lek entry, claiming that aliens were forbidden to enter the royal palace. Ulic and Cay demanded Doneeta's passage, going so far as to draw their lightsabers in his defense. The queen was expecting all three Jedi, however, and Novar received instructions by comlink ordering them all to be brought before her at once. Doneeta was released, and the trio was escorted through Iziz, with the Twi'lek feeling increasingly unsettled by the city-dwellers, sensing something that he could not quite pinpoint was amiss.

He and Cay followed the Commandos but arrived too late; Amanoa had been incapacitated and Galia kidnapped. Doneeta suggested to his companions that they report the situation to Master Jeth, as the Twi'lek believed that events had spiraled out of control.

Rather than attack the creatures, Doneeta soothed and conversed with the bomas through the Force. From them, he learned that Galia was marrying Beast Rider Lord Oron Kira in the fortress of his father, Modon. The bomas allowed the Twi'lek Jedi and his companions to mount them as steeds and carried them to the Beast Rider citadel.

During their exodus, they were threatened by incineration from a heat storm, a natural weather occurrence on Ryloth. As they took refuge in the caves of the barren world, they were overtaken by the storm, and many perished in its merciless heat. Rather than allow any more people to be consumed by the perilous phenomenon, Doneeta\u2014bound by what he felt was his obligation as a Jedi\u2014decided to face the storm head-on. As the searing winds destroyed all in their path, Doneeta stood firm and used the Force to temporarily halt the disaster's advance before it ultimately overcame him. It passed as quickly as it had manifested, and though Tott survived, his face was considerably burned. After the storm, the Jedi's clansmen returned to where he had fallen and were surprised to find him alive yet injured. Doneeta was urged by them to stay on Ryloth and recover, but he refused.

Flying too close to the system's namesake star, Vima had to abandon the craft, only to have her escape pod hauled in and saved by the Twi'lek Jedi before she was engulfed by solar flares. Doneeta then delivered the teen to her mother, and Sunrider expressed much gratitude for his benevolent act.

Doneeta sensed the bitterness within her, and though she reveled in it, the Twi'lek recognized in her the same dangerous passion he had once seen in Qel-Droma. Thus, he offered to help her become free of her anger.

He left Sylvar with his kinsmen and instructed her to help them in building their new city, while he approached the two clan leaders in an attempt to end the civil discord. Upon his return, however, Tott was displeased to learn that Sylvar was attempting to rally the Doneeta clansmen against the R'lyeks and turn them into soldiers. He instantly dismissed Sylvar's plan to take up arms and explained that through his mediation, the clan leaders decided to unify themselves into one tribe and effect a cease of aggressions. Ashamed at his fellow Jedi for so readily choosing violence over diplomacy, Doneeta admonished Sylvar for choosing unnecessary combat as a means to an end.

Doneeta was taken aback by the zeal with which Sylvar's people cherished her, and he even accompanied her as she was honored during a parade held in her name. The Twi'lek felt that Sylvar, who sulked throughout the entire event, should have shown more gratitude for the pride the Cathar had taken in her. However, all she wanted was isolation, and in her opinion, pageants were a far cry from her desired solitude. Sylvar recognized her own rage, and after consulting one of her people's elders, asked that Doneeta accompany her in a ritual Cathar blood hunt, which she believed would help her in releasing some of her smoldering anger.

Nearing their mark, he was awed by the carnage caused by their quarry\u2014the giant omnivorous Kiltik insects of Cathar, which preyed upon any beast or being unfortunate enough to cross their path. The creatures were nocturnal, and because he and Sylvar were attacking by day, Doneeta was concerned that they would have to go deep within the Kiltik nest before any of the insects appeared. His theory was short-lived as a Kiltik guard soon confronted them, which Sylvar cut down easily with her lightsaber. Brandishing his own blue-bladed weapon, he was led by Sylvar deeper into caves until they happened upon the queen's lair. Instead of participating, Doneeta watched as she gave into her rage and slew every Kiltik in sight. It was then that he realized how unprepared he was to deal with the depth of Sylvar's rage, unable to help her cast it aside. He recognized the path on which she was traveling by allowing her negative emotions guide her actions, the same path by which Ulic Qel-Droma descended into darkness. Rather than attempt to convince Sylvar of her wrongs any further, Tott Doneeta left her in the Cathar desert to both remember Qel-Droma's fall and contemplate the fact that her own actions were taking her in the same direction.

He idolized Master Jeth, and sought to follow his teacher's example as closely as possible. He only spoke when he was spoken to and was never a slave to emotions or heedless action; in fact, he would only ignite his lightsaber when all other options had been exhausted. In the way of his Twi'lek kinsmen, Doneeta was a keeper of the peace, who preferred to exercise intelligence and cunning rather than blatant violence.

As a Jedi Guardian, Tott Doneeta could always be seen fighting on the front lines of whatever battles he participated in. When fighting erupted on the library world of Ossus, Doneeta refrained; he instead assisted in the collection and preservation of whatever Jedi artifacts he could gather and was saddened by the fact that generations of Jedi lore would be lost in the planet's devastation.

He eventually accepted the fact that Qel-Droma had willingly succumbed to the wiles of the Krath, and Doneeta's duty as a Jedi superseded his devotion to his friend, for whom he still cared deeply. Though at first hesitant, he decided leave Qel-Droma in Cinnagar to experience the consequences of his actions. During the Jedi's second attempt to claim Qel-Droma, Doneeta joined Ulic's brother Cay and former lover Nomi Sunrider, in spite of his prior reluctance to save the elder Qel-Droma, by providing aerial support for his team while they attempted to forcefully extract Ulic from the Krath Iron Citadel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, during the battle of Ossus, Doneeta was mortified when he witnessed the murder of Cay at the hands of his own brother, and he was further numbed when Sunrider used her newly-learned Sever Force ability to render Ulic insensitive to the Force.

A decade after the end of the Sith War, Tott Doneeta attempted to assist his fellow Jedi Knight and friend, the Cathar Sylvar, to lay aside her anger and hatred for Ulic Qel-Droma, who had never been convicted for his accused war crimes during his time as a Sith Lord.

When the prototype Star Saber starfighters were made available to the Jedi, Tott Doneeta tested one under the call sign of \"Jedi Four\".

The detonation overwhelmed him, however, and he was unable to maintain the shield for much longer afterward.

On two occasions, Doneeta joined his fellow Jedi in creating walls of light; first subduing Ulic Qel-Droma during the Krath/Mandalorian raid on Coruscant and again over Yavin 4 to trap Exar Kun for thousands of years within the walls of his temple. In 3986 BBY Tott Doneeta came to the defense of his clansmen and attempted to protect them by using the Force to briefly stall a Ryloth heat storm.

Early in his Jedi career, he developed an unusual yet natural ability to telepathically communicate with beasts, a talent that proved useful when he tamed wild bomas as steeds to be ridden through the jungles of Onderon. Doneeta also understood the bomas when they told him of Princess Galia's whereabouts in the Beast Riders' citadel. When Queen Amanoa later revealed her Sith sorcery to the Jedi, Doneeta immediately recognized it to be that of the dark side and continued to feel as though his Force connection was being smothered by her spell of darkness. After Nomi Sunrider and her team of Knights arrived on Onderon to assist Doneeta and the other beleaguered Jedi during the Naddist Uprising, the Twi'lek felt his own Force strength renewed as Sunrider's battle meditation drove the power of King Ommin from the atmosphere of the planet.

When the Naddist Revolt broke out, Doneeta continued to alternate between his curved-handle weapon, which now produced a green blade, and the straight purple one. The curved, green-bladed lightsaber remained with Doneeta throughout the Krath conflict, using it in battles that took place on Deneba and Coruscant. Later in life, after he returned to his homeworld of Ryloth, Doneeta chose to carry a rarely-seen Jedi katana; not a blade of energy, but rather one of curved metal.
