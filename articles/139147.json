The New Republic Senator Tai-Lin Garr was killed by Arliz Hadrassian, the leader of the Amaxine warriors, a paramilitary faction that had been destroyed during a skirmish on Sibensko. Garr was a prominent member of the Populist faction in the Galactic Senate who had been nominated as the new Populist candidate for First Senator. After shooting Garr, Hadrassian turned the gun on herself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the assassination, the Populists held a memory service to honor their fallen comrade. Later Lady Carise Sindian, a prominent Centrist senator and a secret agent of the First Order, fabricated evidence framing Ransolm Casterfo, a dissident Centrist as an accomplice of Hadrassian. In retaliation, Casterfo's friend Leia Organa convinced the Elder Houses to strip Carise of all her royal titles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the mission to Sibensko, the Populist Senator Leia Organa gave a speech to the Galactic Senate on Hosnian Prime where she detailed the findings of her investigation. While Rinnrivin Di's cartel and the Amaxine warriors had been eliminated as threats to the New Republic, she warned that other threats still lingered. While several senators greeted her with hostility and disbelief due to her parentage as Darth Vader's daughter, her Centrist colleague Senator Ransolm Casterfo vouched for her. He presented evidence from his mission to Daxam IV corroborating her account that the Amaxines admired the Old Empire and had posed a threat to the New Republic. This restored some of Leia's credibility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Casterfo's actions antagonized his fellow Centrist Lady Carise Sindian, who was a secret agent of the First Order, a remnant of the Old Empire. To discredit Casterfo, she hired the Amaxine leader Arliz Hadrassian to assassinate the Populist politician Tai-Lin Garr, Leia's friend and the next contender for First Senator. She also used her slicers to create a fake video showing that Casterfo and Hadrassian were allies. Lady Carise viewed Casterfo as a threat to her and her allies' plans to aid the First Order's plans to conquer the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Assassination"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ten days after Leia's final speech to the Galactic Senate, Tai-Lin Garr and several Populists colleagues including Leia and Varish Vicly held a rally at a public park on Hosnian Prime. A large crowd had gathered from across the galaxy to greet the senior senator on his first campaign trail. Under Lady Carise's orders, Hadrassian infiltrated the crowd. When she got close enough to Tai-Lin, she shot him in the heart with her blaster; killing him instantly. Amidst the chaos, Hadrassian had a brief verbal exchange with Leia. Before shooting herself in the head, Hadrassian taunted Leia by telling her that she was thinking strategically. Hadrassian's suicide prevented the New Republic authorities from investigating her links to Lady Carise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The assassination of Tai-Lin Garr, a prominent senator who had served since the formation of the New Republic, led to mass mourning in the Galactic Senate. Both the Populists and Centrists put aside their bickering to mourn the elder politician. The Senate postponed future elections indefinitely due to the political unrest. The New Republic authorities and media believed that Arliz Hadrassian was the mastermind of the Amaxines, the Napkin Bombing, and Rinnrivin's cartel who had murdered Tai-Lin in revenge for the deaths of her Amaxine warriors on Sibensko. Leia was skeptical of the official reports that a small-time businesswoman could bankroll a well-armed militia and a criminal syndicate. She voiced her suspicions at Tai-Lin Garr's memorial service but was rebuffed by Varish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following day, Lady Carise leaked a doctored video showing Casterfo shaking hands with Hadrassian. As a result, the New Republic authorities identified Casterfo as the financier and mastermind behind Hadrassian and the Amaxines. Casterfo was promptly arrested for financing and supplying intelligence to a terrorist organization. Per Senate policy, he was deported to his homeworld of Riosa to face imprisonment, trial, and sentencing. Leia and her chief staffer Greer Sonnel realized the video was fake but were unable to stop Casterfo's deportation. After deducing that Lady Carise was responsible for Casterfo's frame-up and for exposing her true parentage, Leia convinced the Elder Houses to strip Carise of all her royal titles. Disillusioned with the Senate, Leia formed a paramilitary outfit called the Resistance to protect the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tai-Lin Garr's assassination serves as the climax of Claudia Gray's 2016 novel Bloodline."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
