It comprised two submodules: the Obedience Module and the Cogitative Theory Unit. Successful interaction of the submodules caused droids to behave in a logical and socially acceptable manner. A malfunction could produce inexplicable or erratic behavior. C-3PO believed that R2-D2's obedience-rational module had developed a flutter, leading to the droid's refusal to replay the holomessage from Princess Leia Organa in front of Luke Skywalker after the pair of droids had been bought by the Lars family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "C-3PO mentioned the obedience-rational module in the novelization of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. A Guide to the Star Wars Universe deemed it part of the behavioral circuitry matrix but mistranscribed its name as Obedience-Rationale Module. This latter term was later used in The New Essential Guide to Droids. However, The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia used both terms. \"Obedience-rationale module\" was used in the entry for behavioral circuitry matrix, while \"obedience-rational module\" was the name of the component's specific encyclopedia entry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
