However, it required extensive maintenance. The ship had no weapons and weak shields. The entire ship could be connected to a cargo module capable of carrying 75,000 metric tons. The BD-27 was quickly replaced by larger bulk freighters, and was relegated to use in small operations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
