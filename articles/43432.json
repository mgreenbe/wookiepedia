While they worked, Elihsu and his fellow Sullustan Garthe were secretly stealing from the corpses they found. He and the rest of his team, minus Garthe and the human Cera, went out early one day in 3643 BBY from their base at Waypoint Station Aurek on an expedition into a dangerous area of the ruins.
