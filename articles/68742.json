He was really annoyed with his wingman who wouldn't stop complaining about their boring assignment, though Jak was quite pleased. He liked it much more than endlessly chasing the Rebels through the galaxy. The two pilots were waiting for the Imperial Star Destroyer Adjudicator to pick them up, when a sudden blast destroyed Jak's TIE Fighter. It was no one else than Boba Fett who approached the crash site with his starship Slave I to search the Anya Karu for a lost holorecording he would later deliver to Aron Harcourt. Before Jak's wingman could figure out what had happened, Fett blasted his TIE into pieces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
