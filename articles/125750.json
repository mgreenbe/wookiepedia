After the Republic transitioned into the Galactic Empire, the remaining Maelstrom-class battle cruisers complemented the Imperial Navy until they were either broken up, used as test beds, or mothballed. The Simoom was one of the starships to be mothballed, but was later under the control of the Rebel Alliance, who deployed it as part of the Alliance Navy during the Galactic Civil War against the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
