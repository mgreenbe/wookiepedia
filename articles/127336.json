Originally developed to control Wookiee prisoners and slaves, the Slavemaster fired a powerful pulse of stunning energy for capturing live targets; this pulse could be widened up to four meters in diameter for capturing multiple targets alive simultaneously. The Slavemaster was configured for Trandoshan anatomy, making it difficult for non-Trandoshans to use, though special training could overcome this. It was the ideal non-lethal weapon for slavers who didn't want to damage their wares."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
