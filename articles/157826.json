It was assumed that their interest stemmed from a genetic flaw in the Duinuogwuin's reproductive system that meant that the offspring of two Duinuogwuins had a greater than average chance of being born as an unintelligent, mindless beast. The theory's hypothesis on organic cold fusion was believed to hold the key to the Duinuogwuin's problem."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
