One Human Naboo citizen, a tough-looking woman, fled into the swamps surrounding Naboo's Capital city, Theed. While in the wilderness, she fell under the hypnotic influence of Savor Kibbs, a charismatic Dark Force Adept that had been rejected for training by the Jedi Council. Under Kibbs' influence, the tough-looking woman became an unreasoning fanatic that opposed the leadership of Naboo's Queen, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and promoted Kibbs' superiority."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kibbs developed a plan to use the tough-looking woman, as well as other refugees that had fallen under his influence, to disrupt the peace treaty between the Naboo people and the native Gungans so that he could seize control of the planet for himself. Elements of the plot were discovered by Lialla Tane, a Human female agent of the Naboo Underground. The Underground, an organization that had successfully resisted the Trade Federation's occupation, dispatched several capable agents, mostly students from Theed's Royal House of Learning lead by Tane, to investigate Kibb's renegades. When the agents discovered Kibbs' encampment, the tough-looking woman and other renegades, a Gungan warrior and an angry young man, challenged the convictions of the Underground's agents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Savor Kibbs himself intervened, attacking the agents with Force powers and a reprogrammed Droideka, but was ultimately defeated. The dark hold he had over his followers vanished, and the refugees, including the tough-looking woman, were returned to the city of Theed and a normal state of mind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
