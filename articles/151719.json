The Human male was one of three pilots that Phennir brought to the planet Adumar in that year on a diplomatic mission to convince the government of the nation state of Cartann to join the Empire.

Racking up many kills, they gained considerable honor, in accordance with local customs. During their time on-world, Cartann declared war on the other nations of Adumar. The Imperials fought for them when forces of the Yedagon Confederacy attacked Cartann. The New Republic pilots flew with the Confederacy, and the Human male was the third Imperial pilot to die, his TIE interceptor brought down by a laser salvo from Wedge Antilles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar, one of Phennir's men is described as being a tall, red-headed man.
