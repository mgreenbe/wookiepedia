Gilas' stocky build was a result of of creating more varied body types for the Trandoshans to make them all physically unique from the more iconic Bossk, a Trandoshan that appeared earlier in the series. Coined by series lead Dave Filoni, Gilas' name is derived from two sources, the first being Angilas\u2014more commonly known as Anguirus\u2014, a character from the Godzilla franchise; and the second being the 1959 film The Giant Gila Monster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
