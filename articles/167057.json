It featured reflection cards from previous editions of YJCCG, as well as preview cards from the final expansion pack, Boonta Eve Podrace. This set contained foils as well as \"combo\" and \"dual\" cards. The combo cards contained 2 battle or effect cards that utilized the effects of both cards mashed into one. The dual cards were placed sideways (the back remained the same) and contained a side-by-side battle/effect card. Either one could be played, you just had to state which one when. Also, if you used the \"effect\" card, then the battle card couldn't be played. This was similar to what the Star Wars Customizable Card Game Reflections II: Expanding the Galaxy and Reflections III sets did."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This expansion contained 100 cards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Card list"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External Links"}]}
