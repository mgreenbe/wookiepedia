As the bulk of the army fielded by the Confederacy of Independent Systems consisted of battle droids, it became practical for the clone troopers of the Republic to employ electromagnetic pulse weapons specifically designed to overload electronic circuitry, and the V-6 haywire grenade was an early product of this strategy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "V-6 haywire grenades were calibrated to cause massive electrical disruptions to the circuitry of droids, unleashing electromagnetic pulse blasts upon detonation. The power of these blasts were capable of violently bursting combat droids asunder, and in this way, the grenade was very similar to its cousin, the electromagnetic pulse launcher designed for the use of clone jet troopers. Like ion grenades, haywire grenades inflicted less damage against organic beings. Nevertheless, they were still capable of electrocuting and even killing any organisms within the blast radius."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the beginning of the Clone Wars, V-6 haywire grenades comprised the standard equipment of regular, front-line clone troopers. The grenades therefore saw widespread use on many early fronts such as the First Battle of Geonosis, the First Battle of Kamino, and the Battle of Rhen Var where clones employed them effectively against not only B1-Series battle droids but also B2 super battle droids and droidekas. While the haywire grenades were potent, specialized clones such as clone sharpshooters and clone jet troopers were issued V-1 thermal detonators instead, and clone commandos favored their own powerful EMP grenades that they referred to as Electrostatic Charge Detonators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Towards the end of the war, V-6 haywire grenades were less commonly utilized, particularly after the transition from Phase I clone trooper armor to Phase II. The clone army was equipped with other models of EMP grenades including a variant that was less destructive yet still effective at disabling battle droids and the reverse-polarity pulse grenade used by Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commandos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sole appearance of the V-6 haywire grenade is the 2004 video game Star Wars: Battlefront though its model is only identified in the game's strategy guide. Only the standard clone troopers of the Soldier class are equipped with them while other clone units employ the V-1 thermal detonator. In the sequel, Star Wars: Battlefront II, the haywire grenade was removed to be replaced by the V-1 thermal detonator as the primary grenade of the standard clone trooper of the Soldier class."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
