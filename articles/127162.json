On Coruscant, crashes were rare, as most vehicles were equipped with auto-navigation systems, allowing them to proceed along pre-programmed routes. However, Coruscant air taxis had permission to leave the skylanes and take shortcuts throughout Galactic City. Traffic was usually heaviest in the early morning and late afternoon. While being chased across Milvayne, Doctor Chelli Aphra and the assassin droid 0-0-0 caught onto a passing freighter, only to find it later stuck in a skylane's heavy traffic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
