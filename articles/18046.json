By blockading the hyperspace entry points, Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh hoped to save starships that would otherwise be traveling through hyperspace from destruction, but she did support sending supply ships into the hyperlanes if a possible crisis began. Nevertheless, the blockade hurt the economies of various Outer Rim systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ships of the Trade Federation fleet would blockade the peaceful world of Naboo in order to pressure its leader, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, to sign a petition treaty. This would escalate into the Trade Federation's Invasion of Naboo. The Corporate Alliance would blockade the planet Malastare, leading the Republic in dispatching a Jedi-led task force that would resolve the matter. It was presumed its commander, Trench, was killed as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, during the Clone Wars, Admiral Trench, the same commander from the blockade of Malastare, would lead the Separatist Alliance's blockade of Christophsis. The fleet would be annihilated after the destruction of his flagship, the Providence-class Dreadnought Invincible, by an experimental stealth ship, allowing a Republic naval fleet to destroy the blockade. The Separatist were able to send reinforcements and force the Republic fleet to retreat. However, Republic reinforcements under Master Yoda were able to force the blockade's remaining ships to retreat. Later in the conflict, a fleet led by Captain Mar Tuuk would blockade Ryloth, though his forces would be destroyed by the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trade Federation, under Sib Canay, blockaded Pantora to force the Pantorans to join the Confederacy.

The blockade prevented entrepreneurs such as Lando Calrissian from bringing equipment to Lothal. Following the destruction of Governor Wilhuff Tarkin's flagship, the Sovereign, Lord Vader tightened the blockade in order to punish Lothal and prevent the Spectres from escaping. The Empire later sent Imperial Security Bureau Agent Alexsandr Kallus and several ships to Ibaar prevent any supplies and aid from being delivered to the Ibaarian underground network. Kallus was able to stop Phoenix Squadron during their first attack, but the blockade was broken by Captain Hera Syndulla and a prototype B-wing starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Lothal campaign, the blockade at Lothal was strengthened by the Seventh Fleet under Grand Admiral Thrawn. The Seventh Fleet blockaded Atollon to prevent Phoenix Squadron and the Massassi Group from escaping. Commander Jun Sato attempted to use Danaan tactics to break through the blockade, but sacrificed himself and Phoenix Nest to help Lieutenant Commander Ezra Bridger to get help. Fortunately, the survivng ships of both rebel cells were able to escape to Yavin 4 after Bridger and Clan Wren destroyed the last Interdictor-class Star Destroyer.
