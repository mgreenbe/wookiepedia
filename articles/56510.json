When turbolifts transitioned between two areas with differing gravity orientations, the lift rotated to match the destination's orientation. The compensators ensured that the lift occupants did not notice the transition at all. DoubleSec Corp manufactured gravity field compensators for starships, including the Kuari Princess, and the CEC YT-1300 light freighter featured gravity compensators in its central passage tube."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
