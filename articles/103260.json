The security force consisted of Pantoran law enforcement guards that were equipped with specialized police speeder bikes, swords, blaster pistols. Although their uniforms were similar to that of the Pantoran guard, they instead wore a red-and-blue clothing. Pantoran Security was active early during the Imperial Era, shortly after the Galactic Republic transitioned into the Galactic Empire. At this time, the rogue Imperial Clone Force 99 was chased by the bounty hunter Fennec Shand through Ro Station on the moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three guards of Pantoran Security responded to a public disturbance in the central marketplace after Shand and Clone Force 99 squad leader \"Hunter\" fought each other, which it described as a 315 in progress. While Clone Force 99 member Omega was pursued by Shand and Hunter, who was attempting to rescue her, on speeders, two guards witnessed the pursuit and gave chase in their own police speeders. Shand, subsequently shot and killed one of the following guards, who then crashed into the second and eventually both vehicles exploded as they collided with a building. After Hunter was able to rescue Omega and destroy Shand's speeder with an explosive, four more guards on police speeders responded to the scene."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pantoran Security first appeared in the 2021 Star Wars: The Bad Batch episode \"Cornered.\" It was identified in the credits of the episode."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
