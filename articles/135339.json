After the TIE fighters dock back in their hangar bay, Cadet Jace Rucklin (DT-798) complains about the repetitive rotations and having to refuel the fighters. He says he is a pilot and should be out there flying. Cadet Tamara Ryvora (DT-533) responds that Jace would rather be back at the Colossus serving Jawa juice.

Pyre admits this is the case and that one has become a Resistance cell but vows to capture it. General Hux tells him to hurry up and no more excuses. He says that he wants all Resistance cells in the galaxy quashed.
