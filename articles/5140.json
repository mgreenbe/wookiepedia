It was home to the diminutive, surface-dwelling Aleena species, and a bioluminescent tree-like species, the Kindalo. At one point in their history, the two species clashed which almost resulted in the destruction of all sentient life on the planet. During the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic arrived to help the Aleena rebuild after a series of devastating groundquakes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A world with a desert-like surface, Aleen was unique in that it contained a series of complex caverns in the upper crust that was viewed as a second biosphere with its own unique atmosphere. Formed by the growth of the unique arbozoic trees, the caverns were also comprised of tunnels carved by water, lava, and tectonic shearing. Maintaining a unique climate and an atmosphere dangerous to the surface-dwelling Aleena, the planet's two sentient species made the conscious decision to recognize the divide between the two environs and remain separated. Aleen's surface was dotted with the remnants of Aleena colossi that stood as relics of their ancient society abandoned in favor of a simpler lifestyle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The homeworld of both the Aleena and the Kindalo species, Aleen was a world of two distinct environments that had a shared, yet separate history. Establishing a strong culture and a fierce army, the Aleena built towering monoliths that were vital to the religious orders that formed on the planet in the earliest days of the Galactic Republic, and long before the galactic community had discovered the world. Undergoing an expansionist era, the Aleena settled other worlds and spread out into the greater galaxy, yet many remained on Aleen."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Conflict then peace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some years later, the Aleena came into conflict with the Kindalo that lived beneath the surface of the world, and the two cultures waged a terrible war that caused great damage to both societies through the use of technological weapons. When the casualties grew to such heights as to threaten the existence of life on Aleen, a compact was formed that secured the notion that neither society would interfere with the other again. To this end, the Great Seal was forged to serve as a reminder of the compact, and was placed within a primary tunnel opening that allowed access to the Underworld, where the Kindalo resided."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Great Seal was more symbolic then any actual barrier to the Underworld, as multiple tunnels and caverns were spread throughout the upper crust of the planet, it was a revered site among the Aleena. Vowing to leave behind the society that caused the near apocalypse on Aleen, the Aleena entered into an era of self-imposed seclusion and scaled back development considerably. Aleena families formed together into kinship clades known as tahikos. The individual settlements across the planet maintained contact with a planetary government that advised the King of Aleen, a ceremonial role usually held by distinguished priests."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rediscovery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the course of the millennia, Duros spacers eventually discovered Aleen and introduced the Jedi Order to the world. Establishing a chapter house over top of the Great Seal, the Jedi protected the world for a time, before abandoning their chapter house and allowing it to fall into disrepair."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars and the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic saw operations on the world during the Clone Wars, when the Great Seal became dislodged and the two atmospheres began to intermix. As a result, groundquakes began to cause major disruption on the planet, their work was humanitarian in nature. During the relief effort, a mysterious being called Orphne and white living trees were recorded by Republic agents\u2014particularly the droids C-3PO and R2-D2\u2014although her nature remained ambiguous. When the Galactic Empire came to power at the end of the war, the Empire established a observation post and listening station on Aleen's lone moon, Trohlu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
