While the members of the Jedi Order that first landed on Weik had long been forgotten, the legend could indicate the Order's members had a hand in the construction of the guild hall. The ceiling of the central hall was made of transparisteel that was considered an architectural model. Within the Guild Hall, the members of the city's most powerful commerce guilds met to govern the city and negotiate the movement of wind-ships across the Rimesea and ensure the stability of trade routes between Vossport and far-off ports such as Fume."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
