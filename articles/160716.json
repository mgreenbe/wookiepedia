Vibroweapons had more cutting power with less effort from the wielder. Some handles were designed to dampen the vibration effect for the user, though cruder versions, such as Arg'garoks wielded by the Gamorreans, used wooden handles. These weapons were often left deactivated, simply to allow the user to show off their physical strength and to intimidate rivals, since these weapons were capable of easily decapitating most humanoid species with a single blow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A vibro-ax required two energy cells to operate.
