It was used by Colonel Maximilian Veers at the Battle of Zaloriis during the Galactic Civil War. After the battle, Veers was promoted to General. Veers later took control of Blizzard 1 to lead the Imperial attack group Blizzard Force in its assault upon Echo Base at the Battle of Hoth, targeting and successfully destroying the Rebel main power generator. Immediately after destroying the shield generator, Blizzard 1 was disabled when the snowspeeder Rogue 4, piloted by Derek Klivian and Kesin Ommis, crashed into its cockpit. Though Veers survived the crash, albeit with serious injuries to his legs that forced him to rely on a small power chair carriage for the rest of his life, the rest of Blizzard 1's crew perished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In The Empire Strikes Back novelization, a dying Derek Klivian crashes into Blizzard 1, killing himself and Veers. This was contradicted by later sources showing both characters alive after Hoth. Later retcons incorporated this source by having the crash occur, with Hobbie surviving due to copious amounts of bacta therapy, and Veers receiving crippling injuries. Also, a flaw in the 2006 video game Star Wars: Empire at War, prevented Blizzard 1 from being toppled by snowspeeders, which has been fixed in a patch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Veers was seen driving Blizzard 1 in the 2006 video game LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy and its 2007 compilation re-release."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
