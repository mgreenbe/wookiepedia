The main parts came from almost thirty different manufacturers; the manufacturers of the minor parts were countless. The hull itself combined those of a Kuat Systems Engineering Firespray-class patrol and attack craft and a Ckratar Crafts Venturer-class freighter. The power converters had been stolen from Koensayr Manufacturing, the primary sensor array was from Primarin Starshipwrights Union, and the two flight computers came from a Gamma-class assault shuttle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Warren obtained the ship or its part as a payment from a student who had a talent for ship design and repairs, but not for finances.
