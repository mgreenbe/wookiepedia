In 3 ABY, a trio of the brown-furred individuals known as the Kagles made and served the fried dish along with jing-jang berries and tobo leaves to the Ewok Teebo for dinner while on the Forest Moon of Endor. Teebo later recounted the dinner's dishes to his friend, Wicket Warrick."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fried mahuga was mentioned in \"Home is Where the Shrieks Are,\" the third episode in the second season of the animated television series Ewoks. The episode was written by Bob Carrau, and it premiered on September 20, 1986. In the episode, after Teebo tells Wicket of three foods that the Kagles fed him, he holds up a small, orange sphere, indicating that that was all he had left from dinner. As the episode does not establish which of the foods the sphere is, this article refrains from linking it with fried mahuga or any of the other foods he mentioned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
