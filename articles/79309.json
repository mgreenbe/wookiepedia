During the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, Warmaster Nas Choka relayed to Supreme Commander Laait that the flotilla he sent to Zonama Sekot had encountered living vessels, and instructed Laait to inform Supreme Overlord Shimrra. Laait summoned Shimrra from his \"meditation\" with the gods, much to the Supreme Overlord's dismay.
