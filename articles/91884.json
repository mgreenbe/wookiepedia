In 21 BBY, Mixer was part of a Republic escort team led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker that was tasked with guarding Duchess Satine Kryze of the planet Kalevala due to concerns of an assassination attempt on her by the Mandalorian terrorist organization known as Death Watch. Kryze was traveling aboard her Nau'ur-class yacht, the Coronet, to plead her people's neutrality in the war before the Galactic Senate. The escort team was placed on high alert and assigned to various patrol routes aboard the yacht. Mixer and his partner, Redeye, monitored the cargo area, and they began their sweep accompanied by Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two clones separated as Redeye began checking the cargo bay's south quadrant while Mixer surveyed the opposite side. As Redeye began his search, a SD-K4 assassin droid, smuggled aboard the yacht by the traitorous senator and Death Watch agent Tal Merrik in an attempt on Kryze's life, attacked and killed the clone. When Mixer attempted to contact his friend via comlink to check in, he received no response. Just then, Redeye's abandoned DC-15A blaster carbine suddenly fell to the ground at Mixer's feet. Mixer picked up the weapon in perplexity, only to be ambushed from behind by the spiderlike assassin droid and killed as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R2-D2 soon happened upon Mixer's empty helmet lying on the cargo bay's ground and then ran into clones Rex and Cody, who had come to investigate.
