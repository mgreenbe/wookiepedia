Emil Graf questioned all the commotion that was taking place and did not believe it was necessary to go through the ship like they were. Crater didn't care but Graf told him a story about it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Decades earlier, at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina the bartender, Wuher asked Kabe if she wanted her normal beverage of blue milk. But Kabe didn't have any credits to pay for it and trying to appease Wuher was not working. Kabe stormed off but overheard a conversation between two other patrons of the cantina. One said that a heist could get them more credits then they have ever asked for. Their job was to do a heist on a Imperial cruiser. One of them was very reluctant to participate. The patron stormed off leaving the other one alone. Kabe left the cantina and headed to the cruiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cruiser was being guarded by stormtroopers but Kabe snuck by them. An Imperial officer spotted her though but she managed to slip away from his sight. She did get spotted by stormtroopers who opened fire on her. She dodged their fire and threw down a thermal detonator near them. The detonator exploded and Kabe entered the cruiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She spotted her objective ahead but set off the booby traps. She dodged all the red lasers shot at her and escaped the cruiser with her prize. When she went back to the cantina she surprised the patron with the object. He paid her a lot of credits and Wuher got her an extra glass of blue milk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on the Star Herald, Graf put down a cake which attracted Noni. Graf pointed out that sometimes it is better to take the easy solution.
