Bol lived on the planet Caarimon, the homeworld of her species, and around 21 BBY the technician assumed a post at a secret Cartel base situated deep below ground in a tunnel network on the moon Tilnes in the Cularin system. There, Bol worked on a secret project to develop pseudonet encryption, which the Cartel considered to be of high importance. The technician's other duties at the base included tracking shipments of cargo, conducting inventory counts and descrambling things. Bol also maintained a personal log, saved on the Cartel base's computer network, which documented the technician's personal musings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Four months after arriving on Tilnes, Bol wrote an entry in the technician's personal log lamenting Bol's time at the base and commenting on how unpleasant the technician regarded being stuck in the secret facility below ground. The follow day, Bol listened to a speech by Thurm Loogg, the Metatheran Cartel's envoy to the Cularin system, which was broadcast via the Caarite holonet, during which Loogg spoke of the Cartel's strength and prosperity. Two days later, Bol was instructed to prepare some bean juice for Ko Bas, the Cartel base's overseer. Irked at being assigned such a menial task, Bol spat in the juice that the technician prepared for him. However, Bas detected the impurity in his drink via a purifier and Bol's pay was docked as a punishment.

Bol detested how the Cartel base on the moon operated in secret deep underground, believing this to be unnatural and that it would be better if the Cartel instead conducted business more openly in the Cularin system. Bol considered the Metatheran Cartel to be one of the most powerful corporations within the Galactic Republic and to be well placed to prosper from tumultuous Clone Wars, fought between the Republic and the separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems. The technician considered this viewpoint to be in line with how Thurm Loogg and Bol's colleagues regarded the Cartel's prospects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bol was pleased to be working on the importance pseudonet encryption project and was annoyed when tasked with preparing bean juice for Ko Bas, regarding such an insignificant task to not be worthy of them.\u00a0 After Bol was castigated for spitting in Bas' drink, the technician was permitted to remain working on the encryption project, which the technician considered to attest to Bol's\u00a0 importance. However, Bol resolved to take more care in the future to avoid getting into trouble again.
