Shortly after the Empire's rise, Clone Force 99 was sent to wipe out this camp. However, due to Clone Sergeant Hunter's reluctance to fire upon the unarmed civilians within the Partisans, the clone commando squad failed their mission. Later, a newly founded Elite Squad led by former Clone Force 99 member Clone Commander Crosshair, was dispatched to once again attempt to eliminate the camp. By this time, Partisan leader Saw Gerrera had already left the camp, leaving only a few of his soldiers and civilians behind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
