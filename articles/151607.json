While dangerous for the lead starfighter, this tactic proved effective against green pilots, who were often caught up in the heat of battle. The Under Split required at least two ships. In order to execute it, the lead ship shot in front of his wingman, as bait for the attacking fighters. While the attacker turned to follow the foremost fighter, the baited ship's wingman would fly under his leader and cut up, going for a quick belly shot at the attacker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
