Their numbers were culled for population control. Ursmal incisors were characterized by a mottled appearance; superficial \"cracks\" covered all 12 of its large front incisors. The ursmal's primitive nervous system was capable of sustaining only two states: deeply asleep, or fully awake. It was known to overpower large hunting parties, continuing to fight when mortally wounded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
