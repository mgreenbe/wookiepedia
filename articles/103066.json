At some point during the Galactic Civil War, he was sent to one of the domed cities of the planet Duro, with the task of negotiating a new capital ship contract in the Emperor's stead. In truth, that plan was a trap baited for the Rebel Alliance. The coded transmission regarding Palpatine's upcoming visit had been voluntarily leaked as a target for any Rebels who intercepted it. As planned by the Imperials, a group of Rebels intercepted the transmission and decided to make an assassination attempt on the man they thought was the Emperor himself. On Duro, the impersonator accomplished the mission, negotiating convincingly with the Durosian corporates. As soon as the Rebels made their presence known, the Empire sprang its trap on them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The impersonator served his Emperor as a decoy for security reasons.

The book states that the Difficulty Class to hit the false Emperor is 16, and adds that, if the attack is successful, the impostor \"slumps forward onto the table, dead.\" However, the Imperials react to the Rebel's presence regardless of whether the heroes were able to kill the impostor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
