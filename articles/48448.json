The explosions caused by their launching and detonation gave off intense bursts of light and radiation that flooded sensors. The YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon had its starboard escape pod replaced with a mine launcher loaded with sixteen firecracker mines in 16 ABY. Its Wookiee crew utilized the mines during a mission to the Koornacht Cluster to distract the sensor operators of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Pride of Yevetha, which allowed them to attach the Falcon to the Star Destroyer's hull and enter using a hull-cutting ring. After rescuing New Republic Commodore Han Solo from the ship, the Wookiees launched more mines as they made their escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
