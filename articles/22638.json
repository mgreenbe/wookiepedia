She was obstensibly a trade agent for the Outer Rim Trade Consortium, and recruited a number of Rebels on Kwevron shortly before the Battle of Yavin. On Kwevron, her most valuable contact was the Ithorian Idu Taanfaar until his death at the hands of Falto Dragen. She visited Duro shortly thereafter as the Alliance attempted to convince the Duro Shipwrights Guild and other corporations to increase their secret support for overthrowing the Galactic Empire. During the climactic events at Tatooine which saw Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi flee that world, Cala was present. After eluding Imperial entanglements, she returned to the base at Aargonar. She was present when the Empire found and destroyed the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Her ship was the Midnight Star, a modified YV-545 light freighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
