The Confederate General Grievous attempted to take his fleet through the asteroids, but the Galactic Republic had already placed AT-TE walkers on the rocks, ambushing the Confederacy and forcing Grievous to flee. Jedi General Anakin Skywalker gave pursuit in his fighter, but after debris hit his ship, he was rescued by Clone Captain CT-7567. Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, was salvaged by the Trandoshan scavenger Gha Nachkt, who promised the droid to Grievous.
