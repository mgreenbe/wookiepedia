After becoming a Jedi Master, Ka-Teen had a bounty placed on his head by Black Sun after a mission to Kriost Station interrupted one of their operations. Captured by a bounty hunter called Kallyx the Piner, Ka-Teen was tortured by Kallyx' knives for weeks. Questioned about Jedi secrets, Ka-Teen found a capacity of lying during his time with Kallyx, and never revealed anything. Describing his technique as \"the abandonment of truth,\" Ka-Teen successfully deceived Kallyx and he was eventually rescued by a Jedi strike team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Regarded as a hero by the High Council, Ka-Teen became withdrawn and prone to studying within the Archives of the Coruscant Jedi Temple for long hours alone. Ka-Teen began searching for the elemental truth, the fundamental constitution behind the concept of being honest. This search brought him to the Crown of Verity, an ancient Benetagean artifact kept within the Temple's Archives. Making many studies of the artifact, Ka-Teen pondered the vergence on the planet Auratera and its effects on the crown. Refusing to take the rank of General within the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, Ka-Teen was permitted by the High Council to take the Crown of verity to Acablas on Auratera and conduct an investigation. Escorted by Republic troops to the site, Ka-Teen was on the world when Contingency Order 66 was enacted and Ka-Teen was assumed to have been killed. Ka-Teen, the Crown, and the clone troopers were never seen again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
