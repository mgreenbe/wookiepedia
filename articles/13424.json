In 21 BBY, the Commander participated in the battle of Dorin, an attack launched by Confederate General Grievous. The battle droid was deployed on the surface of the planet Dorin, where the droid's troops started to overwhelm the resisting forces of the native Kel Dors. The Commander then led the attack on the civilian population of Dorin, causing devastating damage and killing many Kel Dors. The droid was soon contacted by Grievous, who was overseeing the battle from his command ship over the planet, and ordered the droid to press the attack to punish the inhabitans of the planet for staying loyal to the Galactic Republic. In response, the Commander sent several BX-series droid commandos to search and kill any survivors. However, Grievous soon learned that a Republic task force was sent to aid the Kel Dors, and he recalled his troops from the surface. Although the General had his droid starfighters prepared to repel the Republic's attack, the Republic task force was ultimately successful in destroying many of Grievous' ships and routing the rest of the fleet, as well as Grievous himself, out from Dorin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A field commander during the battle of Dorin, the battle droid followed the orders of General Grievous in a dutiful manner, laying waste to the Dorin civilian population.
