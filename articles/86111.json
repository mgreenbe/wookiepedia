At that time, nearly five times as many officers were supposed to be at the docks, but were occupied with Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala's arrival. The customs official accepted the bribery and allowed the Mooga smuggling ring to continue their operations of unloading an illegal shipment of tea and slabin. The official told Va to come to him as his contact directly when he needed to unload more shipments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Duchess Satine and her friend Senator Amidala along with a Mandalorian Protector investigated the Sundari shipping docks and saw the same customs official accepting another bribe.
