After the shuttle entered the Tyrants docking bay, the Tyrant was hit by another blast from the planetary ion cannon.

The commandos escaped with General Madine on a Lambda-class shuttle, with the Tyrant unable to pursue the shuttle. Later, the shuttle brought General Madine to the Mon Calamari Cruiser Champion, which then prepared to jump to hyperspace. Lennox engaged the cruiser with the now functional Tyrant, and proceeded to launch TIE fighters in preparation for battle. Lennox hailed the Champion and said that if they handed over General Madine, he would call off his attack. The captain of the Champion refused and ordered the launch of his ship's fighters.
