He was among the small contingent of soldiers who were sent by the Empire to infiltrate the Republic capital of Coruscant itself. In the Works section of the Galactic City Kasstroff met with a notorious thief Skavak, who delivered to him the prized Murustavan Ruby. The meeting was interrupted by Miel Muwn, Corso Riggs and Voidhound and in the ensuing firefight Kasstroff fatally wounded Muwn, before being killed himself. Only then did the Voidhound find out that the Ruby was faked all along and the deaths have been for nothing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
