The tower was used to oversee the island's security and two hundred guards were garrisoned inside the facility. The base also contained various sensors, listening devices, cameras, surveillance drones and jammers. It was rumored that the base was built to monitor the residents of Dorthus Tal City, and as a result many off-worlders avoided spending prolonged periods of time in the city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
