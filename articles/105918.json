They were loaded with powerful plasma blasts, shot from two turrets stationed on top of the satellite. One round was enough to destroy even the strongest fighter craft. Multiple shots could take down the shields of corvettes and frigates. It was not nearly as effective against multiple squadrons of fighters and frigates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
