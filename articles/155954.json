Sometime before she joined the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry, Brand came to the planet and the city had been enclosed by a ray shield that filtered out of the billowing dust of the surrounding silica plains. Shortly after the Battle of Hoth, the Sixty-First Mobile Infantry, also known as Twilight Company, rendezvoused on Ankhural and utilized a podracing track on the edge of the city for repairs on their ships, the Thunderstrike and the Apailana's Promise.
