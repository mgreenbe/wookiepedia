A shrewd people, the Koorivar strove to make their society one where corporate-mindedness was essential to each citizen. Through the combined efforts of the Koorivar people, these sentients were able to purchase a new homeworld called Kooriva from the Galactic Republic, following the loss of their native planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A tall humanoid species, the Koorivar craniums were studded with several small twisting horns, all of which surrounded a central spiraling one. Consisting of many shades of color, the spiraling horn was a mark of status in Koorivarn culture; those Koorivar with a genetic disposition to growing larger horns dominated the upper class of society. The horn itself developed in adolescence during puberty, and would continue to grow taller and thicker until reaching adulthood. In addition to their cranial horn, the Koorivar were marked by banded ridges that studded their brows and nose. Appearing in a riot of colors, Koorivar spoke in a soft whispering language which focused on body language. This aided them in the business world when communicating in Basic, as they could pick up on others gestures more acutely."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Native to a lost world, the Koorivar were forced to abandon their home when its life-giving star became unstable. Traveling the galaxy, the Koorivar settled on the tropical Inner Rim planet Kooriva, formally leasing it from the Galactic Republic. After centuries of living on the world, they adopted the name Koorivar and petitioned the Galactic Senate to allow them to purchase the world. Upon being turned down, the Koorviar were ousted by Kooriva's indigenous people and were forced to wander the galaxy. Instead of being defeated, the Koorivar strove to gain sway over members of the Senate through bargaining and corporate trickery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For over half a millennium the Kooriva traveled from planet to planet scheming and working to gain enough votes to overturn the decision that lost them their home. The Koorivar were ultimately successful in their endeavors and were able to return to Koorivar, gaining membership in the Galactic Senate and becoming closely tied with the Corporate Alliance. To keep Kooriva's market high, the species seeded the galaxy with agents, trading stocks and selling shares to increase their profit. Despite such successful strides, when the Koorivar attempted to sell war machines to battling peoples on both sides of planetary conflicts, their reputation was ruined and their market crashed following a Republic investigation, blockade and sanctions. To get the Republic to back off, the Koorivar took great strides to comply with all of the Republic's demands and hide any illegal deals more thoroughly. As the Republic began to decline, the Koorivar elected Corporate Alliance Magistrate Passel Argente as their planet's representative in the Galactic Senate. During the Separatist Crisis, Argente withdrew Kooriva from the Republic and took up a seat on the ruling council of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. To protect their interests on foreign worlds during the Clone Wars, Argente raised an army of his own people known as the Koorivar Fusiliers, a pivotal fighting force during the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war, Koorivar were deported in droves from Coruscant because of the species' affiliation with the Confederacy. Despite the illegality of their presence, many Koorivar refused to leave the planet and were forced to stroll the streets with caution and fear. At the war's height, the Separatist Council was slaughtered by Darth Vader, killing Passel Argente and spelling the demise of the Confederacy and the Corporate Alliance. With Argente dead, the Alliance fled to the Corporate Sector and quickly faded away. On Koorivar Republic soldiers, now under the banner of the Galactic Empire, persecuted the Koorivar for their involvement in the war and sent their economy into a downwards spiral. Despite the biases towards non-Humans prevalent during the reign of the Empire, the Koorivar were swift in taking up leading roles in the corporate world of the New Republic and despite the setbacks of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the species continued to thrive under the Galactic Alliance; not withstanding the added scrutiny of the Galactic Alliance Committee on Corporate Oversight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a society, the Koorivar prized financial prowess so much that all schools and academies on their home planet focused on the business arts. It was not uncommon for children as young as ten standard years old to have begun working or to have started their own business. Marriages on the planet were handled in the same fashion, with love considered to be unprofitable. Most Koorivar found jobs as merchants or nobles, ascending to the top of corporations across the galaxy and locking in a controlling interest in many different enterprises."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In regards to physical features, the Koorivar prized their central cranial horn as a symbol of dominance and social class. An unofficial class of superior Koorivar evolved to be made up of members of the species with thick, long horns which they decorated and adorned to emphasize their beauty. Females who had given birth to a child and raised a family draped a matron's hood over their head to note their importance in society. Loss of a horn was a damning thing, resulting in the loss of an individual's position in society, and on some occasions ended in banishment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Koorivar in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the bulk of the species maintained residence on the planet Kooriva, the species roams the galaxy as merchants and nobles striking up new deals where deals are to be had and increasing their commercial ties. Establishing colonies on planets such as Murkhana and Bomis Koori IV, the Koorivar could be spotted on Coruscant even after the species suffered mass-deportation during the Clone Wars. Common Koorivar names included Shand Essil, Terrem Jesond, Menas Neyrr, and Leosa Vantare. While at least one Koorivar entered into the ranks of the Jedi Order, wielding a blue-bladed lightsaber during Operation Influx during the New Sith Wars, a Koorivar male was actively undergoing training as an acolyte in the Order of the Sith under the leadership of Darth Krayt circa 137 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the most famed Koorivar was Magistrate Passel Argente of the Corporate Alliance. A member of the Council which led the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, Argente and his aide Denaria Kee were assassinated on Mustafar at the end of the conflict. Among the ranks of the Koorivar Fusiliers was General Oro Dassyne, a hornless male who perished during the war, and General Terrus of the 313th Legion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Koorivar were initially referred to as \"Koorivians\" in early sources based on Attack of the Clones.
