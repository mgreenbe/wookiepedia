Ace Azzameen, piloting the Sabra, landed at the outpost, disguised as a supplies ship. While Azzameen and his co-pilot MK-09 stalled the facility commander, the Rebel Commandos hidden on the ship sneaked out and captured the Tydirium. As they tried to escape, the Imperial forces in the area scrambled TIE/sa bombers to intercept them. With the Sabra escorting it, the Tydirium raced to get to the hyperspace point. Azzameen called in Rogue Squadron to aid in the operation, and the Tydirium successfully escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sabra was a tough, reliable ship and had a place in the hearts of the Azzameen family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The computer models and textures for both the cinematic and the in-flight appearances of the Sabra and Selu are identical to the one used for the Millennium Falcon model, with the exception of the sensor rectenna and belly turret."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
