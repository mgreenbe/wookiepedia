She stood at the chancellor's side along with Vice Chair Mas Amedda on the day Darth Sidious ended the Clone Wars and anointed himself Emperor of the First Galactic Empire. She was one of the few people who knew of Palpatine's true identity as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Force-sensitive female native of the planet Umbara, Sly Moore served as the Senior Administrative Aide to Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine\u2014who was, in secret, Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith\u2014following his election to that office, and stood beside both the Chancellor and Vice Chair Mas Amedda atop the Chancellor's podium in the center of the Galactic Senate Chamber, located in the Senate Building on the planet Coruscant, during sessions of the Galactic Senate. It was rumored that Moore threatened Sei Taria, Chancellor Finis Valorum's aide, with blackmail to resign when Taria tried to join Palpatine after Valorum's removal from office. Her past prior to her association with Palpatine was shrouded in mystery, but she was aware of Palpatine's dual role as Chancellor and Sith Master, and assisted the Sith's rise to power."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fall of the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moore was present in Chancellor Palpatine's office along with other senators and Jedi as the issue of whether Palpatine should take supernatural powers was debated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, she was present in the session of the Galactic Senate in which Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks of Naboo proposed that Palpatine be given emergency executive powers in order to combat the alleged threat that the Confederacy of Independent Systems posed to the Republic. The proposal was successful, and Palpatine declared that the clone army created in secret on Kamino would become the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, in which the Grand Army fought against the Separatist battle droid armies, Moore continued to serve the Chancellor and accompanied Janus Greejatus, Ars Dangor, Sate Pestage, and Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic to Geonosis to oversee Poggle the Lesser's homecoming. As Poggle gave a speech to his fellow Geonosians, Moore sat in the Petranaki Arena alongside the other emissaries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Coruscant, she was present with the Chancellor in the Galaxies Opera House on Coruscant for a performance of the Mon Calamari play Squid Lake.

A group of Jedi Masters, led by Mace Windu, attempted to arrest the Chancellor. Sidious killed all four Jedi Masters and publicly declared that the Jedi Order had attempted to take over the Republic. Moore was again present in a special session of the Senate, in which Sidious proclaimed that the Republic would be transformed into the Galactic Empire to ensure security and stability after the Clone War and the so-called Jedi rebellion."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Overseeing Ochi of Bestoon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Sith assassin Ochi of Bestoon had apparently buried the Sith Lord Darth Vader in the cave of the Eye of Webbish Bog on Mustafar on behalf of Sidious, Ochi, reveling in his success, was approached by Moore and four death troopers. Moore expressed her doubts of Vader being dead and refused to contact the Emperor. She told the assassin that Vader was looking for the Emperor's secrets in the cave and demanded to know if Ochi had told Vader anything. Ochi denied this, stating that it would not matter if he told Vader anything, because no one ever came back from the Eye. Moore, however, argued that Vader was still Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader ultimately survived the Eye of Webbish Bog and took Ochi prisoner inside an escape pod so he could seek Exegol to discover the Emperor's secrets. Moore was thus sent by the Emperor to complete Ochi's mission, assigning Admiral Corleque and his crew to assist Moore in the task with three Star Destroyers. Firing at Vader's ship, Moore contacted the Sith Lord and expressed her respect for him before notifying him that she would have to eliminate him. Unfazed, Vader told Moore that she would fail just like Ochi. Moore then ordered Corleque to not shoot the cannons and send eleven TIE fighters as \"brute force\" against Vader. Moore sarcastically congratulated Vader for outsmarting the TIEs and dismissed the losses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rest of the TIEs followed Vader until they reached the Red Honeycomb Zone, where a space-faring creature destroyed them. Moore warned Admiral Corleque about the creature and assured Vader that the creature was the galaxy's greatest predator before him. Vader evaded the creature while keeping his course to Exegol, leading a lieutenant to ask Moore if they should still pursue Vader, but Moore asked him to calm down and confided Corleque that she would not require further assistance of them for that day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moore met with Sidious shortly afterwards on the Sith Citadel of Exegol.

When Amedda questioned how he was still alive, Moore responded that as a Sith, his hatred gave him power. Sidious also assured Moore and Amedda that Vader was beyond his reach and that they were both beneath his notice. The three of them then watched as Vader was rebuilt once again and Ochi was given a cybernetic visor so he could continue to see after having his eyes burned. When Vader asked his master his will, Sidious told him to decide that for himself. Vader then departed from Coruscant with Ochi in a Lambda-class shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after Vader and Ochi's departure, Moore secretly hired IG-88B to assassinate Vader alongside the Droid Crush Pirates of Bestoon. She also informed him of the Sith Lord's damaged state and gave him the code needed to slice into his armor. Vader and Ochi were lured into an ambush by a Hutt named Bokku, who sent them after the pirates in an attempt to locate Han Solo. However, both IG-88 and the pirates were swiftly defeated by Vader and Ochi. IG-88 then returned to Moore on Coruscant to report his loss to her and her court. The droid lamented that Vader could not be defeated, but Moore assured him that Vader could only defeat them one at a time. And if they all stood together, then they would be more powerful than either Vader or Sidious could ever imagine."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Attending the auction for Solo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After uncovering Sly Moore's betrayal, Vader and Ochi returned to Coruscant to find her, her court and IG-88 in Administrative Temple Garden 313A. As Vader struck down IG-88 once again, Moore and her court fled into the Imperial Palace. As they attempted to escape into the streets, Vader used the Force to close the door in front of them. However, Moore then took out another remote and used it to freeze Vader in his own armor, allowing her and her court to open fire on the Sith Lord. But this did not last as Vader overcame the Umbaran's control and struck down her entire court. Moore tried once more to take control of Vader, but Ochi revealed that Vader had fixed that vulnerability in his armor. Vader then knocked the remote out of Moore's hand and told her that she could not bend his will. Moore responded that she only wanted to see if Vader was still plagued by fear, to which Vader said that the only fear in that place was hers. Moore conceded that he could kill her effortlessly, but also pointed out that doing so would do nothing to save him from Luke Skywalker. When Vader asked the Umbaran what she knew of Skywalker, she revealed that the key to finding him, his friend Han Solo was currently being sold by Crimson Dawn. She also pointed out that if she secured Solo for Vader, then the Emperor would not learn of his plans. When Ochi asked Moore why Vader should trust her, the Umbaran answered that she would be delighted to reunite Vader with the only person who could kill him, to which Vader agreed and Ochi laughed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, Ochi and Moore left for Jekara along with a few Imperial officers to attend the Auction for Han Solo. Once Crimson Dawn's leader, Lady Qi'ra began the bidding within the Vermillion, Moore attempted to bid for the smuggler, but soon found herself in conflict with Jabba Desilijic Tiure, Bokku and the rest of the attending Grand Hutt Council. While the Umbaran was able to use a mind trick to weaken the minds of the other bidders, she found that the Hutts were too strong-willed for her to manipulate. After losing the bid, Moore took Ochi aside and asked why Bokku was bidding against her. Ochi explained to her that Vader had only sent her there to humiliate her in the Emperor's eyes. The auction was then interrupted by the arrival of Vader himself. Guarded by two death troopers, he declared the Solo belonged to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Umbaran female, Sly Moore had pale skin and white eyes, and her head was bald.
