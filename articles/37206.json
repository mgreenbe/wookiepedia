They were usually located on a individual's thumb or similar appendage. Databases of dermatoglyphic patterns were stored on criminals, slaves, politicians, bureaucrats, and Imperial-allied corporations. Wookiee dermatoglyphic patterns were taken from their noses, as many Wookiee slaves had scarred or missing fingers, making identification problematic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
