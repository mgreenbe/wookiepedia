Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, she paid a spacer to deliver a bribe from Zeed to the Tralus and Talus Liberation Party who had acquired evidence of Zeed's wrongdoings. When the Liberation Party let Snowline know that they still had the evidence and that the Prime Minister could expect to hear from them again, Snowline had the spacer attack the Liberation Party members. She described them as terrorists that had stolen valuable state secrets. The spacer retrieved the evidence, leaving no survivors.
