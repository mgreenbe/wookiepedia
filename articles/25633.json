Thalias was her caregiver, or \"Momish\" while she served on Mitth'raw'nuruodo's ship. She liked to draw on her Questis and later with colored graph markers.

At the skirmish above Hoxim, Che'ri used her powers of Third Sight to guide the hands of weapons officer Afpriuh to aim the Springhawk's weapons. Che'ri and Afpriuh aimed at the commandeered Watith freighter Saltbarrel at the exact angle needed to destroy the fake Agbui nyix mine and make it look accidental.
