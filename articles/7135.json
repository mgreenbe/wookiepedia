While fishing one day, the young Ewok Princess Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka soaked her feet in the water and lost her wooden ankle bracelet into a tide pool. Her mishap summoned King Elbo, a mighty aquatic monarch, who decided to help her. He offered her two golden, jewel-encrusted ankle bracelets, but Kneesaa declined, claiming that they were not hers. When Elbo recovered her real anklet, she accepted without inquiring about the other two, which touched Elbo. He gave her all three ankle bracelets in appreciation of her selflessness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
