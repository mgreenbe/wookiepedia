When Drelfin simply became angry and drew his hold-out blaster to shoot LaRone, the stormtrooper's combat skills again defeated Drelfin's own. The ISB major was shot and immediately died."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His body was hidden in a storage locker to cover up the crime, and his death precipitated LaRone and his squadmates becoming the Hand of Judgment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
