Lando is specifically chosen as he is similar to General Han Solo as they both have \"colorful backgrounds\" referring to their \"crooked\" past. \"Send a Thief to catch a Thief\" as Lando says. Firmus Nantz tells Lando that he can ask for anything in terms of equipment, men and ships. Lando then assembles Lando's Commandos, a team of thieves, pilots, bounty hunters, smugglers and Air Marshal Von Asch who trained the pilots of the pirate TIE/LN starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the briefing, Isolde Siro yells at the former Imperial Officer suggesting he should be on a prison barge and that he shouldn't be trusted as he is one of \"them.\" The briefing also reveals that there is a traitor in the New Republic. Giza and Tiatkin say they can track down and find the pirates and Kine reports as to what the systems are like, having flown there all his life. Von Asch assures them that due to that fact, that's where they are."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piloting the Millennium Falcon, Lando and his team (some of which follow in separate ships) head into what they've narrowed down as the base of the pirates. Getting off the ships, the team realizes that they've walked into a trap, and a firefight ensues with Tia being killed. Lando tells Kine to watch Von Asch, and Kine tells him to \"Watch yourself!\", shoots Lando after he turns on him, revealing himself as an Imperial spy and informant to the TIE pirates, and not Von Asch as many of the team suspected. Pointing a gun to Isolde's head, he orders the team puts down their weapons or he'll let go of Isolde, and he tells Giza to power down. The Imperial pirates, led by Harme Kiela, tell Von Asch the ruse was for his benefit, and tells him also that Kine supplied them with information regarding the New Republic convoys, to free him from his recruitment. Upon hearing Kiela's request to make him the new pirate leader, Asch struck the lieutenant across the face and angrily grabbed hold of the man's jowls as he began rebuking his actions, telling them they are a \"disgrace!\" Kiela then points a pistol at the Air Marshall telling him \"if you're not with us, you're against us.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suddenly Kiela and his accomplice are shot. Lando is not dead at all, surprising Kine long enough for Isolde to knock the wind out of him. Lando contacts Lobot and a Sullustan who arrives with reinforcements and ships, who fire at the Imperial pirates. Realizing he is out of options, Kine reveals his secret weapon: a stolen lightsaber, and attempts to kill Isolde, but Von Asch jumps into the blade, saving Isolde but sacrificing himself, allowing Isolde to kill Kine with her blaster, for holding her hostage. Lying in a pool of his own blood, he tells Siro that he saved her because she's strong, in ways others can't perceive, and has a destiny. Isolde calls for a medic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later on, Lando and Nantz talk about Von Asch, who lives to fight another day. Lando explains to the commander about how he worked out Kine was the villain of the picture, and the loss of Tiatkin and the men. The commander tells Lando that the Republic could still use his expertise. Lando being a typical gambler, flips for it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "See also"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
