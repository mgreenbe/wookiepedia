During the Battle of Borosk, she was instructed by Grand Admiral Pellaeon to assist a certain Lieutenant Arber subsequent to her Star Destroyer being fitted with a gravitic amplitude modulator (GAM), a device capable of jamming yammosk war-coordinating messages among Yuuzhan Vong forces. When ordered to engage, Essenton commanded the Defiant into the heart of the enemy formation, attacking the yammosk-bearing warship-analog and rendering debris. Almost immediately a second yammosk was located among the enemy fleet and Essenton led the Defiant in engaging it as well, though it would prove unnecessary as the Yuuzhan Vong forces withdrew soon after. Following the battle, Essenton was ordered to take Defiant to Yaga Minor in order to assist in the defense of that planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
