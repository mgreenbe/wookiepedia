He insisted on the note being given to the Hutt personally, and told the droid to come back with the crime lord's answer. DUM-4 then proceeded to reach Jabba's private box and held him out the sheet of paper. The actual content of the message is unknown, but Jabba actually read it with interest and answered immediately. When he received the note back, Sebulba also expressed his approval by nodding quietly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The context of the message hints that Jabba and Sebulba might have been in collusion. In Podracing Tales, the Hutt's droid R5-X2 estimated that Sebulba would win the race, so they may have organized the sabotage on other podracers together."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
