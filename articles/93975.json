It passed between two binary systems: one consisting of a yellow and an orange star, the other of a blue giant and a crimson dwarf. The intense gravity wells exerted by the four stars prevented any sort of hyperspace travel, hence the name \"Murgo Choke\". It was the site of a battle during the Swarm War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
