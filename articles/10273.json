The Daybreaker had been crippled during the devastation of the planet Uphrades by the Desolator superweapon, and Angral's forces attacked the starship to eliminate witnesses. However, a young Jedi Knight and crew arrived in-system aboard their Defender-class light corvette and came to the rescue of the Daybreaker, defeating the Imperial boarding party. The Daybreaker would later purposely maroon itself on the surface of Uphrades in order to aid the survivors of the catastrophe, while the Knight followed Darth Angral and the superweapon to Tython."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, during the Cold War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, the Sith Lord Darth Angral's son Tarnis was killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
