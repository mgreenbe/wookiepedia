Because it was a similar model type to the Resistance space station Colossus, the Titan was infiltrated by Team Colossus members Kazuda Xiono, Neeku Vozo, and CB-23 to steal a replacement trans-binary deflector when the one on the Colossus was on the verge of failure. Coincidentally, simultaneous to the infiltration, the Titan hosted an important meeting attended by General Armitage Hux and Commander Pyre. Pyre's attendance at the meeting led to TIE pilot cadets Tamara Ryvora and Jace Rucklin, former residents of the Colossus stationed on Pyre's Star Destroyer, being sent to the Titan on a supply run since they were familiar with supertanker fuel depots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
