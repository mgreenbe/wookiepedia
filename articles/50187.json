It served as a headquarters of the Imperial Inquisitor Program after they were moved off their previous headquarters on Coruscant due to the rogue Inquisitor chase. The existence of the fortress was hidden from the majority of the Empire to maintain the public perception of peace and security. In reality, it was where the Empire took the Jedi they captured and turned them to the dark side by brutal torture turning them into Inquisitors. However, the Imperials were unable to corrupt all of them. The fortress was known for its torture. In 14 BBY, during the Great Jedi Purge, a mission took place at the fortress and Trilla Suduri was redeemed and killed by Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Imperial Dojo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Dojo served as the training room of the Inquisitorius, allowing both Inquisitors and Purge Troopers to hone their skills. The training was fear-based, dark and abusive in nature, standing in contrast to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Detention level"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Where captured Jedi were kept for interrogation, torture, and experimentation.

The room was designed, under instruction from Palpatine himself, to psychologically and physically drain a prisoner's will, forcing them to acquiesce to the evil indoctrination of the Inquisitorius and the dark side."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Security systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The systems within the fortress were a complex network of bridges, wings, portals, and gates. The stronghold had a multi fail safe structure so that the Empire controlled every corner of the stronghold. This allowed for a quick response to any breach by a prisoner or intruder. The entire fortress could be flooded to prevent escape."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Laser gates"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The laser gates were a vital part of the fortress' security system and were designed for the strict confinement of prisoners on all levels of the stronghold.
