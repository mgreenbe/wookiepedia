Over ten thousand Force-detectors were created to help hunt down and kill Force-sensitives. Fortunately for the remaining Jedi of the galaxy, force-detectors were far from perfect. They could only be used to scan a single creature at a time, had a range of mere centimeters, and were not always accurate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
