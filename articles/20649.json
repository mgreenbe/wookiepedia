Together with Rogue Squadron pilot Wedge Antilles, Parry witnessed the destruction of Thanta Zilbra during the Starbuster Plot. The Naritus had been assigned to direct a fleet of shuttles and freighters to evacuate the system, just in case, but until the moment when the Thanta Zilbra star went nova, few had taken the threat seriously.
