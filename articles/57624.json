Group 2 was a diversionary force formed by the Royal Naboo Security Forces in 32 BBY to assist in the recapture of the planet Naboo's capital, Theed from the Trade Federation. During the battle, they became trapped in a plaza by two Armored Assault Tanks and two destroyer droids. Lieutenant Gavyn Sykess intervened to rescue the trapped Security Force officers, but not before one of Group 2's speeders was lost. Group 2 and Sykes then continued onto their objective, the Theed Courthouse, where Group 3 and a group of commandos blew open a gate blocking their way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Group 2 appears in the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo.
