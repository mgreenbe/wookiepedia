Sith Saber Gavar Khai and his wife, Lahka, lived there with their daughter, Vestara. They also housed at least one servant, the Keshiri Muura, who helped take care of Vestara. In 41 ABY, Vestara was chosen as a Sith apprentice and forced to leave the home and move into the Kesh Sith Temple, and Muura was dismissed from the household as her services were no longer needed. Two years later, Vestara was sent on a mission to kill Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, and soon afterward, Gavar was sent on a mission to kill Skywalker and capture the dark side entity Abeloth. While Gavar and Vestara were gone, Lahka kept the household in good condition, and she kept Vestara's room ready for the girl to return at any time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
