Early in his life, Car'das joined the crew of the smuggling ship Bargain Hunter, working mainly as a bootlegger for the Hutts. In 27 BBY, Car'das, Dubrak Qennto, and Maris Ferasi became the captives of Commander Thrawn of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force. Thrawn wished to learn the language of the Republic from the smugglers; they stayed in his base on Crustai for several weeks, teaching him Basic and learning the Chiss language, Cheunh. Car'das assisted Thrawn in defeating the alien Vagaari, before being allowed to return to the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Car'das eventually parted ways with his companions after being given an offer by Sith agent Kinman Doriana to start a smuggling organization that would double as an intelligence operation for Darth Sidious. Car'das's organization flourished, and he built up a huge repository of information. However, he was kidnapped by a Dark Jedi after the Clone Wars, and although he was rescued by Jedi Master Yoda, Car'das left the encounter a changed man. He became extremely ruthless during the time of the Empire, though his health began to deteriorate; Yoda healed him with the Force initially, though the second time Car'das visited Yoda's planet of residence, Dagobah, the Jedi Master refused to heal him, sending him to the Aing-Tii monks instead. Car'das ultimately spent over a dozen years studying with the Aing-Tii, learning of their views on the Force. He later settled down on the planet Exocron, though in 19 ABY he was approached by smuggler Talon Karrde, who was seeking an intact copy of the Caamas Document in the hopes of ending the crisis. Car'das did not possess a copy, but he was privy to top secret information about Moff Vilim Disra's plot to impersonate Thrawn, which Karrde used to help end the crisis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born and raised on Corellia during the waning days of the Galactic Republic, Jorj Car'das lived an unremarkable early life. He was well educated, though he rarely traveled and had a limited knowledge of other parts of the galaxy and their native species. By 27 BBY, just a few years after leaving school, Car'das was a navigator aboard the Bargain Hunter, a smuggling ship rented by Captain Dubrak Qennto. The Bargain Hunter had just three crew members\u2014Car'das, Qennto, and Maris Ferasi\u2014though they made a reasonably lucrative trade smuggling firegems and other illicit materials to Hutt gangsters in the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Meeting Thrawn"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 27 BBY, the Bargain Hunter was on a smuggling run transporting firegems hidden within stolen furs to Drixo the Hutt. Drixo's rival, Progga, had learned of the operation and launched an attack on the Bargain Hunter on the fringes of the Outer Rim. As navigator, Car'das was forced to make an emergency hyperspace jump, and the ship ended up deep in the Unknown Regions. Qennto was furious at the Corellian for jumping blind, but Ferasi defended Car'das, knowing that he had had no choice. However, they were followed by Progga, who believed that Qennto had a secret treasure hold. Just as the Hutt prepared to shoot them, an unknown group of alien ships\u2014three fighter-size craft and a larger cruiser\u2014arrived, deploying a group of Conner nets that disabled the two ships. The Bargain Hunter was left floating adrift in space for several minutes. When Progga's ship fired on the mysterious vessels, they attacked, destroying the Hutt's ship with ease and instilling some trepidation in Car'das and his companions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qennto and Ferasi departed the bridge to check the extent of the damage caused by the Conner nets, leaving Car'das alone on the bridge, ready to reply to any communications sent by the attackers. They made no attempt to communicate, however, and Qennto and Ferasi were able to restore the majority of the freighter's systems while the attackers searched Progga's vessel. Eventually, one of the smaller alien ships beckoned for the Bargain Hunter to follow them towards the largest ship, where they docked. Upon exiting their ship, they were escorted by a pair of blue-skinned Humanoids to a being named Mitth'raw'nuruodo, who told them to call him by his core name\u2014Thrawn. After finding a language in which both parties were proficient\u2014Sy Bisti, a local trade language\u2014Thrawn identified himself as the leader of a frontier picket force of the Chiss Ascendancy's Expansionary Fleet. He expressed a particular interest in Car'das, inquiring as to who they were and what their purpose was. Car'das answered mostly truthfully, omitting any mention of the firegems, though Thrawn was suspicious that they were scouts for an invasion attempt and requested to examine their cargo. Qennto, Ferasi, and Car'das were taken to their temporary living quarters while Thrawn's soldiers searched the Bargain Hunter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being held in their quarters for a time, the smugglers were questioned by Thrawn, who asked about the invasion force he believed would follow them. He asked that Car'das alone answer his questions, much to Qennto's annoyance, as he was the captain. Car'das felt that it would not be wise to lie to the Chiss commander, and so he answered him truthfully, telling him about the illegal firegems they were smuggling. In addition, he revealed that they were Corellian traders, although Thrawn did not know of Corellia. Car'das also managed to convince Thrawn that there was no invasion fleet and that the Republic was unaware of the Chiss. Qennto was extremely irritated by Car'das's honesty, not understanding why the smuggler had revealed so much. Car'das protested that Thrawn seemed to know the details already and that he had an aura of one who should not be lied to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn requested that the smugglers stay with him for a time, telling them that they would be provided with the means to compensate Drixo for their late delivery of the firegems. The Chiss commander wished to learn more about the Republic\u2014and the Jedi Order, as he had not heard of the Jedi before\u2014as well as the Republic language, Basic. Car'das was initially apprehensive, knowing that Qennto would never agree to it, though Thrawn offered to pay them handsomely for their tuition. Eventually, Car'das agreed, though only on the condition that Thrawn teach him Cheunh, the language of the Chiss, in return. Thrawn's ship, the Springhawk, took three days to reach his base on Crustai\u2014they began their language lessons en route. Ferasi took a liking to Thrawn, so she joined in the lessons, though Qennto wished to have no part in it.

They entered hyperspace, exiting several minutes later at the scene of a small skirmish between several starships. Thrawn informed them that the attackers were Vagaari, a merciless species of slavers whom he wished to wipe out. The Springhawk destroyed the smaller enemy ships with ease, though Thrawn decided to board the largest of the Vagaari vessels. Thrawn apologized to his guests for taking them into combat, telling them that he could not pass up the opportunity for a strike at the Vagaari, before leaving them on the bridge while he joined the boarding party. After the Vagaari had been neutralized, Thrawn invited Car'das, Ferasi, and Qennto to join him on the alien ship, showing them around. Walking through the ship filled with dead Vagaari made Car'das feel uneasy, though he eventually overcame this. Thrawn eventually showed them a room filled with treasure plundered by the Vagaari; he promised Qennto that the three smugglers would be allowed to keep some of it after he had examined the ship further."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Vagaari"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They eventually arrived at Thrawn's underground base on Crustai, where Thrawn had a visitor waiting for him\u2014Aristocra Chaf'orm'bintrano, who had matters to discuss with Thrawn. Thrawn permitted the Humans to attend the official welcoming ceremony, though Thrawn's visitors were displeased by the Humans' presence, dismissing them. Car'das and his companions were each escorted to comfortable living quarters, where they spent several hours waiting for Thrawn's visitors to leave. Eventually, Thrawn summoned Car'das to his quarters and apologized for the rudeness displayed by the visiting Chiss. Thrawn discussed with Car'das the concept of preemptive strikes, which were strictly forbidden in Chiss military doctrine. Thrawn saw the Vagaari as a great threat, though because they had never encroached on Chiss territory, his superiors would not allow him to attack them. Thrawn decided that learning the origins and value of the Vagaari's treasure might help sway the Chiss Ruling Families on the matter, and Car'das, Qennto, and Ferasi began examining the hoard. For several weeks, Qennto spent much of his time cataloging and appraising the treasure for Thrawn, while Car'das and Ferasi continued with their linguistics lessons. Thrawn kept Ferasi and Qennto under constant surveillance, though Car'das was allowed unhindered freedom of movement around the Crustai base at all times."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn had yet more visitors some time later: Admiral Ar'alani and his own brother, Mitth'ras'safis (or Thrass), who both wished to further examine the Vagaari ship. Thrawn had Car'das and Ferasi accompany him onto the vessel with his superiors. There, he showed the admiral around the ship, pointing out the technical aspects of it. However, trouble arose when the group entered the treasure room, where Qennto was looking over the plundered Vagaari wealth; Thrawn was forced to reveal the agreement he had made with the smugglers to his fellow Chiss, which he had not intended to do. Ar'alani was not happy when she learned of the agreement and insisted that she be allowed to take an inventory. Thrawn agreed and then told the admiral that he had \"administrative matters\" to attend to, taking Car'das and Ferasi with him as he left the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once away from Ar'alani, Thrawn revealed that there was another Vagaari fleet engaged in a battle not far away.

Thrawn boarded the Springhawk along with Ferasi and Car'das, and the ship jumped into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the battle site, Car'das was shocked to see hundreds of Vagaari vessels, a far cry from the handful he was expecting. He suggested to Thrawn that the ship retreat, although the commander explained that he had a plan for the battle. Ferasi, as usual, was confident in Thrawn's abilities. Thrawn pointed out to the duo that the helpless ships being attacked by the Vagaari were not jumping to hyperspace. The commander deduced that the Vagaari were using an interdiction field, a form of technology that neither the Chiss nor the Republic had managed to successfully create; it generated a gravitic mass of its own, barring all ships within its range from entering hyperspace. Realizing that such technology would allow him a huge advantage in battle\u2014against the Vagaari and others\u2014Thrawn had a team of Chiss covertly commandeer the ship, hoping that the Vagaari were too busy attacking the hapless world to notice. However, several of the Vagaari warships spotted the Springhawk on the edge of the system and moved closer to investigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Thrawn prepared to attack the approaching Vagaari forces, the group noticed that the alien ships were covered in \"bubbles\"\u2014cells that held prisoners to prevent attackers from firing on innocent victims. Thrawn remained calm and ordered the gunners to fire, telling the two that the Vagaari would eventually kill the prisoners anyway. Though Car'das accepted this explanation, Ferasi was shaken and angered by Thrawn's decision. During the battle, the Springhawk was hit by turbolaser fire, shaking the bridge and injuring Thrawn. The two smugglers were closest to the commander, and with quick thinking Ferasi was able to cover Thrawn's wound, enabling him to survive until Chiss medics reached him. Thrawn thanked the duo for their aid and told them that he hoped this incident would provoke the Chiss Ascendancy into attacking the Vagaari. His efforts to steal the interdiction field had been successful, and although Thrawn revealed this to Car'das, he kept it secret from the Chiss."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the ship returned to the asteroid base, they were met by an irate Qennto, who informed his fellow smugglers that Admiral Ar'alani had confiscated the treasure. Car'das and Ferasi attempted to calm him, but to little avail, until they decided to talk to Thrawn. Qennto was confined to quarters, so only Car'das and Ferasi went. They arrived at Thrawn's room at the same time as his brother, Thrass, who wanted to speak to Thrawn about the commander's unorthodox behavior. He considered some of Thrawn's methods contrary to Chiss belief, such as his boldness and his treatment of the smugglers\u2014as friends, not as prisoners. Thrass felt this would ultimately do him more harm than good."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two siblings eventually put their philosophical agreements aside, and despite staunch protests by Qennto, Car'das gave Thrawn and Thrass a tour of the Bargain Hunter, which utilized much technology unknown to the Chiss. Car'das's dialog was mostly in Cheunh, so he had to provide a translation to Qennto, who had accompanied them to ensure the Chiss didn't damage his beloved ship. Qennto overheard a mention of Thrawn's private chats with Ferasi and, suspecting that his lover had fallen for the alien, took his fellow smugglers aside to confront them about it. They were eventually able to dissuade Qennto, though the captain maintained that Thrawn should not be trusted. Eventually, Thrass and Ar'alani departed, though the smugglers were told that they would have to wait some time\u2014possibly months\u2014until the Chiss bureaucracy decided they were allowed to keep some of the profit."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Outbound Flight"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn woke Car'das in the middle of the night some time later to inform him of yet another encroachment by unknown enemies on his territory. The Chiss did not believe it was the Vagaari, for the ship design was entirely different, but suspected that it might be an attack from another force. Car'das accompanied Thrawn\u2014without Ferasi or Qennto\u2014along with a sizable force of a dozen CEDF vessels, including the Springhawk, to the system where the unknown ships had been first spotted.

He contacted the lead ship, a Lucrehulk-class battleship called the Darkvenge, and held a short discussion with a \"Commander Stratis,\" who insisted that his mission was confidential. However, when the Neimoidian commander Kav cut off communications and launched droid starfighters, Thrawn prepared for battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the Chiss forces was just three small cruisers and nine fighters, Thrawn won the battle without losing a man, a testament to his command abilities.

Though Kav threatened the two with a destroyer droid, Thrawn remained calm, staring down Kav until he ordered the droid to deactivate itself. Thrawn demanded he be told of the enemy fleet's intention, even claiming Car'das was a spy he had taken prisoner. Stratis agreed to tell Thrawn of his purpose and began explaining about the Outbound Flight Project, a mission to explore space beyond the galaxy. The ship contained thousands of passengers and several Jedi, and the Trade Federation task force had been sent to destroy it; he said that the Jedi would enslave the Chiss people and implied that Thrawn should himself destroy it. After hearing this, Thrawn announced that the ship would be confiscated and left, deep in thought."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn had Car'das study readouts and blueprints of the Trade Federation vessel so that he could get an impression of the ship's capabilities. Although the Human complied, he was troubled and annoyed by Thrawn's accusation. However, when Car'das and Thrawn next spoke, the Chiss informed him that he did not suspect him of being a spy and had merely accused him to gain more information from Stratis. Thrawn had another reason for the accusation: if the other Chiss thought that Thrawn believed the Humans to be spies, it would give him a plausible reason for keeping them in Chiss space. Thrawn told Car'das that his own brother, Thrass, had been providing Ar'alani with reports of Thrawn's activities on Crustai and that the admiral was growing more and more suspicious of him. Thrawn eventually left, though Car'das was still unsure of the Commander's true thoughts and motivations.

He knew that Stratis was not the man's real name and also suspected that he had another reason for the destruction of Outbound Flight besides the death of the Jedi. Stratis informed Thrawn of his real identity: Kinman Doriana, assistant to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and secretly an agent of Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith. Though even Doriana was unaware of it, Sidious was in fact Palpatine, and he was working to achieve complete control of the galaxy. Doriana also told Thrawn why he sought to destroy Outbound Flight\u2014a mysterious group of beings he called Far-Outsiders lurked near the edge of the galaxy. Doriana claimed they posed a great threat to the galaxy and that they could not be allowed to capture Outbound Flight. After telling him this, Doriana introduced Thrawn to his master, Sidious, through use of a holoprojector, in an attempt to stress the urgency to the Chiss commander. Sidious spoke to Thrawn, with both questioning each other.

Ar'alani discussed the possibility of trying Thrawn for his unprovoked attacks.

As such, he broached the question of when he\u2014and Qennto and Ferasi\u2014would be allowed to claim their treasure and leave. The two Chiss told Car'das it would depend on Thrawn and whether or not he would be tried. Car'das, knowing it would likely take months, relented on that issue.

After Thrawn accused him of being a traitor in front of Ar'alani, the admiral confined him to quarters. Around this time, Thrawn approached Car'das and asked him to steal a shuttle and incite the Vagaari into attacking; Thrawn had a plan that would take out both the Vagaari and Outbound Flight in one stroke. Feeling it was his and his friends' only option if they wished for Thrawn to allow them to return to the Republic, Car'das begrudgingly agreed. He stole a shuttle and piloted it to the site of a Vagaari battle, where he found the Vagaari fleet.

He was thus surprised when the guard led him to a throne room, where a large Vagaari sat on a throne. Car'das attempted to speak to the Miskara (their leader) in Minnisiat, but was punched by a guard, who ordered him not to speak unless told to. After a tense moment, the overlord began to question Car'das. Car'das informed him of the smugglers' situation with the Chiss, claiming they were prisoners. Car'das told the Miskara that he had the coordinates to the secret Chiss base and would give them to the Vagaari if they wished to strike back at the Chiss, allowing Car'das and his friends to flee on the Bargain Hunter.

He showed the overlord how to command the droids, programming them so they would only answer to the Vagaari ruler. To test the droids, the Vagaari brought in several of their Geroon slaves, whom the droids swiftly executed.

As the Jedi and civilians aboard the Outbound Flight were not fluent in the trade language Car'das used to communicate with his captors, the Human was forced to act as a translator between the Vagaari and Outbound Flight, relaying the aliens' message for Outbound Flight to either surrender or be destroyed. The Jedi did not respond, and eventually the Miskara decided the time for discussion was over: the Vagaari would plunder their droids immediately.

He also told Car'das that he wouldn't help him any further, since he had to conserve his time and energy for training Luke Skywalker, who he expected to arrive on Dagobah very shortly. Car'das realized his actions had been abominable, and he was consumed with shame."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He knew he couldn't return to his group, so he fled. Yoda had indicated he might receive help from the Aing-Tii monks, an alien species who had mastered the Force in ways unknown to either the Jedi or the Sith. Before heading for the Aing-Tii's known territory, in the Kathol sector, Car'das received a call for assistance from his old acquaintance, Thrawn, now a Senior Captain with the Imperial Navy. Thrawn needed to temporarily leave behind the majority of his forces in the Unknown Regions and travel quickly to Poln Major in Candoras sector, knowing that Nuso Esva, his longtime adversary, was planning an attack there. Though he agreed, feeling it was perhaps his last chance to do something worthwhile, Car'das nevertheless was both confused and somewhat resentful of Thrawn's choice. After all, he complained to Thrawn, why call on him when Thrawn could pilot a starship equally well himself, and could call on any number of persons within the Empire for aid? Thrawn's answer surprised him: that of all the beings in the galaxy, Car'das was the only one left whom Thrawn believed he could trust."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Thrawn successfully chased Esva out of Candoras sector, he had to immediately rejoin his forces in the Unknown Regions to continue the pursuit. As a last favor, he asked that Car'das put off his journey to Kathol sector just long enough to visit Wroona, where Thrawn believed Esva's forces were holding hostages, including the family of Esva's doomed pilot, Sorro. Thrawn pointed out that Car'das, was the only one of his associates with both the equipment and the underworld contacts necessary to free them. Car'das, recognizing the call to a worthy endeavor, agreed to go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After completing his service for Thrawn, Car'das made his way to the planet Exocron in the farthest reaches of the Kathol sector in Wild Space. The Aing-Tii were able to heal Car'das with ease, though they wished for him to stay with them to learn about their philosophies of the Force. Car'das agreed, and although he was given permission to return to the wider galaxy after a time, he decided to stay with the Aing-Tii for almost a dozen years. Although he was not Force-sensitive, Car'das was able to manipulate the Force after his time with the Aing-Tii; he could make an object instantly transport itself from one location to another. He learned much about the aliens, keeping notes and journals. In return for healing and teaching him, the Aing-Tii used him to help them collect artifacts scattered throughout the sector they believed belonged to their gods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Car'das left the Aing-Tii and took up permanent residence on planet Exocron, where he built a secret home in the side of a mountain. Here, he gathered all his information sources and created a personal library with secrets even the New Republic knew nothing of. Car'das's errands were taken care of by his loyal assistant, Entoo Needaan E-elz, while all housework and maintenance was performed by droids. He also remained in contact with the Aing-Tii, who were happy to come to his aid whenever Exocron fell under attack by slavers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Car'das's organization continued to thrive for several months, but the lieutenants began to discuss the need for a true leader. Rather than put it to a vote, Talon Karrde\u2014one of Car'das's most trusted subordinates\u2014simply took control of the organization. The other leaders weren't happy, but the new operation flourished for the next twenty years. Karrde, however, was ever fearful of Car'das and was constantly prepared for his return. Karrde believed that Car'das would seek vengeance for Karrde's taking over of the organization and thwarted several attempts at his life by other members of the group, who claimed they had been sent by Car'das."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, after the death of Grand Admiral Thrawn, Karrde sent Lando Calrissian and Mara Jade to search for Car'das, a search that took seven years and ended up successfully pinpointing Car'das' location on Exocron. The lone clue was a beckon call Luke Skywalker had recovered on Dagobah. With Car'das within arm's reach, however, Karrde decided to give up the chase, unsure of what Car'das's reaction would be.

Tensions where high, with many groups demanding the Bothans be punished. However, despite Lando's hopes, Karrde refused to bring Car'das into it. As the crisis unfolded, Karrde finally realized that he had to confront Car'das; if not to confront his own fears, then to recover a copy of the Caamas Document. Car'das played an elaborate ruse on him, first appearing as a withered old man bed-ridden on the planet Exocron.

Car'das used Karrde's desire to locate him as a way to draw the crimelord Rei'Kas to Exocron and near the Kathol Rift. Car'das and Admiral Trey David of Exocron's Navy knew Exocron couldn't stand against Rei'Kas's fleet, but they also knew that the Aing-Tii monks wanted to eliminate Rei'Kas. By allowing Karrde to get to Exocron, Car'das and David also gave Exocron's location to Rei'Kas. However, Rei'Kas' fleet was destroyed by the Aing-Tii monks when it tried to attack Exocron. This maneuvering was nearly transparent to Karrde, who realized that Car'das was more than a frail old man. He returned to Exocron and confronted Car'das again, who was no longer an aged man but a healthy man nowhere near death.

Instead, she encountered Car'das, who informed her that her world had been destroyed by a mercenary force, hired by the other peoples of the sector, who had been victimized by Emberlene's war of conquest - about which Shada and the rest of the Mistryl had deliberately never been told. Car'das offered her a choice between two data cards: one that would identify the destroyers of her world, or another that could end the Caamas Document Crisis and prevent civil war within the entire New Republic. She chose the latter, conscious that by doing so she was giving up her last chance to be reinstated within the Mistryl, from which she had been expelled.

Karrde and D'ukal brought this information back to Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, after saying their goodbyes to Car'das.

Car'das then made sure Jinzler arrived, going so far as to trail Jinzler and help repair his ship in the Flacharia system. Jinzler told Luke Skywalker that Car'das was only trying to fulfill a promise he'd made years ago, the promise to Lorana Jinzler that he find her brother.
