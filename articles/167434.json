Designed to function in environments too hazardous for organic stormtroopers, the Z-X3 was the brainchild of Imperial officer Rom Mohc, who was inspired by his experiences facing Confederate battle droids during the Clone Wars.

The Z-X3 lacked built-in weaponry, instead commonly carrying a blaster rifle or mounting a Briletto AAP-IV blaster box on its chest. The droid also boasted enhanced physical strength, and a high level of intelligence separated from any central computer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Created and manufactured by the Tagge Company during the era of the Galactic Civil War, the Z-X3 droid trooper was based off an idea from Imperial officer Rom Mohc, who had served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars and came to admire the Separatist droid armies. As such, Mohc became fixated on the idea of droid stormtroopers that could provide support to the Empire's organic troops on the ground. Mohc launched the \"Droid Trooper Project\" in order to bring his idea to fruition, and by the years following the Battle of Yavin, he found a willing partner in the Tagge Company\u2014 its Baron, Orman Tagge, had remained interested in the concept after the failure of his L8-L9 droid model during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TaggeCo initially produced a crop of less than 100 Z-X3 units, enough for the Empire to test them in a controlled setting. However, by that time, the defeat of the Separatist battle droids was still too fresh in the minds of the Imperial brass, and the project was scrapped. Although Mohc would eventually refine his idea into what became the Dark Trooper Project, the few Z-X3 droids were rejected and slated for recycling. A few found service with the Empire regardless at remote garrisons, but many more made their way into private hands. One such droid, later simply called Zee-Exthree, found its way to the \"Droid World\" of Kligson's Moon, where it became the chief lieutenant of the cyborg technician Kligson while maintaining secret Imperial sympathies. In 3 ABY Zee-Exthree incited a rebellion to seize the Droid World in the Empire's name, but was defeated and destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Z-X3 experimental droid trooper first appeared in Star Wars 47, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1981.
