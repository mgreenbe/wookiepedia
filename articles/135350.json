Built in honor of Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order and a respected former leader of Mandalore, the large statue depicted Vizsla cloaked and armored, holding the black-bladed Darksaber he'd possessed in life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The young Mandalorian woman Sabine Wren accompanied her father, Alrich, to see the statue when she was a child, an outing which she remembered fondly for years after. By the time of the civil war between Clan Wren and the Imperial-backed Clan Saxon, the Galactic Empire had constructed a militarized outpost on the statue, defacing it. During a covert mission on Mandalore, Sabine and her brother Tristan Wren discovered and destroyed the outpost, restoring the statue to its original appearance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The statue of Tarre Vizsla was first introduced to Star Wars canon in the Forces of Destiny animated series, debuting in the eleventh episode of the second season, entitled \"Art History.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
