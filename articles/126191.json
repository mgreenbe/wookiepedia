Hassin sacrificed himself by crashing the Jedi's Infiltrator starfighter into Harbinger's bridge, causing the dreadnaught to crash into Omen right as the two ships jumped into hyperspace. This caused the Omen to crash-land on the remote world of Kesh, where its survivors formed the Lost Tribe of Sith, while the Harbinger entered an unstable hyperspace tunnel and traveled through time to 41.5 ABY. The latter was shortly after destroyed by Druur."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime between 3959 BBY and 3956 BBY, a Galactic Republic-allied Zabrak mercenary raided one of these capital ships.
