After the Jedi High Council gave Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker a mission to protect Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala on Naboo, Skywalker had a dream of his mother suffering and both Skywalker and Amidala left Naboo to go to Tatooine to find his mother, Shmi Skywalker Lars. Skywalker received information of Shmi's whereabouts from his old slaver, Watto, and soon Skywalker met the Lars family, who bought Shmi from Watto, and discovered she had been kidnapped by a Tusken Raider raiding party and was believed dead. After much investigation, Skywalker tracked his mother, who was extremely weak after a month of torture, who then died in his arms. Consumed by rage, the young Jedi touched the dark side of the Force and massacred nearly the entire village, killing every male, female and child he could find, and paid no attention to the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn, who spoke to Skywalker in an attempt to prevent the carnage, while Yoda felt Anakin's grief grow darker as the Jedi Master meditated in the Jedi Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker returned to the Lars Homestead with his mother's body in his arms.

Skywalker, who had not seen Amidala since the Invasion of Naboo, was intoxicated by her presence and endured a sense of attachment. While Kenobi assured his apprentice that a Jedi must not become attached, Skywalker was having problems with his attachment to his mother; who he had not seen for ten years.

As his attachment for Amidala grew on Naboo, dreams of his mother worsened and soon one night, he had a nightmare of her suffering.

Due to Skywalker's ten year absence, Watto did not recognize who the outlander was. The Jedi Padawan refreshed his former owner's memory by asking where his mother, Shmi, was. Surprised, Watto was thrilled to see his old slave. Skywalker demanded to know the whereabouts of his mother, to which Watto informed him that he had sold her after Skywalker left Tatooine in 32 BBY.
