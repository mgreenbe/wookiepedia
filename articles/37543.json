Before the Jedi temple fell, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker sensed darkness building within his nephew, Ben Solo. Snoke had been seducing Solo from afar since the boy's childhood to turn him to the dark side. One night, Skywalker entered Solo's room and looked into Solo's mind as he slept. Seeing and fearing the darkness there, Skywalker instinctively ignited his lightsaber before quickly realizing his error, but it was too late: Solo awakened and believed his uncle was about to murder him. Solo lashed out with the Force to telekinetically collapse his hut, which trapped Skywalker under the debris. Standing outside the temple full of fear and anger, Solo gave in to the dark side's power and created a lightning storm that razed the structure, killing all of the students who were present."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo fled and was pursued by the surviving Padawans, who died attempting to bring him to justice. He completed his turn to the dark side and became Kylo Ren, joining the First Order under the tutelage of Supreme Leader Snoke. Skywalker, distraught over his failure, abandoned his hope of rebuilding the Jedi Order and went into exile on Ahch-To, the birthplace of the Jedi Order. It was not until 34 ABY that he was rediscovered by Rey, a powerful Force prodigy who tried to convince Skywalker to help the Resistance in the war against the First Order. Skywalker was reluctant but chose to briefly rejoin the conflict and confront his nephew, sacrificing himself in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Restoring the Jedi Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the end of the Galactic Civil War, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker was the last Jedi left in the galaxy. His Jedi Master, Yoda, had died after securing his promise to pass on what he had learned. With help from the likes of Lieutenant Shara Bey of the Rebel Alliance and the explorer Lor San Tekka, Skywalker sought out ancient relics and texts of the Jedi Order to better understand their history and teachings. Skywalker had great hope for the future of the Jedi, believing that if a single Jedi could help bring back balance to the Force, then a restored Jedi Order could maintain that peace and prevent the dark side of the Force from regaining its hold on the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the war came to a close, Senator Leia Organa of the New Republic and General Han Solo welcomed a son, Ben Solo. Organa sensed the capacity for both light and darkness within her son. After many years, she also sensed the influence of Snoke, the Supreme Leader of the shadowy First Order that had arisen from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. Hoping to curb Snoke's dark side influence, Organa asked Skywalker, her brother, to train Solo as a Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With his nephew and a handful of other disciples, Skywalker established a Jedi temple to train his students in the ways of the Jedi. Throughout Solo's training, Skywalker sensed the growing darkness within his nephew, but he believed that he could contain it and keep Solo on the path of the light. Unbeknownst to Skywalker, mysterious voices were grooming Solo towards the dark side. He hated the pressure of living up to his namesake, Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi, along with his family's legacy. As his own power grew, Solo believed that Skywalker sensed and feared it, and the boy grew into a man who resented his uncle despite respecting the Jedi Master's power."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A terrible misunderstanding"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One night, Skywalker went to Solo's hut to confront his nephew's growing darkness. Skywalker found Solo asleep and used the Force to look into Solo's mind; he saw even greater darkness than he had feared, and that Snoke's machinations had already turned his nephew's heart. Skywalker saw that Solo would wield a crackling red lightsaber as he brought death and destruction to everything Skywalker loved. Skywalker instinctively ignited his lightsaber to prevent what he had seen by killing Solo, but the moment passed quickly into shame for thinking of killing his nephew. Solo awakened to his uncle standing over him with an ignited blade. He knew what Skywalker had seen in his mind and thought Skywalker had come into his room to murder him in his sleep. Solo ignited his own lightsaber and attempted to kill Skywalker first.

With Skywalker trapped under the rubble and believed dead, Solo left the ruins of his room and raged in confusion over why his uncle had seemingly attacked him. He pointed his ignited lightsaber towards the clear night sky over the temple and screamed for answers. Led by his fear and anger as he lashed out against Skywalker, he surrendered to the power of the dark side and created a storm. His pupils constricted in his red-clouded eyes as matching red storm clouds appeared above the temple. Becoming aware of the clouds, he questioned their appearance just before they erupted with lightning. The storm he had created set fire to the dwellings and razed the temple, killing most of his fellow students."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The temple's initial explosion knocked Solo off his feet and he rose to see the scattered bodies of dead students.

Solo told them that Master Skywalker had tried to murder him in his sleep and now was dead. When Voe expressed skepticism, Solo replied that he was stronger in the Force than the other three Jedi combined and stronger than Skywalker. Tai was unable to defuse the situation, and Hennix and Voe drew their lightsabers to stop Solo from leaving. The three Jedi failed to take down Solo and he used the Force to shower them with debris which wounded Hennix. While Tai and Voe attended to Hennix, Solo fled aboard his personal starship Grimtaash. The other Jedi pursued Solo in their starship Verity but Solo fired a precise shot that disabled their ship's main engines. The three decided to pursue Solo for answers to the destruction.

With some of his students missing from the ruins, Skywalker mistakenly believed that Solo had slaughtered those who would not turn to the dark side as Solo had, and that the missing students had agreed to join Solo.

He fled to a space station to meet Snoke, who embraced him. Snoke doubted Skywalker was dead and asked Solo what he planned to do next now that he was no longer under Skywalker's influence. Solo decided to seek out the Knights of Ren, a shadowy group of dark siders led by the enigmatic \"Ren\" who subscribed to an ideology based on his lightsaber, the Ren. Tai, Voe, and Hennix tracked Solo to Elphrona where he had first met and been invited to learn from the Knights as a child. In their duel, Solo attempted to kill Voe and inadvertently killed Hennix.

Solo still failed to impress on the Minemoon of Mimban, but when Ren killed Tai, Solo gave in to the dark side of the Force. His turn was sensed by Snoke, Leia, Rey, and Darth Sidious as he dueled and killed Ren, then used the Ren lightsaber to kill Voe. The Knights then accepted Solo as the new Master of the Knights of Ren. With Voe's murder and Solo's turn, the destruction of Skywalker's Jedi Order was complete.

The First Order and the Resistance, led by General Organa, both searched for Skywalker and sought out San Tekka, who had part of a map to Ahch-To. The map was pieced together by the Resistance and given to Rey, a powerful Force prodigy, who used it to find Skywalker on Ahch-To. She tried for some time to convince Skywalker that the return of the Jedi was critical if the Resistance was to prevail in its war against the First Order, but he was too guilt-stricken. It was not until the spectral intervention of Yoda that Skywalker was shaken from his guilt and put his faith in Rey as the future of the Jedi. During the Battle of Crait, he projected his appearance into the conflict to confront Kylo, allowing the Resistance to escape from certain destruction. The effort he expended proved fatal and Skywalker passed away into the Force on Ahch-To, but, through his actions, the legend of Skywalker and the hope of the Jedi and the Resistance spread across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origin and development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The destruction of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple was first referenced in the 2015 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.

Released on December 18, 2019, The Rise of Kylo Ren 1 depicted a lightning strike from red storm clouds sparking the fire. The 2021 book Skywalker: A Family at War by Kristin Baver, a biography of the Skywalker family, does not describe the actual moment of destruction, instead presenting the prelude and the aftermath without directly identifying Solo as the cause. The book introduces an alternative narrative in-universe that meteorological reports afterward gave support to an interpretation of events attributing the fire to a \"freak dry-lightning storm.\" Other materials published after The Rise of Kylo Ren 1 state that Solo destroyed the temple and the Order, with the Star Wars Encyclopedia booklet \"Kylo Ren and Other Dark Side Followers\" specifying that he created the thunderstorm that set fire to the temple and caused most of the students' deaths."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Contradictions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, sources did not mention that any of Skywalker's students survived the destruction.
