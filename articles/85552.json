He was an avid collector of marble sculptures and paintings that depicted his likeness, commissioning many fine artisans to make them and thus entangling himself in heavy debt. Despite his monetary problems, Luunim handled several financial accounts for the Rebel Alliance. In 0 ABY, shortly after the destruction of the Galactic Empire's first Death Star, Alliance General Jan Dodonna ordered Luunim to meet with fellow Rebels Princess Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker at his apartment in Pilaan to hand over a datacard the Muun was keeping safe. The datacard contained several account access codes that the Alliance badly needed, as the majority of its funds were lost when Alderaan, Organa's homeworld, was destroyed by the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, before Luunim could meet with the Rebels, he died in an airspeeder accident due to a failure in its central turbine while midair.

Further questioning of the bartender revealed Luunim's debt to Kenuun. The Rebels deduced from the bartender's information that Kenuun had Luunim's apartment raided of anything valuable, including the datacard for which they were looking.
