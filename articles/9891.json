Many treasure hunters subsequently ventured to Tatooine to search for the wreck, but most disappeared during their quests to find for the downed ship. During the Galactic Civil War, the Eirrauc traders Daushoroc and Tamoss set out in search of the vessel, hoping to be able to sell the ship's cargo and use the proceeds to buy the freedom of several members of their species from slavery. While looking for the ship, the pair encountered a band of native Tusken Raiders, and they provided the Raiders with water and a Tusken battle talisman in return for directions to the Athallian Messenger's location."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
