It was led by the Gotal Ujin Voli, who named the group after the planet his homeworld circled. The Antar Band was mostly a collection of smugglers, thieves, and scavengers, but it posed the biggest threat to Black Sun's dominance of criminal enterprise along the Sisar Run and was hated by Black Sun Vigo Sprax.
