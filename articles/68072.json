When she was five years old, her family decided to leave the planet abruptly. While on Batuu, Garsea was best friends with a boy named Julen Rakab. Around 34 ABY, she returned to Batuu to deliver Pall Gopal's package to the Ithorian proprietor Dok-Ondar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Izzy was born to Ixel Garsea and her father. Both worked dangerous jobs as smugglers and bounty hunters. The family moved around frequently and rarely stayed on one planet too long. Eventually the family would move to Batuu where they would live for six months. The longest they had ever stayed. There she met a boy named Jules. They were best friends and she was saddened when her family had to leave. The family had to leave because of Oga Garra."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The family at one point stayed on Corellia for two weeks. Izzy signed up at an academy on Eroudac. During her time, one of her professors wanted to her to smuggle in some haneli flower, but the job failed and Izzy quit the academy. At some point she met Damar Olin and they joined Ana Tolla's crew. Tolla was known for getting the job done no matter what. Even though Izzy had been in the crew as long as Damar, she felt that they didn't care about her and she didn't fit in with them."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First Order\u2013Resistance war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 34 ABY, after a mission, the crew was on a polluted city on Actlyon in a cantina. Damar was supposed to have fireworks for her birthday, but forgot as he usually did. Shortly after, a firefight ensued in the cantina with the crew ditching her. During the fight, she shot a man. After the firefight and her leaving the crew, she met with a Rodian named Pall Gopal. He knew her parents and wanted her to deliver a package to Dok-Ondar on Batuu. She was excited to return to her childhood home."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Delivering the parcel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When she arrived on Batuu with her ship, the Meridian, she travelled to Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities. When she knocked on the door, she accidentally hit Jules in the nose. Both of them traveled to Cookie's restaurant. While there Izzy spotted her old crew and ran off. This upset Jules and when she came back she told Jules about how Damar had abandoned her and asked him if he wanted to go off world with him. Jules declined."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He offered her a ride back to Jules and he continued on to Ohnaka Transport Solutions. While at Dok's she realized with horror that she had switched their packages. She found Neelo and Fawn, whom she had met earlier at Cookie's, and asked if she could have a ride. They were both on their way to practice there anyways so they accepted. Izzy met Jules at the docks and explained the situation. Jules tried to ask Lee Skillen if he could go in the office and get it, but she said no. Fortunately, Jules had snatched her access card and Izzy went into the office. She found the parcel, but before she could leave. Delta entered the office. Izzy hid under some pelts and stunned Delta when she grabbed the package."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jules and Izzy tried to go back to Dok's, but a protest against the First Order blocked their path and they had to go down Smuggler's Alley. There they were confronted by a man saying that Oga Garra wanted to speak to them. Oga talked through Jules in Huttese to Izzy. Oga said how she knew her mother and that she was one of her best bounty hunters. Oga said how Izzy knew nothing about her mother which infuriated Jules. Oga then dismmised Jules from her office and talked privately with Iza about her mother's death. Oga told her that someone had put a bounty on her mother's head and she knew who. She would tell Izzy if she complete a \"tryout\" job for her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally on their way back to Dok's the two walked through the marketplace and Jules bought them some nuna jerky. Jules stopped at the Creature Stall to meet his friend Volt Vescuso. While in the shop a Loralora bird bonded with her. When she was leaving, Izzy was spotted and grabbed by Delta. Jules caused a distraction by letting out the animals in the shop, angering Volt, but allowing them to run. They ran around the corner and Tap let them in."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Dok still missing, the trio decided to search his personal quarters and found him locked in the safe. Dok told how a First Order sympathizer thought he was contributing to the corruption of Batuu and tried to shoot him, but lost his nerve and shoved him in the safe. Dok sent them out to a rocky area in the middle of nowhere. Once Izzy stepped outside she met with Damar. Jules denied Damar's greeting and gave him his birth name instead of his nickname. Damar invited both of them to join the crew. Both of them flatly denied him, and when he said that Jules should take her somewhere special for her birthday, she shot the ground near his feet and Damar ran."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jules and Izzy returned to the cantina where his speeder was parked. They sped out to the countryside and stopped at the abandoned settlement where both of them used to live. Izzy went into the house where she used to live and reflects on her past. Izzy told him how she dropped out of the academy when her professor hired her to smuggle in some haneli flower. She dropped the cargo and ran off. While talking about Ana Tolla a Loralora bird that had formed a strong bond with her came and sat in her lap. Before she could protest the stowaway, Jules named it Lucky."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They then drove to Kat Saka's farm. Jules introduced Garsea to Shari, Ksana, and Belen. Izzy told them stories about her adventures and awed the farm kids. After her story she talked to Jac Lodain about rumors of the Resistance on Batuu. While the two were discussing the war, Jules entertained the kids. Izzy then told Jules that Oga had offered her an audtion and she took it. Izzy then kissed him. She told him about her conversation with Belen and how she promised that is she left, she would never return."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally they arrived at the drop off location with rock formations. They met an older woman and a Mon Calamari named Lejo. Jules realized they were Resistance operatives. Izzy asked what was in the package and the older woman asked if they wanted to do some good, they could always sign up and they left. Both of them walked to the cenotes and swam in it until Damar arrived and put Izzy's blaster to his head. He handed her over to Delta and Damar got Jules."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Skirmish at Kat Saka's farm"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Delta took Izzy back to Black Spire outpost. On the way there, Delta realized the risk she was taking against Oga and formed an alliance with her. Izzy then went to Volt's and told him about the situation. Tap also came and they all stole Julen's ship. They flew to the farm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once they arrived, Jules was so happy to see his friends come. Izzy had Lucky knock Oksan off a water tower. They soon surrounded Ana Tolla who held the sodilium detonator control in her hands. Oskan betrayed his captain by grabbing her arm and forcing her to drop it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Celebrations began as Oga's thugs dragged off Ana Tolla's crew. Izzy went back to her ship. There she found that lucky had eaten half a dozen Batuuan Rats. She cleaned it all up and after found a hologram at the cockpit. It was of her mother, telling her she always loved her and she was sorry for not being the best mother. She then headed to Oga's Cantina where she met Jules. Both of them were very popular around and had lots of drinks on the house."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, both of them were flying above Batuu and debated joining Hondo's company as pilots.
