Built after the Galactic Alliance had retaken the planet from the Yuuzhan Vong, it was built as part of an effort to speed up the symbolic transfer of the galactic capital from Denon. It contained a deep underground facility, which was designed in case of orbital bombardment. The building was filled with multiple planning and analysis rooms, many of which Luke Skywalker had never heard of, let alone been in, despite the fact that his advice was often sought on military matters in the time between the Yuuzhan Vong War and the Swarm War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of the Defense Force nicknamed the underground portion of the compound \"the Dark Star\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
