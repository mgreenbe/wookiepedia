While they were talking they were interrupted by Darth Vader who ignited his lightsaber. Vader attempted to kill the duo after he discovered an attachment between them, stating that they should have learned their lesson about attachments from the death of Eeth Koth. But Vader's strike was intercepted by the Twi'lek Inquisitor's lightsaber. The Inquisitor told his other Inquisitor to run while he held off Vader. Darth Vader offered to let him stay but he refused and ran off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The chase"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two rogue Inquisitors ran out of the headquarters and the Twi'lek confessed his love for his fellow Inquisitor.

As they were patrolling, their speeder was hit by the lightsabers of the Inquisitors causing the speeder to explode. Vader jumped off the speeder and onto another one but that one was also destroyed. Down below in a park a Gran senator was having a drink when the speeder came down and killed her. Back on the speeder, the two rogue Inquisitors used the Force to throw another speeder in Vader's direction but Vader stopped it and threw it back at them. Vader started to leap from speeder to speeder as the Inquisitors continued to throw more objects in his direction. A statue fell over and hit Vader, causing him to fall on the balcony of a nearby building."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inquisitors jumped down and were very surprised to see that they had beaten Darth Vader. They both ignited their lightsabers but before they could strike Vader down, he stopped their blades with the Force. Vader started to redirect the lightsabers back at the Inquisitors.
