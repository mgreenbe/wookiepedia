The Raiders had been observed sniping at passing podracers in the desert. At long range, the cycler rifles proved powerful enough to destroy the podracer of Teemto Pagalies, causing it to crash during the Boonta Eve Classic. Among Tusken clans, the cycler rifle was the less popular weapon, because despite the fact that the rifle could hit targets reliably at long ranges, it had a crude design and the fire rate was typically slow.The Cycler rifle was used by Boba Fett during his time hunting for his armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
