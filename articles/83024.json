The longbow needed to be reloaded after each shot and had a slow rate of fire, although the hitting power and accuracy of this weapon was not to be underestimated. Because of its size, longbows could be cumbersome to carry even close quarters or over great distances, especially when meter-long arrows and quiver were carried as well.
