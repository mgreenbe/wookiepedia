In an effort to modernize their society, the Brigians formed the New Regime by hiring an off-planet developmental consulting firm to aid them in forming a new system of government. One of the first objectives the firm accomplished, was to replace bartering and local coinages with a planetary-wide monetary system, which gave the Regime a secure grasp on planetary and interplanetary trade. The purchase of an outmoded Marauder class pocket-ship was also executed primarily for appearance, but under the pretense of planetary defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inner Council was established as the ruling contingent of the New Regime.
