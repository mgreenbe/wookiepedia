Its leaves secreted an irritant oil that could cause intensely itching skin rash. Despite the warning of his mother, the young Ewok Wicket Warrick from Bright Tree Village once shoved aside a clump of poison ivy bushes to retrieve the fragments of his broken fishing rod. The Ewok medicine men such as Logray knew of a powder that could treat the rash induced by the poison ivy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
