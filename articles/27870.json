They were used to code the equipment specifically to the clones' genetic sequence in order to prevent looting and sabotage. However, the notion was later discontinued as a result of unnecessary costs, despite the savings from having a single genetic sequence shared throughout an army of identical troopers, but prototypes of the firing key were created."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In various cases, firing keys were commissioned for clone units that operated deep behind enemy lines, and weapons that were installed with the firing key read the genetic sequence of the combatant who held it and would not fire unless the sequence matched that of the authorized wielder. The cost of the firing key was 250 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clone firing keys were mentioned in Rise of the Separatists, a roleplaying supplementary sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying series that was published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
