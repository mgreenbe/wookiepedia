When one of the base\u02b9s supply ships was set to leave for the nearest supply depot, Wek noticed that one of the ship\u02b9s engines was damaged. Gardit, however, dismissed her concerns and allowed the ship to leave.

He appears as part of the Republic Taris mission \"Supplies and Demands\" and the accompanying bonus mission \"Prove Gardit's Corruption\". Both missions, as they appear on the Republic version of the planet, are restricted to Republic players, but players do have alignment options. Players can gather the evidence for Wek and complete \"Prove Gardit\u02b9s Corruption\", and they can choose whether or not to give the recording to Wek. Giving her the recording and supporting her against Gardit results in light-side points, while siding with Gardit results in dark side points."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
