The Quesoth underwent a cycle whereby the Queen of the Black would reign from the White City on the planet Quethold for a number of years until her death. She would then be replaced by the Queen of the Red and on the Queen of the Red's death, the Queen of the White would emerge. The Queen of the White would then, in turn, be replaced by the Queen of the Black, and the process would repeat itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
