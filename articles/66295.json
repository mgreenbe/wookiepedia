Burning incense was often contained in censers, portable devices that allowed the smoke to escape into the ambient environment. Qatameric incense was a type of incense used by the Brotherhood of the Beatific Countenance to mask their natural Lorrdian scent. Sticks of incense were lit on Naboo at a yearly memorial for those who had fallen in defense of Naboo during the Trade Federation's invasion.
