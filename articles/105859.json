Planetary rings could be formed from the remnants of satellites, such as the silica ring of the planet Lah'mu, which were created after one of its moons was pulverized. The rings revolving around Geonosis and Bothawui were rocky in nature, while the planet Minfar had a ring made of ice. Planets could have multiple sets of rings, exemplified by a gas giant in the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although ring systems could constitute navigational hazards, some were mined for metal ore. The rings of the gas giant Hudalla were some of the largest in the galaxy. The ring of the planet Tiferep Major was disrupted when the wreckage-prison Accresker Jail fell through it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
