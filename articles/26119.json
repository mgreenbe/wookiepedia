Although Alderaan was destroyed by the Galactic Empire in 0 BBY, the chinar trees outlived their homeworld thanks to seed banks. The Canto Bight piazza, located on the planet of Cantonica, was lined with such trees. Chinar trees could also be found in the rooftop gardens of Coruscant many years prior to Alderaan's destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
