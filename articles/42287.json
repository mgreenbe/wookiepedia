The droid was used to transport the Rebels to one of the planet's subsidiary computer centers where they took control of one of Corusacnt's orbital mirror stations. This was the key first step in the Rogues' plan to take down the shields, an attempt which proved to be a success."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
