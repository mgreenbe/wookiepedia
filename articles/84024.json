The Empire controlled the Wookiees by using inhibitor chips which sounded like a song of fire and terror. On one occasion, Waroo witnessed a female friend dying while trying to scale the walls of the daubcrete bunker. Following the liberation of Kashyyyk by New Republic forces in 5 ABY, the inhibitor chips in Waroo and the other child slaves were disabled. While Dessard and his subordinates managed to reassert their authority by using shock-lances and blasters, Waroo was encouraged by the demoralized state of the Imperial slave masters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Desiring liberty, Waroo made a dash for freedom while Commandant Dessard tried to close the pylon-gate.

However, the Imperials were then shot by several adult Wookiees including his father Chewbacca and Greybok, and New Republic soldiers. Dessard managed to escape the barrage of blaster bolts and was taken prisoner by New Republic soldiers.

Waroo hated his Imperial captors and nicknamed them \"milk-skins.\" He regarded the signals created by the Imperial inhibitor chips as a song that could drive one insane. He also had a strong sense of smell and could smell his Imperial captors from afar. Waroo took delight in the disabling of the inhibitor chips and the despondent state of his Imperial captors. Waroo once made a desperate dash for freedom. He loved his father Chewbacca and mother Malla. Waroo experienced an emotional reunion with his father following the Liberation of Kashyyyk.
