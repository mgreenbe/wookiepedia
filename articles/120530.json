After choking his brother Feral, a brother who he had fiercely protected during the Selection, to death in a display of loyalty to Ventress, Opress was equipped with armor and a mystically enhanced spear before being offered to Dooku as a Dark Acolyte by Talzin. Dooku accepted Opress, allowing for him to enter the Clone Wars as his personal enforcer. Opress was initially sent to execute a mission against the Galactic Republic on the planet Devaron to prove himself, aiding the Separatist forces that were attacking the Temple of Eedit. Opress slaughtered a group of clone troopers and slew his first Jedi, Master, Halsey, and his Padawan Knox, overpowering them with his brute strength, endurance, and Hand-to-hand combat skills.

After a scuffle, Opress began to break free of the spell, with Ventress discovering that neither her or Dooku could contain Opress's impulsive nature and rage. In what became a three-way lightsaber battle, Opress overcame Ventress's spell of control and also terminated his service to Dooku, further battling his way through Skywalker and Kenobi as well as an army of droids, before escaping to Dathomir.
