That year, the Omen was knocked off course during hyperspace jump after a Jedi attack, and crashed in a mountain range on the remote planet Kesh. T'dell survived the disaster, and eventually she and the other remaining Omen crewmembers found their way to civilization where they took over rule of the planet. In 4992 BBY, T'dell had a daughter, Ebya, with another Human survivor, a miner named Nafjan T'dell.
