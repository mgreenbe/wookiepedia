After successfully planting explosives on board, they discovered that the vessel had been stolen by Admiral Gar Stazi of the Galactic Alliance. Deciding to inform Stazi of the explosives, Sinde and Dare rescued Monia Gahan, a Mon Calamari pilot from Rogue Squadron who had been assigned to slice into the shipyards' defensive system. Together, they rescued other Alliance captives from the recent battle, and sought to steal a shuttle to escape the planet and join up with the Alliance fleet. As they prepared to depart, the Quarren Sith Lord Darth Azard tried to stop them. Sinde engaged the Sith Lord in combat, giving Dare, Gahan and the Alliance pilots time to escape.

Despite feeling that his work on Dac was crucial, he was prepared to obey his Liege's orders. However, at the same time, the Sith scientist Vul Isen created a Sea Leviathan to hunt down the Mon Calamari refugees and suck them dry of their life-energies. When word of its existence reached Sinde, he initially counseled the Rangers to leave it alone and sacrifice the refugees to safeguard the few Ranger units operating on the planet. When Captain Tanquar, leader of the Rangers, made it clear that would not happen, Sinde devised a plan to destroy the Leviathan. While the Rangers attacked Isen's AT-AT Swimmer that was riding herd on the creature, Sinde took command of a number of Devilsquids, six tentacled creatures that hunted Mon Calamari. Sinde directed them to attack the Leviathan, and they dragged it into the depths of the Devil's Crevasse, where the Devilsquids made their home.

During the trip to Agamar, Fel admitted to Sinde that training new Knights was not the only reason for ordering Sinde back to Bastion; the Emperor was fearful of corruption, and needed Sinde by his side to counsel him. On Agamar, Sinde, along with his fellow Knights, guarded Fel during the meeting with the Jedi delegation. As the meeting came to a close, Moff Nyna Calixte, head of Imperial Intelligence in Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, arrived to warn the congregation that the Sith knew of the meeting, and had arrived with the intention of capturing or killing the Emperor.

Fel was unable to spare any to pick him up, and Sinde noted that acquiring a transport off the planet was impossible at the time.

The strike team successfully infiltrated Coruscant, using information supplied by Nyna Calixte. Calixte's role in warning Fel of the assault on Agamar had been discovered, and her execution had been ordered. Calixte survived an assassination attempt perpetrated by Morlish Veed, and subsequently hooked up with the allied forces of the Empire and the Alliance. The strike team completed their mission, neutralizing the orbital defenses and allowing the allied fleet to engage Coruscant's ground-based defenses and the Annihilator-class starfighters of Krayt's Sith troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the strike team's success, the Sith forces proved to be too strong for the allied fleet. Emperor Fel, believing the battle to be lost, intended to release a virulent toxin capable of wiping out all life on a planet, regardless of species, that had been designed by one of Krayt's Sith, Darth Maladi. Maladi had previously been captured by Imperial forces, and had struck a deal with Fel to create the toxin in exchange for safe haven and the life of Cade Skywalker. In reality, Maladi's capture had been arranged by Krayt to give Fel the toxin, which Krayt and his Sith were immune to by design. Fel intended to use the toxin on Coruscant to eliminate Krayt and his followers once and for all, feeling that the loss of a single planet was worth the sacrifice for killing the Sith Lord. As he prepared to release it, Sinde, alongside Fel's daughter and Antares Draco, implored his old friend to step away from the launch mechanism. Fel responded by Force-pushing his daughter and Sinde into the bulkhead behind them. Draco, finally realizing that his duty was to the Force as embodied by the Emperor rather than the Emperor himself, dueled and killed Fel, fulfilling his oath to prevent his liege from falling to the Dark Side. On Coruscant, Skywalker killed Darth Krayt, causing his Sith troopers to go mad and forcing Darth Nihl to order the retreat of all Sith Imperial forces from the planet. With victory achieved, the allied forces established the Galactic Federation Triumvirate to rule the galaxy, consisting of the new Empress, Marasiah Fel, Jedi Master K'kruhk, and Admiral Gar Stazi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 138 ABY, Treis Sinde was the eldest Imperial Knight in service to Emperor Fel. His skin was tanned, and his hair and beard were pure white. Pledged to serve the Emperor and the Empire-in-exile like all Imperial Knights, Sinde was a level-headed and pragmatic man, able to see the larger picture of galactic affairs. However, Sinde held to the belief that while Imperial Knights owed their allegiance to the Emperor, they were meant to follow the Force as embodied by the Emperor, not to obey him over its will. Sinde was willing to disobey direct orders to follow the will of the Force, and was dismayed that many of the younger knights, including his own former apprentice Sigel Dare, held loyalty to the Emperor as more important than the needs of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When sabotaging the Imperious, Sinde planned for the explosives to go off away from Dac, so that the native Mon Calamari would hopefully not be blamed for their act. He did not share Sigel Dare's views that all non-Imperial's were technically their enemies, and often counseled the younger Knight that she needed to look at the bigger picture. While Dare did not always agree with him, she respected Sinde's wisdom and decisions. He was also fully aware that the Mon Calamari Rangers could not defeat the Empire and the Sith, and instead counseled them to focus on surviving long enough for outside assistance to arrive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sinde also had no compunctions about sacrificing others to achieve the greater good, as shown when he informed Captain Tanquar of the Rangers that they should forget about protecting Mon Calamari refugees from the Leviathan, as it was clearly a Sith scheme to draw the Rangers out of hiding. However, the Knight was also willing to sacrifice himself if it would help the completion of his mission, such as engaging Darth Azard in combat rather than seek to escape Dac himself since he knew that informing Stazi of the explosives on board the Imperious was important as he saw the wisdom in a possible alliance between the Galactic Alliance and Fel's Empire-in-exile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sinde was unafraid of speaking his mind, even if what he said threatened to make him unpopular to those he was speaking to. Emperor Fel II regarded Sinde to be stubborn, and informed his son, Roan Fel, of this fact. However, despite this, he was deferential towards his Master, Emperor Fel, even when he felt that his Liege's orders went against what Sinde thought to be morally right."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A capable warrior, Sinde could fight as effectively underwater as he could on the ground. Sinde also had a talent for command, as he had previously commanded an Imperial mission to the Unknown Regions, and was given the responsibility of leading the team of himself and Master Dare to Dac, as well as commanding the fleet sent to support the Jedi Order at Taivas. He was also a shrewd strategist and tactician, able to devise plans to achieve objectives such as planting multiple explosive charges on the Imperious, capturing an Acklay battle fortress, as well as devising an ad hoc strategy to defeat the Leviathan shortly after learning of its existence. He was also an effective teacher in the ways of the Force, have trained Sigel Dare to knighthood, and was required by Emperor Fel to train new Imperial Knights even though Fel had other Knights available, and Sinde was assisting the Mon Calamari resistance at the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sinde and Roan Fel were close friends and confidants, which stemmed from their days as apprentices together. When Fel began to fear that he was being tempted with corruption by the last seven years of war against the Sith and his desire to possess the Muur Talisman, he recalled Sinde to his side so that he could benefit from the experienced Knight's wisdom and counsel. Sinde's loyalty to the Emperor was absolute, and in return, Fel trusted the Knight implicitly. However, Sinde had sworn an oath to serve the Force as embodied by the Emperor, and to prevent the Emperor from falling to the Dark Side. When Fel intended to kill billions of innocents on Coruscant\u2014including his allies\u2014by releasing the Omega Red toxin in an effort to kill Krayt and his Sith, Sinde stood against him and implored him to reconsider. Fel attacked Sinde, and was only stopped from releasing the toxin when Antares Draco dueled and killed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sinde was a fully trained Imperial Knight, and was skilled in employing the Force to repel attackers. He was also skilled with the use of a lightsaber\u2014wielding one of the same design as every other Knight\u2014and could use it to both effectively deflect incoming blaster bolts and duel a Sith Lord. His lightsaber was also capable of functioning underwater. Sinde could project a protection bubble to safeguard himself from harm, as he did when caught in a fuel tank explosion on the Sea Lion, and could use the power of animal friendship to take command of a large number of Devilsquids and direct them to attack the Leviathan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Treis Sinde was introduced in Legacy 22, written by John Ostrander and illustrated by Alan Robinson. His story was continued in the Fight Another Day story arc and Divided Loyalties, which were both written by Ostrander; this time, however, Sinde was illustrated by Omar Francia and Dave Ross respectively. In the next of his appearances, Legacy 43 by Jan Duursema, Sinde was mistakenly colored as a brown-haired, light-color skinned Imperial Knight. John Ostrander later clarified that the character is indeed Sinde. In the following issue, Sinde's coloration was back to normal.
