A hotbed of life with a hot and humid climate and breathable atmosphere, Rodia was mostly covered in water, including the vast Wesessa Sea. The majority of the planet's solid landmasses that were not submerged were covered in unworkable swamps, thick forests and jungles, with colder regions to the north and south of the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Union with the Galactic Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around fifteen millennia before the Battle of Yavin, Rodia had joined the Galactic Republic after seeing benefits come from their union.

However, when Gunray stated his intentions to execute Amidala, and delay the delivery of Rodia's supplies, he realized his mistake and helped her escape. The two held Gunray at gunpoint and had him arrested. Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine dispatched several supply convoys to Rodia upon learning of the dilemma."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bounty hunter Cad Bane was later assigned to Rodia by Darth Sidious to capture a Force-sensitive Rodian child.
