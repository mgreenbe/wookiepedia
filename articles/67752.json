This route led to the Brevost system on the Harrin Trade Corridor, and took thirteen days to travel.

However, rather than supply slaves to the Empire, the Iskalloni decided to enslave the Imperial emissaries instead. The Imperial Navy sent three Victory-class Star Destroyers for a retaliatory raid. Though the Imperials devastated much of the planet before the Iskallon counterattack, the Imperial forces were forced to retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since they were not pursued, the Empire no longer saw the Iskalloni as a major threat.
