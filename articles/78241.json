The architecture resembled the original terrestrial colonies on the planet Kamino, which were constructed with wattle and daub and suited the long stormy seasons. After Kamino's ice age ended, causing a Great Flood and constant rain beginning in 19,000 BBY, the graceful curves of Middle-period Krorral were adopted in almost every major Kaminoan city, including the planet's capital, Tipoca City, and Timira City for their rain-sloughing and wind-shedding nature and resemblance to the old colonies. The design of these cities, along with stilts applied from the Alderaanian Oversea style, were some of the only instances of offworld influence on Kaminoan culture, provided by some of the galaxy's keenest architectural minds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The domed architecture of Tipoca City was first described in the 2002 novelization of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, written by R.
