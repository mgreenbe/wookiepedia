However, while searching for Slayke's crew, the pirates stole the Plooriod Bodkin after disabling the Thranta, leaving the Republic crew stranded on the world for months, disgracing Halcyon in the eyes of many. The Bodkin became Slayke's command ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Plooriod Bodkin is referred to at least once, in the novel Jedi Trial, as a 'judicial corvette'.
