The last of his kind, the Geonosian kept a Queen egg hidden under his protection in the hopes of resurrecting his species after the Galactic Empire brought the Geonosians to near-extinction after finishing the primary stage of construction of the Death Star in the planet's orbit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Klik-Klak had a home in the depths of an old Geonosian temple where he was able to build his own droid army from the resources left by the Confederacy of Independent Systems back from the Clone Wars. With the use of his droids, they were able to ambush anyone or anything that entered the Geonosian's lair. In 2 BBY, Klik-Klak ambushed Saw Gerrera and a team of his Partisans who had been sent by Rebel Command to investigate the disappearance of the Geonosian people. Believing they were threats, he killed all but Saw, who managed to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Klik-Klak encountered members of the rebel cell Spectres who had been sent to find Saw. Following a brief skirmish and pursuit, the rebels and Saw managed to capture him. Despite their initial hostile encounter, the rebel Ezra Bridger managed to convince his comrades and Saw that Klik-Klak was no threat. Klik-Klak attempted to explain to the Rebels the existence of the Death Star but was unable to do so due to only being able to draw a circle within a circle. While exploring an underground air shaft, the rebels and Saw discovered evidence that the Empire had exterminated the Geonosians with chemical weapons. After allowing Klik-Klak to flee underground with the Queen egg, the rebels managed to escape an attack by an Arquitens-class command cruiser and flee offworld with news of the Imperial genocide against the Geonosians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Background"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Klik-Klak was the sole survivor of the Imperial sterilization of Geonosis.

Klik-Klak also managed to rebuild and reprogram several B1-series battle droids and droidekas, which he used to guard his territory. Several of the droidekas were used to guard a military-grade Deflector shield generator on the surface.

Saw had been sent by Rebel Command to investigate the apparent disappearance of the Geonosian people. Believing Saw and his team to be hostile, Klik-Klak attacked and killed Saw's team. Saw survived and managed to hide in the underground labyrinth long enough until the Captain Rex and several members of the Spectres rebel cell arrived to find him and continue his mission. With the help of Saw, the Spectres Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger, Chopper, and Rex managed to destroyed a unit of battle droids and droidekas that Klik-Klak had sent to ambush them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While exploring the central air shaft, the droid Chopper discovered Klik-Klak hiding on the other side. Believing that Klik-Klak held the answers as to what the Empire was building on Geonosis, the rebels and Saw pursued him through the mine. He also used a remote controller to activate the droidekas on the surface. These droidekas attacked the Spectres Sabine Wren and Garazeb Orrelios, who were extracting the deflector core from the shield generator. Chopper and Ezra attempted to corner him but Klik-Klak managed to fight off his pursuers. Following a prolonged struggle, Klik-Klak was cornered by Saw, Kanan, and Rex.

His harsh methods alarmed Ezra and his rebel comrades. Ezra managed to gain Klik-Klak's trust by reassuring him that they were not there to harm him. He also managed to convince Klik-Klak to share his name. Unable to pronounce Klik-Klak's name, Ezra nicknamed him Klik-Klak. When Ezra asked him what the Empire was doing on Geonosis, Klik-Klak merely drew two circles on the ground. After Chopper picked up an energy reading, Saw forced Klik-Klak to lead them there. Not trusting the Geonosian, Saw handcuffed him with restraints."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Klik-Klak reluctantly led the rebels into his nest. Klik-Klak protested when Saw began rummaging through his place for information on the Empire's activities. Saw's harsh methods alarmed Ezra, Kanan, and Rex. At Ezra's prompting, Klik-Klak revealed that he had been sheltering a Geonosian queen egg. After some discussion, the rebels and Saw reached an agreement which allowed Saw to take Klik-Klak off world for interrogation on the condition that they return him safely to Geonosis once they were finished with him. After restablishing contact with Hera, the rebels and Klik-Klak rendezvoused with the ship Ghost in the central air shaft. The Ghost's arrival coincided with the arrival of an Imperial light cruiser commanded by Captain Brunson."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once aboard the Ghost, Saw broke his agreement with the Spectres and Rex and attempted to leave with Klik-Klak aboard the Phantom II.

When Saw threatened to shoot the Geonosian queen egg in order to extract results from Klik-Klak, Ezra warned him that resorting to such behavior would make him no better than the Empire. The rebels and Saw later put aside their differences to fight off Brunson's boarding party of Jumptroopers.

Despite his past animosity towards the Geonosians, Saw believed that the Geonosians deserved the right to rebuild like everyone else.

Following the sterilization of Geonosis, Klik-Klak became the custodian of a Geonosian queen egg, which was believed to be one of the last surviving eggs left on the planet. Due to his people's recent history, Klik-Klak was suspicious of armed strangers especially those who were armed with guns.
