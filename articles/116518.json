Rock-One entered the Dubrillion system shortly after the Battle of Helska IV, where it was used as a base to launch coralskipper probes against the surface of the world. Later Rock-One was targeted by Rogue Squadron during the evacuation of Dubrillion; during the battle, it used interdiction fields to prevent some of the convoy from heading to Agamar, necessitating their rerouting to Dantooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
