Believing that the insignia would be a symbol to rouse and reawaken those who had fallen under the sway of Palpatine, the group replaced the Insignia of Unity with a counterfeit. With the counterfeit in place, the group moved the symbol to Tandun III for safe keeping and used the Stellar Envoy as the key to retrieve it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars era the Republic Group spent time uncovering numerous traitors in the Galactic Senate by tracing credits that flowed from Coruscant to different weapons manufacturers and starship-building companies across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the Republic Group believed it was time to re-reveal the insignia and tasked Captain Jadak with delivering the Stellar Envoy to an ally of the group, Aren Folee.

Several had died in the Ghorman Massacre, while others died in the Destruction of Alderaan, even more died in the ensuing conflicts between Imperial Warlords. Very few of the members died a natural death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known members"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
