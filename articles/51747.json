An apprentice tech to the Keiffler Brothers, he assisted in their work on the FarStar when it was under Moff Kentor Sarne's control. Unlike the Brothers, Gaelin returned to Pembric II and began working for himself. Sarne had given him orders to watch over Crev Bombaasa. Without finances and clout, however, he was pulled into the Bombaasa Cartel, since Bombaasa trusted no one who had come into contact with Sarne. Although desperate to leave the planet, Gaelin was locked away in a lab with his equipment. Despite this, he managed to send reports to Sarne on Bombaasa until the moff retreated from Kal'Shebbol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 8 ABY, a landing party from the FarStar, aided by Breslin Drake, liberated Gaelin from his imprisonment, and he joined the crew of the corvette. He uncovered over twenty-five separate traps in the systems of the FarStar, including the high-powered tracking beacon. However, he wasn't as skilled as his mentors, and missed several of the more subtle traps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
