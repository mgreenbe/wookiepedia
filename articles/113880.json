Within the Order, he became a Jedi Guardian, a combat-orientated Jedi specialization, and he eventually constructed his own lightsaber and attained the rank of Jedi Knight. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, a conflict that was fought between the Republic and the separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems, members of the Jedi Order were called up to serve with and lead the Army of the Republic.

He summoned the Heroes of Cularin to New Dawn so that he could debrief them on their encounter with Dessin's Dagger, and he met with them in one of the station's conference rooms. After thanking them for the role that they had played in the freighter's capture, Jaa took statements from the agents in relation to who they were and what they were doing in the Druckenwell system.

During his inquiries into the actions of Dessin's Dagger, Jaa became concerned by the willingness of the freighter's crew to fight to the death, and he suspected that they had planned to carry out something that would be bad for the Republic.

If the player characters are helpful to Jaa when he questions them, he informs them that the Republic is willing to pay to repair any damage that they sustained to their starship during their engagement with Dessin's Dagger.
