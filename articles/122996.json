The development of the sequel trilogy was made official on October 30, 2012, when The Walt Disney Company announced that it was acquiring Lucasfilm from Lucas and that they would be producing new Star Wars films beginning in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early plans"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ideas for a Star Wars sequel trilogy were in place as early as 1976, during the filming of the original film. Mark Hamill, who starred as Luke Skywalker in the film, recounted that George Lucas asked if he would be interested in appearing in Episode IX \"around 2011,\" when Lucas assumed such a film would be made. According to Hamill, his character would \"be like Obi-Wan Kenobi handing the lightsaber down to the next generation.\" In 1978, after the success of A New Hope, Lucas told Time magazine that he would produce a sequel to A New Hope and then ten additional films, for a total of four Star Wars trilogies. In the early 1980s, both Hamill and Lucas repeatedly told the media that the sequels would be made in the 2000s. At first, he was considering making 12 films, 3 of which there were \"a couple of odd movies\" that focused only on subjects such as droids and Wookiees. However, he decided to abandon his ideas for those films and focus solely on the 9-part saga. At the time of the release of The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas confirmed that there were seven further Star Wars films he wanted to make. He said he had multiple-page outlines and title for those films, and that the sequel trilogy \"deals with the character that survives Star Wars III and his adventures.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Gary Kurtz, the producer of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas's original ideas for the sequel trilogy (which he described as \"very vague\") were eventually condensed into Return of the Jedi.

So plots change a lot when they start getting into script form.\" The original plan had been for Han Solo to die and for Luke was to confront Vader and then go on with life alone. The sequels would've then showed Luke becoming a full-fledged Jedi, Leia becoming Queen of the remaining people of Alderaan, and Luke finding his long-lost sister from the other side of the galaxy. Luke would've trained his sister as a Jedi and together they would've confronted the Emperor on the Imperial Capital Planet of Had Abbadon. Lucas allowed author Dale Pollock to read the plot outlines of a 12-film saga on the condition of signing a confidentiality agreement. Pollock said these sequel trilogy drafts would \"involve Luke Skywalker in his 30s and 40s\" and that they would be \"The three most exciting stories \u2026 They had propulsive action, really interesting new worlds, new characters. I remember thinking, 'I want to see these 3 movies.'\" Likewise, author Timothy Zahn had been briefed by Lucas on his sequel plans when he was hired to write the Thrawn Trilogy. Lucas told him that he wanted each trilogy to follow a generation of Skywalkers, and as such, the sequels would involve Luke's children."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the 1980s, Lucas himself revealed several ideas he had in mind for the sequels; He described it as \"like a saga, the story of a group of people, a family.\" They would begin roughly 20-40 years after Return of the Jedi, would involve the core cast in their 60s or 70s, and would deal with the rebuilding of the republic. and their main theme would be \"the necessity for moral choices and the wisdom needed to distinguish right from wrong.\" \"If the first trilogy is social and political and talks about how society evolves, Star Wars is more about personal growth and self realization, and the third deals with moral and philosophical problems. The sequel is about Jedi Knighthood, justice, confrontation, and passing on what you have learned.\" Han and Leia would be a couple. R2-D2 and C-3PO would be the only characters who might continue through all nine films. The story would focus on Luke, who would be a sixty-year-old Jedi knight in a romantic relationship with a female. According to Lucas, \"what happens to Luke \u2026 is much more ethereal. I have a tiny notebook full of notes on that. If I'm really ambitious, I could proceed to figure out what would have happened to Luke.\" (Hamill also said in 1983 that if his character were to return again, it would be \"on another plane of existence, or not the same character.\")"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Abandonment and the Expanded Universe"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, stories began to appear that were set during the sequel time period, telling original stories of their own; The first attempt at filling this void was the ill-fated 1986 toy line The Epic Continues, which involved the rise of the genetics master Atha Prime and the survival of Grand Moff Tarkin. More notably, Timothy Zahn's 1991 novel Heir to the Empire marked the beginning of the successful \"Expanded Universe\" of stories set after Return of the Jedi. Luke started his own Jedi Academy and met and married a woman named Mara Jade, who was one of the Emperor's assistants. Together they had one child, Ben Skywalker. Han and Leia were married, and had three children: the twins Jacen and Jaina, as well as their younger sibling Anakin.

At some point, the decision was made to diverge from Lucas's outlines, in favor of what Lucas later refered to as \"something for the fans\" with a \"retro feel\"; He contrasted The Force Awakens with Episodes I-VI, saying \"I worked very hard to make them completely different, with different planets, with different spaceships \u2026 to make it new.\" Director JJ Abrams told Vanity Fair that among the studio's concerns was that Lucas's outlines featured characters who were \"very young,\" which seemed reminiscent of The Phantom Menace. According to Iger's 2019 memoir The Ride of a Lifetime, Lucas felt \"betrayed\" by The Force Awakens.

Darth Maul has united these criminal factions and consolidated power.

At first, Luke is in a dark state of mind, but slowly returns to his old self, and ultimately agrees to train the girl. Luke then tries to rebuild the Jedi, seeking out survivors of Order 66 as well as new young recruits. (According to Hamill, Luke would have survived until Episode IX and trained Leia in the Force.

It was very much about putting ideas up on the board and exploring together. There were millions of things that we bounced around and abandoned.\" Lucas was also set to advise, but he stepped away due to the departure from his original outlines. However, the creative team did use Lucas's outlines as a starting point, and retained certain elements from them as they developed a very general idea of where the trilogy's story would go.
