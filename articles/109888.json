In addition to this, these units were also equipped with an internal orbital strike beacon that could be activated remotely by the droid's owner. This beacon could call upon a small orbital strike from any ally starships in orbit. The device required a few seconds to power up, but the R-4 was completely mobile even when it was activated, allowing it to evade incoming blaster shots from enemies during the time it is activated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The R-4 recon droid, which was 0.75 meters in diameter,[source?] was identical to the R-1 recon droid, as well as the Mark IV recon droid, reconnaissance droids also produced by Arakyd Industries during the Clone Wars.

The clone sharpshooters' recon droids were called the R-1 recon droids, the droid snipers had Mark IV recon droids, and the Rebel marksmen and scout troopers both had R-4 recon droids. In-game, however, no model designation is giving of each weapon and equipment. By Star Wars: Battlefront II, all the recon droids from its game guide were classified as the Mark IV models and the orbital beacon had been replaced with a self-destruct mechanism."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
