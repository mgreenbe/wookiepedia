In 34 ABY, CS-Squad, led by Commander Pyre and Sergeant CS-812, deployed to the Outer Rim world of Castilon to enforce the First Order's occupation of the Colossus refueling station. Operating as peacekeepers in the wake of several pirate raids on the platform, their presence was welcomed by some civilians such as the human mechanic Tamara Ryvora. Others, however, opposed the First Order's security measures, leading to a riot among the Colossus' alien population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to their peacekeeping mission, CS-Squad was tasked with hunting spies who worked against the First Order's interests. As such, citizens were regularly subjected to inspection, arrest and interrogation by stormtroopers, inciting to discontent among populace. In the midst of the occupation, the Resistance agent Kazuda Xiono impersonated CS-515, one of the troopers in CS-Squad, in order to spy on the First Order. Yet his behavior was considered irregular for a stormtrooper, as noted by Pyre and CS-812, who believed \"CS-515\" was in need of a memory wipe. However, Xiono managed to switch places with the true CS-515 which, in turn, led to the arrest of the real soldier while the imposter remained at large."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
