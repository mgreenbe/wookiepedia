Later while meditating, the pair received a report from Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi who was investigating the attempted assassination of Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala on Kamino. While on the water-world, Kenobi had met with Prime Minister Lama Su who revealed the creation of the Grand Army of the Republic. The Masters were shocked that Prime Minister Su claimed that the Jedi Council had placed the order and were even more concerned with the fact they had not sensed its creation through the Force. Realizing how clouded the Force was, the two decided to keep their diminishing abilities private so as not to boost the moral of the resurgent and mysterious Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after the First Battle of Geonosis and the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Windu met with Master Tholme and Jedi Quinlan Vos regarding a proposed undercover mission to get into the upper echelons of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

Once there, Fett began to plot the assassination of Master Windu. In the time before Windu was due at the Chancellor's Office Fett sneaked through the service corridors of the Temple up to the Council Members' Level.
