It was located on the southeastern coast of the continent of Keshtah Minor. As with other parts of the planet, it was ruled by the Lost Tribe of Sith, the descendants of Human Sith who had become stranded on Kesh during the Great Hyperspace War. As with other urban settlements, Glorim had a local constabulary that was tasked with enforcing law and order.
