Its main mission was to intercept and engage pirate fleets although, because of its relativity low firepower, required the assistance of one of the other Tapani fleets to be able to take on more powerful forces. Unlike the Ground Pounders fleet the Swift Wing were designed to destroy rather than seize their targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
