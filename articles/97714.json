While there, she learned of an Imperial Army non-com named Drenn Biktor who wished to defect to the Alliance. He knew a great deal about Imperial Outer Rim supply routes, which could be useful for the Rebels in interdicting their shipments. Eager to bring Biktor safely to Anchorhead before he could be found by the Empire, Vendallan asked a Rebel spacer to escort him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The spacer succeeded in finding Biktor and bringing him back safely to Anchorhead. After returning Biktor, Vendallan made arrangements to get him offworld. However, Vendallan's work did not end there. A friend of hers, named Vil Sembian, son of a famous, deceased weaponsmith named Daw Sembian, possessed a schematic for a new type of blaster. Vil was bringing the schematic to Vendallan, but the Empire was on his tail. Vendallan's commander claimed that the weapon could tip the scales in their favor, so she tasked the same spacer who had helped her earlier with finding and escorting Vil Sembian safely. The Rebel spacer agreed, and succeeded in the mission. Vendallan was pleased, and stated that she would send the schematics to Alliance High Command."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nitra Vendallan was a Non-Player Character (NPC) in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
