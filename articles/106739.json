It contained many roleplaying articles, including a rules supplement for the West End Games Star Wars D6 system. The article was called \"Lightsabers: And the Force in the Star Wars New Republic\" and was written by Bill Slavicsek and Michele Carter. Like all supplements printed in Polyhedron prior to 2002, the article is considered ambiguously canon."}]}
