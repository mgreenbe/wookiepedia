On the surface, Shang-Troy found a young woman, pregnant and ready to give birth to twins. Assisting her in the birth, he was there to welcome the two young boys, one of which received a scar on his arm during a slight complication in the delivery. With the planet having little to offer it citizens, the boys' mother agreed to let Shang-Troy take them offplanet and train them as Jedi Knights so that they might have a brighter future."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shang-Troy took it upon himself to train the boys on a remote planet, and as the boys grew into young men strong in the Force, they came to love Shang-Troy as a father. Together they traveled the Galaxy, protecting the innocent and upholding justice while staying true to the Jedi way. During their travels, however, the younger brother met and fell in love with a young lady who returned his love just as much. However, the older brother loved the woman just as much, and it did not take long for his love to turn to jealousy and anger. Shang-Troy did his best to comfort the young man, but was unfortunately unable to extinguish the anger and jealousy within him. One night, the older brother used his identical appearance to fool the woman into sharing a kiss with him, but was caught by his brother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This time, the jealousy was in the younger brother and the woman's true love.
