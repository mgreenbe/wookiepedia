When Jedi Knight Jysella Horn was stricken with a mysterious psychosis that made her believe that everyone she knew had been replaced by impostors, she began to attack civilians, tossing them across the Processional Way. Two of her friends, Bazel Warv and Yaqeel Saav'etu, were at a nearby tapcafe and witnessed her rampage. Realizing what had happened to her, they attempted to stop Horn, but she attacked them, using flow-walking to predict their movements. After slashing Warv in the chest, she attempted to flee, only to be cut off and captured by Galactic Alliance Security forces shortly after. Horn was imprisoned, encased in carbonite, and eventually placed in a secret Galactic Alliance Security blockhouse. Jedi Master Cilghal and several other Jedi soon arrived, and Saav'etu and Warv were taken back to the Jedi Temple for healing and debriefing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
