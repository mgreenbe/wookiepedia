The victim was injected with a pain-stimulating drug like Skirtopanol or Bavo-6, their nerves stimulated with heat, the effect artificially raised into progressively more pain, starting from level four and increasing upward. A powerful tool for extracting information or causing mental breakdown from unwilling captives for retraining them into secret agents, Imperial Intelligence Director Ysanne Isard used the technique often, including on Rogue Squadron starfighter pilot Corran Horn while he was being held aboard the buried Lusankya. Both he and squadron pilot Tycho Celchu were designated R1, unsuitable for conversion through brainwashing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
