During the trade group's blockade of the planet, this droid was stationed aboard the Saak'ak, the Federation's Lucrehulk-class command ship. There, he led a squad consisting of seven OOM security droids under the command of Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. He and his squad were tasked with the mission of confirming the deaths of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi by dioxis gas in the ship's conference room, with orders to blast the Jedi on sight if need be. Upon reaching the conference room, whose sole occupant appeared to be a very startled TC-14, he ordered a corporal inside to investigate, with OWO-1 and the other security droids offering cover fire. Before the corporal could comply, two lightsabers activated in the room. OWO-1 and the corporal fired instinctively at them, only for the Jedi to deflect the blasts, destroying both droids. The rest of the squad swiftly followed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OWO-1 was designated from other OOM droids by the yellow markings on his head and torso and the twin antennae mounted on his back.
