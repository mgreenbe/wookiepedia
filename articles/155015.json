Wanting to obtain the data held in the memory banks of the tactical droid's cranial unit, Secura planned an ambush to acquire the head of the droid. With her clone troopers, she set a trap by fabricating an information bunker in a rocky canyon. Eventually, the tactical droid learned about the bunker, and, hoping to receive valuable information about the Grand Army of the Republic, he led his droid forces to capture it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time the tactical droid arrived at the bunker with his forces, Secura had hidden herself inside of it, and positioned her clone troopers on a nearby rock formation, where they prepared to ambush the droid forces. As a B2 super battle droid exploded the door of the bunker, the tactical droid ordered his data retrieval droids to gather all of the information held in the data banks inside it. The droids, however, informed the tactical droid that the data banks were completely empty. This revelation confused the tactical droid, and at that moment, the Republic clone troopers launched their attack. Under heavy fire, the tactical droid panicked, ordering his droid forces to defend him while he fled inside the bunker and left his cohorts to be destroyed by the clone troopers. Inside the bunker, the droid stated that he was too valuable to be destroyed, but was suddenly confronted by Secura. Before the surprised droid could trigger cyberostasis to protect his memory banks, Secura quickly decapitated the tactical droid with her lightsaber. The Jedi then took the droid's unscathed head, preparing to transfer the cranial unit to her cruiser and analyze it with a robolobotomy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata, this droid, like all tactical droids, was 1.93 meters tall and was far more intelligent than standard battle droids of the Separatist Droid Army. His freedom from being controlled by a central control computer allowed him to think and function independently. The droid had masculine programming and white photoreceptors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid was very impatient and eager to gain information about his enemies. An information bunker, which the droid believed to contain Republic intelligence, proved to be too tempting a target for him to resist. He was often dissatisfied with his subordinates' activity, insulting the droids under his command while ordering them to march more swiftly and, later, to protect him. The tactical droid also believed himself to be more valuable than his troops\u2014too much so to be destroyed.
