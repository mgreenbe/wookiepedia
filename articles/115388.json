Rhand was once inhabited by a species that disappeared before some members of the Knell of Muspilli, Kanzer Exiles, and Warriors of Shadow arrived on the planet. These three groups merged after thousands of years to create the Sorcerers of Rhand. This dark organization expanded their territory in the nearby region known as the Nihil Retreat but kept Rhand as base of operations. The greatest Sorcerers of Rhand took up residence in the ruins built by the extinct Rhandite species. Rhand was the homeworld of the Sorcerer of Rhand Cronal, later known as the Director of Imperial Intelligence and Emperor's Hand Blackhole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Wars: Force and Destiny Core Rulebook incorrectly places Rhand in the Dreighton Nebula."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
