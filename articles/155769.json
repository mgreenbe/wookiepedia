Its design included a control cabin with a wheel to steer the vessel, and an aft section where the repulsors were housed. Its hull was not rated to withstand 1,000 atmospheres worth of pressure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The smuggler Roark Garnet boarded the vessel at one point, and neutralized the crew except for a single member.
