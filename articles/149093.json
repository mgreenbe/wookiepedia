During the trip, Tret and some of the other tourists, the Humans Nia Reston, San Herrera, and Philinda, and the Rodian Nikolo, were recruited by the droid LN-73 into assisting him at sabotaging the production facilities. LN-73 accomplished this by lying to them by claiming that HG-211, Uffel's head of security, had been corrupted. Tret and the rest of the group then attacked the Heroes of Cularin, who LN-73 falsely claimed were sabotaging the droid factories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
