During the time of the Disciples of Ragnos, it was known that there was a chain of Imperial Remnant fortresses and manufacturing plants on the surface which was responsible for the considerable amount of pollution in the atmosphere. It was here that Rosh Penin was held captive after having fallen to the dark side of the Force. Despite, or perhaps because of this, he managed to get a message out to the Jedi Praxeum, prompting Kyle Katarn and his former apprentice, Jedi Knight Jaden Korr to launch a rescue mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The presence of the Imperial Remnant was large here, as the fortresses and processing plants were being defended by several platoons of stormtroopers and hazard stormtroopers, as well as numerous jumptroopers, New Reborn, and Sith Cultists. It was on Taspir III where Tavion Axmis' apprentice, Alora met her destiny, having been killed in a fierce lightsaber duel by Jaden Korr. It was also where Korr chose his path within the Force, having overcome his anger at Rosh's betrayal and refusing to kill his friend. Once the Cultists and Imperial forces had been cleaned out, Korr departed for Korriban to aid in the final confrontation between the Disciples and the New Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor and the collapse of the Empire the planet remained under the control of Grand Moff Ardus Kaine and his Pentastar Alignment.
