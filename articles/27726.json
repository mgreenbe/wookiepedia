Galactic Emperor Palpatine wore a simple hooded cloak to hide his face. Cloaks could be worn for fashion (Alderaanian cloak) or as a status-symbol (Command cloak). Most notably they were used for protection against the elements (All-Temperature Cloak) or other people (Stun cloak). Specially imbued cloaks could even protect the user from force-wielders, such include the Yuuzhan Vong Cloak of Nuun and the Sith Cloak of Hate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
