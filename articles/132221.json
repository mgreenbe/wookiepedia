Each vehicle, starship, and bit of technology from Episode VII is explored; cross-sectioned to reveal the armaments, propulsion systems, armor, control systems, and other key aspects of each. From Han Solo's Millennium Falcon (no doubt further modified in the years since Episode VI) to the First Order's new TIE fighters, special features and hidden mechanisms are described and illustrated in graphic detail. Together with the Star Wars: The Force Awakens Visual Dictionary, these books comprise a definitive look at this all-new chapter in the Star Wars saga and a welcome addition to any fan's reference library!"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Content"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
