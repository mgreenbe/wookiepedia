It was envisioned as a Banking Clan world and the technological designs of the world were inspired by the thin elegance of the Muun species. Concept art showcased \"fresnel\" type designs, with layered crystalline filaments suggesting old-style electronics. The first paintings by Erik Tiemens emphasized a turquoise color palette, giving it a self-illuminated brightness, as well as prominent hexagonal facets that marked the planet's surface. These concepts resurfaced during the development of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series and heavily inspired the look of the planet Christophsis, as well as that of Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
