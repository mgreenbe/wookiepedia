As they cried from the fright, the adult Ewoks arrived, and Shodu inquired what was going on. Wicket tried to hide the woklings' true reason for crying, as he was not supposed to have taken them to the Hut of Horrors; he claimed that they were having a sleepover and that the woklings were simply crying for more of Shodu's sunberry pie. As though to prove his point, he and his friends shoved slices of it in the mouths of the woklings.
