In addition to her regular fleet of transport freighters, Nuutu often hired private contractors and smugglers, always making sure to meet individually with the pilots before their assignments. She employed both legitimate transport captains and discreet smugglers for XTS's illegal operations. Her docking bay was well equipped for starship repair, and she offered her pilots many perks, such as free repairs, upgrades, credit vouchers to the XTS store, and \"favors\" owed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
