Rebel Alliance soldiers and Imperial stormtroopers alike later used them during the Galactic Civil War, although not as much as thermal detonators. These concussion grenades had powerful magnetics and were utilized against armored vehicles during the war such as AT-STs. The grenade would stick to the armor of the vehicle and detonate with a powerful blast designed to rip a hole through the vehicle's hull. While effective against armored vehicles, the grenades had a short blast radius and caused only minimum damage against infantry units."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LXR-6 concussion grenades appear in the 2004 video game Star Wars: Battlefront, although they are identified as such in the game's strategy guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
