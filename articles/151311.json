After the First Battle of Geonosis, Haber fled to Serenno and joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. There he became a propagandist for the Separatists, using his knowledge of cloning and genetics to deliver agitprop over the CIS Shadowfeed to Republic citizens. Haber claimed that the Kaminoans had suppressed the genes that would allow clone troopers to integrate with mainstream society, and that the Republic had covered up numerous incidents in which clones were maddened by bloodlust and had massacred Republic civilians. Haber also claimed that the Jedi Generals had promised the clones settlement on selected Republic \"liberty worlds\" after the war, which would be ruled as the clones saw fit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
