The world allowed for the usage of Octusi servants, and also had a police force that was capable of handling minor protests; although the force was not strong enough to put down a full revolt. In 44 ABY, a freedom march was carried out for the slaves. When Galactic Federation of Free Alliances Chief of State Natasi Daala heard about the incident, she ordered her Chief of Staff, Wynn Dorvan, to contact Mandalorian Commander Belok Rhal to hire a brigade of Mandalorians through the use of the mining company to stop the potential revolt. Meanwhile, Freedom Flight, a galaxy-wide anti-slavery organization, was aware of the situation. One Freedom Flight member, Blink, tipped off reporter Madhi Vaandt to go to Blaudu Sextus rather than Klatooine, where another uprising had recently begun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vaandt traveled to Blaudu Sextus, where Freedom Flight had initiated a revolt among the pacifist Octusi species. Vaandt reported on the revolt as Mandalorian troops arrived and responded to the Octusi with violence. Soon afterward, Belok Rhal personally led a massacre of the Octusi in the capital city of Arari when they refused to stop their revolt. Vaandt covered the event on live news, but Rhal found out and attacked her, shooting and killing her. However, Vaandt's assistant, Shohta Laar, picked up where she left off, continuing the report and assisting in Rhal's capture by the arriving Jedi Knights Sothais Saar and Avinoam Arelis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jason Fry confirmed that the \"Blaudu Sextus system\" mentioned in the Essential Atlas Online Companion (in the Prefsbelt sector) was a mistake.
