No crew survived the crash, and a young Bimm named Glah Ubooki discovered the wreck. Enlisting the help of seven of his brothers, the Bimms salvaged what they could from the vessel for three hours before Imperial forces arrived. The Bimms sold their find in the markets of Glastro, the closest city, where the prototypes were bought by a Rebel smuggler who recognized their worth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
