The Rebels went on alert and began loading transports to make an escape from their base. X-wing and Y-wing squadrons were sent to cover the transports' jump to hyperspace. Meanwhile, stormtroopers were landed on the moon, tasked with the capture of Rebel officers and leaders. The Midnight Star escaped the system, carrying Commander Hamelin, Gruu Dunrik, and Cala Worner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the base was lost, many of the Rebel forces escaped the system and key officers and leaders were spirited away.
