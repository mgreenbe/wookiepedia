During the Separatist Crisis the senate began to debate the Military Creation Act, which would create an army for the Republic for the first time in a millennium. During the debate, Senator Farr became a strong Militarist and supporter of the Act. He was known as a watchdog against Separatist influences in the senate and was highly critical of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's Loyalist Committee, going so far as to claim it was a shadow government. After exposing Senator Havriso Looruya's Separatist ties, Farr was granted a position on the Loyalist Committee, an appointment that confused many members of the Senate. Despite the appointment, he continued to be critical of the Chancellor's handling of the Separatist Crisis, claiming that Palpatine was following his own agenda to the detriment of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the Separatist Crisis exploded into the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Emergency Powers granted to Palpatine resulted in the creation of the Grand Army of the Republic without the Military Creation Act ever coming to a vote. Farr was installed as the head of the Senate Action Subcommittee for Corellian Trade Spine Defense, a position he used for personal advancement. Around the beginning of the war, supplies en route to Farr's homeworld of Rodia became the repeated targets of pirates. After Rodia's pleas for assistance were consistently ignored by the Republic, Farr abandoned the Senate and joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In exchange for much-needed supplies, Separatist Council member Nute Gunray demanded that Farr aid him in capturing the Rodian's longtime friend, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo. Amidala came to Rodia in order to aid in the supply crisis, but was instead imprisoned by Farr and Gunray's battle-droid forces. After learning Gunray's plan to execute Amidala, Farr realized the error in his decision to join the Confederacy and turned on the Separatist leader. Farr then assisted Amidala and Representative Jar Jar Binks in arresting Gunray and turning him over to Republic forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the incident with Gunray, Farr rejoined the Senate. Shortly after, he and several other senators were taken hostage in the Republic Executive Building by a group of bounty hunters led by Cad Bane. Bane used his hostages as leverage when negotiating the release of the Hutt crime lord Ziro Desilijic Tiure, a Confederate ally who had been captured by the Republic earlier in the war. Bane accomplished his mission and escaped the Republic Executive Building before detonating a series of explosives intended to kill the hostage senators. Farr and the rest of the senators survived the assassination attempt through the efforts of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. In the wake of the attack, Farr returned to Rodia to find that the wildlife around a swamp on the planet was being killed. With the aid of Jedi Master Kit Fisto, he learned that the cause was a Confederate station under the command of Robonino, one of the bounty hunters who had aided Cad Bane on Coruscant. Later in the war, Farr vehemently opposed a proposal to increase clone trooper spending and increase the war effort. However, he was murdered through a poison put in his drink by his aide Lolo Purs, who wanted to punish him for bringing war to Rodia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Loyalist senator"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Onaconda Farr was a Rodian male from the planet of Rodia, and by 52 BBY, he represented Rodia in the Galactic Senate of the Republic. He held residences in both the Senatorial Palace on Rodia and the Rodian Consulate on Coruscant, the galactic capital and headquarters of the Senate. Senator Farr was a close family friend of Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who affectionately referred to him as \"Uncle Ono\" from the time when Farr was the biggest ally of Amidala's father, Ruwee Naberrie, in the Senate. He also had a brother and a sister."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 33 BBY, when the Yinchorri began a campaign to attack and conquer settlements near the planet of Yinchorr, Farr was a large supporter of Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum and his actions. Valorum sent a team of Jedi to Yinchorr to negotiate peace, but were only met with continued hostility, and a military garrison was later placed on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, Farr, along with Senators Tikkes of Dac and Mot-Not Rab of Tarnab, attended an unofficial audience organized by Senator Orn Free Taa of Ryloth. At that point, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum had just finished a crisis and was suddenly accused of corruption. Taa admitted to have delayed the accusation because the situation at that point would allow the Senate to oust and replace Valorum, which was Taa's goal. Neither Farr or Rab openly supported Taa's scheme at that point."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 24 BBY, a variety of planets and corporations began to withdraw from the Senate in protest of the growing power of the government, beginning the Separatist Crisis. Farr was very critical of then\u2013Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's handling of the crisis, often accusing him of following his own agenda to the detriment of the Republic. Because of the crisis, the Senate began to discuss the Military Creation Act, which would create an army for the Republic. During the discussion, Farr remained a Militarist, a proponent of the Act. The Rodian senator objected to Palpatine's attempts to negotiate directly with the leader of the Separatist Movement, Count Dooku, believing that the talks would accomplish nothing and blunt the Military Creation Act. Farr also expressed criticism when Palpatine created the Loyalist Committee, a ten-senator advisory body to the Supreme Chancellor that would also negotiate with the Separatists, saying that the body was made up of Palpatine's political allies and was another attempt to weaken the Military Creation Act. Later, when Palpatine and the Loyalist Committee formed the covert investigative agency known as the Senate Bureau of Intelligence, Farr once again criticized Palpatine, saying that the Chancellor was using the Committee and the bureau to increase his power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, to help promote his Militarist ideals, Senator Farr wrote and bankrolled the politically charged play The Trickery of Vosdia Nooma, produced by the Rodian government's Drama Council. Filled with allegory and symbolism, the play endorsed Farr's pro-military positions and a pro-Military Creation Act stance in particular. Farr himself had a cameo in the play, though drama editor Korvit Domesa of HoloNet News, who reviewed the play, believed this was a mistake that could hurt his platform. Domesa, however, still thought that the production would inspire discussion on both sides of the debate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, in a Senate session prior to the vote for the Act, Farr released a \"list of 245\" individuals within the Judicial and Legislative branches of the Galactic Republic he accused of Separatist ties, including Loyalist Committee member Havriso Looruya. Farr had received the information from a source he kept private from the judicial investigators, and the source was never identified by the officials. Though the Senate protested these accusations, the Judicial Department confirmed that the charge against Looruya was indeed legitimate, leading to Looruya's resignation from Senatorial office. Farr was elected to the Loyalist Committee in light of his recent success but was unable to celebrate, suffering a devastating personal loss when a house fire on Rodia killed both his brother and sister shortly before Farr was announced to the Loyalist Committee."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered a clone army\u2014commissioned by the long-dead Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas\u2014being built for the Republic on the world of Kamino. Kenobi also found evidence that the Separatists were building their own army on the planet of Geonosis. With the Senate still deadlocked over the Military Creation Act, emergency powers were given to Chancellor Palpatine, allowing him to activate the clone army to defend the Republic. Despite Farr's mistrust of Palpatine, he and the rest of the Loyalist Committee supported the emergency powers.

However, Rodia was left undefended, and its supply lanes were soon attacked by pirates, leaving the population deprived of food and other necessary materials. In response, Senator Farr returned to Rodia along with the Senate's Rodian delegation. At first, Ryloth Senator Orn Free Taa criticized Farr, saying that the delegations move back to Rodia was just a \"political move.\" It was later confirmed, though, that Rodia was actually experiencing pirate attacks. However, a Senatorial vote for a relief effort for Rodia was postponed, and Farr tried to contact his longtime family friend, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, but was unable to speak with her, as she was preoccupied with other business."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Rodia's people continued to starve, Farr turned to the Separatists, reluctantly making a deal with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. Gunray, who harbored a strong grudge against Amidala since his defeat at the Battle of Naboo, promised that Rodia would become a member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and would be given relief supplies in exchange for the capture of Senator Amidala. Farr was willing to give up Amidala to the Separatist, thinking that he could protect her after her capture. As soon as Amidala learned of the pirate attacks on Rodia, she traveled to Rodia to ensure the planet's loyalty to the Republic.

A squad of battle droids appeared and surrounded Amidala as Farr opened a hololink with Gunray, allowing Amidala and the viceroy to talk. Amidala attempted to contact C-3PO and Binks via comlink, but a B1-Series battle droid seized the device and destroyed it. As Amidala was escorted away, she warned Farr that he could not trust Gunray and that he had made a mistake by aligning with the Separatists.

The droid, assuming the humanoid was a Jedi, alerted Farr and Gunray about the pair. The viceroy ordered his droids to destroy the supposed \"Jedi\" as Farr and Silood stood back and watched. As the battle droids attacked, the \"Jedi\" escaped through a grate that led to the swamp underneath the compound, losing his robes in the process.
