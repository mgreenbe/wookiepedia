As of the Battle of Naboo, Sebolto had become a powerful crime lord, operating out of Malastare, and was a known death stick producer and distributor. The druglord and kingpin of the trafficking operation that ultimately bowed to Komari Vosa, leader of the Bando Gora cult, even wielded control over the Gran senator of Malastare, Ainlee Teem, a well as other politicians throughout the galaxy such as Connus Trell in Coruscant. Such power elevated Sebolto to King of the Dugs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sebolto's reach thus extended well beyond his homeworld. While the Dug also oversaw smuggling operations in the Gazzari Minor system, he lost a huge amount of credits when the trafficking was uncovered to the Republic Security Force by Bendix Fust and was stopped. When Sebolto learned of Fust's involvement, the incensed Dug placed a huge bounty of 50,000 credits on Fust's head, specifically requesting him to be delivered alive so Sebolto could kill him personally. The bounty was eventually collected by Zam Wesell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zam was not simply after credits, however, as she was working with fellow bounty hunter Jango Fett. On the trail of Komari Vosa, Fett discovered that Sebolto had links to the Hutts and Vosa's feared Force-worshiping cult, and the bounty hunter captured Fust to infiltrate Sebolto's Palace. While Zam kept Sebolto occupied, Jango fought his way through Sebolto's guards and eventually burst into the throne room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Confronted by one of the most lethal bounty hunters in the galaxy, the Dug's nerve failed and Sebolto attempted to flee. In his haste, Sebolto slid down a ramp leading to an escape route through his death stick plant. However, Sebolto failed to jump at the precise moment and slammed against the wall before plummeting to his death in a vat of boiling death stick chemicals, which Jango mused would be a \"sour batch.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sebolto was known to be ruthless, wanting people to suffer a slow and painful death. The bounties he posted showed that he wanted Bendix Fust alive so that he could kill him himself, also having the Mordageen tortured prior to execution.
