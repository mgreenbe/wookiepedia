A group of unreconstructed Imperials on their way to join the Imperial Remnant were attacked by a group of Yuuzhan Vong coralskippers, and their yachts were completely annihilated. When the forces of the privateer Urias Xhaxin arrived from hyperspace, intending to pick off the Imperials themselves, they were attacked by the coralskippers and forced to flee. Xhaxin was later picked up by the New Republic Defense Fleet's Admiral Traest Kre'fey and was pumped for information on the coralskippers, which were still largely unknown to the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
