Not knowing of the Imperial presence on the planet, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa were dispatched to the world to scout its potential as a new Rebel base. They learned of the Imperial presence just as an Imperial patrol came upon their landed ship, destroying it with proton grenades and dispatching all available forces to track the Rebels down. The pair spent much of that night and dawn the next morning evading an Imperial AT-AR, before being rescued by Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This planet was unnamed in the original comic.
