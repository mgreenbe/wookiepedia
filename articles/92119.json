The pistols were bulky, making them heavy and less portable than other smaller blaster pistols, but giving them more stopping power. Due to their weight they were rarely used as backup weapons, but many mercenaries favored them as primary weapons during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The pistol was considered rugged and dependable by its users and was fairly powerful for a blaster pistol, although not so much as a heavy blaster pistol. The pistol was built with a stun setting and a scope, the latter of which made it difficult to draw quickly from a holster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Model 80 was first shown in Dangerous Covenants a sourcebook released in 2014 for the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game produced by Fantasy Flight Games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
