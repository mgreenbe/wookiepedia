They were unarmed wedge-shaped vessels with two bubble-like cockpits, and were driven by two propellers. The transports could carry up to 15 individuals in the rearward bulge at a cost of 125 units of carbon and 15 units of nova crystals. They were produced at shipyards by the Bongomeken Collective around 3000 BBY during the War of the Gungan tribes. Over three-thousand years later, two transport ships escorted Boss Rugor Nass and other survivors from the Naboo Swamp Battle to the Gungan Sacred Place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gungan Transport Ships appear in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack.
