Following this attack, after they had secured the banner of Clan Cadera, Wynnward met with Heta Kol, Bask Sunn, and Tyrus Brokenblade. An argument broke out between Wynnward and Brokenblade but was quickly stopped by Kol when she pulled out a thermal detonator and threw it at Brokenblade. Brokenblade managed to catch and keep it from exploding, and was then stabbed twice by Kol as a demonstration of how they all relied on each other. Following this, Wynnward was dismissed to fulfill the orders given to him by Kol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
