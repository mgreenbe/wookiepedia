During that time, he served as a part time community police officer with the Coruscant Security Force. As the Coruscant Guard and stormtroopers took primacy in policing Coruscant, the CSF was given fewer resources to patrol the lower levels, a fact which frustrated Anskow. In 19 BBY, Anskow and his squad pulled over an individual who responded by attacking them with a lightsaber. The individual, who the police assumed to be a fugitive Jedi, fled and the squad chased him, eventually trapping him into a cantina on Coruscant's lower levels. Anskow called in for support and Squad 40, an Imperial Commando unit from the 501st Legion, was sent to assist. The commandos managed to enter the cantina and kill the individual. Upon investigation, the individual turned out to be nothing more than a common thief who came into possession of a lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anskow first appeared in Imperial Commando: 501st which was written by Karen Traviss and published on October 27, 2009."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
