Zone six was located next to zone five. During the Battle of Bothawui, an engagement of the Clone Wars between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and Galactic Republic, in 22 BBY, General Grievous led his Confederate fleet of Munificent-class star frigates through zone six to reach and attack Jedi General Anakin Skywalker's task force of Venator-class Star Destroyers. Aboard Skywalker's flagship, the Resolute, a clone trooper in Resolute command reported the Separatist fleet's movement while tracking them on a screen. Unknown to Grievous, Skywalker had allowed for the frigates to pass through zone six and beyond, as it meant the starships could be outmaneuvered by a force of All Terrain Tactical Enforcers that was hidden on surrounding asteroids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zone six appeared on a screen aboard the Resolute in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season One episode \"Downfall of a Droid,\" which first aired on November 7, 2008."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
