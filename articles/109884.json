It had a good balance of speed, weapons and durability, but lacked heavy armor or internal hull bracing, which often made it vulnerable to well-placed enemy hits. It had a slight advantage over the Headhunter with its ion cannons, and in the hands of expert pilots could pose a considerable threat even to newer starfighters, as was the case in the clash between the Rneekii pirates and the Galactic Empire at Kiilimaar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The craft featured a flat lifting body with a diamond-shaped nose.

This did not prevent the resource-strapped Rebellion from using the R-41 in early battles against the Empire's newer TIE Fighters, as evidenced in the Assault on Kamino. The R-41 seemed to disappear from the Rebel fleet once the X-wing became available. Cash-strapped Rebel cells were forced to use it, though."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the Galactic Civil War it was still found in the hands of third party organizations, such as Black Sun and pirates like the Rneekii, who preferred it because of its reliability, since regular maintenance was not often available for these groups."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The R-41 was the favorite ship of Abron Mar, lieutenant to the crime lord Takara.
