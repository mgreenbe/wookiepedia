Balmorra was a historically violent, yet ardently independent world that was renowned for its highly developed military manufacturing sector. This reputation, along with the world's strategic positioning, attracted the attention of the Sith upon their return to the known galaxy in 3681 BBY. Early in their war against the Republic, the Imperials resolved to take control of Balmorra's manufacturing capabilities, and so launched an invasion of the world that killed numerous citizens and displaced thousands of others as refugees. In response, the Balmorrans organized a resistance group to fight against the invaders and maintain their political independence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Recognizing the threat posed by a Sith-controlled Balmorra, the Galactic Republic dispatched military and Jedi forces to aid the Balmorran resistance. Although the relief effort was maintained for a length of time, the continuing war elsewhere in the galaxy forced Republic Military leaders to reassign the units that were fighting on the world. As their allies gradually pulled out of the conflict, the Balmorran freedom fighters were left to battle the Empire largely on their own\u2014a battle that resulted in the Empire gaining control of the planet's industries. Even as the Great Galactic War came to a close with the Treaty of Coruscant, the Resistance continued to fight the Sith, and even did so with the covert aid of an illegally operating Republic contingent. After several years of this guerrilla warfare, the Republic began to once again ramp up its military presence on Balmorra, thereby pushing the limits of the Treaty of Coruscant in an effort to free the world's workers from Sith servitude."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3681 BBY, the Sith Empire returned to the galaxy and began the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic. In the years before the war, the planet Balmorra was one of the galaxy's leading independent industrial worlds, producing weapons and droids in its many factories and manufacturing plants across the planet. A number of powerful corporations effectively controlled the planet, including the Okara Droid Company, Traken Industries, and Balmorran Arms, and Balmorra maintained a close relationship with the Republic but the planet's corporations kept the world largely independent of most galactic conflicts. Balmorra's government was a corporate-run oligarchic democracy that was centered in the capital city of Bin Prime. When the Great Galactic War started, the Republic offered ships and troops to protect Balmorra as its trading partner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Great Galactic War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime before 3670 BBY, the Empire set its sights on Balmorra, believing that the planet's proximity to the Core Worlds and its weapons production facilities were a major strategic resource. In an assault planned by Admiral Ivernus, the Empire began their assault by slicing and reprogramming the networked security systems of the planet's laboratories, factories, and weaponry, turning the planet's defenses against the people. These efforts included the release of a number of mutated Colicoids, an insectoid sentient species, from the genetic research facility Lab 352. Lab 352, which had been experimenting on Colicoids in hopes of turning them into bioweapons, was quickly overrun by the creatures when Imperial saboteurs released them from the facility, leading the area to become known as \"Bugtown.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial technicians infiltrated the automated Okara Droid Factory and uploaded a virus to the factory's computers in hopes of turning its droids\u2014some of the the finest military droids in the galaxy\u2014against the Balmorrans. However, the virus worked more than the Empire intended: the factory's defense systems and droids became independent, resuming production and attacking any biological life that approached the factory. With the orbital defense satellites and towers offline, the Empire then bombarded the surface, devastating Balmorra's military forces and its central government in order to forestall a unified response to their assault. The Empire soon landed a full invasion force, which prompted the Republic to come to the planet's aid and deploy the Republic Military there. The Balmorran Arms factory became a stronghold of resistance, as the Balmorrans turned the structure into a heavily-defended fortress that supplied the Republic and resistance forces with supplies and weaponry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bombardment destroyed also many of the waste-processing facilities on the planet, including the Traken-4 ChemWorks, and the system of underground sealed storage facilities for toxic materials known as hazard vaults. As a result, the toxic waste leaked out onto the surface in various regions, destroying wide swaths of land and damaging the environment. The mutated Colicoids from Bugtown quickly spread to other regions of Balmorra, particularly the hazard vaults and other sites of toxic waste. The bombardment also completely wiped out the Balmorran maweater, the primary predator of the flying wingmaw species\u2014causing the wingmaw population to rise rapidly in the years afterwards. As the invasion and then occupation progressed, wingmaws soon became threats to combatants and civilians on both sides of the conflict, as swarms of the carnivorous scavengers often attacked convoys and individual fighters across Balmorra."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their invasion, the Empire made an effort to preserve the corporate hierarchy on Balmorra, as they desired to put the planet's industrial facilities to use as part of the Imperial war machine. The Republic forces were aided by many native Balmorrans, including former members of the planet's army, but the battle was largely a stalemate for most of the Great Galactic War, though the Empire began to gain the upper hand as the war drew to a close. Several cities, including Sobrik\u2014which was the original capital of Balmorra and had been largely decimated by bombing runs during the battle\u2014continued to hold out against Imperial control for most of the invasion. A number of small factory towns across Balmorra were wiped out by the Empire during the invasion, including one near the Karill River. The area became known as Ghost Town as the resistance slowly retook the area and began launching guerrilla attacks on the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A side effect of the bombardment was the extinction of most of the bormus, slow-moving and peaceful herd creatures. Many bormus perished in the bombardment, and the toxic waste released during the assault poisoned many more of the creatures, leaving the bormu on the brink of extinction as they were now vulnerable to smaller predators. The zeldrate, a smaller creature that preyed on bormus prior to the invasion, began to target sentient beings in the absence of their favorite prey. Zeldrates were hunted prior to the Imperial invasion on account of a caustic chemical useful as an industrial cleaning solution that zeldrates secreted naturally, and with the Balmorran industry operating below half its typical capacity, the zeldrate population experienced a slight increase during the years of warfare that was balanced out by the rise in zeldrate deaths caused when the creatures attacked soldiers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3653 BBY, the Great Galactic War was brought to an end when the Empire sacked the Republic capital of Coruscant and held it captive to force the Republic into signing the Treaty of Coruscant. Per the terms of the Treaty, the forces of the Republic Military were to withdraw from every battlefield across the galaxy, including Balmorra. To the surprise and anger of the Balmorran people, the Republic Military was ordered to withdraw from Balmorra, and General Buryn and the other Republic officers began preparations for withdrawal. However, some refused to back down: the Jedi Knight Fortris Gall disobeyed Buryn's orders and departed Base 11A to rescue Demolitions Squad 419, which had been captured and was being imprisoned at the Troida Military Workshop."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gall infiltrated the workshop and, after defeating a Sith who tried to stop him, rescued Squad 419 and evacuated them back to Republic territory. Gall continued to battle the Empire despite orders to stand down, forcing Grand Master Zym of the Jedi Order to send Gall's former master Orgus Din and Lieutenant Harron Tavus of the Republic Special Forces Division to convince him to withdraw. Buryn's forces remained on-world to wait for Gall's return as the Empire's deadline for withdraw approached, and the Empire attacked when the deadline expired, trapping Buryn's forces on world. Din tracked down Gall as he was leading Republic forces against Imperial Forward Outpost XT-23, and though Gall was victorious, Din convinced him to depart Balmorra while Din stayed behind to enforce the Treaty."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Cold War"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Early years of occupation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the Treaty, the Empire declared victory on Balmorra and established its planetary headquarters in Sobrik, on account of the city's proximity to the Balmorran Arms Factory and the Okara Droid Factory and its resistance to Imperial invasion during the war. Imperial engineers rebuilt the city, though the outskirts of the city in the Gorinth Canyon remained in ruins, and they installed powerful defensive shields over Sobrik. In an effort to rebuild the planet's shattered industry, the Empire forcibly removed those corporate executives who refused to cooperate with the Empire and replaced them, turning the planet's corporations into Imperial puppets\u2014some of which were eager to cooperate with their new rulers. Corporate executive Brel Orus sold out almost immediately to the Empire, and he was rewarded with a comfortable position in the new government in Sobrik, overseeing the confiscation and storage of corporate technologies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the Empire's initial claim of victory, they soon found themselves under constant harassment from the resistance, and the Imperial presence quickly became understaffed and undersupplied as Imperial High Command focused on more pressing issues. By the end of the Cold War, Lysennius Melchiro was serving as the thirteenth governor of Balmorra since the initial bombardment decades earlier, and Balmorra had become a career quagmire or deathtrap for the Imperial officers and soldiers assigned there. In the absence of an official Republic presence, Balmorrans took it upon themselves to organize and train themselves in the resistance. The resistance soon developed into a formidable fighting force with superior knowledge of the terrain, and they waged an endless guerrilla war against their Imperial overlords. Other Balmorrans also rebelled: the Empire was confronted by rebellious citizens and factory foremen, saboteurs, assassins, and terrorist cells across the planet. In response, the Empire placed all regions of Balmorra that were under its control under a strict lockdown. Using a combination of military policing, curfews, and propaganda, they subjugated the Balmorran population throughout the Cold War, forcing all citizens to apply for official IDs\u2014a process that tests Imperial loyalty\u2014or else they would be arrested as rebel sympathizers. When the resistance attacked the Imperial infrastructure, the Empire regularly punished the families of resistance members and even the entire population in response."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Troida Military Workshop was soon put back into work, becoming a supply depot and weapons manufacturer for the Imperial forces at nearby Sobrik, and the workshop's overseers were expected to worry about Imperial concerns over their own profit. Troida's workers were known to harbor resistance sympathies throughout the occupation, and because of the strategic importance of its production, the caravans between Sobrik and Troida were frequently targeted by guerrilla resistance attacks. The Empire made repeated attempts to take control of the Okara Droid Factory, but their efforts met with little success for much of the invasion and occupation. The Balmorran Arms Factory, however, remained a stronghold of the resistance and their primary headquarters as it was transformed into a heavily-defended fortress and weapons supplier. Resistance scientists and engineers also began developing a planetary hyperspace beacon, which in theory would allow starships that tracked the signal to jump into the Balmorra system directly in Balmorra's orbit, above the factory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grand Marshal Cheketta of the Republic Army refused to retreat from Balmorra despite the Treaty, and he and the contingent of Republic troops and Jedi with him were declared rogue by the Republic in response. Throughout the Cold War, the resistance was aided by various offworld mercenaries, a group of whom were cyborgs and saw heavy fighting in the Gorinth Wilds region. The resistance also used stealth field generators to infiltrate Imperial outposts and assassinate their officers and soldiers, though the Empire was unable to locate the stealth fighters' camp. The remaining members of the government-in-exile, led by former trade secretary Tai Cordan, joined the Rift Alliance: a coalition of powerful and resource-rich worlds who were dissatisfied with the Republic's failures during the war. However, former Minister of Defense Vol Argen continued to support the resistance from off-planet, sending weapons, supplies, generators, and other resources to those fighting on Balmorra. Cordan also contributed to the cause, sending the freelance operative Giana Kayl with lists of major supply caches that were hidden before the occupation, but Kayl's ship Meridian Grace was shot down over Balmorra and the Empire recovered the lists from the ship's wreckage in the Gorinth Fields."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Imperial occupation progressed, the resistance continued to occupy Ghost Town, using the town's small gardens to supply food and the nearby caves to stage anti-aircraft attacks on Imperial starfighters. The resistance also set up a base in the ruins of the Traken-4 ChemWorks that they named Outpost Traken-4, though the outpost's fighters were regularly rotated to other parts of Balmorra in order to prevent long-term exposure to the chemical waste in the area. The paths between the toxic pools in the area formed natural choke points that were easily defensible by the resistance, as they Empire was unwilling to reach the camp without traveling along those paths between the pools. The resistance established a base their named Outpost Victory in a crater formd by the Imperial bombardment, and though it was originally a small outpost, it quickly developed into one of the Balmorrans' largest and most heavily-defended bases on the planet. Imperials who were captured by the resistance were imprisoned in the lower levels of Outpost Victory, and the Republic's few remaining forces\u2014including General Aakars and Marren Atma, the base's defense coordinator\u2014were headquartered in Outpost Victory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Imperial officer almost caused a diplomatic incident when the officer killed a delegate of the Chiss Ascendancy, an ally of the Empire, after an argument in the back rooms of Sobrik's Sunken Sarlacc cantina. However, Officer Breerdin moved quickly to contain the situation, sequestering the delegate's guards in the cantina back room and having a recording of the crime doctored to frame the resistance for the delegate's death.

Piloc was unable to convince Privates Ganbar, Erelut, and the others in his squad to try again, even after he shot Private Camm as motivation, so Piloc was forced to seek other help from Imperial forces in order to retrieve the plans."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Operation Breaking Point and the capture of Balmorran Arms"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Rigel of the Imperial Conquest Consolidation Corps and his second-in-command Lieutenant Davrill developed a plan they termed \"Operation Breaking Point\" to break Vol Argen's support of the resistance. The first phase of the plan saw Imperial forces attack the Neebray Warehouse in Gorinth Canyon to destroy the generators given to the resistance by Vol Argen, thereby cutting off power to their anti-aircraft emplacements in the area. In phase two, Lieutenant Thorpe at Markaran Imperial Outpost determined a way to use the technology of the cyborg mercenaries in the Gorinth Wilds against them, so Imperial forces scavenged the technology from the cyborgs after killing them, and they were able to push the mercenaries out of the region.
