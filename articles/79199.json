The Jawas had traveled across the Dune Sea desert in a sandcrawler and lined the wares they had for offer up along the side of the vehicle next to the homestead, where Owen Lars, the owner of the homestead, inspected them. Lars chose not to purchase LIN-V8K, instead selecting the protocol droid C-3PO and the R5 unit R5-D4, who had been positioned next to the LIN in the line. The R5 unit's motivator proved faulty however, and Lars quickly exchanged it for the astromech droid R2-D2. Imperial stormtroopers later killed the Jawas who owned LIN-V8K while trying to locate R2-D2 and C-3PO, leaving the sandcrawler to be later found by Lars' adopted son Luke Skywalker and the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.
