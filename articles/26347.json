Inspected by director George Lucas, he narrowed it down to two possible models. Asked for his opinion, Visual effects supervisor John Knoll preferred a different model, that looked similar to Besalisks, stating animation possibilities for its wattle. Lucas then suggested combining the ridges from the head of the model that would go on to be Chon Actrion, with the rest of the head of Knoll's preferred model. The Actrion model, along with several of the other unused sculpts, were then recycled into the Jedi Archives scene as busts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
