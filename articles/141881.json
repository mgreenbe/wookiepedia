He was present when K'Kruhk and the rest of the Soaring Hawkbat Clan crashed on the planet. While observing the refugee camp, he was approached by Captain Relik who expressed his hatred of the refugees settling on his planet. Teron reminded him that they were citizens of the Empire and deserved compassion and respect."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the local militia found out the Jedi had escaped from the refugee camp, they immediately started to search for them. Teron offered assistance, but Relik didn't want the interference. The Imperial officer became suspicious and requested additional support, including troops and gunships with scanning packages, but it was refused. Teron noticed Relik scrambling his troops. He asked about the deployment and Relik assured him it was just a training drill. Teron did not believe him, and had one of his sergeants connect him to Captain Denimoor on the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tenacious. The commander was able to convince Denimoor to deviate from his patrol and come to Arkinnea by reminding him of their service with K'Kruhk on Saleucami."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teron accompanied Denimoor to the site where the Arkinnea Militia were dumping refugees to their deaths in a ravine. During the course of his investigation, Teron discovered that some refugees had survived the militia's attacks, and located one of them\u2014his old commander, K'Kruhk. Teron volunteered not only to protect the Jedi Master and the younglings under his care, but also to use some of his income to purchase equipment and supplies for their outpost, helping to establish the Hidden Temple. Many years later, Teron did not show up as expected to deliver supplies. The Jedi feared him dead, and K'Kruhk vowed to always remember him and honor all that he had done for them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
