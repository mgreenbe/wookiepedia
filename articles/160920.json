When activated, a vid-vox scrambler generated a low-intensity comms-jamming field around itself, disrupting audio, video, and holographic recordings within its area of effect of around four meters. However, a conversation would remain unaffected by the jammer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scrambler was an excellent protector against spying, however particularly powerful recording devices or dedicated eavesdroppers could still pick up some parts of a private conversation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
