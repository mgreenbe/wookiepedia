Commanding a Separatist invasion force more than one million strong, the cunning financier-turned-warrior lays siege to the planet Praesitlyn, home of the strategic intergalactic communications center that is key to the Republic's survival in the Clone Wars.

All of Praesitlyn's defense force is destroyed by Tonith's forces comprising more than one million battle droids, but two of Praesitlyn's residents survive the onslaught: Odie Subu, a female soldier in General Khamar's Praesitlyn army, and Erk H'Arman, a pilot observing the surface of the planet, meet up together and lay low from Tonith's forces. As for Tonith himself, he captures the communications center, operated by the famous Reija Momen, and holds her and her employees hostage.

When Anakin is introduced to Grudo, Nejaa reveals to the Jedi Padawan that Grudo used to work for Zozridor Slayke, and that around a certain time in the past, earlier in the Clone Wars, Slayke was a rebel who decided to fight the Separatists in his own way and departing himself from the Republic due to its slow and political ways. Nejaa was sent by the Republic to track him down and arrest him, and on a certain planet, Nejaa happened to be following Slayke, the Jedi first met Grudo, and the two fought while Slayke got away.

Later in the rebellion's activities, Grudo and a few of Slayke's men find out that, without proper maintenance, the battle droids stationed on Praesitlyn will fail in time. After Grudo and the soldiers escape from a battle droid attack at night, Erk and Odie finally get out from beneath their bunker and Odie accidentally shoots Grudo in the head, mistaking him for an enemy. Eventually, the surviving soldiers bring Erk and Odie back to the rebellion, along with Grudo, and due to the wound he sustained, he dies from it, and Anakin is the last one Grudo talks to.

Unfortunately, Anakin is nearly driven to the dark side of the Force, driving him further to his destiny, after a battle droid kills Momen, whom Anakin feels a rapport with due to similarities between her and his mother.

However, before Anakin can kill either Tonith of any of his technicians, the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn contacts him and prevents him from killing Tonith or any of his group.
