They were more active in the galaxy in the years prior to the Mandalorian Wars. At this time, they were led by an overlord named Kraat, who was particularly nasty for his species. Kraat commanded a Dimean warship, and on one occasion overtook a starship containing two members of the Jedi Order\u2014Jolee Bindo and Andor Vex. Among the Jedi, Vex was believed to have a significant destiny to fulfill. Consequently, a mythos of perceived infallibility arose around him, and Vex himself soon began to believe in it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Dimean overlord hauled Vex and Bindo aboard his bridge for questioning, Vex demanded the Dimean release him, confident that his destiny would prevent him from dying here. Kraat reacted by crushing the man's throat and throwing him down a giant energy intake shaft. That inadvertently caused a reaction with the warship's reactor, setting off alarms and eventually causing the warship to explode. While Bindo escaped the starship, Kraat was killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The repercussions for Dimean society from that event were profound.
