Their disputes over commerce and resource-sharing were a common source of tension in their part of the Core Worlds. In 19 ABY, the Ishori refused to allow armed Diamalan vessels into their ports. An attempt by the Iphigini to resolve the dispute (with Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Luke Skywalker as mediators) was unsuccessful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their dispute with the Diamala soon became a flashpoint in a larger dispute in the New Republic over the Caamas Document. While the Diamala took a \"forgive and forget\" approach, Ishori Senator Ghic Dx'ono was one of the leading voices in favor of making the Bothans pay for their complicity in the destruction of Caamas. The apparent return of Grand Admiral Thrawn at the same time did not concern the leadership of the Ishori Confederene, many of whom suspected it to be some sort of Bothan plot. Despite their anti-Bothan stance, the Ishori fleet participated in the Battle of Bothawui against three Imperial Star Destroyers, as fleeing from an enemy that the Diamala stayed to fight would have been too great an embarrassment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Psychologically, Ishori had what some called a \"fight or think\" response.
