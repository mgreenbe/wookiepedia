Its surface was rocky, barren, and dusty. Wraith Squadron used the moon's surface as cover for their commandeered corvette Night Caller during the Battle of Ession by using tractor beams to raise a dust cloud for concealment from the Star Destroyer Implacable. A relay dish on the moon's surface was also used to jam the Star Destroyer's sensors. Implacable ultimately fell prey to the Wraiths' assault and crashed into the moon with heavy casualties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
