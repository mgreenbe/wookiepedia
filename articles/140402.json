As a result, Chester starved to death in the wake of the Sith bombardment. Many others in Khoonda considered him to be something of an idiot, and not that great a mechanic. He attempted to repair an old protocol droid salvaged from the Enclave for use as a greeter, however he did a poor job of it and it took Surik's own skill at repair to get it working properly again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Exile fixes the protocol droid and has it play a recording having to do with her, Tarn hears it and asks the Exile if he/she is a Jedi.
