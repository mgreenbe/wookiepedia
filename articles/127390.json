Some took the form of solid or semi-solid mattresses, or sleep mats, while others could mold themselves to the being who slept upon them and react to their movements. The sheets of a bed might be printed with elaborate designs, and children's bed linen often featured war heroes and villains of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
