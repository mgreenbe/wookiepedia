Each table had low-backed stools that could be adjusted for height. As many as five tables in any row could be slid together to accommodate a large party. The stools could be moved but could also be electronically held in place by the bartender, in case the patrons got rowdy and considered using the stools as weapons. Blowers and vacuums that could be controlled by the bartender or servers were built into the ceiling and tabletops."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
