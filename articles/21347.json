It was estimated that the bacterium sped up the reprocessing time by 30%, which Ton Phanan remarked was \"amazing.\" Unfortunately, if the bacterium entered into the digestive system of a live being, it produced side-effects akin to food-poisoning. Mos Eisley, on the planet Tatooine used a Bunkurd Sewer and Falynn Sandskimmer once contracted the illness. She remarked that she was as \"sick as a womp rat for a week.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet of Storinal suffered an outbreak of Bunkurd Sewer Disorder some time in or before 8 ABY and in order to manufacture a cure, some of the bacterium was stored in a hospital. Wraith Squadron who were then operating on Night Caller were going to rendezvous with the Hawkbat, a ship in Zsinj's employ. It was decided that the Hawkbat should be infected with a mysterious malady so the two crews would never meet face to face. Ton Phanan, Kell Tainer and Tyria Sarkin were sent to infiltrate Storinal and steal some culture. After Falynn's description, it was decided that Bunkurd Sewer Disorder fit the description nicely."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bacterium was put in the external air vents of the Hawkbat's shuttle and spread amongst the crew of the ship.
