He served as an admiral in the naval forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the galactic conflict. In 20 BBY, Ningo assumed the leadership of the Bulwark Fleet, an armada of Bulwark Mark I vessels that had been constructed by Techno Union engineers at the Foerost Shipyards, and used the warships to defeat the Republic blockade of Foerost. Following this historic victory, the admiral was tasked with conquering the Republic capital of Coruscant, destroying a series of Republic outposts in Sector Zero en route."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Recognizing the threat that Ningo posed, the Republic authorized the launch of the Victory-class Star Destroyer, a new warship design, six months prior to its scheduled debut in order to deal with the Bulwark Fleet. Two task forces of Victory-class Star Destroyers\u2014collectively known as the Victory Fleet\u2014were formed: one led by Captain Terrinald Screed and the other by Captain Jan Dodonna.

His campaign to capture Coruscant started with a historic victory at Foerost, where Ningo used the warships of the Bulwark Fleet to break through the Republic's blockade of the planet. The galactic government considered the admiral and his forces to be such a threat that it launched its new Victory-class Star Destroyers months in advance of their planned rollout to deal with the Bulwark Fleet and its commander. After several engagements with Screed's and Dodonna's forces, Ningo was finally killed in a sneak attack above Anaxes, although the engagement cost the Victory Fleet several vessels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dua Ningo and the Foerost campaign were created by Daniel Wallace for The New Essential Chronology, published in 2005."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
