In 4 ABY, after the Battle of Var-Shaa, the station was crewed by five Imperial cadets who had been sent to their post prior to passing their final examination and an Imperial officer. Two months after the station was captured from New Republic forces, an incident occurred where the station destroyed the Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier Exigent due to the New Republic targeting protocols never being erased from the station's targeting computer. After the Exigent was destroyed, TIE fighter pilots Shen and Havina Vonreg aggressively landed a TIE Reaper in the station's hangar, slightly damaging it, where they subsequently went to chastize the cadets for their mistake."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nuvar system defense station first appeared in the short story Count to Three."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
