After centuries of isolation in Ragnos' caverns, the Beast was ultimately slain by a rising star of the reconstituted Sith Empire who had entered the tomb as part of the Sith Academy's trials."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As its name implied, the Beast of Marka Ragnos once belonged to the Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos, who ruled over the Sith Empire for a standard century. The Beast was a giant terentatek, a species that had been created by the Nin\u00fbshwodzakut, a group of Sith priests who used manipulated breeding and alchemy to produce fearsome creatures. Legend held that Ragnos, despite considering the Beast his \"pet,\" used to beat it at night in order to increase its ill emotions. The same legend also reported that the Beast was only fed with blood between two periods of deprivation, which gave it an unquenchable thirst for more. By dint of torture, Ragnos' pet was ultimately turned into an embodiment of pure hatred. Since it had been altered by the Sith to be more brutal, the creature had become what was called a Sithspawn, and it pulsated with the darker aspects of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Ragnos died in the year 5000 BBY, the Beast was left to guard the burial chamber of its master, nestled in the Valley of the Dark Lords on the planet Korriban. For many centuries, the Beast of Marka Ragnos served its purpose, and no one who had seen it lived to tell the tale. Around 3643 BBY, toward the end of the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and a reconstituted Sith Empire, Overseer Tremel of the Korriban Sith Academy ordered a promising Sith Warrior to enter the tomb as a test of worth. Tremel advised his acolyte to hold nothing back, as he considered the creature to be \"doom itself.\" The Sith Warrior discovered the reliquary containing an ancient Sith carving that could summon the Beast and meditated around it for a moment, prompting the creature to appear. True to its mission, the Beast confronted the Sith Warrior but was ultimately slain. Since Ragnos' pet had been a great source of dark energy on the planet, its death caused a disturbance in the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all terentatek, the Beast of Marka Ragnos was a massive biped distinguished by its thick forearms, the spines growing from its back, and a pair of poisonous tusks.
