In the year 32 BBY, Sleg stood and spoke to a human in the streets of the Mos Espa spaceport on the planet Tatooine. He then began walking through the streets and passed a DK-1 Dark Eye probe droid that had been sent out by the Sith apprentice Darth Maul to search for Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of the planet Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounty hunter later attended the Boonta Eve Classic podracing event and sat in the stands at the Mos Espa Grand Arena, where each of the three laps of the race started and ended.

For the scene in the streets of Mos Espa, he was portrayed by Industrial Light & Magic digital effects artist Alex Lindsay, who in 1998 was brought to the Windward Stage and given what he describes as a \"scuba suit with helmet and accessories\". He was then filmed in the costume walking and talking with fellow digital effects artist Jonathan Rothbart, although Rothbart was then rotoscoped out of the shot so that Sleg seemed to be walking alone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lindsay says this was possibly because you could see to much of Rothbart's face. After filming the scene, Lindsay was asked to \"t-pose\" for photographs that could then be used to make an action figure, and ultimately one was released in 2009. He believes he was picked to portray the character simply because he was the right size for the suit, but did not get to keep the costume after filming and doubts it would have held up well. A separate actor portrayed Sleg viewing the podrace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the new Star Wars canon, Rum Sleg's name was used in the mobile card game Star Wars: Force Collection, which initially launched in 2013. Although the launch of Force Collection predates the Star Wars canon reset of 2014, Lucasfilm Story Group member Leland Chee confirmed that the game was kept updated to fit with canon. The character's name originated in the Boonta Eve Podrace expansion set of the Star Wars Legends Young Jedi Collectible Card Game, released by Decipher, Inc. in 2001. According to Decipher employee Chuck Kallenbach, Rum Sleg was named after a character that fellow Decipher employee Dan Bojanowski played in a Star Wars roleplaying game that Kallenbach ran. The character's catch phrase was \"Just Chill!\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
