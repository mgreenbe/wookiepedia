Afterwards, they were among dignitaries given an extensive tour of the station by its administrator, Shai Tennem. During the tour, the party encountered technicians Joss and Pikka Adren, who were hurriedly attempting to quietly locate a fault Pikka had discovered in the station's power systems. Tennem, unaware, attempted to rope the Adrens into joining the tour; however, Burryaga sensed their distress over the situation and informed Assek. She immediately suggested aloud that the Adrens be allowed to continue on with the important work they were doing, allowing the couple to locate and fix the problem before the Beacon could completely lose power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterwards, Assek and her apprentice were among many who departed the space station on the Republic cruiser Third Horizon. However, while the starship was in transit through hyperspace, a distress signal was picked up from the Hetzal system, causing the ship to divert to offer assistance. A rescue effort was formed from those onboard the Third Horizon, and Assek and Burryaga manned a two-seater Jedi Jedi Vector, with Assek piloting. The threat to the Hetzal system was comprised of large amounts of debris which had been flung out of hyperspace at great speeds and threatened all of the system's inhabited worlds. During the rescue effort, Assek and Burryaga teamed up with two other Vectors flown by Jedi Knights Mikkel Sutmani and Te'Ami, as well as a Longbeam flown by the Adrens, on an important task to destroy a chunk of debris heading for the main landmass of Hetzal Prime's Fruited Moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Te'Ami took charge of the mission, bringing the weapons systems of the four ships under her control, as the Jedi joined their minds together. However, Burryaga appeared to have trouble focusing, so Assek and the other Jedi let him out of the link so they could work. Just before they fired, however, Burryaga halted the attempt, and Assek translated her apprentice into Galactic Basic Standard as he explained that they could not fire upon the approaching debris because it was a piece of a starship with living beings still onboard. Te'Ami subsequently relayed the information to Avar Kriss, who was coordinating the system-wide effort."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nib Assek was a human female with grey hair, worn in braids.
