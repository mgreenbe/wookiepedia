Although by 3964 BBY the epic battles with the Sith had passed, the Galactic Republic, and the Navy that Veltraa served, found itself facing a new enemy when the Mandalorian warrior clans started a crusade against the Republic on the Outer Rim. As the Mandalorians began to threaten resource worlds near the ecumenopolis of Taris, the Navy formed a defensive cordon known as the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line. By then, Veltraa was in command of his own flagship, Reliance. Eventually, the line collapsed, and the Mandalorians broke out toward Taris after a diversionary attack on the planet Vanquo. Forced to choose between minding the frontier and the home front, Veltraa, alongside Admiral Noma Sommos, reacted by reforming the remnants of the Outer Rim fleets into a makeshift force protecting Taris. Although Veltraa held out in the face of the invaders, Reliance was destroyed in the Mandalorian attack on Taris, with all hands, including the admiral, lost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Veltraa was memorialized on the Republic capital of Coruscant and honored for his heroism, with Supreme Chancellor Tol Cressa giving a speech crediting Veltraa with delaying the Mandalorian siege. Although there was talk of renaming a new class of warship recently approved for construction at Corellia after Veltraa, the Chancellor supported keeping the original name, the Interdictor-class, which Veltraa had proposed. In the wake of Veltraa's death, newly promoted Admiral Saul Karath, who was not able to attend the Coruscant ceremony, sent a message honoring the late admiral and dedicated his next campaign against the invaders to Veltraa's memory. These events were described in an edition of The Admiral's List, the official publication of the Republic Navy, dedicated to Veltraa's memory. In addition, a Republic Hammerhead-class cruiser was named after the late admiral\u2014the Veltraa was ready for action by the next year, becoming the first command of Captain Dallan Morvis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After his death, Veltraa was renowned for his bravery and valor in combat, and his ability to effectively organize and command disparate forces in desperate times.
