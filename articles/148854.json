The Galactic Republic was strong armed into the treaty following the twenty-eight year conflict with the Sith Empire that saw the galactic government crumble under the pressures of war and economic struggles. In reality, the \"treaty\" functioned as more of an armistice, as, while peace technically existed between both governments, as the concept was more of a cessation of hostilities between the Republic and Empire. This armistice was first proposed by the Sith Dark Council, under the leadership of the Sith Emperor. Although wary of possible ulterior motives, the Republic's Galactic Senate accepted the offer out of desperation. The two governments organized a summit to take place on the Core World of Alderaan, where delegations from both factions would meet to deliberate the terms of peace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While representatives of the Empire and the Republic conferred, the Sith launched an unexpected assault on the Republic capital world of Coruscant. The Sacking of Coruscant placed the Republic's capital firmly under the control of the Sith Empire, and gave the Imperial delegation on Alderaan the leverage they needed in order to demand the Republic's surrender of the war. The leader of the Imperial delegation\u2014the Sith Lord Darth Baras\u2014authored the Treaty of Coruscant and presented it to the representatives of the Senate and the Jedi Order for their signatures. They signed the document, ending the Great Galactic War and declaring the Sith Empire as the victor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The treaty divided the galaxy in two and demanded that all Republic forces and Jedi withdraw from open conflict with the Empire and that the Senate cede a number of outlying worlds to the Sith. The agreement was heavily opposed by certain interests within the Republic, including Jedi Master Dar'Nala, General Elin Garza of the Republic Military, and the Royal House of Alderaan. Such opposition to the treaty led to the initiation of a galactic Cold War fought between the Republic and Empire both directly and by proxy.

The treaty established deadlines by which Republic forces and members of the Jedi Order were required to withdraw from battles against the Sith. If these deadlines were not met, Imperial forces were authorized to engage those forces of the Republic which were in violation of the treaty. Harsh restrictions were even placed on Republic personnel who were acting in compliance with the treaty. For instance, all Republic vessels were required to announce their arrival to the airspace above a planet to Imperial authorities. Furthermore, to ensure compliance with the various clauses of the document, the Empire included a provision that allowed them to assign protocol droids to shadow certain individuals within the Republic and remind them of the mandates of the Treaty of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The peace agreement also dictated that the Republic revoke the membership of a number of outlying worlds, thereby denying them the protection benefits that came with a seat in the Galactic Senate. Additionally, the Sith Dark Council also demanded that the Republic turn over seven star systems that were largely uninhabited and strategically unimportant. Other than the cessation of open warfare, the treaty only benefited the Republic in that it called for an end to the Empire's assault and occupation of Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Republic.

These Sith were the surviving legacy of the ancient regime that had been defeated by the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order thousands of years prior in the Great Hyperspace War. Led by the Dark Lord of the Sith known as the Sith Emperor, the Empire revealed itself to the Republic and immediately opened hostilities, sparking a galactic conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After capturing the Tingel Arm in a successful campaign early in the war, the Empire moved to secure the rest of the Outer Rim Territories. As world after world fell to the onslaught of the Sith, the Galactic Senate of the Republic was deadlocked on how to proceed with the defense of the galaxy. That slow response resulted in numerous victories for the Sith, including their seizure of the Aparo sector and their victory at Korriban. The Republic continued to suffer heavily as the Empire targeted key supply sources, such as the Sluis Van Shipyards, which were destroyed, and the Rimma Trade Route, which was blockaded. As the Senate worked to prioritize the Republic's defenses, many worlds were left wholly unprotected. The representatives of these planets blatantly refused to take part in further debate, instead choosing to leave the Senate to its crippling deliberations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire secured the Outer Rim with the capture of the Seswenna sector in 3671 BBY and began plans to stab inwards towards the galactic core. However, after suffering dual defeats at Bothawui, the Sith were forced from the Mid Rim and put on the defensive. The Republic's victories lasted a short time, however, as the Emperor changed strategies and put in motion a plan to secure the Mandalorians as allies in the war against the Republic. Imperial Intelligence agents sponsored the rise of a new Mandalorian leader who would later become known as Mandalore the Lesser. This Mandalore galvanized his people and led them to create a blockade of the Hydian Way\u2014the Republic's primary trade route and means of transporting military wares. The blockade crippled the Republic economy, which had been in the grips of a downturn since the start of the war. Although it was eventually broken by the Mirialan Hylo Visz and her band of smugglers, the blockade of the Hydian Way had already caused irreversible damage for the Republic."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Meeting on Alderaan and the attack on Coruscant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The conflict continued for several years with the Sith continually gaining more ground. Although they appeared to be on the verge of total victory, the Imperials suffered serious losses during the attempted conquest of the Core World of Alderaan and Darth Mekhis's efforts to secure Rhen Var. In response to those Republic victories, as well as the loss of the Hydian Way, the Imperials extended an offer of peace in 3653 BBY, shocking the galaxy. The Dark Council of the Sith contacted the Galactic Senate and expressed its interest in ending the war, proposing that the two governments send delegations to represent the interests of their people in a peace conference on Alderaan. In addition, the Empire began to downgrade the scale of its assault, ending their offensive in the Minos Cluster and scaling back operations on Dantooine. The Republic was still hesitant to accept the offer and was advised to use caution when dealing with the Sith by the Jedi Council, but desperation eventually pushed the leaders of the Senate to agree to the proposal and make plans for the conference."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their convincing facade of sincerity, the Sith were in fact using the conference as a distraction from their ultimate objective\u2014the capture of the Republic's capital world, Coruscant. While Lords Angral, Malgus, and Adraas prepared to lead the attack on the planet, Lord Baras led the Imperial peace delegation to Alderaan, where they met the Republic delegation led by the Cerean Senator Paran Am-Ris. The Senator was accompanied by two representatives of the Jedi Order, Jedi Master Dar'Nala and Jedi Knight Satele Shan. As the parties began their negotiations, Angral, Malgus, and Adraas launched their attack on Coruscant.

Although Dar'Nala and Shan both argued against giving in to Imperial demands, Senator Am-Ris and Jedi Grand Master Zym agreed that they had to accept the Empire's terms if they wished to save Coruscant. The next day, Baras presented the Republic delegation with the Treaty of Coruscant, which the Sith Lord himself had authored. Senator Am-Ris signed the treaty, ending the war and placing the Empire firmly in the position of victor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A fragile peace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pursuant to the mandates of the Treaty of Coruscant, the Republic and Empire ended open conflict. Control of Coruscant was handed back to the Republic, which was now being led by Paran Am-Ris as interim Supreme Chancellor. Republic military forces were gradually recalled from battlefronts across the galaxy, while Jedi were assigned to oversee the troop withdrawals. Two Jedi assigned to the task were Dar'Nala and Satele Shan, who were being watched over by the Imperial protocol droid SP-99. Dar'Nala was radically opposed to the treaty, and nearly restarted the Great War by manipulating Republic and Sith agents in her quest to kill Lord Baras for creating the Treaty. The rogue Jedi Master gathered together a cabal of like-minded individuals within the Republic and Jedi Order, and together the group committed acts of terrorism throughout the galaxy. She orchestrated a skirmish in the Kuat sector, feigned her own death, and organized a bombing of the Senate Tower in order to kill politicians who supported the treaty. Dar'Nala's plot was ultimately foiled by Baras and Shan. After the death of the Togruta Jedi Master, her co-conspirators disbanded and much of the violence throughout the Republic subsided."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other early threats to the peace agreement included the Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer, who travelled to Coruscant while it was still occupied in an effort to avenge her Master, Ven Zallow. Zallow had been murdered in the Jedi Temple by Darth Malgus, who also ultimately came to be a threat to the Treaty's regime. The Sith Lord believed himself destined to destroy the Republic in its entirety, and saw the accords on Alderaan to be a perversion of the Empire's truest purpose\u2014to make war. The Jedi Order avoided disaster with Leneer by disowning her before she was able to reach the planet; Malgus saw it as a betrayal not unlike the one he felt he had suffered at the hands of an Empire now focused on peace. As such, the Sith Lord defeated the Jedi but allowed her to go free. He later began a personal crusade against the Sith politicians who supported the Treaty of Coruscant while simultaneously building his own power base in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although they were still officially allied against the Republic, the Mandalorians and the Empire essentially ended their partnership when the treaty was signed. The Hutts meanwhile found the new political tension in the galaxy to be ideal conditions for the growth of their own interests and cartels.

Xandret fled pursuit alongside a number of other discontent Imperial citizens, and together they formed a colony on the uninhabited planet Sebaddon, far above the galactic disc. Her colony grew in its technological abilities until around ten years after the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant. That year, Lema Xandret attempted to forge a partnership with the Mandalorians against the Empire, so as to eventually exact revenge against the Sith that had taken her daughter from her. Xandret sent Mandalore a small droid factory that could produce nearly invincible automatons as a sample of the powers at her command. After failing to hear from the warrior-king, Xandret dispatched the starship Cinzia to make contact, but the crew failed in its mission and the wreckage of the ship was collected by the Hutt-employed smuggler Jet Nebula. The droids that remained on Sebaddon, which were created to protect a clone of Lema Xandret's daughter, saw the attempt to contact outsiders as a threat to their mission. In response, the droids killed Xandret and the rest of the colonists and began replicating at a prolific speed, intending to one day to grow to such strength that they could eliminate everyone in the galaxy in order to protect Xandret's cloned daughter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several weeks later, Imperial and Republic delegates were called to the independent world of Nal Hutta by the Hutt matriarch Tassaa Bareesh to partake in an auction of two items found in the wreckage from the Cinzia. The first was a navcomputer that would supposedly lead its owner back to the planet of the ship's origin. The second item was a mysterious container that was comprised of rare metals and an unidentified organic substance. Unbeknown to the auctioneers, the container was a droid factory created by Lema Xandret. To the Empire and Republic, the navcomputer represented a new, resource-rich world that could be annexed into their respective governments and added to each party's growing war machine. To the Jedi, the mysterious container was the priority: they believed it could be an artifact of great importance to the Order, or a weapon that had to be kept out of Sith hands. To the Sith, the navcomputer represented an opportunity to finally locate and punish Xandret for her transgressions fifteen years prior. Although Bareesh expected to conduct a clean and legitimate sale, both the Republic and Empire sent agents to ensure that they would be the auction's victor and obtain the items."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire was represented by Envoy Ia Nirvin, who was accompanied to Hutta by the Sith apprentice Eldon Ax, daughter of Lema Xandret. Ax was the pupil of Darth Chratis, who planned for Nirvin to partake in the auction while Ax broke into Tassaa Bareesh's vaults and stole the navcomputer. The Republic delegation to Hutta was lead by Envoy Ula Vii, a functionary serving under Supreme Commander Stantorrs who was in fact an Imperial Agent working covertly to further the goals of his Sith masters. Unknown to Vii, the Jedi had also sent an agent, Padawan Shigar Konshi, who was joined by former Republic trooper Larin Moxla. All of the participants in the auction were manipulated into participating through the actions of Dao Stryver, a Mandalorian who was working on behalf of the Mandalore to eliminate a threat growing on Sebaddon. While Ax attempted to steal the navcomputer, she was interrupted by Konshi, who had come to steal the container. The two were then beset upon by Stryver, who had also come for the navcomputer. The three battled in the vault anteroom before they were attacked by a squad of nearly invincible droids that were produced by Xandret's factory. The combatants destroyed the droids and fled the palace, leaving to hunt down the source of the factory. The Sith and the Jedi each independently learned the location of Sebaddon and rushed to reach and secure the world before their opponents could mobilize. Satele Shan\u2014now the Jedi Grand Master\u2014organized a task force to travel to Sebaddon and attempt to convince the colonists to join the Republic. The task force was quickly attacked by the uncooperative droids that were now running the world and suffered massive damage to their fleet when the planet launched thousands of the droids into orbit to combat the warships. During the fighting, Imperial forces under the command of Darth Chratis and Eldon Ax arrived to force the colonists to yield to the Empire's demands, but their fleet was also nearly destroyed. Both the Republic and Imperial forces were driven away from Sebaddon, forced to withdraw from proximity to the planet in order to avoid the droids that were forming orbital defenses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While both factions tried to formulate individual plans of attack, representatives from the two fleets were summoned to Sebaddon's moon by Dao Stryver, who had arrived prior to both the Republic and Empire. Before an audience consisting of Shan, Konshi, Moxla, Vii, Ax, and Jet Nebula, Stryver explained her findings regarding the Sebaddon colony and Lema Xandret's attempts to form an alliance with the Mandalorians. She further asserted that the droids' programming and ability to self-replicate posed a serious threat to the galaxy, as their numbers would soon become overwhelming. In a surprising show of cooperation, both parties at Stryver's briefing agreed that such an outcome was unacceptable, and so agreed to work together temporarily to halt the production of Sebaddon droids. The joint mission was commanded by Ula Vii, and was ultimately a success, despite witnessing the death of Eldon Ax's clone, Darth Chratis, and a large number of soldiers fighting for both sides. When the droids were finally destroyed, Jet Nebula used his droid companion Clunker to wipe the memory banks of both the Imperial and Republic fleets before fleeing the scene. The joint task force quickly devolved into chaos and opened fire on one another, sparking a short battle before both were forced to retreat. Although reinforcements had joined the conflict, it was eventually surrendered by both parties, as Sebaddon's orbit around the black hole had been disturbed during the fighting. The planet fell into the singularity in a matter of days, leaving no trace of the droids or Xandret's machinations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The affair proved to be a major test of the Treaty of Coruscant, as both the Republic and Empire engaged in activities that violated its terms.

Others were consumed by their duty to ensure the Republic's adherence to the treaty mandates, while still others outright ignored the call for peace and continued the war, both covertly and overtly.

During the invasion, the Imperial forces took the Royal family hostage and killed many Alderaanians, but were ultimately defeated by a Republic and Jedi task force. In the aftermath of the battle, the Alderaanian Royal Family advocated for aggressive military action against the Empire, which would eventually come into direct conflict with the mandates of the treaty. Upon hearing the announcement that peace had been established with the Sith, the Crown Prince stormed out of the Senate in a rage, declaring his world an independent system. The people of Alderaan had mixed reactions to their planet's secession, leading to a political uproar that resulted in the assassination of the prince.

Other planets did not choose to leave the Republic, but were forced out. The Treaty of Coruscant dictated that the Senate rescind the membership of several outlying worlds, including Bothawui and Rodia.

Imperial forces re-engaged his men, pushing Buryn to pursue counterattacks. The general and his men were eventually pulled off the world, but the Republic left behind a small force in order to aid the Balmorran resistance.
