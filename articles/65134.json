Upon learning that the recently-discovered planet Voss was inhabited by the Force-sensitive Voss species, who had powerful foresight abilities, the Sith Emperor ordered the Imperial Military to conquer the planet. General Khypes arrived in orbit with a battlecruiser and several army divisions in order to demand a surrender, having been alerted that the Voss capital of Voss-Ka was undefended. However, Khypes' cruiser exploded before he could contact the planet, and the ship's escorts were destroyed moments later. During this time, the agents of the Emperor's Hand kidnapped a Voss from the surface for the Emperor's own purposes. Realizing that they had underestimated the Voss, the Empire declared that Khypes had gone rogue, and both the Empire and the Republic began making diplomatic overtures to the Voss. The Jedi Council declined to assist in the negotiations, perceiving the Mystics to be \"grey Force-users\", who don't believe in light and dark sides of the Force, and that they have more in common with the Sith in being rulers of their society."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Attack on Voss was first mentioned on the official site of the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, and it was given a name and further background in the game itself and The Old Republic's in-game Codex."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
