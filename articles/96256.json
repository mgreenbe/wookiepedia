During the pursuit of the Millennium Falcon, the freighter at one point outmaneuvered the Avenger and caused it to almost collide with another pursuing Star Destroyer. The Avenger chased the Falcon into the Hoth asteroid field, where the fugitive ship evaded the Star Destroyer by unknowingly taking cover in the mouth of a space slug housed in one of the asteroids. The Avenger traveled into the asteroid field to search for the Falcon, where it suffered significant damage. Eventually, the Millennium Falcon reappeared, and was spotted by the Avenger. Needa had a priority signal sent to Darth Vader's flagship, the Super Star Destroyer Executor, with the message that the Falcon was about to be captured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nemet was working in the crewpits of the Avenger's command bridge when the warship pursued the fugitive Falcon into the neighboring Anoat system. The freighter charged the bridge, setting off alarms throughout the Avenger. Nemet, along with Needa and the rest of the command crew, dove for cover before the Falcon veered away at the last moment, and seemingly disappeared from the Star Destroyer's sensors. Unbeknownst to Needa and his crew, the Millennium Falcon simply landed on a blind spot of the Avenger's conning tower. Nemet attempted to track the Falcon on his scopes, but was unable to locate it. He reported to Needa that the Falcon was not visible on the Star Destroyer's sensors, and Needa dismissed the idea that the freighter could have disappeared, dispelling the idea that a ship that size could have a cloaking device, to which Nemet replied there was no trace of the Falcon. Seconds later, communications officer M'Kae reported that Lord Vader demanded an update on the pursuit of the Millennium Falcon. Needa decided to personally apologize to the Dark Lord for the failure, and ordered a TIE/sh VIP shuttle to be prepared for his visit to the Executor. Needa gave one last request for his crew to continue their search for the Falcon, before traveling to the Executor to rendezvous with Vader, who ultimately executed the captain for his failure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like many Imperials, Nemet was fiercely competitive. When he spotted the Millennium Falcon heading directly towards the Avenger's bridge, Nemet panicked and reported that the Star Destroyer was going to collide with the freighter. The commander took cover along with Captain Needa and the rest of the command crew when the Falcon flew towards the bridge.

In the film, the character was only credited as one of the \"Other Officers,\" portrayed by Mark Jones. Toward the end of the film, footage from the Avenger scene was reused during the Executor's attempt to capture the Millennium Falcon following its escape from the Imperial-occupied planet Bespin. Because of that, Mark Jones and other extras portraying the command crew of the Avenger are visible during that scene aboard the Executor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1997, Nemet was first given a name and brief backstory in a card for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game's \"Dagobah Limited\" expansion set."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inconsistencies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In several adaptations of The Empire Strikes Back, Nemet's lines regarding the Millennium Falcon differ from the film. In the novelization, in addition to having a different line, his dialogue with Needa is expanded to him also suggesting the only logical explanation was that the Falcon went into light-speed, which contradicts with what is seen in The Empire Strikes Back film. A similar line about the freighter going into light-speed is given to him in Marvel Comics' Star Wars 42. The film's junior novelization also indicates that Needa turned and gave Nemet the order to track the Millennium Falcon immediately after its maneuver against the Avenger; however the film shows Needa speaking with his first officer. Additionally, the novelization, Storybook, and Marvel comic have the line \"We're going to collide!\" as the Millennium Falcon charges the Avenger's bridge, though each adaptation assigns it to a different character. While the novelization presents Commander Nemet as having the line, the Storybook gives the line to Captain Needa himself, and the comic depicts Needa's first officer as the speaker. This article assumes Nemet having the line in the novelization is the canon version of events."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Possible appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the non-canon comic Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back 1, during the Millennium Falcon's escape from Hoth, it charges a Star Destroyer's command bridge, before landing on its conning tower and drifting away along with the garbage disposed by the Star Destroyer in a scene practically identical to the freighter's maneuver against the Avenger from The Empire Strikes Back. In that scene, a black-uniformed Imperial officer in the command bridge's crewpits\u2014whose uniform differs from Nemet's gray uniform\u2014has a similar role in informing the ship's captain that the Falcon has disappeared from the Star Destroyer's scopes and that there is no trace of the freighter. However, neither the Star Destroyer nor the captain were named in the comic, and thus it is unclear whether Nemet was the aforementioned officer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
