It was mounted on a droid and would perform as a regular sensor, but could be detached and sent to scout an area remotely. It normally could be deployed for 30 minutes before needing to be recharged. Remote Viewers were frequently used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
