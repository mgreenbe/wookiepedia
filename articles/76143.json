Tormented by his status as a cyborg\u2014he was known for his hatred of mechanicals\u2014Valance had become obsessed with an unnamed \"farmboy who had played a crucial part in the rescue of Alderaanian Princess Leia Organa from Imperial captivity. Valance's hatred wasn't political: rather, he despised the lad for his friendship with two droids. As Valance continued his spiral into madness, he led his crew in a campaign across the Outer Rim on the Kill Switch, embarking on a series of increasingly more violent missions. This culminated in Valance's brutal raid on the unarmed, officially neutral medical facility known as Anglebay Station on Telos IV in 0 ABY. Valance's attack on Anglebay Station slaughtered everyone within the hospital and completely destroyed the facility before he and his hunters returned to the Kill Switch and left as suddenly as they arrived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although many of Valance's crew saw the raid as senseless, it did uncover one valuable piece of information: one of the Kill Switch's crew, Remel Fud, overheard the babblings of an elderly patient that pointed them in the direction of well-known smuggler Han Solo, a known associate of Valance's \"farmboy.\" An ensuing investigation led Valance to believe that his quarry\u2014a young man named Luke Skywalker\u2014could be found on the agrarian Outer Rim planet Aduba-3, and the Kill Switch immediately made haste to the farmworld. Upon arriving at Aduba-3, however, they found that some of Solo's friends were waiting for them: the Kill Switch was met above the planet by the Lepi smuggler Jaxxon and his running partner Amaiza Foxtrain in Jaxxon's ship Rabbit's Foot. Valance immediately recognized that the freighter was making a run on the Kill Switch and quickly ordered his crew to fully activate the ship's shields, saving the ship. The Kill Switch promptly pounded the Rabbit's Foot with its laser cannons and disabled the ship, sending it crashing to the planet below. Valance and his crew followed, only to immediately walk into a trap: once they left the ship, Jaxxon and his compatriots stampeded a herd of banthas, which trampled most of Valance's men. Valance survived to discover that the \"farmboy\" they were defending wasn't the target he was looking for, and after a long laugh, Valance returned to his ship and swiftly resumed his search across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Valance's pursuit eventually led him to the Outer Rim world Feriae Junction. Valance had little linking his quarry to the world except intuition: many hyperlanes crossed at Feriae Junction, and Valance hoped that the ongoing Imperial blockade of the Rebel-held Yavin system could lead Skywalker to the trading post. By this point, Valance was alone, living on the Kill Switch and surviving by hunting local bounties. Valance's hunch was proven true after several weeks, when a contact tipped the hunter off that he had seen Skywalker on the planet. Valance swiftly tracked Skywalker to a scrap yard, only to ultimately let the Rebel leave after his droid, C-3PO, stepped in to save his life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kill Switch was originally owned an operated by the Sikurdian pirate Alabar Double Ax, before it was taken and renamed by bounty hunter Beilert Valance.

Valance populated the Kill Switch with a crew full of hardened killers, including his feared first mate Slssk, a Hutlarian former gladiator.
