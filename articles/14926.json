Stele engaged the first squad of T-wings from Gotmilc Squadron, but his wingman developed \"problems\" that were brief. Then 4 Stormtrooper transports Lucthz were the next group of enemies that Stele and his wingman destroyed to defend the conveyor. Lastly, two more squads of T-wings Gotan Squadron and Notow Squadron engaged Stele and his wingman but were both destroyed. The Conveyor reached a safe distance and escaped the area into Hyperspace. The TIE Defenders now finished with the cargo containers turned their attention to Stele and his wingman, who decided it was best to pull out as they were outclassed and outnumbered, encouraged Stele to do the same."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack was everything the Empire feared. They now knew of Ali Tarrak's intentions through the crew and personnel on the Ulzepdi. Fortunately Admiral Thrawn had developed a new starfighter, the Missile Boat, to counter this serious threat and informed Emperor Palpatine of its completion. Palpatine promised that Thrawn will be well rewarded if these starfighters proved themselves by eliminating Zaarin.
