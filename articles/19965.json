Nak conspired to depose his boss, Moff Nile Owen, and replace him with Braig. To do so, Nak arranged the abduction of artist Crying Dawn Singer by pirate Yearo Seville as a charade. Owen believed he would be the public rescuer of the singer; however, Nak ordered Seville to deliver the hostage to Braig, so that Braig could get the credit. Owen discovered the truth, executed Nak and attacked Narg with his military forces. At the same time, members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic also attempted a rescue.
