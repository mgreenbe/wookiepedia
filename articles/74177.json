Karka, along with his brother Traest Kre'fey, would follow in his grandfather's footsteps in serving with the New Republic. The Kre'fey family reputation was strongly damaged by the First Battle of Borleias, a devastating loss for the New Republic thanks in part to poor planning and tactical errors by Laryn Kre'fey, who died during the battle. Karka Kre'fey adamantly denied any allegations of wrongdoing by his grandfather and vehemently defended his family's honor. During a party, Kre'fey confronted Rogue Squadron pilot Gavin Darklighter over his claims about Laryn Kre'fey's mistakes.

Karka possessed a strong sense of honor and pride regarding his family, especially for Laryn Kre'fey, the highest ranking Bothan in the New Republic Army and arguably the most celebrated Bothan military leader of his time. Karka and his brother would both follow in the footsteps of their grandfather by joining the New Republic military; Karka wore a black uniform that contrasted with his creamy white fur and golden eyes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 6.5 ABY, Laryn Kre'fey planned and orchestrated the First Battle of Borleias, a New Republic effort to capture Borleias, a strategically significant planet in the Pyria system. The New Republic hoped to use the planet as a launching pad for an eventual assault on Imperial-controlled Coruscant. The battle proved to be an overwhelming loss for the New Republic forces, which was partially attributed to Laryn's alleged poor planning and tactical errors, which left the New Republic forces unprepared for secret defense measures implemented by Imperial General Evir Derricote. The Bothan general died in the assault, and the Kre'fey family reputation suffered greatly as a result of the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karka Kre'fey refused to believe the allegations against his grandfather and vehemently defended both Laryn and the Kre'fey name in general, on at least one occasion resorting to force in attempts to defend the family's honor. During a lavish party on a skyhook hosted by wealthy Bothan Liska Dan'kre, Karka Kre'fey spotted Gavin Darklighter, a pilot with Rogue Squadron who participated in the Borleias battle. Karka, who had been socializing with two fellow Bothan subordinates, confronted Darklighter and asked whether he believed the claims about his grandfather's alleged mistakes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Darklighter responded affirmatively, Kre'fey slapped him across the left cheek without warning, catching the pilot off-guard and nearly knocking him down. Kre'fey challenged Darklighter to a duel for besmirching Laryn Kre'fey's name and sullying the honor of the Kre'fey family. Darkfighter, inwardly citing a new sense of discipline he learned from the squadron, refused to fight. Darklighter instead offered a handshake to Karka Kre'fey, which the Bothan rejected. Most present at the party believed Darklighter proved himself to be the better man in the encounter, which angered Kre'fey more than losing a fight would have. Had Darklighter accepted the duel, his chances of defeating Kre'fey would have been good due to his military training."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karka Kre'fey was a male Bothan with creamy white fur and golden eyes typical of members of the Kre'fey family. Apart from their different colored eyes, he bore a striking resemblance to his brother, Traest Kre'fey, as well as his grandfather Laryn Kre'fey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like many Bothans, Karka Kre'fey possessed a very strong sense of pride in his species, himself and his family honor. He was embarrassed by the shame brought onto his family by Laryn Kre'fey's failure at the First Battle of Borleias, and was so headstrong and adamant about defending his family that he provoked at least one confrontation about the matter. Kre'fey was willing to resort to physical violence even when faced with a physically stronger opponent better trained in the art of hand-to-hand combat, like Rogue Squadron pilot Gavin Darklighter. Although he described courage and honor as important convictions for himself, Karka Kre'fey sometimes demonstrated behavior that contradicted those virtues, such as his unprovoked attack against Darklighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karka Kre'fey was created by Michael A.
