Emitting a strong blast when used to strike a target, they were usually set to stun and incapacitate rather than maim. Largely used by law enforcement personnel and guards, the grip was located in the middle of the weapon and the butt of the stick was often placed on the ground and carried like a walking stick. The butt of the staff was weighted for use as a one-handed weapon, while the longer end was used for striking."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
