During the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic operated a stronghold on the planet, which was attacked by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. According to legend, the tactical droid who General Grievous placed in charge of the attack calculated that their general's plan would cause the unnecessary loss of many battle droids due to the planet's dangerous terrain. As a result, the tactical droid, refusing to let any more droids get destroyed for no reason, disobeyed its orders, sending their forces into a safer region. Because of the droids' location, the Republic anticipated the attack and were ready to defend their stronghold. The tactical droid's modified plans caused the Separatists to lose the battle, but droid losses had been minimized."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
