They settled on the world around 3000 BBY. The fact that they were widely ignored by the galactic community, even during times of crisis, left them with a distrust of whichever government was in power. This distrust led to an open rebellion when the Jabiimi Loyalists aided the Republic forces and let them land on Jabiim. Then the Jabiimi Nationalists chose to aid the Confederacy in what would be known as the conquest of Jabiim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
