She informed her superiors that they lost communication with the squad of battle droids dispatched to ensure the Jedi were destroyed (under the belief that they dioxis gas killed them), before sealing the bridge at Gunray's command.

After Anakin Skywalker destroyed the ship's main reactor with two proton torpedoes and set off a chain reaction, How made her soon-to-be final damage report to Dofine, who dismissed it as \"impossible\" and that a starfighter could never have penetrated the ship's deflector shields. How was later killed, along with her Captain and cohorts inside the ship, when the chain reaction triggered by the main reactor's destruction caused the control computer console to explode in front of the crew, just as the bridge was incinerated by the explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A female Neimoidian, Tey How had mottled gray skin and red eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "How had audio and visual mechanics surgically implanted to assist her in shipboard operations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally created for the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, Tey How was voiced by Amanda Lucas (credited as Tyger) and an uncredited Marc Silk, aboard the Saak'ak and Vuutun Palaa respectively. As a result, Decipher's Star Wars Customizable Card Game erroneously identified Silk's character as a separate Neimoidian known as Sil Unch, even though the screenplay had assigned his dialogue to How. However, Leland Chee considered this an error and How became the pilot of both ships as was originally intended, while Unch was retconned into a separate Neimoidian seen on the left of both vessels' bridges."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Secrets of Naboo provided Tey How as an example of a Neimoidian name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Episode I \u2014 The Phantom Menace 1, How does not speak, with all of her dialogue having either been cut or reassigned to different characters.

This continued in Star Wars: Episode I \u2014 The Phantom Menace 4, where the Vuutun Palaa's imminent destruction was instead reported by a Daultay Dofine-lookalike.
