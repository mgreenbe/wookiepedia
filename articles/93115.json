She became a professional athlete and toured the galaxy where she witnessed the Galactic Empire's action enough to become sympathetic to the Rebellion. She used the contacts she gained as an athlete to move into business and in a couple of years she was an accountant for Incom Corporation. After the Battle of Yavin, Incom had been taken over by the Galactic Empire but Faenarm realized that by getting inside the power structure of the corporation she could get information on new ships, technology, and Imperial military strategies. She was able to pass this information along to the Rebellion by sending information and credits through a series of anonymous dummy accounts she had set up."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Faenarm was a Human female. She was a cautious and thorough operative and was smart enough to utilize the rampant corporate paranoia as a way to gather information.
