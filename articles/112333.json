They had a long body, the front end of which featured two eyes and a beak, with which the reap screeched when attacking foes. The reap also had a dark two-pronged organ located at the back end of their body, from which it extruded elastic, white-colored fibre that could entrap members of another species, such as the sentient Ewok and Gupin. Reaps were known to eat Gupins, having completely enveloped the young Gupin Oobel in their fibre when they planned to have him for dinner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Gupin Mring-Mring went missing, a group of Ewoks consisting of Kneesaa, Paploo, Wicket, and Teebo, stumbled upon a reap's nest as they searched for the lost Gupin. Agitating a group of reaps, Paploo and Wicket were captured by the reaps and taken to their fibre-built nest that imprisoned Mring-Mring, though Kneesaa and Teebo utilized a fallen tree branch to pull at the reaps' nest, building up force that released their three trapped friends from the reaps' dead forest when they let go of the branch. With their companions freed, Kneesaa and Teebo evaded further attacks from the reaps, quickly making their escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
