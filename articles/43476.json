The fighter craft of the unit were painted white and marked with Black Sun's logo on the wing panels. The veteran smugglers and pirates that made up the squadron were proud to be flying for the most feared crime syndicate in the galaxy. Consisting entirely of the best ace pilots in the organization, members were occasionally selected from Black Sun Squadron based on how effective their ruthless tactics were."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
