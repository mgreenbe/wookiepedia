As training sessions continued at the Shadow Academy, Brakiss considered shutting down the camp on Dathomir, as it was failing to produce any strong new students. Around this time, Brakiss discovered an elderly TIE pilot named Qorl who had been trapped on Yavin 4 for over 23 years and had only just recently escaped after having his TIE fighter repaired by students at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy.

There they discovered three Jedi trainees: Jacen and Jaina Solo and the Wookiee Lowbacca. All three were stunned by stormtroopers under Tamith Kai's command and brought on board an Imperial shuttle.

The Shadow Academy's stormtroopers were able to stun the Wookiee, and Brakiss ordered them to be confined to their quarters. Although discouraged by their refusal to cooperate, the potential power of the kidnapped students inspired Brakiss to continue attempting to turn them. He ordered Tamith Kai to work with Lowbacca, while he would personally attend to the training of the Solo twins, while keeping all three isolated from one another. To seduce the Solos, Brakiss offered them access to previously forbidden teachings, such as training with a lightsaber. Brakiss brought Jacen into a hologram training facility, and although the young Jedi refused to fight, Brakiss warned that he might sneak real creatures into the facility. Worried by the threats, Jacen attacked and killed an Abyssin hologram, pleasing Brakiss. The same training was forced upon Jaina at a different time, but she quickly tired of the exercises, refusing to participate any further. However, Brakiss promised that she would be allowed to see her friends if she continued, and in the next hologram encounter, he forced her to combat her own brother by overlaying holograms over their bodies, disguising both twins as Darth Vader. Brakiss watched the fight alongside Qorl, who questioned the wisdom of having the twins fight a potentially deadly duel. However, Brakiss assured him that he knew what he was doing, and he disabled the hologram projector, dismaying the twins, who were shocked by how they had been manipulated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eager to continue the training, Brakiss agreed to let the Solos and Lowbacca work together during future lessons. Brakiss prepared an exercise in which a series of objects, ranging from hard balls, to rocks, and eventually knives, would be thrown at Jacen and Jaina while Lowbacca would be forced to guide remotes to protect them. The Solos were equipped with sticks and blindfolded, forced to rely only on the Force and their friend to dodge the projectiles. Brakiss hoped that the difficulty and danger of the exercise would force the young Jedi to tap into the dark side of the Force to succeed. However, Lowbacca succeeded in sabotaging the computer that was controlling the projectiles, rescuing his friends. Tamith Kai was enraged over Lowbacca's tactics, but Brakiss praised the Wookiee for his ingenuity, proclaiming that he would be a fine addition to the ranks of the Empire. Suitably impressed with how the three Jedi had performed during his tests, Brakiss orchestrated plans for another kidnapping attempt at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 to take further recruits for the Shadow Academy. Brakiss sent his plans for a second kidnapping attempt to the Imperial leader, who quickly approved the mission. However, that night, the Jedi orchestrated an escape from the Shadow Academy after Jacen used a corusca gem to cut himself out of his room and free his friends.

Although Brakiss was prepared to fight his former teacher, the Shadow Chaser opened fire on a nearby panel, closing blast doors which cut them off from one another. Brakiss raced back to the control room, only to find Qorl watching the Shadow Chaser escape.

While the cloaked Shadow Academy was stationed above Coruscant, Brakiss' forces raided orphan populations to find individuals that wouldn't be missed. During one of these raids, Tamith Kai kidnapped an orphan friend of the Solos, Zekk, after determining that he was talented in the Force with a Force detector. Zekk was brought to the Shadow Academy, and Brakiss personally convinced the young man of his potential and of how it could be best developed under his tutelage. Although Zekk attempted to argue with Brakiss, the resentment that Zekk felt towards the Solos and Skywalker for not recognizing his abilities allowed Brakiss to convince the young man to train at his academy.
