In 9 ABY, the gunship known as the Razor Crest was directed to land in bay three-five and upon the vessel landing, Motto's three DUM-series pit droids gathered their tools and approached the ship to see what repair work was needed. The ship's owner, the bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian, emerged and scared off the droids by firing a blaster bolt at them.

Motto and the Mandalorian rushed to check if Grogu was alright, but discovered it had crawled away to safety behind some crates. After she cradled the infant and soothed it after all the excitement, the Mandalorian paid her with what credits Calican had been carrying.

Motto expressed her pleasure at seeing Grogu and warned her droids not to go near Djarin's ship. However, when Djarin admitted his ship needed a once-over, Motto let her droids have at it. Djarin said that he was here on business, asking Motto for directions to Mos Pelgo. After seeing Grogu one more time, she directed the astromech droid R5-D4 to show Djarin an old planetary map of Tatooine where she indicated where Mos Pelgo used to be.

He entered Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, where he met with Motto, who was in the middle of a sabacc game with \"Doctor Mandible.\" Motto noticed Djarin carrying a set of Mandalorian armor, snidely inquiring whether or not Djarin had met with the Mandalorian he sought and killed him. Djarin told her that he had simply acquired the armor from its owner by helping him kill a Krayt Dragon. Dr. Mandible, hearing the conversation told Motto that he knew a contact who could help Djarin on his quest to find Mandalorians. Motto, translating for Mandible, told Djarin to cover Mandible's call in the game in return for the information. Djarin gave Mandible 500 credits, and Motto assured him that Mandible was on a \"hot streak.\" Motto won the game with an Idiot's Array, but Mandible kept his word and told Motto about the contact, who he said would rendezvous with Motto and Djarin at the hangar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Motto and Djarin met at the hangar soon afterward, where Motto had a Treadwell droid cook the Krayt Dragon meat Djarin had brought with him.

Djarin asked whether or not the covert was part of the Tribe that left Nevarro, but Motto did not know. She added that it wouldn't cost Djarin anything, but he would have to give the contact passage to the system without hyperdrive. Djarin protested that traveling sub-light was too dangerous and called off the deal, but Motto vouched for the contact, the \"Frog Lady,\" who had entered the hangar. Translating for the Frog Lady, Motto told Djarin how the only cargo would be the Frog Lady and her spawn, adding that entering hyperspace would kill her eggs. Djarin, still unsure, asked whether or not the Frog Lady was sure that there were Mandalorians at their destination, though all Motto was told was that the Frog Lady's husband had seen them.

Despite relying on her droids to help her she was willing to take on any job herself for an additional fee.

She was additionally a skilled translator, able to speak and understand multiple different languages, including Galactic Basic Standard and Frog. During her second encounter with the Mandalorian, she translated both Dr. Mandible and the Frog Lady for him, although she was prone to paraphrasing their words.

Motto scolded him for leaving it alone and warned that he needed to improve his parenting skills. She initially thought of the Mandalorian as a \"womp rat,\" but complimented his strategy during the fight with Calican. After the fight she feared for Grogu's safety, and was relieved to see them unharmed. During her second encounter with the Mandalorian, Motto excitedly said that she was glad Grogu was doing well, jokingly asking if she could purchase them.
