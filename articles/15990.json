The Jedi Council agreed to send acting Grand Master Kenth Hamner's assistant, Kani Asari, out to negotiate. When she appeared at the entrance to the Jedi Temple, however, Rhal noted that she was neither Saar nor Altamik, and shot her on the spot, killing her. Rhal once again showed his ruthlessness when he was deployed to Blaudu Sextus covertly by Daala to suppress the rebellion of the Octusi there. After mercilessly killing the Octusi elders, Rhal concentrated his fire on Madhi Vaandt, killing her. He was later knocked unconscious and captured by Sothais Saar who turned him in to the authorities on Blaudu Sextus. Leia Organa Solo later remarked that the Blaudu Sextus leaders would have no choice but to prosecute him, otherwise it would appear that they approved of his crimes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
