In the year 84 BBY, Gaitag oversaw the construction of a luxury space station in the Besh Gorgon system. The station was known as the Wheel, and was built by Bolzi Design & Transmogrification, an Ugor architectural firm. Following the station's completion, it swiftly became one of the galaxy's premier gambling dens while Gaitag served as its first administrator. The Qiraash eventually sold the station to the J'feh crime lord Skijid Vrescot, who hoped to use the station to distribute Tirefin spice. During his life Gaitag fathered at least one child and eventually became a grandfather, with his granddaughter Qimberly Gaitag-Delio growing up to become a celebrity attorney."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Doffen Gaitag was first mentioned in Viva Space Vegas!
