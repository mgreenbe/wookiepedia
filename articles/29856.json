The company was founded by a former Corellian Engineering Corporation (CEC) executive one millennium before the outbreak of the Great Sith War. Corellia StarDrive was well known for both its civilian and military vehicles; many warships of the Republic Navy were designed by the company around 4000 BBY. This supremacy would not last long; the whole of the company's senior design team was killed in a freak shuttle crash. Corellia StarDrive never fully recovered from the loss and was subsequently bought by CEC. It was the parent company of Akin-Dower."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic War, the Sith Empire invaded Corellia.
