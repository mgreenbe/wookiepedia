It was used by Quarrie in his Prototype B6 starfighter with one cannon mounted at each of the two S-foils and one under the cockpit. They were part of the composite-beam laser weapon. Also, the SW-5 was utilized by some Koensayr BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bombers as a twin turret mounted behind the cockpit. Some BTL-A4s used SW-4 ion cannons instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
