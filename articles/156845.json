He hired pirates, led by the Dashades Maliss and Sorath, to crew the station. The crew used the station's hyperdrive to travel to star systems near the Kurost transfer point, where starships would be stolen under the pretense of gralloc attacks and taken to the way station. The station came under attack by the Grysks, who killed Maliss and eighteen of the crew, capturing the survivors. Upon investigating the gralloc attacks, Grand Admiral Thrawn discovered the way station and its dead crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Equipped with hyperdrive and thrusters, the station was not a fixed orbit post, but more like the kind of portable survey labs the Republic had used during the height of its expansion phase. Sampling nozzles, sensor clusters, drive flares and the telltale vents and power cables of a hyperdrive could be seen along its hull. A pair of docking collars were fitted on opposite sides allowing for expedited off-loading of cargo from one ship and transfer to another, with sorting and repackaging facilities aboard the station itself. It was the sort of thing Commodore Karyn Faro had seen used by smugglers, pirates, rebels and contraband dealers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
