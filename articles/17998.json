He was a veteran of more than forty years of racing, and could always be seen wearing a full-face helmet. This led to many speculations about his gender and species, although it was generally thought that he was a male Human. After retiring from his racing career, Pinnix founded \"The Pits\", a restaurant complex that catered to swoop racers on Stend IV. Pinnix could often be found striding through The Pits with his expensive racing gear, and zipping around in his ebony swoop, the Black Raptor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A popular racer yet none have seen his face, Blizz was both a legend and a mystery. He was undefeated on the Black Raptor and even after retiring would occasionally enter and win a race. Blizz won a race while Cohden K'Reye, a Corellian gambler, was in the stands watching. Cohden was so impressed by the speed and skill of Blizz that he dubbed blizz unbeatable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He founded and  decorated a restaurant called \"The Pits\" with all the trophies and awards he had won over four decades of racing. He named the race track outside of his restaurant \"Raptor Run\", after his bike. He also employed Chugg, a former speeder racer, as his bouncer. The adjoining building, Kuda's Compound was owned by Kaylo NaKuda. Blizz was unaware of the corruption and slaver that Kaylo supported, and would not have tolerated that in his restaurant if he had been aware."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blizz had mastered the art of racing swoops, and his familiarity with riding on the Black Raptor pushed his talents to legendary levels. Given the strength of his skills and the speed of his swoop, there wasn't a question of why he was undefeated. He dabbled in business and kept his ear to the streets to stay informed about the latest swoop racer gossip. Finally, he had decent skills with the blaster in a general terms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blizz Pinnix was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy, a supplement for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997.
