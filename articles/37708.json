Above in the balcony, Admiral Rampart conveys the Galactic Empire's displeasure that the Twi'leks are troubled by the Imperial presence despite an Imperial doonium refinery which will bring jobs to the citizens. Senator Orn Free Taa claims that the Twi'leks welcome the partnership, and asks Eleni Syndulla if she agrees."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eleni replies that she will always support what helps Ryloth. Senator Taa turns his attention to General Cham Syndulla, asking if he shares his wife's outlook. Cham says that after years of fighting, peace is needed.

A blue-skinned Twi'lek woman shouts that they want General Syndulla, which distresses the Imperials and Senator Taa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the urging of the crowd, Cham moves to speak, saying he understand their uneasiness. Cham says that the one thing they have done as a people is to stand together to defend Ryloth. When the Clone Wars began and the Galactic Republic was losing, they were on their own.

Cham reminds him that they agreed to disband when the time came, asking what the point of fighting was if they cannot accept peace.
