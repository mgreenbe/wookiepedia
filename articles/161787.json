The virus caused painful bony growths to sprout from the skin. It didn't affect any Yuuzhan Vong or the Jedi - which made it look like they had organized it. The growing tension eventually led to the start of Sith\u2013Imperial War and the shift of power in galactic society due to the fall of the Galactic Alliance and the rise of the Fel Empire to dominance, albeit a short-lived one. Many infected Vongspawns were left across the galaxy as the result of the plague."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
