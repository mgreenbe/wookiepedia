Despite this, Vardias knew his troubles were not yet over. He knew that the Chonar and the Dim-U would simply send another bounty hunter when they learned of Jinsari's demise. In order to calm down the Dim-U, Vardias had a talented artist sculpt a bantha statue out of a piece of kiliad marble. He tasked the spacer who had helped him earlier with deliving the bantha statue to Chonar, with the hope that they would forgive and forget the killing of the bantha. The spacer agreed, and sought out to find Chonar who was just outside of Anchorhead. When Chonar received the statue, he told the spacer that the statue conveyed the respect for the majestic banthas, and informed the spacer that the Dim-U would no longer pursue Vardias Tyne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brother Chonar was a Non-Player Character (NPC) in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies.
