In Coruscant's distant history, the Gree had a hand in building some of Coruscant's infrastructure, so at some point during the Cold War the Galactic Senate reached out to the Gree for aid. Isolationists, the Gree themselves did not come. Instead, the Gree Enclave sent droid representatives to aid in the rebuilding efforts. These representatives included Pat-aK, the lead ambassador droid assigned to work with Senator Oranda, Hib-R-ak, the subordinate droid responsible for the waste processing system, In-iK, the droid responsible for the power systems, and Nam-aK, the droid assigned to the hydrosupply."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially, the Gree droids had difficulty communicating with their Human collaborators due to their tendency to fall back on Gree speech patterns when their Basic speech programming was insufficient to convey their ideas. An agent of the Galactic Republic who had traveled to Coruscant on other business happened upon Oranda and Pat-aK attempting and failing a conversation and was able to discern much more about Pat-aK's troubles than Oranda was. The Republic agent was able to determine that Pat-aK's subordinates had fallen under attack by hostile forces who had taken control of various sections of Coruscant's lower levels, interrupting the repair work. The Republic agent needed to access these areas anyway in the course of their other business, and so they agreed to take on some jobs for Pat-aK and Oranda to help repair Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nam-aK was the first of the subordinate droids to whom Pat-aK sent the Republic agent, designated in the Gree language as a \"black bisector.\" Nam-aK had been assigned to repair Coruscant's water processing systems, but Pat-aK did not inform Nam-aK that the systems were in Black Sun territory. Nam-aK built a set of repair parts he called his \"crafted solution\" to fix the water processing systems, but due to Black Sun attacks he had been unable to install it. He barely escaped back to the Gree base in the Senate Building, bringing his crafted solution with him. When the black bisector came to help, Nam-aK gave them the crafted solution and warned them to deactivate the nearby flow valves before attempting to install it or the water pressure would cause a lethal explosion. He also emphatically warned the Republic agent about the Black Sun aggressors, or \"green perpendiculars,\" who would certainly attack the black bisector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic agent was able to install the crafted solution, eliminated at least a dozen Black Sun green perpendiculars, and provided credits to some young orphans who were relying on the leaks in the water system for survival so they could leave the area and stop interfering with its operation. Nam-aK rewarded the black bisector with a reward of credits and a trinket of Gree technology and sent them on to Hib-R-ak to assist him in repairing the waste processing systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nam-aK and the other Gree droid ambassadors were largely similar to basic model protocol droids, but were somewhat dissimilar in their programming. These droids spoke some Basic but fell back on Gree speech patterns of colors and geometry when trying to explain concepts that they were unable to enunciate otherwise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nam-aK appears only in the Star Wars: The Old Republic mission \"Gree: Hydrosupply Leak\" on Coruscant. The mission is only available to Republic players, but any class can participate. The mission has only minor differences in light side/dark side dialogue and bonus mission completion. This article assumes 100% completion and a light side path. If the bonus mission is not complete, the player does not kill at least 12 Black Sun agents. If the dark side path is chosen, the player chooses not to assist the orphans who use the hydrosupply station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
