They were most notoriously known for producing the Providence-class Dreadnought. The QFD was primarily comprised of Quarrens, a species native to the planet Dac, who had allied themselves with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. They had a partnership with Pammant Docks, and factories located on the planet of the same name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Quarren official Tikkes represented the QFD in the Confederacy. Five years after the Clone Wars conclusion, a modified warship attacked Sentinel Base, a remote Imperial outpost. Scans revealed that some components of the ship were from the Invincible and the Lucid Voice, Providence-class cruiser-carriers manufactured by the Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps.
