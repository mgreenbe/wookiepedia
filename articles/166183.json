While Grace Command was officially a mercy organization which fought the Sith warlords and distributed food supplies to civilians, its real mission was to disseminate the narcotic Deluge in Sith-occupied worlds. Yades and his fellow Devils attacked one of the Hutt crimelord Zodoh's Stormdriver ships during the Battle of Capital Cay in 1032 BBY. Following the liberation of Capital Cay, Yades rotated with the crew of the transport ship Mother Grace in order to allow the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt to borrow his Fire Lotus-class starfighter. Yades' decision saved his life since his entire squadron with the exception of their Captain Jenn Devaad were killed by Zodoh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
