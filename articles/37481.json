The cataclysm was theorized to have been caused by a shipyard's main reactor failing, igniting a hypermatter stockpile that destroyed the planet. One remnant of the planet, designated PM-1203, was the original site of Fort Anaxes, a military installation used by the Galactic Republic during the Battle of Anaxes during the Clone Wars that miraculously survived the cataclysm. Following this event, the facility became a fuel depot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
