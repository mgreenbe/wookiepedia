It only came above ground to feed or defend its tunnel network. Since the creature was blind, it had an amazing sense of smell and could feel the vibrations of any creature close to it. The Ardan resistance encountered a Tunneling Garrix when they arrived on Jagomir, but were able to fend off the mighty creature due to the fact that the creature was cowardly, and would flee if it took too much damage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
