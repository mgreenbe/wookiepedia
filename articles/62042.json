Rebel prisoners managed to steal a copy of the Death Star plans and beam it to a Rebel cell stationed at a base on Polis Massa. These plans would be transferred to a holodisc, and this holodisc would play a key role during the subsequent Imperial raid on Polis Massa. When Imperial forces stormed a command room located further in the base, they retrieved the holodisc. After returning it to a captured communications center, they were forced to hold off Rebel forces for a couple minutes as the computer needed time to uplink the data to the Imperial network. During this, the Empire discovered that this holodisc was a decoy, but it did lead Darth Vader to the whereabouts of the plans, which were now in the custody of Princess Leia Organa aboard the Tantive IV."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
