Before the Jedi Civil War, no one was able to see these creatures, but after Darth Malak's bombardment, bogstalkers appeared again on the planet's devastated surface. They survived for hundreds of years beneath Taris's sprawling undercity and, during the Cold War, they could be seen flying around the planet's toxic swamps. After its \"rebirth\", the pollution from Taris's destroyed industries made the bogstalker more resilient and mutated its flesh, making it poisonous to most predators, even the voracious rakghouls."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
