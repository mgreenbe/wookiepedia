Sent back to the Republic as advance agents, the newly anointed Dark Lords of the Sith Darth Revan and Darth Malak broke free of the Emperor's mental control and established their own empire with the Star Forge, an ancient space station of great power that had been built by the Rakata species. Using the Star Forge to construct a military fleet and weapons, Revan and Malak waged war against the Republic in the resultant Jedi Civil War.

However, when the group was captured by Malak, Revan's true identity was revealed and Shan was captured, forcing Revan and his crew to find the final Map and locate the Star Forge on their own.

The Jedi Master Kreia claimed to have been his first teacher in the ways of the Force. Regardless of the truth of her statement, the Human was trained along with a fellow student named Alek on both the planet Coruscant and at the Jedi Enclave on the planet Dantooine.

Ferroh's entire species had vanished from their homeworld ten years prior, and the Revanchist\u2014believing that the Mandalorians were responsible\u2014began showing other Jedi the abandoned world in order to convince them that the Mandalorians needed to be stopped. He and Alek were on Cathar when Mandalorian forces under the command of their leader Mandalore the Ultimate attacked the planet Serroco.

However, in the midst of the discussion, the Revanchist discovered a Mandalorian mask underfoot. When he picked it up, the entire group of Jedi was enveloped in a Force vision of the past: hundreds of Cathar were storming toward the nearby beach, pursued by a swarm of Mandalorians led by Mandalore's lieutenant Cassus Fett.

Fett saluted her efforts before authorizing his warships to fire away, thus killing the female Mandalorian and all of the Cathar. It was that woman's mask that the Revanchist had found, and after being inspired by her sacrifice, he placed the mask on his face.

Officially, they still denounced Revan's actions as unwise and too hasty, and continued to dissuade the rest of the Order from joining Revan's cause. In reality, the Mandalorians' own actions made it impossible for them to stand in the way of Revan's cause. However, Revan came up with a solution that would appease the Council and allow him to respond to the growing public clamoring for the Jedi to take action. Inspired by an initiative from the days of the Great Sith War thirty years earlier that had allowed civilian healers to work with the military, he proposed that the Revanchists be deputized into the Republic Military as a Mercy Corps. The Council grudgingly agreed to Revan's request, and the newly formed Mercy Corps was placed directly under his command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the following weeks, the Revanchist Jedi joined the Republic Military in battling the Mandalorians openly.

While Revan had a keen military mind and knew that the Republic's industrial might was the key to victory, many of his victories were the result of his sacrificing resources and territory in order to gain an advantage. \"Moral shortcuts\" became common under Revan and Malak's leadership, and the two Jedi developed a cold and calculating disposition unlike that of a Jedi; they matched the Mandalorians' brutal tactics with tactics just as merciless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during the next two years, Revan and Malak uncovered an ancient ruin of the Rakata species near the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, and after undergoing a series of tests at the hands of the droid guardians, the two were given access to the inner chambers.

There, Revan freed a group of slaves who were about to be sold on the slave market\u2014among them a young Force-sensitive Cathar named Juhani. Inspired by Revan's heroism, Juhani was encouraged by one of Revan's compatriots to join the Jedi Order. Not long afterward, Malak and Revan were defeated by the Mandalorian commander Cassus Fett at the star cluster Jaga's Cluster, and Revan then ordered a large part of his forces under now-General Meetra Surik to attack the Mandalorian strongholds on Onderon and Dxun.

By 3960 BBY, Revan had begun to use a lightsaber of a blue color, and he had ordered the construction of a superweapon known as the Mass Shadow Generator, which had been designed by the Zabrak engineer Bao-Dur. The Mass Shadow Generator served as the centerpiece of an elaborate trap in the Malachor system, where he hoped to lure the Mandalorians into a final confrontation that would end the conflict. He placed General Surik in command of half of the Republic fleet to serve as bait to draw the Mandalorians into the range of the Mass Shadow Generator, while the rest of the fleet under Revan would launch an assault on Mandalore's flagship.

The Sith had convinced Mandalore to help him uncover a Sith tomb on the ice world of Rekkiad before he influenced the warrior into attacking the Republic, and Mandalore gave Revan Rekkiad's coordinates in order to prove he was telling the truth just before he died.

Revan and Surik both watched in horror as most of the Mandalorian fleet and a large number of Republic vessels were drawn toward the planet into a massive gravity vortex. Countless ships were pulled from orbit and slammed into Malachor V's crust, crushing them and fracturing the planet to its very core.

As the two became Sith Lords, Revan continued to employ HK-47 to assassinate Republic political figures, but when Revan was betrayed by Malak, HK-47 fell into the hands of a string of various owners\u2014many of whom ended up dead. When Revan finally rediscovered the droid on Tatooine, HK-47's master was a different man, and because of a damaged memory core, the droid did not recognize Revan as his creator. However, when Revan's identity was revealed by Malak, HK-47's programming unlocked his hidden memories, and he recognized Revan as his maker. When asked by Revan, HK-47 considered the Jedi's new personality to be different in some ways but largely the same as before Revan's mindwipe, and the droid believed that Revan's concern for life and willingness to protect other beings was in fact an inherent trait that Revan had possessed all along. HK-47 remained steadfastly loyal to Revan even after the Jedi Civil War, and he set out on his own to locate his missing creator when Revan disappeared in 3954 BBY\u2014and after traveling with Meetra Surik during the rise of the Sith Triumvirate, HK-47 once again left his new companions and went in search of Revan. HK-47 searched for years until he finally deactivated, but three centuries after his initial disappearance, Revan found HK-47 and reactivated him, tasking his faithful ally with the defense of the Foundry\u2014and Revan was dismayed to witness the droid's destruction at the hands of Sith attackers.

Among Revan's greatest victories was his defeat of Mandalore the Ultimate, the leader of the Mandalorian warrior culture and a feared warrior in his own right, in single combat. On Korriban, Revan single-handedly defeated a pair of massive terentateks, and defeated dozens of Dark Jedi and Sith during the Jedi Civil War, not to mention his own former student Darth Malak. While he normally wielded a lightsaber, Revan was also proficient in the use of firearms, as he made use of blaster weaponry during his time as a Republic soldier and while fighting in the Taris dueling ring.

As a Sith Lord, Revan also utilized the Force to choke opponents, as well as the ability to violently crush their internal organs or bodies with the dark side. In battle, Revan often threw his lightsaber and guided its path with telekinesis.

Revan was capable of absorbing and redirecting energy, as he did when he absorbed Darth Nyriss's storm of Force lightning with his bare hands and channeled it through his own body before redirecting it against her and burning her to ash. Revan's mastery of both sides of the Force aided in the mental fracture that he experienced in the Foundry; one half became one with the Force, but the other embraced the dark side and was fueled solely by hatred.
