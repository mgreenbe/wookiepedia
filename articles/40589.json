The Gotra was feared by members of the criminal underworld; simply citing their name was enough to convince others of an informant's legitimacy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY,[source?] members of the Gotra, including KRONOS-841, attended a Xrexus Cartel auction of a Jedi Padawan named Eldra Kaitis.

These combat units had what some considered legitimate grievances against the Galactic Empire for having been abandoned after their service during the Clone Wars. The Gotra recruited Q2-B3KO, an articulated holographic color separator who produced propaganda supporting the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars, to disseminate messages of mechanical emancipation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, the Empire's base on the Sentinel moon came under attack by insurgents using Separatist equipment and droids. The installation's commander, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, initially suspected that the Gotra was responsible, but found it unlikely that they would make use of obsolete weapons to send a message to the Empire. Phoca Soot, the Coruscant Security Force prefect of level 1331, hired himself out to the Droid Gotra instead of controlling crime within his sector. However, his duplicity did not go unnoticed and he was executed by the Sith Lord Darth Vader as an example to Coruscant's criminal elements, advising them to relocate their operations to sectors in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories, lest their activities infringe upon Emperor Palpatine's designs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 13 BBY, the Droid Gotra were attempting to place a foothold on Corellia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 ABY, the Droid Gotra hired the rogue archaeologist Doctor Aphra to recover the Triple-Zero protocol personality matrix, which could turn a protocol droid into a torture specialist, and the prototype BT-1 assassin droid on their behalf. They also meant to have her liberate a droid factory from Karina, a Geonosian queen who survived the Empire's sterilization of Geonosis. Although successful in retrieving the droids, she instead turned them over to Darth Vader and helped him secure Karina's droid factory, as he needed personal troops for his own ends without the Empire knowing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cyban Front, an organization who worked with the Droid Gotra, were hired to participate in the auction of the Rur crystal so it could be destroyed due to its technopathy abilities.

Around four years after  the official establishment of the New Republic, the Abyssin criminal Gor Koresh was interrogated by the Mandalorian Din Djarin, who sought to learn the locations of other Mandalorians in the galaxy. Koresh directed him to Tatooine, swearing by the Gotra that his information was legitimate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after Supreme Leader Snoke's assumption of leadership within the First Order, Gotra attacked and eliminated an armed Ubrikkian freighter commanded by Red Key Raiders. After sweeping the wreckage, they found Maz Kanata's Journal and flagged valuable datapoints from the contents within. They then began to transmit orders to all members of Gotra and the Cyban Front stationed in the rim territories, ordering them to target the closest data cache. The transmission was promptly intercepted by the Guavian Death Gang, who then broadcast their own counteracting broadcast and somehow removed Kanata's Journal from Gotra."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Droid Gotra was first mentioned in the 2014 novel Tarkin, written by James Luceno."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
