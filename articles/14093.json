During those years, the asteroid had been terraformed and colonized as Hanoon, and the colonists had found the shards and held them as valuable relics in their cities. Moff Yittreas had also fled the Krantian Civil War to Geddes and fortified the asteroid. Organa and her brother, the future founder of the New Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker ventured to Hanoon to find the shards in 6 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Recovering the shards"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A New Republic task force led by Organa and Skywalker returned to the asteroid to retrieve the shards.

The Republic forces deployed the Blaster Cannon to eliminate the turrets, and Reticul gratefully turned over their shard and several R2-D5 labor droids, which the Republic army used to establish their own base, including a Jedi Temple to hold the shards. The strike force also eliminated the nearby Imperial base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The strike force also visited Libreck, where a leader of the Hanoon Imperial Resistance, Excellency Lathe Parthenian, was held. Libreck turned over its shard after Parthenian was freed and the stormtrooper garrison was eliminated. Magentic turned over their shard after the Rebublic strike force destroyed the Fortress guarding the town. Reeche demanded and received a tribute of 500 units of carbon and 500 units of nova crystals in exchange for their shard. Skywalker returned the four shards to the Temple for storage."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Capturing the Terraform Processor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker and Organa then decided to stay and liberate the asteroid world, although it was considered a suicide mission. They gathered a Blaster Cannon, two Heavy Attack Tanks, a Heavy Torpedo Launcher, nine Repeater Troopers, and a Transport Ship filled with five labor droids. They advanced on New Geddes, the city which sprang up from the old research facility, intent on capturing the Terraform Processor. The Blaster Cannon advanced ahead of forces and eliminated four turrets to protect the Transport Ship, which was boxed in the canal. The forces of New Geddes, veterans who originally served on Krant, resisted ferociously, but the Republic strike force infiltrated the base. The labor droids took control of the Terraform Processor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The strike force built up their defenses to maintain control of the Processor and recruited additional forces for the push deeper into New Geddes. The army fought past the Imperial's defenses, including air defense towers. They destroyed one Fortress, but Moff Yittreas escaped to another. They eventually cornered him and his forces in another Fortress, and defeated them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The survivors tried breaking into the Jedi Temple to take control of the shards.

The player may create any structure in the base, but must build a Jedi Temple to hold the four shards after recovering them from Reticul, Magentic, Libreck, and Reeche. The objectives may be completed in any order. The optional objective is to destroy the Imperial base in the mission. This article assumes the player did so. For the second mission, the player may build up any army forces as long as the Imperial base is destroyed and the Terraform Processor is protected."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There is a discrepancy in the dates of the battle.
