It was damaged by one of the planet's frequent groundquakes, causing it to be closed for over three months for repairs. During the fight with the Sarlaccs in which he met Hera Syndulla, Kanan Jarrus tackled the gang's leader, Charko, into the cantina through a window. Their ensuing brawl, which Kanan won, caused even more damage to the bar, including the breaking of both of its windows."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
