It was used to strangle an opponent by wrapping it around the person's neck and using both hands to pull on the ends, which would result in their trachea being forced closed. Garrotes employed by the Alliance to Restore the Republic were made with sixty centimeters of wire. It was a personal favorite for Republic Commando Fi Skirata and Sergeant Kal Skirata."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
