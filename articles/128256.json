The craft were one-person ships with space for only one pilot. At least one ship was present at the Solay Spaceport when the ex-King Blackart attempted to escape the world. Blackart commandeered one of the ships and was in the process of escaping Solay when he was cut off by the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. Skywalker used a wing pack in conjunction with a jump platform to attack the ship with his lightsaber. The Jedi cut the top off of the craft, causing it to crash land near the spaceport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
