It could fit at least one Human adult and was available for purchasing. The model was considered as an option by the Galactic Empire during the construction of the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station for replacing the Death Star's slower default lift tube. It was faster than the NB200 Commercial Lift and the Insta-Lift 2000 SE but slower than the Infini-lift Lightspeed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
