Following the devastating defeat of the Galactic Empire at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Chandro excelled at capturing Imperial fugitives. Having earned quite a reputation for capturing Imperials, he made sure to avoid contact with the First Order that rose out of the remnants of the Empire. In 35 ABY, Chandro was no longer a member of the Guild and was one of many unaffiliated individuals who answered the call of Resistance agents Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca to aid the Resistance in defeating the forces of the Sith Eternal above the planet Exegol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calrissian and Chewbacca led Chandro and the other volunteers through the hyperspace anomalies of the Unknown Regions to Exegol, where they immediately engaged the Sith Eternal's fleet, the Final Order, based there. Shortly after their arrival, the vessels of the Resistance and their allies were disabled by the Force lightning of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious; however, they regained control once the Sith turned his attention to fighting the Jedi Rey. The Resistance and its allies were ultimately victorious and Chandro was amongst those who returned to the Resistance base on the jungle moon Ajan Kloss to celebrate. As the pirate Maz Kanata reunited with Chewbacca, Chandro stood with the droid AL1-L3.
