Believed to have been inspired by the Stokhli spray stick, the RL-40 deployed a stun net 2.5 meters in diameter which could achieve maximum range in less than half a second. Upon contact the net would deliver a paralyzing electrical shock until the target stopped moving. The intensity of the shock could also be varied, from a light charge able to subdue small game to a full charge which could kill a Human or paralyze a Gundark or Dewback."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
