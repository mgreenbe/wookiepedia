In order to capture the New Republic ships stationed in the shipyards at Sluis Van, Thrawn needed mole miners. He attacked Nomad City, a mining colony located on Nkllon and ran by Lando Calrissian. Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo, and Luke Skywalker happened to be in the system, visiting Calrissian in hopes he could hide Leia from Imperial assassins. They helped fight in the Millennium Falcon and an X-wing, but Thrawn still managed to capture fifty-one mole miners, more than half of Nomad City's complement. During the battle, Skywalker first came into contact with the mad Jedi clone Joruus C'baoth, who telepathically reached out to Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
