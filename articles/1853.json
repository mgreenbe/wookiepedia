They were usually piloted by scout troopers and were able to jam comlinks. All machinery the Empire deemed unnecessary was stripped off to maximize the speeder bike's speed. This lead to some calling it a \"death trap,\" but the 74-z's terrain sensors had a connection to a heads-up-display in every scout trooper's helmet to let them know what was ahead of them.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 9 ABY, scout troopers AP-1982 and JS-1975 of Moff Gideon's Imperial Remnant used two white 74-Z speeder bikes on the planet Nevarro in order to acquire Grogu. One of these bikes would later be used shortly after by the assassin droid IG-11 to protect Grogu and attack Gideon and his forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three decades after the Battle of Endor, 74-Z speeder bikes could be found on the black market."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 74-Z speeder bike was one of the longest produced speeder bike models built by the Aratech Repulsor Company. A militarized variant of Aratech's popular 74-Y speeder bike, the 74-Z was first fielded by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Its first test under fire was at the First Battle of Geonosis, and since then, the speeder bike served with countless military and paramilitary groups, mercenary crews, and criminal organizations. It was, perhaps, most famous for being the Imperial Army's ride of choice for reconnaissance and scout troopers, who made good use of its speed and maneuverability."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like its discontinued civilian ancestor, the 74-Z was built for speed rather than livability. It had a relatively fragile twin-spar frame that mounted the powerful Aratech VV318 Scoris repulsiveness engine. A pair of tiny ion turbines supply thrust, and a remarkably intelligent fly-by-wire system controlled the forward-mounted steering vanes and mid-mounted maneuver control unit to keep the bike upright and on the level. The pilot sat far aft over the repulsorlift engine and controlled the bike with a set of handlebars and rear-set foot pegs with foot-controlled yaw and pitch controls. The instrument panel was rudimentary at best, with indicators for heat, boost, coolant, and turbine pressure. Under Imperial service, the 74-Z was equipped with a forward-mounted Ax-20 blaster cannon, on-board com-links, simple optical sensors, and a close-range com link jammer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
