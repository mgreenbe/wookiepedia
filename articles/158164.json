Since they believed they could not trust anyone within the Empire, Ur'Loach was released and became part of a brutal test created by Vader, to see who among the prisoners was worthy of joining the New Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, Ur'Loach attacked Lieutenant Tohm and overpowered him, grabbing the human's arm and blaster in his hands and wrapping his long, prehensile tongue around Tohm's neck. Ur'Loach drew Tohm closer, knocking the blaster away and planning on biting the young man's head off, as was his wont. Ur'Loach didn't see fellow Separatist and prisoner Shonn Volta, who drew Tohm's blaster to herself with the Force. With a single shot, she hit Ur'Loach right in his open mouth, bisecting his head and killing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
