The Imperials kept an Oskan blood eater at the base, trapped within a pit. Sometime after the Battle of Hoth, Imperials inadvertently brought the mind-witch S'ybll to the outpost. While using her illusions to pose as an Imperial trooper, she drained the life force from all the Imperials at the base. When Rebel scouts, Andur Thorsim and Glaennor arrived at the base in a G9 Rigger-class light freighter to investigate, S'ybll imprisoned them and manipulated them into drawing Luke Skywalker to the base. During the encounter, Skywalker's droid, R2-D2 used a T-65 X-wing starfighter to blast a hole in the structure. The maneuver allowed Skywalker to defeat S'ybll, causing her death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
