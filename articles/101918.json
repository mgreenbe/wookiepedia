Otoh Gunga Bongowerks) was a Gungan company dedicated to producing bongos and other transports for the Gungans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cooperative may have been a descendant of the Bongomeken Collective, and after the War of the Gungan tribes it was located in the city of Otoh Gunga and grew bongo hulls in large underwater farms. The skeletal frames were grown and then fitted with a combination of Gungan and Naboo technology. Every bongo was individually crafted, and no two vehicles looked alike. Certain designers, however, had signature styles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cooperative survived the events of the Battle of Naboo, and soon began creating larger designs for use as starships. These starships were used to colonize the moon of Ohma-D'un. The Cooperative suffered a huge setback when the Galactic Empire established a presence on Naboo. The Gungans, fearing enslavement, went into hiding, and the cooperative ceased producing. The company, however, enjoyed a huge resurgence after the Battle of Endor, when the Gungans began traveling in larger numbers across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
