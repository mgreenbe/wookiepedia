After some time, Probus defeated his master, and eventually become one of the best Inquisitors. He was later assigned to search for Jedi Knight Jax Pavan. Searching every sector on Coruscant, Probus was getting closer to detect the Jedi, but received a call from the Sith's priority to search for a droid named I-Five.
