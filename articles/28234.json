Pirates used a masking code modulator to interfere with a ship's transponder code. The modulator created a new transponder code, or at least one that was similar to that used by another ship. When active, the masked ship appeared to be another vessel of the same model."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
