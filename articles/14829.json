In the months that followed, Maydla Churhee rebuilt the unit, this time as a fiercely anti-Imperial organization. Thereafter, Churhee's Riflemen took anti-Imperial contracts only, and allied themselves with the Rebel Alliance. Because of the high quality of marksmanship among their members, the Riflemen became a real thorn in the side of the Empire, particularly in the Parmel sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During several weeks, Churhee's Riflemen helped local Alliance ground forces on Turcan III to fight the Empire.
