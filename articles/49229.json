The creature was kept in a pit within the Hutt's palace on the planet Nal Hutta, where it was cared for by the crime lord's beast master. In 3643 BBY, Nem'ro sent a bounty hunter to kill the supposedly treacherous beast master as part of a series of tests to prove that the hunter was worthy of Nem'ro's sponsorship in the Great Hunt competition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having been warned that the hunter was coming, the beast master prepared Fleshripper and several other creatures in cages around the pit, releasing them in waves once the bounty hunter arrived. As Nem'ro watched, the hunter killed two waves of creatures before the beast master released Fleshripper and two young vrblthers. The bounty hunter killed all three creatures and then the beast master himself, earning congratulations from Nem'ro. Fleshripper had brown skin and black eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fleshripper appeared as a non-optional enemy in \"House Cleaning,\" a quest in the bounty hunter class campaign in the 2011 BioWare massively-multiplayer online roleplaying game, Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
