In the comic, following the Republic's victory on the planet Kaller, Mixx and his clone comrades received Order 66, which commanded them to execute their Jedi commanders, Master Depa Billaba and her padawan Caleb Dume. Mixx attacked Billaba while Dume stood stunned, as the padawan considered Mixx and the other clones friends. The Jedi Master then decapitated Mixx with her lightsaber. However, \"Aftermath\" depicted these events differently, with no mention of Mixx."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
