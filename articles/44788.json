Extraction Team Misericorde escape on their U-wing with the defector, eluding several TIE fighters and escaping into hyperspace.

Dr Aphra apologizes for leaving her and her companions. Believing that she cannot change herself, she has decided to shield those she loves from her own defects.

She admits that chaos is not much better, describing herself as a \"one-woman trail of destruction.\" Dr Korin wonders whether his daughter, whom he presumed to be dead, survived.

He adds that the four guiding principles are near-quotations of Jedi apocrypha but the Captain is not interested.

Skywalker reports that it set the Imperial search efforts back by two weeks, giving them enough time to set up Echo Base's deflector shields and to prepare their evacuation plans. Skywalker says that this confirms his view that she was on the side of good."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Skywalker leaves, Tolvan muses about telling him that Dr Aphra also saved the Emperor's life. Kolvin advises against it, saying that there is nothing more cruel to a dreamer than reality. Vulaada says that is cold out here but admits that is pretty with so many worlds out there. Korin wonders if Aphra is settling on a new world to stay out of trouble. Vulaada quips that Aphra is settling down to make some.
