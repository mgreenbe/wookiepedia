One particular encounter was when the Legion was en route to the Umbaran capital city and were attacked by a pair of these creatures-- one of which knocked ARC-5555 to his feet and another carried away a trooper in its claws. Both banshees were killed by General Pong Krell, although the clones would encounter the creatures several times afterward as they attempted to claim the soldiers for food or feed on the corpses of the Umbaran militia and clones themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
