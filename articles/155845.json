Yahenna Laxo, the head of the Gray Syndicate, sold the elderly poet Holshef to this bounty hunter as payback for Merei Spanjaf getting on his bad side. When Laxo was killed by the Galactic Empire, Spanjaf tried to spirit Holshef off-world, but first had to deal with this bounty hunter coming after them both personally. They lost him when a paper of Holshef's poetry whipped up in the wind and blinded him, causing him to crash into a droid truck, which exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This bounty hunter was originally envisioned to have a rather larger role within the Servants of the Empire story. In his official Tumblr blog, author Jason Fry stated that Merei Spanjaf would have played a game of \"cat and mouse\" with the bounty hunter. This plot line was ultimately cut in the interest of economizing the story, as there was no room for another plot thread, with the bounty hunter only briefly seen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
