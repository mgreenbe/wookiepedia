A relatively imposing planet, Al'Moab III was mostly covered in deserts. However, that had not prevented the colonization of the land. At the time of the Galactic Civil War, Al'Moab III was mostly populated by Humans who built their cities in its wide barren zones. Those colonists had been there for an undetermined, and yet quite ancient, period of time, and the planet was known for both its archaeological remains and troubled history."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Al'Moab III has only been mentioned in L'Arche d'Alliance (\"The Ark of Covenant\"), a scenario published in the French RPG magazine Graal 17."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
