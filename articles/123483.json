A fast and versatile starship, the ShaShore-class saw extensive use during the Sith\u2013Imperial War and the subsequent operations that followed. Many of these frigates were part of Admiral Gar Stazi's Galactic Alliance Remnant fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like its larger cousin, the Scythe-class battle cruiser, the ShaShore-class was designed with a large, blade-like structure centered on the ventral section of the ships's bow. In its standard armament configuration, the ShaShore was equipped with multiple turbolaser batteries, point-defense cannons, and a pair of proton torpedo batteries. The ship's port and starboard hangar bays were capable of housing up to twenty four CF9 Crossfire starfighters and two Crix-class shuttles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ShaShore-class frigate was designed for greater speeds and maneuverability, at the cost of less armor. A smaller blade positioned directly in front of the main blade was designed to carry one of several specialized modules, ranging from barrage-style concussion missile launchers, to an advanced sensor suite or communication jammers. ShaShore frigates often were deployed as escorts for Scythe-class battle cruisers. At the Battle of Dac, at least four ShaShore-class frigates and several Sabertooth-class assault ships served as the escort for Admiral Stazi's flagship Indomitable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ShaShore-class had a predecessor design that served in the Alliance Fleet during the early years of the Galactic Civil War.

Unlike larger designs such as the Scythe-class battle cruiser and Tri-Scythe-class frigate, which were purpose-built, the ShaShore-class was capable of being augmented to numerous other secondary roles. Many ShaShore-class frigates fought at the Battle of Caamas, with at least one being destroyed by heavy Imperial fire. Following the formation of the Galactic Alliance Remnant, remaining ShaShore-class frigates saw continued heavy usage, as both a warship and diplomatic courier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One ShaShore transported Admiral Gar Stazi to the Wheel to conduct negotiations with Captain Mingo Bovark of the Imperial faction loyal to Emperor Roan Fel. In the months following the aborted negotiations on the Wheel, several of the frigates were part of a task force under Admiral Stazi that captured the Advanced Star Destroyer prototype Imperious during the Battle of Dac. That major victory gave the Alliance a must needed morale boost, as well as a state-of-the-art capital ship prototype."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in 137 ABY, numerous ShaShore-class frigates were part of a combined GA-Fel loyalist operation against Sith naval forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In its first appearance, the frigate was accidentally named a Sabertooth, which is the name of another Galactic Alliance vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Until the publication of the Legacy Era Campaign Guide, there was no confirmed class name for the ShaShore frigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When drawing the cover for Dark Horse Comics Star Wars 11, artist Sean Cooke added a detail showing an aging ShaShore-esque ship as part of the Rebel Alliance fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
