Located in the 100-story isolation tower, it occupied one spoke of the tower's quadripartite summit. It was dominated by the color red, mirroring the Emperor's private suites in the Imperial Palace on Coruscant. The room featured a conference table fitted with a multi-spectral comm system, at least four seats, and two circular viewports similar to those in the nearby throne room. The area also contained a few antiquities and sculptural pieces, including a statue of the Atrisian demigod Wapoe, a pair of trophies presented to the Emperor by Naboo's Theed Council, and an idol gifted by Moff Quarsh Panaka. The front door led to the tower turbolifts and the throne room, while the back door opened on the Emperor's monitored sleep chamber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
