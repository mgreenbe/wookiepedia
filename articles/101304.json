The Executor Nom Anor was known to have removed one of his eyes with the sharpened end of a burning stick and then replaced it with a plaeryin bol, a living creature capable of spitting venom. This was considered one of the most extreme rituals ever committed by a Yuuzhan Vong. Yuuzhan Vong commanders also had their cloaks attached by special growths to their shoulders. For Supreme Commanders and Warmasters, it was common for armor plating to be grafted onto their bones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
