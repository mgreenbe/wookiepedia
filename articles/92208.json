The city boasted Naboo's highest concentration of successful authors, artists and musicians. It was also the training ground for many of Naboo's elected officials, and included some of the galaxy's most respected universities. Inhabitants of Moenia also encompassed many merchants and Gungan sympathizers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An interesting feature about Moenia was that it usually had a misty gloom about it. While inside the city, one could rarely tell if it was day or night. Perhaps it was for this reason that Moenia chose to be the host of the Galactic Moon Festival."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Invasion of Naboo, Moenia was conquered by the Trade Federation and its population was relocated to the Detention Camp Six, outside the city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Galactic Empire viewed Moenia as little more than an artist's retreat and virtually ignored all activity in the city. This allowed for the formation of a small but influential group of political idealists sympathetic to the Rebellion. Publicly, Moenia's leadership would support the Empire, but they surreptitiously funded Alliance activities, welcomed refugees from worlds under Imperial siege, and arranged meetings between Rebel agents and powerful political figures from throughout the galaxy. While the peaceful residents of Moenia would rarely take up arms against the Empire, their underground support of the Alliance proved to be a valuable asset. After the Battle of Yavin, the city eventually became a Rebel Alliance stronghold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Aerie Casino was also located on the city's outskirts.

Among the city's more famous patrons was the famed poet, philologist, and scholar Ebenn Q3 Baobab. Borvo the Hutt was also known to relax in the local cantina. From there, he managed his own vault just outside the city. This vault was actually a large underground bunker, rumored to have an acklay and rancor guarding its secrets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
