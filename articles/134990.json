Bachs was explicitly asked not to include any Humans. However, he convinced the rest of the team to include one Human as a background character in the cantina. That Human was a caricature of Star Wars fan Skippy Farlstendoiro, who has met Bachs many times usually disguised as a Mon Calamari. As such, \"Farlstendoiro\" appeared next to a Mon Calamari. Furthermore, another human appeared in the first issue: Vana Sage (in a hologram)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}]}
