The conflict resulted in the Great Hyperspace War, and the Jedi and Empress Teta supposedly managed to drive back Sadow's forces, resulting in their defeat and forcing the Sith to scatter throughout the galaxy.

The destruction of his body caused a massive burst of energy to release that crumbled the Sith Citadel, its debris crushing the Sith loyalists, and killed Rey, but she was resurrected by Solo, who gave his life for hers.
