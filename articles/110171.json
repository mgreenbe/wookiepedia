Four color schemes were proposed. The first was a striped design, with a metallic gray blue pattern along a pewter dome. The second color scheme featured a metallic camouflage green eye and selected panels, aluminum panels, and a pewter dome. The third design had an embossed circuitry look with raised surface detail on a gunmetal gray head. The last design was very metallic, featuring copper panels on a bronze dome. Ultimately, the fourth color scheme was chosen, and went on to appear in Revenge of the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
