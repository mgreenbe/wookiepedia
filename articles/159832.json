After taking refuge with the Alliance, he studied medicine and signed on as a combat medic and surgeon. Vaocan soon became one of the Alliance's best medical officers, earning the nickname \"Doc Rodian\" from the troops he treated. He rose to become the chief surgeon of the Tierfon Rebel Outpost, a starfighter base in the Sumitra sector. He had to stretch his pacifist ethics to join a paramilitary group, but he reasoned that helping the Rebels win the Galactic Civil War would prevent many people from being harmed by Imperial oppression. Even in combat situations, however, he refused to carry any kind of weapon and resolved to offer no resistance if captured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vaocan was a tall Rodian with light green skin, bulbous red eyes, and a short snout. At some point, injuries from a battlefield explosion destroyed one of Vaocan's antennae, leaving him deaf on one side.

Vaocan's backstory and personality differ slightly from the default description in the character template, however. For example, Vaocan was driven off Rodia, while the default template is a voluntary exile. Vaocan is presented as a serious character who becomes a successful military medic, while the default template describes a more quixotic and eccentric pacifist who does not start play with any advanced medical skills. Finally, the character illustrated in the template description has both antennae, and unlike the unarmed doctor carries a holstered weapon (presumably the stun pistol described in the template.)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the text describes Vaocan as only able to hear on his left side, his left antenna is missing in his picture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
