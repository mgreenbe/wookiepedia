Like many, Jemuro expressed distaste towards the forces of the formerly-dominant Eternal Empire that had joined the Alliance. He declared that the Skytrooper battle droids stationed aboard his capital ship were plotting a mutiny and imprisoned them. His claims were disproved when his ship was damaged navigating the Kauron asteroid field and the skytroopers escaped from the cargo hold and repaired his ship. This event led to most of the Alliance accepting the Zakuulan forces, which frustrated the now disgraced Jemuro."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hym Jemuro is first mentioned in \"Zakuulan Allies\", a codex entry in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne, a 2016 expansion to the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
