On one occasion, the Gozzo requested that Durl and Dekk open the vault to retrieve items, but Durl, whose voice unlocked the vault, had his mouth stuck shut with goo-goo-gum given to him by Dekk. Dekk tried in vain to open the vault, and his boss grew impatient, until Durl, who had only been pretending to have his mouth still stuck, said the password that opened the vault."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
