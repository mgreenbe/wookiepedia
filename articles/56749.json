However, they encountered problems and had to turn back, only to get lost in the planet's fog before crashing. The ghosts of the crew haunted the villages on the planet, until Han Solo and Chewbacca landed on the planet and made two lines of crystals. They acted as a runway, the ark's ghost landed, and the crew's souls were finally put at rest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
