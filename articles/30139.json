It was connected via hyperlane to the Kolatill, Oon Tien and Charis systems. Transit from Corjain to Kolatill took five hours, eleven hours to reach Oon Tien, and fourteen hours to arrive at Charis. Marginally habitable, Corjain's atmosphere was harsh and poisonous, requiring all settlements to be built deep underground. However, the planet was rich in metals and ores, resulting in large scale mining operations. Deep mines covered the planet, and the metals and ores extracted provided a large amount of income for the local mining guilds. The planet was also the location of a secret listening post run by the Bothan Spynet during the Galactic Civil War that was established without the knowledge of the New Republic's government."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corjain maintained a sizable population, made up primarily of communities of Humans, Jarells, and Svivreni.
