However, the Kel Dor's efforts were unsuccessful until Darth Sajar, a member of the Sith's ruling Dark Council, asked to meet him on the planet Dantooine to discuss peace. Their meeting occurred sometime between 3678 BBY and the end of the war in 3653 BBY. Sajar attacked the Jedi when he arrived, beginning a duel that would last for three days as the two debated and attempted to draw their opponent over to their respective side of the Force. The duel ended when Braga successfully convinced the Dark Councilor to abandon the dark side and become his Padawan learner. Shedding his title of Darth, Sajar shared much of his knowledge with the Jedi Council, including information on the agents known as the Children of the Emperor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The duel was first mentioned by Tol Braga in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 video game released by BioWare.
