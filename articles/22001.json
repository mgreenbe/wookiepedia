Alpha-17 also gave CC-5052 the name \"Bly,\" which the clone commander himself adopted. Assigned to the 327th Star Corps, Bly worked with Jedi General Aayla Secura throughout the Clone Wars. Serving in campaigns on planets such as Quell, Maridun, Alzoc III, Florrum, and New Holstice, Bly worked with Secura to personally extract a valuable Scientific Instrument Package from Honoghr. During the mission, Bly encountered renegade Jedi Quinlan Vos, whom he deeply mistrusted.

With that mission a success, Bly and his troops hunted Shu Mai, who was a member of the governing body of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. They eventually discovered that they were too late to capture Mai, and that her forces had unleashed a deadly toxin into the planet's water supply. Bly set out with Secura to stop the toxin from spreading, but in transit he received the command to execute Order 66, which meant that all Jedi were declared to be enemies of the Republic. After gunning down Secura, Bly's men were unable to locate Zonder or the two other Jedi Padawans involved in the Felucia campaign, Ekria and Drake Lo'gaan. Several months later, Bly was given the opportunity to finally eliminate Ekria and Lo'gaan by Darth Vader.

As a clone commander, it was Bly's job to act as an intermediary between the Jedi Generals and the regular clone troopers, although he was bred to be loyal to the Republic above all others. Bly was assigned to the 327th Star Corps, which fell under the 2nd Sector Army. He personally served Jedi General Aayla Secura, and they began to develop a close relationship during their shared service in the ongoing Clone Wars. When the Republic amassed a number of droids that needed their memory cores unlocked and wiped, Bly helped to recruit a Jedi Knight for the task, as the secrets in the droids could be crucial to the war effort."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Service with Secura"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Quell"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, in an attempt to reap information from the memory banks of a Confederate tactical droid, Bly and Secura set up a trap in a rocky canyon.

In turn, the droid ordered his troops to attack the bunker, prompting Bly and the men of the 327th to attack them from the rear. They were able to effectively dispatch the droid's troops, while Secura beheaded the tactical droid. Since the droid had not gone into cyberostasis, they would be able to plunder its memory banks for intel. Later, Secura led a task force of three Venator-class Star Destroyers to Quell.

Sure enough, the Resolute entered the system, but the Confederate frigates began launching B2-RP battle droids. Realizing that they were intending to board her ship, Secura ordered Bly to repel the attacking forces. Gunships from the Resolute arrived at the site of the battle to aid Secura's listing starship, and Skywalker, his apprentice Ahsoka Tano, and CT-7567 (or \"Rex,\" as he was known) were able to board.

Skywalker, in an attempt to save both his allies and the cruiser, sealed himself off with a set of blast doors, and held back the force of the explosion with the Force. As a result, he was seriously injured, but Tano was able to recover his unconscious form. The group boarded the cruiser, prompting its pilot to make a heading for the Resolute. Aboard the Resolute, Admiral Wullf Yularen advised Secura against docking in the middle of a battle, but Secura realized that the severity of Skywalker's injuries meant that he needed better medical care than the cruiser could provide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the cruiser began docking operations, it was set upon by Vulture droids.

Despite the overwhelming odds against surviving a hyperspace jump in a gravity well, the cruiser, and all aboard it, survived. As it traveled through hyperspace, Bly learned that the ship was on a direct collision course with a star. As the clones tried desperately to disengage the hyperdrive, Secura ordered that they power down all the ship's systems. They did so, bringing the cruiser into realspace just short of the star. Secura then powered the ship back up again, allowing it to maneuver around the star, which in turn allowed Tano to slingshot the craft around the star and into a crash landing on the planet of Maridun."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Maridun"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the wreckage of the ship burned on the planet's surface, all evacuated through its emergency escape hatches. Once the fires had burned out, the group used the wreckage as a makeshift shelter.

Tano suggested that Bly and Secura scout in a southerly fashion while she and Rex would stay and watch over Skywalker, but Secura disagreed, insisting that she and Tano work together as Jedi. In a cursory search of the area surrounding the wreck, Bly discovered a carved tablet depicting a humanoid battling some sort of predator. The group realized that the tablet indicated that there was an intelligent species dwelling on the world, and set themselves upon the task of finding said species. Also depicted on the carving were large trees, which Bly, Secura, and Tano decided to look for, as a clue to the species' location. Setting out with Cameron, Flash, and Lucky, and leaving Rex behind with Skywalker, the group found one of the trees by nightfall.

They were greeted by the village leader, Tee Watt Kaa, but the elderly Lurmen was suspicious of their intent. Secura insisted that they were peace keepers, but Kaa argued that the Jedi were a violent people. The Lurmen had colonized Maridun in an attempt to flee the death and destruction that the Clone Wars brought, and in accordance with that, he asked the trio to leave his village. Tano launched into an impassioned plea for aid, however, and Kaa decided to send his healer son, Wag Too, to aid Skywalker.

The clone commander set off with Tano and Too, and after running for 17 hours straight, arrived back at the wreckage just as a mastiff phalone was tearing apart the shelter and attacking Rex and Skywalker. Too was able to incapacitate the creature, but barred Tano from killing it. Meanwhile, Bly assisted Skywalker, who had been further injured in the altercation with the mastiff phalone. Too was able to stabilize Skywalker's condition, and the general was set to make a recovery. They returned to the village, where Skywalker's recuperation continued. Meanwhile, Bly was informed by Rex that a Confederate C-9979 landing craft was approaching the Lurmen settlement, which Bly then immediately relayed to the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaa insisted that the Jedi leave the village, lest the Confederate invaders find them. Too helped the clones and the Jedi to sneak out of the village, while Kaa met with the leader of the Confederate force, General Lok Durd. As the clones and the Jedi moved out of the village, the Confederate troops began ransacking the place. The group was able to make its way to some long grass, where they hid until the droids finished their sweep of the settlement. Skywalker, remembering that they would need a ship to get off Maridun, suggested that if the Confederates had a landing craft, they would also likely have a shuttle of some sort. As Skywalker and Rex plotted, Tano spotted a Confederate recon droid nearby. Bly and Rex opened fire on it, while Bly jammed its comlink. The droid fled, and the group gave chase. Secura was able to dispatch the droid, and their chase had taken them to the base of a large tree. The group climbed the tree, and from their new vantage point, they spotted the Confederate invaders building a fortified outpost around the landing craft. Within the outpost was, as Skywalker predicted, a Confederate shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bly noted that getting into the outpost would be no small feat, as the enemy's security appeared to be flawless. As the group continued to observe the base, Skywalker saw that Durd's forces had some sort of large new weapon in their arsenal, and he asked Bly and Rex to investigate. As they moved closer, the vehicle fired a large projectile into the sky. When the projectile hit the ground, it unleashed a rapidly expanding ring of fire that wiped out everything in its path. Bly and Rex attempted to outrun the blast, and Rex decided to fire his grappling cable at a branch of the large tree, in order to ascend out of the blast's range. Bly followed suit, but tripped on a log, and as a result, his cable fell short of the tree. Before he could be killed by the blast, however, Secura swung down on a vine, and rescued him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi quickly realized that Durd's target would be the Lurmen, and Skywalker devised a plan of attack: first, they would eliminate the Confederate communication station, steal the shuttle, and then return to aid the Lurmen.

Tano and Secura were able to enter the outpost, wherein Tano proceeded to open the main door, allowing Bly, Rex, and Skywalker to join the others. The rest of the guard droids dispatched, the group made their way toward the parked shuttle. Before they boarded, the clones gathered two shield generators to take with them. The group then flew the shuttle to the Lurmen village."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Kaa still refused to accept the aid of the Jedi, Skywalker went about ordering the clones to set up the shield generators, in preparation for the defense of the village. In addition, the Jedi and the clones began moving the large pods into place, forming a makeshift barrier. When the Confederate forces were close enough to the village, Durd fired his new weapon. In response, Skywalker had the shield generators activated, and the shields in turn protected the village from the blast. Durd's next move was to have his army of droids charge the village, prompting Skywalker, Tano, Secura, Bly and Rex to move outside the shield and engage the attackers. They were able to successfully dispatch the first wave of droids, but the second and third waves were able to make through the shield perimeter, forcing Bly and Rex to retreat behind the pod barrier. Skywalker set off on his own to destroy the weapon, leaving Tano and Secura free to battle the droids that were moving into the village. Unfortunately for the defenders, the droids were able to destroy both of the shield generators. Skywalker was able to destroy the weapon, however, and the Lurmen, under the leadership of Too, banded together, and helped the clones and the Jedi destroy the attacking droids. Durd was later arrested by Skywalker, and Admiral Yularen's cruisers arrived at Maridun to extract the clones and the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Alzoc III and Florrum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bly accompanied Secura, Jedi General Luminara Unduli, and Clone Commander CC-1004, nicknamed \"Gree,\" to investigate the planet Alzoc III, where Separatist activity had been reported by the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. The Republic squad took several All Terrain Tactical Enforcers and headed for the coordinates of the location provided by Jabba. Along the way, the walkers were forced to scale a vertical cliff, and when a walker's path became blocked by a bulk of ice, Bly immediately ordered his men to blast it. Secura, however, ordered to hold, stating that the blast could lead to the collapse of the entire cliff, and proceeded to remove the obstacle in a more delicate way. Upon arriving at their destination, both the Jedi and the clone troopers witnessed a crash site of a large capital ship and were stunned by the view of huge masses of ice and numerous starship parts floating freely in the air. Deciding to investigate the unusual phenomena, Bly, Gree and several clone troopers used their jetpacks to reach what remained of the ship's hangar, while the Jedi followed them by using the Force to navigate through debris. When the group rendezvoused at the hangar, it was attacked by a Vulture droid, and it became apparent that the crash site attracted Separatist interest as well.

It became apparent that an individual had used a Telgorn dropship to board a Munificent-class star frigate carrying two classified weapons, stole one of them, and then departed shortly before the frigate was hit by an explosion. The vessel had then crashed on the planet, where the weapon created a gravity anomaly. Soon, it was also revealed that the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress had already visited the crash site and set the remains of the frigate for self-destruct. The Jedi ordered the clone troopers to safety and then briefly dueled Ventress.

The Jedi ordered the clone commander to take a squad of troopers aboard an LAAT/i gunship and gather more information, and to hold fire unless fired upon. The Confederate captain, seeking to eliminate both the Republic gunship and the neutral vessel belonging to the bounty hunter Shahan Alama, dispatched Vulture and Hyena droid starfighters.

On New Holstice, Bly and his troops successfully battled against the Mandalorian Protectors, driving the warriors into full retreat. However, the Star Corps suffered heavy losses and was whittled down to an effective strength of sixty percent. The commander alerted Secura to the shortage of troops, but the Jedi resigned herself to the fact that other units across the galaxy were under just as much stress. During his time with Secura, Bly began to grow close to the Jedi, earning the two of them the ire of other Jedi such as Arligan Zey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Continuing to work with Secura, Bly was then sent to Honoghr.

In the battle, En's ship had also sustained heavy damage and was forced to crash-land on the planet. Investigating the incident, En tracked the Confederate Scientific Instrument Package that contained data pertinent to Trihexalophine1138 to a Rakatan temple, where it had been taken by the native Noghri.

It was the commander's hope that they would be able to retrieve the SIP without detection by the Noghri, but any attempt at stealth was abandoned when the Noghri ambushed the party. Retreating into the temple, Bly posted a trooper as a rear guard, with the order that were he to fall, another would take his place. By the time they had entered the temple, Bly and Secura were the only Republic troops left. Fighting off a horde of Noghri warriors, the pair were saved when Quinlan Vos entered the engagement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bly immediately recognized Vos as the renegade Jedi who had defected to the Confederacy and had become an associate of Count Dooku. Secura, who had been trained by Vos, asked him where his allegiances lay. The general believed Vos's claim that he was still acting as a double agent for the Jedi, but Bly was not so trusting. It took a direct order from Secura to prevent the clone commander from opening fire on Vos, but he was still far from happy with the situation. Vos, as a token of his goodwill, offered to aid Secura in obtaining the SIP, an offer the general accepted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the information that En had provided before his death, the trio knew where in the temple the SIP was being kept. More challenging was the elimination of the Noghri guards. Bly ventured out alone, drawing enemy fire, while Secura and Vos dispatched the enemy guards by stealth. Reaching the chamber holding the SIP, Vos pointed out that the area was booby-trapped with poisonous darts. Although the Jedi worked as a team to extract the device, the trap was triggered. Fortunately for the trio, no one was hurt, allowing them to escape the temple unharmed. When they were safely out of range, Vos demanded that Secura relinquish the SIP. Secura, displeased, ignited her lightsaber, prompting Vos to do likewise. Realizing that Vos was truly a threat to the mission, Bly attempted to shoot the renegade Jedi, but his target swiftly rounded on him and threw the clone hard into a wall with the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bly fell into unconsciousness, and as he came to, he witnessed Secura and Vos dueling fiercely. Eventually, Vos was able to overpower his former Padawan and prepared to land a killing blow. Bly, roused into consciousness, shot Vos in the shoulder.

The distraction was all Vos needed to escape on his ship, the Skorp-Ion, although Secura still possessed the SIP. Returning to their task force, Bly received treatment for wounds sustained during the Honoghr mission, although he was confused as to why his general considered the mission a failure. Following the Honoghr operation, Bly and Secura served a tour of duty on Anzat.

The Confederacy was using underground caves below the planet's capital to clone Morgukai warriors, who were subsequently trained by the Anzati. As these clones would be deadly warriors and an extremely effective tool for the Confederacy, the Republic hoped to preemptively halt this threat by besieging the capital city. The Republic's forces were commanded by Oppo Rancisis, with Quinlan Vos, who appeared to have defected once again, serving as the Senior Jedi General's second-in-command. During the siege, Bly worked closely with fellow commanders CC-8826 and Faie. Secura wished to speak with Vos following a large battle that had gained the Republic ground, so she sent Bly to make the request. Vos was displeased with the presence of the man who had recently shot him, and he brushed off Secura's request."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Secura, not to be deterred, met with Vos anyway, though she sent Bly away for some privacy. The following day, the Republic troops made their way into Saleucami's capital, with Bly once again fighting alongside his general. Eventually, Dark Acolyte Tol Skorr entered the skirmish, taunting Vos and leading him away from the battle. Bly was concerned, but Secura assured him that the situation was under control. Following the battle, control of the city remained contested, leaving the Republic forces with little choice but to return to their encampment. That night, Morgukai clones attacked the camp, forcing most of the Jedi committed to the Saleucami campaign to respond.

Meanwhile, the rest of the Jedi set out to remove the large planetary ion cannon that was preventing the Republic fleet from moving over the city and bombarding the Confederate installation. Bly and his men were tasked with making sure that no Morgukai warriors made it out of the enemy base alive. When the ion cannon was destroyed, Bly suggested to General A'Sharad Hett that an extraction team be sent after Vos and Secura, but the Jedi refused, urging Bly to continue pursuing his objectives. Hett's persistence paid off, as the Confederate base was demolished, and the enemy forces routed. Bulq and Skorr also perished in the battle, and the Siege of Saleucami was all but won.

While sparring in a practice fight with Secura, Bly was informed that Barriss Offee, who had been sent to Felucia to track down Separatist Council member Shu Mai some weeks prior, had not been heard from. Along with the new detachment of troops sent to Secura's command, a Jedi Padawan, Ekria, had been placed in the general's custody.

Secura was livid, insisting that Bly turn the Intrepid around and set a course for Coruscant, but the commander reasoned that they were too far away, and that the Felucia mission was still the priority.

Lo'gaan, driven into a rage, used the Force to throw Bly and his troops against a wall, knocking them out of commission. When Bly regained consciousness, he was met with the sight of Lo'gaan and Vader dueling. Waiting for an opening, the commander shot Lo'gaan in the shoulder, putting him at Vader's mercy. The Dark Lord took the opportunity, stabbing Lo'gaan and letting him plunge to his apparent death in the factory. Vader then congratulated Bly on finally completing his mission. Though none of the Imperials knew it, Lo'gaan and Ekria had in fact survived the encounter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A dependable clone trooper, Bly was bred to be fiercely loyal to the Republic and his superior officers. As a clone commander, he was allowed much more initiative and independence than his fellow clone troopers. Despite this, he always valued the mission as the most important thing in any situation, even over the wellbeing of his comrades. Bly felt it was better that he didn't have to concern himself with the politics or minutiae of his missions and was happy just to execute his orders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His unswerving dedication to the Republic and his objectives would lead him to deeply mistrust Quinlan Vos, even though Secura had assured him otherwise. Bly attributed his mistrust of Vos to his instincts, which he had received from his clone template, Jango Fett. Despite his feelings toward Vos, he respected the Jedi's abilities in combat. He also advocated Vos' killing of Noghri in cold blood, considering that the enemy would not hesitate to do the same to Bly or his allies. Nevertheless, his instincts told him to open fire on Vos when the situation on Honoghr intensified, despite Secura's orders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bly respected Secura's talents, namely her ability to successfully complete missions in a prompt fashion. He acknowledged that the Jedi were more suitable to command than the clones due to their natural ability with the Force, which heightened their coordination. He appreciated her sentiment that personal feelings were not as important as battlefield objectives, and he wished other Jedi would exhibit her restraint in such matters. His loyalty to Secura did not stop him from feeling alarmed at the recklessness of other Jedi generals. Bly and Secura's relationship became more personal during the war, making their method of operation less and less formal in the waning months of the conflict. However, even friendship could not override Bly's ingrained loyalty to the Republic, as he unquestioningly gunned down Secura in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The commander, in the late stages of the war, would be reassigned several times before being able to complete his mission. Following the Siege of Saleucami, Bly's frustration over being reassigned prompted him to train and exercise aboard the Intrepid, even taking time to spar with Secura in a practice fight. Darth Vader would capitalize on Bly's desire to complete his missions, enlisting him to track down Ekria and Drake Lo'gaan following the rise of the New Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, Bly utilized the standard Phase I clone trooper armor, sporting several customizations, including a kama command skirt which significed his rank, an ARC pauldron, and polarized macrobinoculars. He wielded a pair of krayt dragon pearl-handled DC-17 hand blasters, with which he was an expert shot, in addition to the standard DC-15A blaster rifle and the DC-15S. Occasionally, he would utilize a jetpack, an item he would use with a degree of expertise. At the Battle of New Holstice, he wore his Phase I armor without the customizations, but afterward would make the upgrade to Phase II armor. He held extensive knowledge of armed and unarmed combat skills, leadership skills, and military tactics."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Commander Bly made his first appearance in John Ostrander's Republic 65, where he was shown briefly conversing with Aayla Secura. He would later feature as the main character in Ostrander's Republic 68, which is told from Bly's perspective. Originally on the cover of Armor, Bly featured no yellow markings, which were added for the final version."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bly would once again play a supporting role in Ostrander's Star Wars: Republic: Siege of Saleucami, before appearing in Paul Ens' webstrip, Reversal of Fortune. Eventually, in 2005, Bly appeared in George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Originally, Bly was going to feature red markings in the film, but was changed to yellow to better fit the imagery of Felucia. The \"red Bly\" would later become Commander Deviss. Following Revenge of the Sith, Bly made appearances in the Clone Wars Adventures story What Goes Up... and the Reversal of Fortune sequel, Evasive Action: End Game. In Guide to the Grand Army of the Republic, Bly's number was incorrectly given as \"CT-80/88-2199,\" which conflicts with most other sources. Bly also made appearance in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series episodes \"Jedi Crash\" and \"Defenders of Peace,\" where he was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. Bly was given roles in The Clone Wars webcomics Headgames, Hunting the Hunters, Part I, and was recommissioned for the video game Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes as a playable character, where he was again voiced by Baker.

Holocron continuity database manager Leland Chee has stated that Lucasfilm Ltd. has not yet made a decision about how the Reversal of Fortune material would be retconned, though he personally could not see Offee returning to the Jedi Order in time for the events of the comic.
