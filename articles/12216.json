He wore a hood and his droid hands had been replaced with two grayish, bloated human hands. At 7 ABY, he was in service on the moon Grava when Han Solo and Lando Calrissian arrived there. He brought them to Seven-Seven Dirgeos as they requested but was later destroyed when Lando severed his head from his body with his blaster and took his head with him. Lando later used a map from Balthamus' head to find the location of the Phylanx Redux Transmitter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
