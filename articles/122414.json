The shaft of the weapon was formed from heavy wood with one end containing an obsidian blade while the other end possessed obsidian hooks and barbs. Each glaive was specially crafted by a Selonian female, much like young Jedi are required to build their own lightsaber. It was a mark of worthiness to use this melee weapon should the wielder be able to locate the appropriate materials for herself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
