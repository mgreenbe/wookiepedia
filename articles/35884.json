The fleet consisted of hundreds of vessels that ranged from dreadnoughts to assault gunboats, and included tens of thousands of TIE-series craft. The fleet was part of the garrison that was deployed as part of the military forces of the Death Star. Due to the size of the fleet and the garrison on the Death Star, personnel and equipment took up a large amount of space within the battle station, including hangars and magazines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fleet, along with the garrison, were led by Chief of the Imperial Navy Admiral Conan Antonio Motti, who was described as a veteran naval commander and one of the highest decorated officers in the Imperial Navy. While the fleet existed, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, the commander of the Death Star, decided not to deploy any naval escort with the battle station during the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although they did not participate in the battle, many vessels were caught in the explosion of the Death Star, including the Fortitude, which was an Imperial II-class Star Destroyer that served in the fleet. The Fortitude was critically damaged during the Battle of Yavin and was then renamed Tarkin's Will and served to avenge the Death Star's destruction as part of an assault group tasked by Darth Vader to hunt down and destroy the naval division so of the fragmented Alliance Fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
