It was capable of withstanding blistering heat, frigid cold, and monumental physical stress, even when very thin. Because of these properties, durasteel was used for everything from smelting pots for other less hearty metals to spacecraft hulls. However, it could still corrode in the same manner as lesser steel alloys, and likewise required maintenance.
