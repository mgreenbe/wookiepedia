They possessed small claws, which were believed to be vestigial fangs, that allowed them to manipulate the prey and force it into the saberjowl's mouth. They were known to possess scales that were green in color allowing them to blend in with the waters of Kamino. They also possessed a short row of fins along the dorsal ridge which added to their balance when swimming."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was learned that the saberjowls were actually a genetically engineered creature made from the material that made Naboo's colo claw fish, to which the saberjowl appeared almost identical.
