The pilot had to pass through the doorways in the proper series, without over-passing one. In later levels, there were also turrets inflicting simulated damage, in order to train the pilot's targeting abilities while in speed. The course was informally referred to as \"The Maze.\" Pilots were required to pass eight levels for any given ship, in order to earn a flight badge for it, certifying their skill."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels received the technology for the rings from the Verpine, which used them in the Vergesso Asteroids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Hoth, Rebel pilots began using a salvage yard as a proving ground, negotiating a course that used rings that formed a corridor, and also boosted the ship's speed temporarily.
