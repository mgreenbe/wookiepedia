Unexpected by the members of the crew, the light emitted from the solar flares of Lupal's star affected their minds, especially the Shistavanen Kordus Vrak, who attacked the other crew in a feral rage. Borzul fought with Vrak, allowing Romina Foss, Tucat's associate, to escape with the excavation droid RF-U5, leaping aboard their starship and leaving Vrak behind. However, as the ship entered into the moon's orbit, another solar flare lit up the cockpit, and, like Vrak before him, Borzul was driven mad."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
