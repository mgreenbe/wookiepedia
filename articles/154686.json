The Guardsman escaped from Onderon and traveled to the Imperial Royal Guard Academy on the planet Yinchorr, where he revealed what he knew to fellow Royal Guards gathered there.

The follow-up 1997\u20131998 series Crimson Empire, written by Mike Richardson and Randy Stradley and illustrated by Paul Gulacy, established a backstory for one of those Guardsmen, portraying his escape from Onderon with crucial information about Carnor Jax's betrayal."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Audio drama inconsistency"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 1999 audio dramatization of Crimson Empire combined this Guardsman's story with that of Kile Hannad, another Guardsman from the comic-book version of the story. During the stormtrooper attack on Yinchorr, Hannad and Kir Kanos are the last two Guardsmen left standing, and Hannad sacrifices his life to allow Kanos to escape. However, the original comic-book version portrays Hannad as a separate character and shows that the survivor of Onderon has already been killed by the stormtroopers before Hannad makes his own last stand.
