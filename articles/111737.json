Wishing to rescue Qin from the New Republic, he formed a team of mercenaries. Led by the ex-Imperial sharpshooter Migs Mayfeld, it included Xi'an, the Devaronian Burg and the droid Q9-0, known as \"Zero.\" Ran also contacted Djarin to be the fifth individual in this team. When Djarin arrived at the station, Ran greeted him and told him of the job. Rather than revealing it was to save Qin, he claimed to Djarin it was to save an associate who was captured by some competitors. Ran also revealed that they would be using the Djarin's gunship the Razor Crest. Djarin in was skeptical about this, but Ran told him he would not have let him on the space station otherwise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ran then introduced Din Djarin to Mayfeld. Djarin did not think much of his career as an Imperial sharpshooter and the mercenary told him that he had not been a stormtrooper. When Mayfeld saw the Razor Crest he claimed it looked like a Canto Bight slot machine. Ran also introduced Burg and Zero to Djarin. Xi'an then arrived and attempted to threaten Djarin with a dagger, which did not phase him. The team began planning their mission and studied the New Republic prison ship. Djarin, realizing they were dealing with the New Republic, expressed his worry about messing with the larger faction. Mayfeld silenced him and proceeded to discuss the plan for infiltrating the prison ship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Republic attack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The team infiltrated the prison ship, eventually freeing Qin from his cell. The mercenaries then betrayed Djarin, leaving the bounty hunter in a cell. After Djarin escaped, he fought each of them, imprisoning Mayfeld, Xi'an and Burg before destroying Zero aboard the Razor Crest and taking Qin with him. Djarin returned to the Roost with the Twi'lek, and was given payment. When Ran asked what had happened to the other mercenaries, Djarin told him \"no questions asked.\" After Djarin left aboard the Razor Crest, Ran ordered a gunship to kill him. As he did this, Qin discovered an active tracking beacon which Djarin had hidden with Qin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three New Republic T-65B X-wing starfighters then exited hyperspace, following the tracker.

In terms of personality Ran is amoral, caring primarily for profit or success over any moral values, as displayed by his rule of 'no questions asked' when in charge of Roost.
