Under the command of Admiral Brom Titus, the Interdictor succeeded in destroying one rebel patrol and capturing the CR90 corvette Liberator, the flagship of Phoenix Cell. Among their captives were Commander Jun Sato and Ezra Bridger, a young Jedi-in-training. During a rescue mission mounted by Kanan Jarrus, Rex, and Chopper, the Imperial Interdictor and its escort light cruisers were destroyed, leaving the surrounding space strewn with wrecked debris and starship parts. Admiral Titus survived the devastation in an escape pod and was retrieved by Agent Kallus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
