He was short, but respected by most Rebels for his tactical sense and sharp tongue. He had wrinkled features and a strip of white hair running down the middle of his head. Riskin was gruff, obnoxious, demanding, but at the same time very lovable. He had a humorous take to his own posture, making fun of the height of people who were taller than him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
