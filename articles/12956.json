Four years after the Battle of Yavin, D'an and the other members of the band played at the palace of Jabba the Hutt on the planet Tatooine. The band played Jedi Rocks for the Hutt, who ordered it played a second time but then dropped his slave Oola into his rancor pit during the repeat performance when she refused his advances. The Bith and the rest of the band stopped playing as Oola was eaten by the rancor, and then witnessed the arrival of Princess Leia Organa disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh with the Wookiee Chewbacca as a prisoner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Barquin D'an first appeared in the Special Edition re-release of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi in 1997.
