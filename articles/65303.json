During the Assault on Kamino, two dropships were used to assault the rebel positions until General Rahm Kota called Starkiller to aid them. The clone used the Force to send TIE Fighters strafing Timira City crashing into the transports."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These transports did not appear in the PS2, PSP, or Wii version of the Star Wars: The Force Unleashed video game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
