They were known for their lack of intelligence, which some postulated was due to their very small brain. While attending the New Republic Dagobah Tech school in 5 ABY, the young Jedi Prince Ken learned of the g'nooks as a part of his study of exobiology. Indeed, when Ken took the Dagobah Tech aptitude tests, several of the exobiology questions concerned that species. Accordingly, the Jedi Prince considered the test so ridiculous that only a g'nook could have designed its questions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The g'nooks were mentioned in the 1993 novel Mission from Mount Yoda, the fourth book of the Jedi Prince series written by Paul and Hollace Davids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
