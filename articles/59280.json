It consisted of a statue of a giant hand, with the palm facing upwards. The fingers were about three meters tall and a meter wide, while the palm had a diameter of five meters and was raised two meters above the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The artifact allowed it's controller to enhance their Force powers, by drawing power from someone who was placed inside the hand. However, the device was dangerous for the occupants, as if they didn't resist the attempts to drain their life force, then it would turn them into Force ghosts. The risk of dying was less for force-sensitives than it was for people who weren't attuned to the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Clone Wars, the artifact was discovered by the Tarasin Xinishia, a member of the Wyrd. She had the Wookiee Chywarra placed inside the hand and drew power from him, although he was able to survive the session. She then had Chywarra's mother, Risstenni, placed inside, although Risstenni was not so lucky and was turned into a Force ghost. Xinishia planned to use the artifact to cause Cloud Mountain, which was a dormant volcano, to erupt and destroy the settlement Kiirloor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
