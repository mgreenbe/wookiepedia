He attended an Imperial Academy with his friend Ianna Wick, who helped him through the academy. Tifino, however, rose through the Imperial ranks at a much faster rate than Wick, landing him a prestigious position in Krennic's service, where his unit discovered a deposit of kyber crystals on the sacred moon of Jedha. These crystals would ultimately be used for a secret Imperial superweapon project publicly disguised as Project Celestial Power. Tifino and Wick were present at the Imperial Ball together, where they were questioned by the HoloNet News reporter Calliope Drouth. In the ensuing conversation, Tifino drunkenly revealed confidential information regarding the excursion to Jedha."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
