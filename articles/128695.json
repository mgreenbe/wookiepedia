She was an old friend of Shmi Skywalker. After Shmi Skywalker's death, in 22 BBY during the Separatist Crisis, she used to place flowers on her grave at the Lars homestead every year. At some point during the Galactic Civil War, about twenty years later, the old woman Sorna was unable to do so. Circa 1 ABY, one of her friends, the manager of Tosche Station Cuan Talon hired a spacer to help the woman. Sorna thus sent the spacer to the Lars homestead to place the flowers for her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sorna was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There is a discrepancy between this storyline and Ryder Windham's novel, A New Hope: The Life of Luke Skywalker.
