During the year 32 BBY, Kee was present on the planet Tatooine in order to participate in the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. Flying a purple-colored inverted, Y-shaped podracer, Kee started on the nearside position of the last row, behind the seventeen other competitors. After the initial ceremonies, the race host Jabba the Hutt officially began the Boonta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kee fared poorly from the get-go, and was quickly passed by the pilot Anakin Skywalker, who had actually stalled on the starting grid and got a late start. Eventually during the second lap, in need of a short cut, Kee flew off course only to never be seen again. Following his disappearance police inspector Tan Divo acquired a hologram image depicting Jabba the Hutt paying bounty hunter Aurra Sing nearby the crash of Neva Kee's podracer. The image displayed two of Jabba's henchmen pulling Kee out of his podracer. All identifying authentimarks were scrubbed from the hologram, so is it unknown if it was true. Divo also developed a theory that Farwan & Glott, the original manufacturers of Kee's podracer, had hired Sing so that they could acquire the racer's customization secrets, which Kee had never shared."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Neva Kee was a blue and off-white-skinned Xamster with orange eyes.
