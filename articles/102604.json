With a narrow spaceframe flanked by large engines, the PTB-625 resembled other Incom/Subpro starfighters such as the Z-95 Headhunter, NTB-630 naval bomber, and the ARC-170. The PTB-625 was not as maneuverable as the NTB-630 and was designed for planetary bombardment. It was in common use by Republic Navy forces in the Outer Rim during the Clone Wars of 22 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The PTB-625 bomber was first mentioned in the 2005 Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections, a book detailing vehicles seen in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
