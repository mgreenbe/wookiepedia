At one point in his operational history, M-3PO aided an imprisoned smuggler named Roark Garnet in an escape attempt. Garnet was impeded by restraints and encouraged M-3PO to strangle a sleeping guard with a feather boa. Although M-3PO protested, citing the fact that he was not \"programmed to attack sentient beings,\" he relented. However, M-3PO decided that the correct thing to do would be to ask the guard for permission and he did so. This decision caused Garnet some degree of exasperation, since M-3PO's query awoke the guard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
