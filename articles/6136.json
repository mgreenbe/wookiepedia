He had long gangly arms and a green back with a striped pattern. Amanin were also known by the colloquial name \"head hunters\" due to their tendency to collect their victims' heads as souvenirs, and Amanaman was no exception; for a time (around 4 ABY), he wielded a staff from which three prized heads grotesquely hung. He also kept a dried, decapitated corpse at his side. All of these were from unidentified victims. He eventually collected 35 heads, displaying them on posts around the palace complex."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amanaman appeared in Return of the Jedi and was played by puppeteer Ailsa Berk.
