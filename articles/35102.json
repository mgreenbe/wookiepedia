Rendar ultimately saw Charn safely to Alderaan, but Vrill was killed during an assassination attempt on Bannistar Station. Despite his personal reasons for disliking the Empire, Rendar refused to abandon his independence to join the growing Rebellion.

The family's wealth ensured a comfortable and safe childhood for Rendar, along with his older brother Stanton, providing them with the best education available. The two started to follow different paths upon coming of age, however.

There, he practiced piloting a variety of starships and his skills soon began to impress both his instructors and fellow students, who included future smuggler and Rebel general Han Solo. Rendar seemed poised for a promising career as an Imperial officer until a family tragedy brought about a change in his fortunes. Prince Xizor, the head of the Black Sun crime syndicate, approached Rendar's parents about making RenTrans a subsidiary of his company, Xizor Transport Systems. When they refused, he arranged for one of their freighters to be sabotaged, hoping to cause a crash that would damage the company and force them to accept his offer. Stanton Rendar was piloting as the ship launched from a Coruscant spaceport and its control system failed, causing it to crash into the Imperial Museum. The resulting explosion destroyed both the freighter and much of the museum, killing Stanton in the process. Emperor Palpatine was furious and sought revenge on the grieving Rendar family for the loss of numerous Jedi and Sith artifacts that had been contained in the museum. The family's property and wealth was seized, RenTrans was turned over to Xizor Transport Systems, and Rendar's parents were banished from the Core Worlds.

Although his parents were still alive as of 0 BBY, Rendar had lost contact with them and did not know where they were. Details of how Rendar survived in the months immediately following his expulsion from the Academy were never recorded, but he eventually decided to use the skills he had learned at the Academy to make his own way in the galaxy. Moving to the Corporate Sector, he began to forge a place for himself among the galaxy's fringe elements as a freelance spacer. Rendar was not content to take easy, low-paying work, instead choosing to take jobs with higher risk in return for higher reward, and was prepared to work for whoever offered the most credits. During this time he worked as a smuggler, bodyguard, mercenary, thief, and card cheat. Through a series of daring and risky missions and scams, including breaking the record for the Sevari Sidestep with a cargo hold full of carsunum, and encounters with Imperial cruisers, pirates, bounty hunters, Black Sun operatives, rancors and an Imperial Inquisitor, Rendar made a name for himself as a hot-shot pilot. He went on to work with such individuals as Katya M'Buele and Lando Calrissian, teaming up with Calrissian on smuggling runs and con games after first meeting him over a sabacc table on Kaal. While hiding from Imperial Customs ships on Port Haven, an uncharted smugglers' hideaway, Rendar met up with Calrissian and Han Solo, his old friend from the Academy, who had also been forced out of Imperial service and become a smuggler. The three spent several hours attempting to impress each other with stories of their smuggling runs and piloting prowess while many credits passed between them in sabacc games. Early in his smuggling career, Rendar had a brief relationship with fellow spacer Nanika Senoj, which he ended as a result of her highly competitive nature."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among Rendar's employers was the Twi'lek crime lord \"Uncle\" Vanya, for whom Rendar worked as a mercenary. Vanya gave Rendar the YT-2400 light freighter Outrider to assist in his mercenary work, but Rendar intended to focus on smuggling and decided to convert the ship for his purposes. Not long after acquiring the Outrider, he visited Byblos Starport Tower 214 to enlist the services of the Sullustan technician Bolabo Hujaan in refitting the ship, upgrading its weapons, shields, ion drive, and hyperdrive, as well as fitting an illegal sensor stealth coating to the hull. The refitted Outrider was ideally suited as a smuggling vessel and went on to save Rendar's life countless times.  Though the upgrades cost Rendar most of the credits he had made from the carsunum shipment, he considered it a worthwhile purchase and was eager to make Solo jealous. The two went on to have a friendly rivalry over the speed of their respective ships, pitting them against each other multiple times, with Solo's Millennium Falcon narrowly beating the Outrider in at least one race. This competition led Solo to frequently dismiss the Outrider's abilities and, at one point, to throw a drunken punch at Rendar during a heated discussion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After acquiring the Outrider, Rendar enlisted the Nautolan Eaden Vrill as his co-pilot and partner. Around four months after Vrill joined his crew, the pair paid a visit to Rodia, where they encountered the Rodian comedian Kood Gareeda in The Nexu's Den cantina. Gareeda was seeking to sell LE-BO2D9, his Cybot Galactica LE-series repair droid, to fund a quick escape from Rodia. Although Rendar and Vrill were having financial difficulties at the time, Rendar considered the droid's navigation, piloting, weapons and repair programming to make it a useful purchase and agreed to buy the droid for 1,000 credits and passage off world, naming his new purchase Leebo. Moments after Gareeda left, arranging to meet the smugglers at their ship, four beings entered the cantina and headed straight for Rendar, Vrill and Leebo, who made a quick exit and returned to the Outrider. Gareeda failed to arrive for their rendezvous and the smugglers decided to leave without their passenger. However, shortly after taking the Outrider into space, they were attacked by a cruiser commanded by Kravengash, a Wookiee in the employ of the crime lord Hox Bilan. The cruiser's laser fire knocked out the Outrider's hyperdrive but Leebo calculated a slingshot orbit around an nearby gas giant which allowed them to kick-start the hyperdrive and escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Safely away from Rodia, Rendar and Vrill discovered the reason for the attacks; hidden beneath Leebo's restraining bolt was a datastick containing a list of Black Sun Vigos in Coruscant's Third Quadrant and details of their transactions and associates. Realizing that the datastick made them a target for not only Bilan but Black Sun and the Empire, the trio decided to flee across the galaxy through a nearby Hutt jumpgate. Upon arriving, however, they found that, not only was Kravengash's ship waiting for them, but the system's white dwarf star was only minutes from going supernova. With Kravengash blocking their way through the jumpgate, Leebo took one of the Outrider's escape pods and opened fire on the Wookiee's vessel. With Leebo providing a distraction, Rendar ejected the datastick into space and took the Outrider through the jumpgate. They were followed moments later by Leebo's escape pod, after the droid used the cruiser's bulk to shield him from the exploding star long enough to enter the jumpgate.

The ISB reported that the Outrider was a reward from Vanya and that the Rodian comedian briefly served as Rendar's co-pilot aboard the Outrider, until his untimely demise during the first twenty seconds of their debut mission. The report claimed that Leebo was the Rodian's droid and was chosen by Rendar to fill his former master's position as first mate aboard the Outrider, starting by assisting with the refitting of the ship as a smuggler vessel. Leebo then manipulated accounts to ensure that Vanya paid the cost of the refit, but the crime lord forgave Rendar after the smuggler saved his life during a Corporate Sector Authority Security Police raid. Rendar himself tended to be evasive about this period, though he often commented that the Outrider did not come into his possession through \"clean living\" and hinted that it was a gift from a Twi'lek employer. He also claimed that he acquired Leebo in exchange for providing Gareeda with passage off Rodia after the comedian offended the Rodians with a joke about their leader, Navik the Red.

As the Outrider approached the Pit, an asteroid field at the start of the Kessel Run, it was pulled out of hyperspace by an Interdictor-class cruiser. An Imperial light cruiser opened fire on the smugglers, but Rendar used the Outrider's greater maneuverability to slip by the larger vessel and towards the Maw, counting on the black holes to discourage the Imperials from pursuing. As the Outrider was caught in the Maw's immense gravitational pull, Rendar attempted to pull away on a new course, but the Outrider's port ion engine failed under the strain. Unable to escape on ion power only, Rendar attempted to jump to hyperspace, only to discover that the hyperdrive had sustained damage. Vrill quickly transferred power to the backup hyperdrive and Rendar made the jump to hyperspace. The smugglers escaped the Imperial ambush\u2014breaking Solo's record for the Kessel Run in the process\u2014but the secondary hyperdrive soon failed, leaving them stranded on the edge of Wild Space. Unable to salvage enough parts from either hyperdrive to fix the other, Rendar realized that they would be unable to deliver their cargo on time.

Leaving the ship in Docking Bay 92 behind Spacers Row, Rendar and Vrill headed to Chalmun's Cantina to find a pilot who was both willing and could be trusted to deliver their cargo to Nal Hutta. After an unsuccessful start, Chalmun, the cantina's Wookiee proprietor pointed Rendar towards a booth occupied by Han Solo. Rendar was unwilling to ask for his rival's help, but Vrill dismissed his objections and agreed to pay Solo twenty-seven percent of the cargo's value. After Solo left for Nal Hutta, Rendar discovered that the repairs would be both time consuming and more expensive than he could afford after subtracting Solo's share from the payment for the cargo run. Rendar and Vrill spent the next three days visiting cantinas around Mos Eisley in search of work to cover the repair costs. On the third day, Rendar was directed towards a pair of human females who were recruiting in Chalmun's Cantina. To Rendar's surprise, the pair revealed themselves as the famous holostar Javul Charn and her road manager Kendara Farlion, and explained that they were seeking a bodyguard to protect Charn from a stalker during her upcoming tour.

After being shown to their quarters aboard the Nova's Heart, at the head of the aft quarterdeck, opposite Charn's suite, they were taken on a tour of the ship by Farlion and the Nova's Heart's captain, Serdor Marrak. Rendar was impressed by the vessel and took the opportunity to acquaint himself with its layout and systems, both of which had been altered from the standard specifications, along with any potential weaknesses in security. Following the tour, Rendar and Vrill were introduced to the rest of the crew over dinner, before they briefed Charn and Farlion on their first impressions. Having learned that the body of a stowaway fan had once been found hidden in a container, Rendar believed that the cargo hold was the weak point in the ship's security and resolved to speak to the cargo master, Yanus Melikan, as soon as possible."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Trouble on Rodia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following morning, as the Nova's Heart arrived in the Tyrius system for the first leg of the tour, Rendar met with Melikan on the cargo deck to familiarize himself with the Nova's Heart's loading procedures. While the two talked, a siren sounded, warning of a hull breach on the aft quarterdeck. Rendar and Melikan made their way to the quarterdeck, arriving shortly after Vrill, Leebo and the ship's engineer, Arruna Var. The aft section had sealed automatically in response to the hull breach, trapping Charn on the other side, but Leebo was able to ascertain that it was a false alarm and overrode the door lock, allowing the group proceeded to Charn's quarters. They arrived to find the door locked and could hear both Charn and Farlion's voices inside as they attempted to get out. When the voices suddenly stopped, Leebo once again forced the door open, allowing Rendar, Vrill and Melikan inside. However, they found no sign of either Charn of Farlion in the suite. A thorough search of the room revealed an escape tunnel hidden behind a false wall. Moments later, Charn and Farlion returned through the main door, explaining that they had taken the escape tunnel to the cargo bay when the door had failed to open. Var and Bran Finnick, the Nova's Heart's first officer later revealed that the false alarm and power failure had been triggered by a remote signal, hidden within the approach protocols sent by the Rodian Space Authority as the ship entered the system. Knowing that this would have required resources beyond those of the average stalker, Rendar came to suspect that Charn was not telling him everything. When he questioned her, she revealed that the stalker was linked to Black Sun and believed her to be Alai Jance, a small-time singer who had been engaged to the Black Sun Vigo Hityamun Kris before leaving him and disappearing. With Black Sun active on Rodia, Rendar attempted to persuade Charn to cancel her performances there, but she refused."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving on Rodia, Rendar escorted Charn to the venue for her scheduled performances, the Holosseum in Equator City, before leaving her in Vrill's care and heading to the Equator City Flight Control Authority with Leebo. The staff there refused to grant him access to the log of outgoing messages to uncover who had triggered the false alarm, so Rendar enlisted Leebo's help in slicing into the facility's computer to retrieve the information. Leebo bypassed the security systems by routing his access through the MSE-6-series repair droid E3E3EEK, which the droid decided to take as a pet when the pair left the building and later nicknamed Mousie. They returned to the Nova's Heart, where Var examined the recovered log and determined that the signal had been sent directly from the Flight Control Authority building and not by a remote slicer. Rendar then returned to the Holosseum, arriving just in time to see Vrill save Charn's life as she fell to the stage during a rehearsal. An investigation revealed that a power surge from the city grid had caused a series of equipment failures, culminating in damage to Charn's antigrav unit. The power surge again suggested that somebody powerful had been involved, but Rendar was also concerned that the convenient timing suggested an accomplice among Charn's crew. He voiced his concerns to Charn and once again urged her to cancel the Rodia shows. Although she again refused, Charn admitted that she was in fact Alai Jance and that Kris himself was the one pursuing her. Charn had begun a relationship with Kris early in her career, but called off their engagement when she realized that he was using her tours to smuggle drugs, weapons and even people aboard her ship. The revelation made Rendar contemplate quitting, but his financial situation and desire to protect Charn convinced him to stay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rendar implemented new security procedures for the concerts on Rodia.

The first two performances were uneventful, but on the third night Hityamun Kris arrived backstage to speak to Charn. Rendar and Leebo accompanied Charn as she met with the Mandalorian Vigo. Kris told Charn that he still cared for her and warned her not to be stubborn. Knowing Rendar's reputation as a pilot, Kris also offered him four times what Charn was paying to work for him, but Rendar declined. Although Kris stayed to watch from a skybox, the final Rodian performance passed without further incident. During the night, Rendar went to speak to Charn in her quarters, but when he found her missing he feared that she had been kidnapped via the escape tube. He and Vrill took the tunnel to the cargo bay, where they found Melikan's apprentice, Nik, still awake. The young Sullustan informed them that he had seen Charn leave the ship alone in the direction of Port Town. Rendar and Vrill followed and soon arrived in a busy street filled with cantinas. After searching several of the venues without success, the smugglers located Charn in a club called Every Delight.

However, when Rendar surveyed the damage, he noticed that the hatch was blown out, suggesting that somebody inside the ship had triggered the explosion. Melikan sealed the breach, but the Nova's Heart would need full repairs before undertaking a lengthy hyperspace journey. Unable to complete repairs on Christophsis, and with Rendar concerned that a saboteur was attempting to force them back to Rodia, Charn decided instead to return to Tatooine for repairs and to make the journey to Christophsis in the Outrider, rendezvousing with the Nova's Heart later in the tour. After arriving on Tatooine, Rendar visited Kerlew to hire him to repair the Nova's Heart and to check on the Outrider's progress. Despite Charn's offer to pay extra up front, however, Kerlew could not complete repairs to the Outrider's hyperdrive in time for the Christophsis performances. When Rendar returned to the Nova's Heart, he found that Charn had once again left the ship. He and Vrill later located her in Chalmun's Cantina, where she had arranged for Han Solo\u2014freshly returned from delivering Rendar's cargo\u2014to take her to Christophsis in case the Outrider could not be repaired in time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rendar was unhappy with the idea of traveling aboard his rival's ship and threatened to quit, causing Charn to confide that she was not simply being pursued by a jilted lover; when she left Kris, she reported his activities to the Imperial Security Bureau, leading to the arrest of several key members of Black Sun, and making herself a personal enemy of Prince Xizor. Rendar began to suspect that both Kris and Xizor were involved, with Kris trying to scare Charn into returning to him, while Xizor sought to kill the singer. Concerned for her safety, Rendar agreed to stay on as security chief. He arranged for Melikan and his Otoga-222 maintenance droid, Oto, to inspect every crate as it was transferred to Solo's Millennium Falcon and advised Charn to take only those of her crew who she trusted completely to avoid further sabotage. In addition to Rendar, Vrill and Leebo, Charn chose to take Farlion, Melikan, Nik and Oto.

Leaving Charn and Solo, Rendar began a security sweep of the ship. Even though the maintenance droids he had left to watch the cargo bays had recorded nobody entering, Rendar conducted his own inspection, during which the Millennium Falcon dropped out of hyperspace for a routine course change, and the cargo bay's artificial gravity simultaneously failed, leaving him suddenly airborne, along with the hold's numerous cargo containers. Rendar managed to reach the gravity controls near the cargo bay door, but found them non-responsive and the door locked. With no way out, Rendar contacted Vrill in the cockpit for help. As Vrill made his way to the cargo bay, the gravity suddenly returned, leaving Rendar slumped against the door as a large, cylindrical container rolled towards him. Vrill opened the door just in time, and Rendar cleared the room moments before the container slammed into the wall. Leebo subsequently ascertained that the gravity failure was the result of sabotage to a circuitry box in the engineering section and was set to activate when the Millennium Falcon entered or exited hyperspace, but the droid was unable to determine whether the saboteur was still aboard or had acted while the ship was docked on Tatooine. The affected cargo hold contained key equipment for Charn's show and Melikan suggested that the intent may have been to cause sufficient damage to postpone or cancel the Christophsis performances.

Charn's next three performances were scheduled for Falleen Throne, the capital of Xizor's homeworld of Falleen. Fearing Xizor's involvement in the attacks, Rendar went to Charn's dressing room as the tour prepared to leave Christophsis to persuade her to skip the concert and proceed straight to her next stop on Bannistar Station. As he arrived he heard Charn and Kris talking inside. Rendar listened as the Mandalorian Vigo tried to dissuade her from visiting Falleen, claiming that he could only protect her from Xizor if she returned to him on Rodia. When Kris grabbed Charn's arm, Rendar entered and drew his blaster pistol on the Vigo, only to find himself outnumbered when Kris's bodyguards emerged. The standoff was soon broken, however, by the arrival of Vrill, Solo and Melikan. After disarming the Black Sun trio, Rendar and the others quickly departed on the Millennium Falcon.

Charn admitted that her actions had been more damaging to Black Sun than she had previously let on, and had resulted in the collapse of Xizor's operations along the Corellian Trade Spine.

Rendar was concerned about a possible attack as the Millennium Falcon departed Falleen and carried out a thorough examination of the ship before leaving, during which he caught sight of somebody departing the ship through an airlock. Fearing that the being was a saboteur, Rendar gave chase, but soon realized that he was pursuing Charn. Rendar followed the singer to a Wayfarer's Temple in a ground level plaza, where he found her speaking to an Equilibrate priest in a small chapel. Taking cover behind a pillar, Rendar watched as the priest gave Charn a small data wafer. As Charn turned to leave, she made it clear that she was aware of Rendar's presence and he escorted her back to the ship. When he asked her what she was up to in the turbolift back to the landing pad, Charn claimed that she was an Equilibrate and that the data wafer contained a copy of the religion's holy book, the Fulcrum.

It did not take long for their assailant to realize their deception and the Anomid quickly made his way to the Falcon's new level. As Rendar and Charn made their way to the docking bay, the assassin emerged from a turbolift behind them to be met by covering fire from Vrill and Solo, who were making their way toward their allies. The group's fire harmlessly struck the Anomid's personal energy shield and the assassin returned fire with a Rodian throwing razor, which narrowly missed the fleeing Humans on its initial pass. Rendar attempted to shoot the razor down as it came back, but missed, forcing him to leap to the ground to avoid being hit. Removing her robe, Charn threw it into the razor's path, slowing it down enough for her to get a clear shot. At that moment, Vrill and Solo reached Rendar and Charn.

After arriving, Charn's group were met by Bannistar Station's commanding officer, Commander Arno D'Vox. D'Vox offered to take Charn on a tour of the station, to which she agreed, provided that Rendar and Vrill could accompany her. It soon became clear that D'Vox was attracted to Charn and, despite Rendar's concerns, the singer agreed to dine with him that evening in the hopes of persuading him to rearrange the station's modules. The commander agreed to her request, but did not include the module she needed in the plans and Charn tasked Rendar with finding another way to reach the cargo. The solution came when Solo, hoping to make a profit from his trip, negotiated to sell some cargo he was carrying to the local traders Kyobuk and Sars Tarquhar. Rendar persuaded them to book the hangar containing Charn's cargo in which to make their exchange, then accompanied Solo to meet with Kyobuk and Tarquhar the following day, and loaded the Rebel container aboard the Millennium Falcon while Solo concluded his business."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although there was no indication that the Imperials were aware of Charn's true purpose, Rendar had Solo keep the Millennium Falcon ready to leave at a moment's notice.

With four interconnected modules surrounding Charn's centerpiece, Rendar chose to split them between himself, Vrill, Leebo and Oto. During the concert Rendar and Vrill spotted Edge among the spectators lining the walkways on Oto's module. While he made his way over to the assassin, Rendar contacted Oto to warn him, prompting Oto to open the hatch between the spectators' area and the security walkway the droid was patrolling. The assassin took the opportunity to move onto the security walkway but was stopped there by Vrill. As Rendar reached the walkway, Edge stabbed Vrill with a darkstick and fired a cable across to Charn's platform, allowing him to swing over to the singer. Rendar rushed to his partner's aid, but Vrill, knowing that his wound was mortal, told Rendar to ignore him and save Charn. The impact of Edge's landing had caused the centerpiece to begin swinging, allowing Rendar to jump across as it swung close to his platform. Rendar landed between the assassin and his target just as Edge launched a throwing razor at Charn. The razor missed its target and Rendar shot it as it returned, causing him to be hit in the eye by shrapnel. Edge threw another razor, which Charn also evaded. As it returned to Edge, Rendar fired at the floor near the assassin's feet. The resulting spray of of slag transparisteel caused Edge to miss catching the razor, which struck him in the shoulder. Moments later the lights went out; unable to see Edge, Rendar climbed the stairs towards Charn, whose holo-emitter lenses made her eyes clearly visible in the dark. Rendar reached Charn with Edge just a few meters behind him and told her to close her eyes. As the assassin approached, Rendar instructed Charn to open her eyes, drawing Edge's attention to her while Rendar opened fire. The blasts struck the Anomid's armor but failed to stop his advance.

Rendar had little time to rest, however, as Leebo revealed that Oto had been attempting to shoot the cables holding Charn's platform in place during the attack. After fitting the droid with a restraining bolt, Rendar, Leebo and Melikan questioned him and discovered that Oto was the saboteur and was working for Kris, Xizor and the Imperial Security Bureau. Bran Finnick was secretly working for Hityamun Kris and had arranged for Oto to be reprogrammed to sabotage Charn's tour in an attempt to scare her into returning to the Vigo. However, the new subroutines had allowed Xizor to gain access to the droid and program him to kill Charn. Finally, the Imperial Security Bureau, attempting to uncover Charn's involvement with the Rebel Alliance, had programmed Oto to gather evidence and to alert Imperial forces when she met with her Rebel contacts. When the droid revealed that he was due to send their location to both Xizor and the Empire when they next dropped out of hyperspace, Rendar had an idea. Deactivating the droid, they dropped out of hyperspace and sent a warning to Captain Marrak aboard the Nova's Heart about Finnick, at the same time arranging to rendezvous in the Circarpous system. They then made another jump away from their intended destination, reactivating Oto temporarily when they next reverted to realspace so the droid could send his signal and lead Black Sun and the Empire in the wrong direction. Before they could jump back to hyperspace, however, Kris arrived aboard his personal yacht.

Rendar pointed out that his eye injury would prevent him from aiming with any accuracy and Solo grudgingly agreed to let Rendar pilot the Millennium Falcon while he crewed the turret. Rendar aimed the ship towards Circarpous Major, hoping proximity to the star would hamper their pursuers' systems, only to see Kris's vessel approaching from the direction of the star.

Lucasfilm's Howard Roffman and Lucy Wilson prepared a two-page outline of the basic premise for the project's story, which would be set between Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. This initial outline included the idea of an assassin targeting Luke Skywalker and a bodyguard assigned to protect him. In a meeting between Lucasfilm and their licensees in November 1994 to develop an outline of the plot, Steve Perry proposed the character of Rendar, who it was decided should take on the bodyguard role. The LucasArts representatives liked the new character and soon made the decision to use him as the player character in the video game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Perry envisioned Rendar as a dashing character who would fill the gap left by Han Solo's imprisonment in carbonite at the end of The Empire Strikes Back. However, as the project moved forward, Dark Horse artist Kilian Plunkett developed some designs of the character that differed from Perry's initial idea. In Plunkett's sketches, Rendar was tough, wild-eyed, unshaven, disheveled, and starting toward overweight. Plunkett wanted to keep the character in the same vein as Solo, but to ensure that they were not too similar in appearance, a concern shared by Bantam editor Tom Dupree. On one of his early sketches, Plunkett noted that Rendar was the \"character most likely to have 'mom' tattooed on his arm.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the same time, concept artist Mike Butkus developed dozens of preliminary sketches of Rendar, showing variations in armor and clothing but sticking to a more clean cut appearance. Butkuss, who listens to music while he illustrates, explained that Rendar was designed while listening to Elvis Presley and 1960s rock 'n' roll. Butkus's designs were circulated to those working on the project and led to some disagreement over the appearance of the character. LucasArts lead artist and designer Jon Knoles had concerns about Butkus's sketches from a game design perspective, wanting to see his muscles toned down, his clothing less tight and his bushy hair replaced with something less \"goofy.\" Knoles suggested either following Plunkett's ideas of a mean-looking character or making him have the appearance of a determined, angry young warrior. Knoles's own designs experimented with the character further, with variations on armor, helmets, a mustache, and a Vandyke beard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucy Wilson favored a young and heroic appearance for Rendar and Tom Dupree wanted the character to be a Top Gun-style fighter pilot who would have a combination of talent and ego that led to a natural competitiveness with Skywalker. Over four or five months, Butkus and Knoles refined the designs, settling on a final design that was a middle ground between Butkus's clean-cut and Plunkett's rugged sketches. LucasArts produced a sculpture of this final design, which was scanned to provide dimensional information used in producing his computer model."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As with his appearance, Rendar's backstory was also refined during the development of the project. An early biography of Rendar included in Knoles's Game Design Outline document, dated January 26, 1995, describes Rendar as an enlisted pilot in the Imperial Academy who crashed a prototype Imperial fighter into a statue of Emperor Palpatine while conducting a careless maneuver during a ceremony for the Emperor on Coruscant. Rendar was called before the Emperor and made to watch as a gladiator droid executed his brother, an independent freighter pilot who was suspected of having Rebel sympathies. Rendar was subsequently sentenced to life on a dungeon ship, but was freed during a Rebel raid on the prison. Inheriting the Outrider from his brother and filled with a desire to gain vengeance on the Empire, Rendar dedicated himself to the Rebel Alliance, but, while his skills were seen as invaluable, he gained a reputation for reckless tactics that put both himself and others at risk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Shadows of the Empire game was one of the early Nintendo 64 titles and the new technology presented LucasArts with the opportunity to recreate scenes from the original trilogy in a way that had not previously been possible, specifically the Battle of Hoth, which had first appeared in The Empire Strikes Back. To accommodate this, Rendar's biography was written to incorporate his involvement in the battle, which is depicted in the opening levels of the game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Steve Perry's original outline for Shadows of the Empire described Rendar escaping the climactic battle over Coruscant moments before Darth Vader's forces destroy Xizor's skyhook. It was later decided that the destruction of the Outrider would make a more dramatic ending for the novel, but this presented a problem for LucasArts, who were concerned about killing off the player character at the end of the game. One possible solution would have been to change the player character to Skywalker, but LucasArts wanted to explore a new character in the game. To accommodate the game, Rendar's death was left ambiguous in the novel and the game includes a final cutscene, shown only when completed on the harder difficulty settings, in which Rendar and Leebo discuss their last-minute escape. Rendar's survival was also revealed in Shadows of the Empire: Evolution and has been mentioned in several reference sources, including The Official Star Wars Fact File 25, The New Essential Guide to Characters, and The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inconsistencies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The video game version of Shadows of the Empire differs from the story as told in the novel and comic versions.

The second section, \"In Search of Boba Fett,\" depicts Rendar's hunt for the bounty hunter after being hired by Lando Calrissian, which is also only mentioned in the novel. This section culminates in a fight between Rendar and Fett, leaving Fett's ship damaged and stuck on Gall. The opening crawl to the third section, \"Hunting the Assassins,\" refers to the failed rescue attempt by the Rebels as shown in the novel and comic, suggesting that Rendar's own encounter with Fett occurs before the Rebels arrive in the system and he leads them to the bounty hunter. In the novel, Rendar agrees to carry the Bothan boarding party on their mission to board the Suprosa and retrieve the supercomputer containing the Death Star II plans, but the game features a mission in which Rendar personally boards the vessel and retrieves the computer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The major differences between the game and other versions come in the fourth section, \"Lair of the Dark Prince.\" In the novel and comic, Rendar accompanies Skywalker, Calrissian, and Chewbacca into Xizor's Palace, locating Organa and escaping moments before the palace is destroyed by a thermal detonator thrown down a garbage chute by Calrissian. In the game, however, Skywalker instructs Rendar to find a way to cover their escape while the others search for Organa. Rendar makes his own way through the sewers leading to the palace, and places pulse bombs on the service panels for the elevator connecting the palace to Xizor's skyhook, destroying the palace and cutting off the skyhook. After leaving Coruscant, the novel and comic show Rendar helping to fight Black Sun's fighters until the Imperial forces under Darth Vader destroy Xizor's skyhook, allowing them to escape. In the game, Rendar engages the skyhook in the Outrider, destroying its turbolasers, before flying inside and taking out the power core. Instead of being struck by debris while escaping, in the game, Rendar appears to be killed when he fails to escape the skyhook in time before the power core is destroyed. According to Jon Knoles, the decision to have Rendar attack the Skyhook was made \"to prove he's the greatest gung-ho dude in the galaxy.\" Where the differing versions cannot be reconciled, this article follows the events as depicted in the novel and comic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rendar's physique varies in different sources, between his svelte depiction in Michael Sutfin's illustration for The New Essential Guide to Characters and the muscular Rendar as shown in the Hildebrandts' paintings.

The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 1 also contradicts the Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook, stating that Rendar personally liberated the Outrider's KGDefender engines from the Imperial Academy on Corulag.
