It utilized microparticle accelerators to agitate ionized gases to relativistic velocities, and featured independently articulated ion stream deflector manifolds for pinpoint maneuvering accuracy. It also supplemented power yields through a set of solar gather panels that would become synonymous with TIE fighter designs for years to come."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars, the SIE-TIE design was endorsed and adopted by Republic Sienar Systems, in an announcement made to HoloNet News reporters on Lianna. The SIE-TIE was set to go into mass-production, and would be available for purchase by the governing bodies of Republic member worlds. News of the approval gave Santhe/Sienar Technologies stock an immediate 27.58 credit gain, and Raith Sienar himself was believed to have totaled a personal net worth of 640 million credits due to the stock increase."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the success of the SIE-TIE, Republic Sienar Systems reported that power-yield compatibility issues with current hyperdrive, life support, and shielding technologies could prove prohibitive in incorporating the engine into their starship designs. This fault was not rectified with the later P-s4 model."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
