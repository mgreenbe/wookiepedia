An alien sidekick would draw too much attention to Starkiller, whereas droids were so common in the galaxy that nobody would give them a second look, allowing the apprentice to keep a low profile during his travels. The developers also thought it important that Starkiller and the droid have a long-standing relationship, similar to the one between Han Solo and Chewbacca.

Since droids could also be programmed with loyalty, Vader would never have any reason to distrust the sidekick character."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The developers next tried to determine in what way the droid was comic. They conceived him as something of a half-way point between C-3PO and HK-47. They attempted to stay away from C-3PO's panicky nature, but also did not want to give him HK-47's cold, calculating personality. They next set about working on developing what unique special abilities the droid would have. They came up with the idea that the droid would be given to the apprentice by Vader, but would also serve some purpose for the Dark Lord, and so it was decided that the sidekick would be a training droid designed to help the apprentice hone his skills. Thus, he was programmed with a range of fighting styles and equipped with technology that would make him a worthy enough adversary for the apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When writing the droid's dialogue, Project Lead Haden Blackman was able to come up with the character's comic aspect by contrasting his sadistic programming, to kill the apprentice, with his na\u00efve and innocent personality. The droid wanted to please his master, the apprentice, by fulfilling his main programming, but did not realize that in doing so he would kill his master. The droid was finally given an advanced hologram array and transforming chassis to solve the problem of Vader not being able to confront the apprentice in the flesh at any given point in the game. With his new abilities, the droid sidekick could take on the appearance of Vader whenever the Dark Lord wished to speak with the apprentice. It was from this that PROXY received his name\u2014his abilities allowed him to become another character's \"proxy\" when they wished to communicate with the apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the early brainstorming sessions for \"Jedi Outlaw,\" one of the many video game concepts the development team came up with prior to settling on The Force Unleashed, featured a droid character who was a \"reverse cyborg.\" Dubbed \"corpse droid,\" the character would have been a demented droid who was obsessed with replacing his mechanical components with organic ones. Corpse droid eventually found his way into some of the early drafts of The Force Unleashed and was initially chosen to fulfill PROXY's role as the \"comic droid sidekick.\" Corpse droid would still be serving as a training droid for the apprentice, but would be obsessed with wanting to become an organic being would use body parts from enemies the apprentice defeated. Soon, however, the developers realized that corpse droid was too bizarre and did not fit with team dynamic created by the other main characters. Additionally, the only way to emphasize the character's comic nature would have been to bring corpse droid's \"hobby\" of organ harvesting to the forefront, which was seen as too mature and gruesome for what was intended to be a Teen-rated game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a G4 exclusive interview with Haden Blackman it was revealed that PROXY would be an unlockable playable character in the video game.
