The students were asked to bring up the best solution to the problem. Anakin Solo found a way to create a levee by using the Force to loosen some rocks. While Anakin got high marks for the solution, he had not paid enough attention to the history of the village, a fact which was later criticized by Mara Jade Skywalker during their stay on Dantooine. Apparently, the residents of the village knowingly settled in the floodplain, thus were in a constant danger of being flooded. Anakin's solution, while being effective on the spot, didn't provide the settlers with a way to independently solve the problem, leaving them to trust the Jedi next time disaster struck."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
