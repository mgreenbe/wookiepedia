They were primarily run by Vogga the Hutt, and managed by a Twi'lek named Fassa. The Docks had a bar known as the Jekk'Jekk Tarr, and a flophouse, which was occupied by people such as Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell, Mira, Lasavvou, and Lootra."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Jedi Exile came to Nar Shaddaa in search of Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell, she came to the Docks, helping other people and performing many tasks there. The Exile even persuaded Vogga to supply the Citadel Station above Telos IV with fuel from Sleheyron, and served as one of Vogga's dancing girls. When an Exchange leader, Visquis, who worked for Goto, invited the Exile to Jekk'Jekk Tarr, she was intercepted by a bounty hunter, Mira, who took her to her room and knocked her out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, after Goto captured the Exile, the Champ sold the Exile's droid, T3-M4, to Vogga, but T3-M4 escaped with one of Vogga's launch codes and destroyed three HK-50 droids. This allowed the Exile's companions to find the Visionary. The Exile returned here later and encountered Zez-Kai Ell, whom the Exile could have convinced to return to the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
