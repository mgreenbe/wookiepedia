It was a very formidable weapon capable of stunning everything from small infantry such as a stormtrooper to extremely large opponents such as a rancor. They could also be used to stun mechanical devices such as tanks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The carbonite gun appeared quite like an ordinary blaster pistol from a first glance; however, unlike the blaster pistol, the gun emitted a deep ion blue blast when fired that could render an enemy immobile and defenseless for a considerable amount of time. During the time the target was immobilized, they could be attacked without a chance for self-defense, or in some cases, simply be smashed by a blow from the weapons' reinforced butt. After a few moments, however, they would thaw, and there was no sign of hibernation sickness. The enemy could easily attack as if nothing had happened. These weapons had a short range but in the right hands could be an extremely effective and fearsome weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Empire in its reports noted that the weapons made their enemies formidable warriors when wielding these."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The gun was originally invented by scientists from the planet Empress Teta; however, the weapon had fallen into the possession of several groups afterward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 980 BBY, carbonite guns were discussed as a potential method of subduing Darth Bane.
