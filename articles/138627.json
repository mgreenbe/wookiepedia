In previous twin-fuselage TIE designs, this been a munitions bay or passenger nacelle, but on the TIE Reconnaissance Fighter, it housed a number of advanced systems intended to improve the fighter's combat and infiltration performance. There was a hyperdrive, a navigation computer, a deflector shield generator, and a full life support system, which had not been standard on most earlier TIEs, plus sophisticated stealth countermeasures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fighter may not have been quite as advanced as the StealthX, however.
