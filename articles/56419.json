He was present in the Red Light Sector when he encountered the Hero of Tython, who was there to destroy several power conduits around the sector. Graul was tasked with preventing the Jedi Knight from ruining Sadic's plan. Graul engaged the Hero with several Mark I Power Guards, but they were all killed by the Jedi. After Graul's death, the Hero recovered an encrypted datapad from the Commander's body.
