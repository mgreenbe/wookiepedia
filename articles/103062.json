Young Anakin Skywalker and the Gungan Jar Jar Binks also were brought along. A short time after arriving at the apartment, Anakin and Jar Jar were waiting outside the apartment' sitting room with the Gungan sitting in a small chair. Captain Quarsh Panaka walked passed them as he entered the sitting room where Queen Amidala sat on a small couch as two of her handmaidens stood behind her on either side. Panaka stood off to the side as Senator Palpatine paced before the young queen, relating about the corruption within the Galactic Senate and how there was little chance of the Senate taking action in response to the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo. Queen Amidala stated that Supreme Chancellor Valorum believed there was chance to which Palpatine informed her that the Chancellor held little real power in the Senate. Amidala then asked what their options were."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moving towards the young queen, Palpatine stated that the election of a new Supreme Chancellor was their best option, suggesting she call for a Vote of No Confidence in Valorum. Stunned by the senator's words, Amidala countered with how Valorum had been supporting them. Palpatine stepped back and started to pace again as he explained their only other option was to go to the courts and submit their plea. Remaining in her seat, Queen Amidala voiced her frustration, reiterating their people were dying and that they needed a fast solution. Palpatine stood still as he gave his queen an apologetic look before pacing again, informing her that for the moment they would have to accept Federation control of their planet. The senator stopped and looked back to Queen Amidala as she informed him she could not do what he was suggesting. Meanwhile outside the sitting room, Anakin pulled Jar Jar out of his chair and led him off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
