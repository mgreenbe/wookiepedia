On several occasions, he was able to save Palpatine's life\u2014first, when Palpatine was attacked by the specters of long-dead Sith Lords on Korriban, and secondly on Kaal, when the Emperor's spirit journeyed from Endor and bonded with Droga.

Inhabiting his final clone body, the Emperor soon learned that the body's cell structure was deteriorating due to further sabotage, and that it would soon expire. Faced with the prospect of having no body to possess, Palpatine planned to inhabit the infant Anakin Solo, the grandson of Anakin Skywalker. Droga strongly cautioned against the plan, and he was proven right when Palpatine died his final death at the hands of Empatojayos Brand. Driven to insanity by the loss of his master, Droga's hope of a returned Palpatine was rekindled by the Second Imperium, which appeared to be headed by the Emperor. He soon realized that the Second Imperium's Palpatine was little more than a scam, and he found himself left with no cause to fight for.

He had lived an erratic life, and had poured his energies and emotions into mastering the art of the lightsaber. In particular, he was a practitioner of the Jar'Kai form, which allowed him to wield his two lightsabers, one red-hued and one yellow-hued, in each hand. He and Palpatine were bonded through a psychic link\u2014a link that the Emperor would frequently use to his advantage.

The Emperor's Hand also traveled with his master to the Sith world of Korriban, home to the tombs of long-dead Sith Lords. In 0 ABY, Palpatine demanded knowledge of the dark side from the entombed and mummified Sith Lords, sparking their rage. They cowed the Emperor, prompting Droga to rush to Palpatine's rescue.

When Droga reached the Yushan sector, he felt his master's death through the Force. At that moment, aboard the Emperor's Shadow, Droga's body wrenched in pain, and he began screaming. He then fell into a state of insanity, crushing the windpipe of one of his crew members before taking his dual lightsabers to the rest of his subordinates. In his rampage, he smashed the bridge controls of the Emperor's Shadow, causing the ship to plummet into one of the oceans of Kaal. Palpatine's spirit, which had survived Endor, journeyed all the way to Kaal and entered Droga's body. Now infused with Palpatine's tremendous dark energy, Droga was driven to madness. In time, Grand Vizier Sate Pestage was able to extract Palpatine's essence from Droga's body, allowing the Emperor to inhabit one of his clone bodies.

Over the next year, he would do battle with Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and his sister Leia Organa Solo, and would perish multiple times. Following the destruction of the dreadnought Eclipse, the remainder of Palpatine's spare clone bodies were destroyed by Nefta and Sa-Di, Dark Side Adepts who were planning to take Palpatine's place as ruler of the galaxy.

Droga suggested that he and the rest of Palpatine's servants journey to the planet to retrieve the child, but the Emperor paid Droga no heed. Still, a vision of his master in peril haunted Droga, and he rushed to Onderon to once again come to the aid of Palpatine.

During the battle, however, he realized that his master had not returned and that the Palpatine of the Second Imperium was but a scam.

When harm befell Palpatine, Droga would generally react violently, falling into madness and utter insanity. When he had nothing left to lose, he became a berserker and a dangerous adversary in combat.

The image, as well as the accompanying text, retroactively consolidated the unidentified character from Empire's End and Droga.
