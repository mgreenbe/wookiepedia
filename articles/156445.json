In 3950 BBY, she and two other soldiers were handpicked by Murtog, Dark Councilor Darth Nyriss' security captain, to be part of his strike team that would ambush Meetra Surik, a Jedi Knight, in a cave outside of Dromund Kaas' capital, Kaas City. During the ambush T3-M4, Surik's droid, used his headlamp to blind the soldiers, who instinctively opened fire shortly after. They forced Surik to evade their fire and in retaliation Surik jumped and stabbed the nearest male soldier and slammed the other female soldier against one of the cave's walls killing her instantaneously. The surviving soldiers ripped off their night goggles and opened fire on the Jedi. While they were distracted, T3 used his flamethrower to set the surviving male soldier ablaze. The female soldier was distracted by the screams of her comrade, which allowed Surik the opportunity to cut through her armor and kill her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The female soldier first appeared in Drew Karpyshyn's novel The Old Republic: Revan which was released on November 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
