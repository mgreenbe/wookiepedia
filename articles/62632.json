A week later, after pretending to join Krayt and receiving training as a Sith, Skywalker attempted another rescue, but was once again thwarted.

While Trey'lis was waiting for his transport, bounty hunter and former Jedi Cade Skywalker, along with fellow hunters Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue, burst into the cantina seeking to capture the gambler Naxy Screeger, who was wanted for a debt he owed.

Trey'lis was finally brought down by an illegal thud bug thrown by Syn, which knocked the Bothan unconscious. On the way to the bounty hunters' ship Trey'lis pleaded with them to let him go, stating that although he did not fear death, what the Sith would do to him would be far worse.

Skywalker pursued the Bothan, following him as he jumped off a ledge. As they fell together, Trey'lis recognized the power of the Force within Skywalker, and realized it was not a Sith trained power. After plunging into the water below, Trey'lis was dragged out of the water by Skywalker and brought before Rav, who had been watching the engagement from a holovid captured by his droids. Rewarding Skywalker, Blue, and Syn for their work, Rav ordered his crew to take Trey'lis and Screeger away. After receiving hallucinogenic death sticks from Rav, Skywalker was preparing to take the narcotic when he was visited by the spirit of his ancestor, the famed Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker. Pointing out that Cade had never turned a Jedi over to the authorities before, Luke attempted to dissuade his descendant from taking the death sticks, which deadened his connection to the Force.

Trey'lis could not resist the ruthless interrogation and torture methods of Maladi, and eventually told her everything he knew about young Skywalker, such as his ability in the Force, and that his companions were Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue.

Despite not having completed his training, Cade left Ossus and headed to Coruscant to rescue Trey'lis. Meanwhile, in the Sith Temple on Coruscant, Trey'lis was forced to use his healing abilities on Krayt, who was struggling to control the Yuuzhan Vong implants\u2014gained during the Yuuzhan Vong War\u2014which threatened to take over his body.

Sensing impending danger, Skywalker Force-pushed Trey'lis out of the way just as they were attacked by one of Krayt's personal assassins, his Hand, Darth Talon.

Expecting such an attempt, however, Talon had been waiting in the lab, and the former Jedi was once again captured. Taken to Krayt's chambers, Skywalker was berated by the Dark Lord of the Sith, who ordered him to kill Trey'lis to show his devotion to the Sith. Knowing that Krayt wanted him alive, Skywalker refused, stating that Krayt's threats were meaningless. In response Krayt commanded that Trey'lis be killed, which angered Skywalker as he did not want the Bothan to die for him. Not wanting Krayt to use him as weapon, Trey'lis pleaded with Skywalker to resist Krayt's temptations of the dark side.

Unlike many Bothans, who held political scheming and spying in high regard, Trey'lis valued healing, patience, and communion with the Force. Peaceful by nature, Trey'lis preferred to practice the healing arts over the ways of the warrior. As a Jedi, the Bothan strove to be a force of good in the galaxy, even after the Jedi were decimated at the end of the Sith-Imperial War. Despite his inherent peaceful nature, Trey'lis was willing to fight for his survival when pursued by Skywalker and his fellow bounty hunters.

Knowing his death was imminent, Trey'lis was not afraid; instead, he found a greater happiness and a deeper sense of peace than he had ever felt before.

He was proficient in telekinetic applications of the Force, able to throw both objects and people with powerful waves of energy, as he showed during his attempted escape from Skywalker and his friends.
