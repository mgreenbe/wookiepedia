He had a mistress, Marska, who was secretly a loyal Imperial spy tasked with keeping Dixton in line. Dixton was traveling aboard the Curich-class shuttle Resurgence with a light TIE/LN starfighter escort when they were attacked by Irregular T-65 X-wing starfighters. To escape, the ship made an emergency jump to hyperspace which deposited the ship several light-years from its destination above Abonshee. Damaged in the escape, with life-support failing and its grav motor compromised, the shuttle ejected a distress buoy and made an emergency landing on Abonshee, just outside of the Godking's castle. Dixton was subsequently captured by Green squad of the Reekeene's Roughnecks, who were on-planet at the time negotiating with the Godking, Trisstan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dixton was an arrogant coward, happy to send the soldiers under his command into battle while he hid.
