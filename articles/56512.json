Plunging their starship into the gravity well of a planet or moon, a pilot allowed the planet's own pull to increase the ship's velocity so that when the pilot pulled out of the dive, they ricochetted off in another direction. Done correctly, the dive provided a substantial boost in speed, without adding stress to the engines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
