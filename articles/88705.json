Despite his wealth, Melas was not entirely unaffected by his status as a Sarkan expatriate. He missed his homeworld on occasion and often spoke of its lush jungles, jewel-encrusted mountains, and beautiful cave-cities with a melancholy eloquence that belied his normally optimistic nature. However, Melas' insatiable curiosity for what was out there easily eclipsed his bouts of sadness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A broad-snouted Sarkan with mottled gray skin, Melas was born with physical deformities: Standing at 1.7 meters in height, he was unusually diminutive in stature for his species.

During his travels, he developed a fondness for smoking an Esoomian gruu pipe to heighten his awareness, and only rarely was he seen without the sweet-smelling device clasped in his scaly palms.
