The Lean Nuuti was dark, grubby, and dank. It possessed a beat-up autojuke for playing music and had a game of holodarts, as well as several tables that were looked after by a serving droid. Among the items the Lean Nuuti served were flangth, ootoowergs, and Shasa ale. The grill commonly catered to the pirates and the other non-Human individuals who frequented StarForge Station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In existence by 0 ABY, the Lean Nuuti was the meeting place where the mutinous crew of the Imperial EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Far Orbit met with a representative from the Alliance to Restore the Republic after the crew seized the starship from the Empire. The meeting was intended to finalize the terms of the letter of marque and reprisal that would allow the Far Orbit to serve as a privateer vessel for the Rebels. Instructed to enter as a party of six and order flangth and ootoowergs alongside Shasa ale, those crew members of the Far Orbit would then be approached by an Ithorian. After the crew ordered, the Ithorian approached them and informed them that there were no ootoowergs left. Under the guise of going with the Ithorian to check what was available, the Far Orbit's captain, Dhas Fenoep Vedij, and another crew member went to clarify the final deal with the Alliance. While Vedij was gone, four alien thugs came up to the remaining crew members and insulted them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The insults led to the start of a fight between the two groups. However, when Vedij returned from successfully negotiating with the Alliance, he halted the fight with an order, before taking his crew to find bunks for the night."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lean Nuuti Bar and Grill first appeared in Preparing for War, an adventure scenario in 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games's Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and had the same theme of the previous publication Pirates & Privateers, as it followed the privateering vessel Far Orbit. The fight in the Lean Nuuti can be won by either side, according to how the players play it, with the losing side buying the other drinks. If the fight ends in a draw, the aliens will buy the crew members drinks to make things even between them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
