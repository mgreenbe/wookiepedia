Among the pirates was his former Padawan Azlyn Rae who was now working as an Imperial Knight. The pair were reunited in which Rae expressed the belief that her master had perished. She inquired about Tuum's brothers to which he explained Ahn's death and Zho's mission to locate other Jedi. He did not seem phased by his brother's recent demise and instead focused on telling Rae of the fate of Jho. Tuum raised concerns about whether her allegiances were with the Jedi or the Imperials. Shortly after this interaction, Rasi Tuum was attacked by another member of Cade's crew, Jariah Syn the son of Zareb Syn, in an act of  vengeance for killing his father. He was unsuccessful in his attack as Tuum forced Syn to face up to the fact that his father was a bad man and he was only trying to protect the miners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rasi Tuum later fought alongside his old Padawan once again on Agamar when a meeting between the Jedi and Emperor Roan Fel was interrupted by the Sith who attempted to assassinate the Emperor.
