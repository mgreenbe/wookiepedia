By 14 BBY, it hosted an Imperial base. When the corvette Carrion Spike was stolen from Imperial Governor Wilhuff Tarkin by a rebel cell and used to attack TaggeCo mining facilities on Lucazec, Imperial forces stationed at Lantillies and Centares were moved in triage redeployments to try and protect other Imperial assets that might be attacked. Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit\u2014who was secretly one of those behind the attacks\u2014later outlined fears to Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine that Lantillies itself might be a potential target since it was no longer as protected due to the redeployments; however, the base was never attacked by the corvette as the rebel cell was destroyed by Tarkin.
