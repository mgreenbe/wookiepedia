Its hull was carved from burnished wood, and its portholes were so clear that it looked as if there was no glass in the frames. Because it did not have any boosters or repulsors, the airship was almost completely silent, at least until it sounded its guns. The Count's private cabin featured dark wood panelled walls lined with holos of various natural landscape, a wooden desk ornated with carved dragons on its side, several book shelves, and a cabinet filled with bottles and decanters. When Dooku tasked Asajj Ventress with finding his disappeared sister, he insisted Ventress took the Windrunner, giving her the opportunity to review old personal holos while seeing Serenno from above."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
