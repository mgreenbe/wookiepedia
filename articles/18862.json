To maintain security and secrecy, Hujaan paid off a number of contacts in Byblos Starport Security. Hujaan earned a reputation for expert repairs and creative modifications, particularly amongst smugglers and Rebel Alliance agents, but she never did anything for free and demanded payment up front. When parts were unavailable, Hujaan called on her skills as a smuggler to acquire them. Some of Hujaan's most impressive work was on Dash Rendar's Outrider, although if any modification proved a failure, she claimed it was Rendar's work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
