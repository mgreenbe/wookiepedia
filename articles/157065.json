Shortly afterward, the Resistance members departed for the planet Kijimi, but were followed by the starship of the dark side group known as the Knights of Ren, who were tracking the Resistance operatives for Supreme Leader Kylo Ren of the First Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the planet itself was not seen, its rings first appeared in the 2019 film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker.
