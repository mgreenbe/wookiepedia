Tuana, along with a group of other civilian vessels, some of which contained Bothans was held up by the Accuser, which also bought the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Grappler to prevent it from leaving. When the Interdictor was driven out by Rebels in X-wings and A-wings all of the ships, as well as the transport made a run for their hyperspace junctions but were opened fired on by the Accuser. It is likely that the Tuana made it back to the Rebels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
