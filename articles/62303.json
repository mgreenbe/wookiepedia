By around 5 BBY, a flight school was located there which was used to train rebel pilots. In a message from Commander Jun Sato to General Jan Dodonna, Sato found that the RZ-1T trainer was extremely helpful in certifying bush pilots for A-wing starfighters, and stated that if models were available, the flight school on Homon and Farstey could use them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, the Rebel Alliance considered Homon was considered at least a level five starfighter hub, and was included in a map of the galaxy that listed safe worlds, starfighter hubs at level five or higher, regional headquarters and operations sectors, and deep space caches.
