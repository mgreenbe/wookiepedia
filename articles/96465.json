Each mated pair of Avogwi established an eyrie and claimed a fifty kilometer area as their own territory and hunting reserve. Eyries were usually inherited from parents, but could also be won in duels, games of chance, or by trade. Mated couples without an eyrie were forced to either search for an abandoned eyrie or establish a new one. Until they settled down, the Avogwi were in constant danger as they were never sure if their travels took them into claimed territory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
