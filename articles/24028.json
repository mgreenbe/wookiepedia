The casino's sophisticated sensors could detect even the most well-hidden of cybernetic implants, and a small army of Kilmaulsi were on hand to politely deter any troublemakers. External troubles were generally handled by Vorzyd V's legion of R-series police droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the destruction of the first Death Star, Luke Skywalker visited the Casino Royale while trying to meet up with a potential Rebel contact. There, he managed to amaze the patrons by being the first to score on Cosmic Chance in more than three sidereals, then further amazed them by scoring a second time. But before the young Jedi could break the record and score for a third time, he was pulled away by Princess Leia, much to the dismay of the patrons betting on him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Royale was serviced by a small fleet of droid-operated hover-taxis which in brought beings from the spaceport and the numerous surrounding hotels, which had accommodations for nearly any type of being.

And when the patrons had grown tired of gaming, there was always the Royale's night-life to liven things up."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The casino was almost certainly named for the titular casino in Ian Fleming's very first James Bond novel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
