Though the Quick-6's bolt was slightly less powerful than that of most sporting blaster pistols, its stun setting was much more effective than most weapons in its class\u2014a feature that live-game hunters used to their advantage. The Quick-6 was also lighter than most comparable weapons, though this trait also made the weapon slightly more delicate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This blaster resembles the real-world Mauser C96 pistol, in common with the Merr-Sonn Model 44 and Power 5 blaster pistols and BlasTech's DL-44 heavy blaster pistol which were all built using a C96."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
