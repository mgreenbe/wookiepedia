The pair attempted this by having a female college infiltrate the museum and reprogram one of the ASP-7 labor droids that worked there to bring the pots to the museum's loading dock and walk off the edge with them into a waiting speeder, driven by Urnon. Hewpaj's job was to distract the museum staff with his sniper rifle from a nearby building until Urnon picked him up after collecting the stolen pots. However during their escape the pair were chased by a group of spacers which caused them to crash their stolen hot rod speeder into the Royal Icqui Aquaria. Both ended up in the tank of a Pierceskimmer where they were knocked unconscious and possibly devoured by the beast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hewpaj was a character in the saga edition Star Wars Roleplaying Game mini-adventure Art For Art's Sake and so the above biography assumes the adventure is completed as suggested in the article."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
