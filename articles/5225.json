In reality, Alexan was the planetary governor, and had a daughter who was in love with the Rebel Selas Ferr. When two of Ferr's men were captured, he contacted Alexan for help. Alexan agreed as long as Ferr took his daughter away at the same time as his fellow Rebels. Alexan delivered Ferr's men and his own daughter to the rendezvous but they were ambushed by Imperial troops. The Rebels managed to escape but Alexan was mortally wounded.
