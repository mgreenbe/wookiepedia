At some point after the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs included a recipe for Roasted Kajaka Root in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook. In the book, he recommended roasting the root vegetable either by following his recipe or using skewers, not deep-frying it. He claimed that the root would lose its natural flavors when fried unless a good troogan oil was used, while roasting the root brought out its subtle sweetness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Roasted Kajaka Root was created as one of the recipes in the 2019 cookbook Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which was written by Marc Sumerak and Chelsea Monroe-Cassel.
