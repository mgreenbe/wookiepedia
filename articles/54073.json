In 0 BBY, they staged an uprising on Gerrard V, seizing the planetary capital of Harazod. An Imperial counterstrike destroyed the navy in orbit of Gerrard V, and forced the Rebels to retreat to the capitol building. The Rebels leader, General Camon Udeon, refused surrender terms, forcing Imperial Admiral Jion Trynn to bombard Harazod's urban center from orbit.
