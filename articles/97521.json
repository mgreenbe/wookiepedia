Nim'Ri helped Yurdel against the Caarites, but Gerta Haman was seriously injured during the shootout. Yurdel was distraught at that and wanted to destroy the Cartel base with great violence. Nim'Ri believed that Yurdel was too careless and that he could get killed in the attack. The Trandoshan, an expert in Caarite tactics, organized part of the attack, including briefing some allies who were to slice in the Cartel's computers, and later he took part in the battle, co-leading the troops along with Yurdel in their attack to the Metatheran Cartel jungle base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was a great victory for the resistance, and led to the Cartel retreating from Cularin.

A rumor said that Nim'Ri had returned to his native Trandoshan planet but, as Nim'Ri had not been born on Trandosha (and as he was a known freedom fighter who would not give up during hard times and would instead threaten the threateners), this canard was an obvious hoax. Some people believed that the Thaereians had secretly killed Nim'Ri and then developed the false hearsay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
