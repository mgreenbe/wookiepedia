In the year 3964 BBY the Hidden Beks were a known gang operating out of the Lower City on the planet Taris led by Gadon Thek. During the Siege of Taris in 3963 BBY, during the Mandalorian Wars, the Beks launched counterattacks against the Mandalorian invaders and the fugitive crime lord Marn \"Gryph\" Hierogryph joined to help lead resistance. Gryph's companion, Jedi Padawan fugitive, Zayne Carrick later joined the Beks on Taris, although the gang remained wary of the Zayne since he was the declared orchestrator of the Padawan Massacre on Taris. However, Zayne proved himself trustworthy when he absolved the Hidden Beks of kidnapping the children of Noana Sowrs, the top law enforcement official on Taris.\nThe Beks now believed they could be trusted to join the Taris Resistance lead by officials they used to be at odds against as a gang. However, their first meeting was interrupted when a member of the resistance, Shel Jelavan, fired on Zayne, but Gadon believed there was no way Zayne would murder kids and defended Zayne. The different parties resolved their differences for the time being and together planned an counter attack against the Mandalorian invasion leader, Cassus Fett, at the Jedi Tower. However, the Mandalorians discovered the plot and launched their own ambush. The surviving Beks hid in the Undercity of Taris in order to escape further attacks."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post-Mandalorian Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some time during the next seven years, Gadon Thek, was blinded in a swoop accident, at which point he was expected to step down and relinquish leadership to his adopted son Brejik.
