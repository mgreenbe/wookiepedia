Another droid with the exact model can be found looking for EG-7 during a mission where he didn't appear, and agreed to help the player with the lift platform; the only difference about this droid was that instead of the EG-7/RD-RR voice, this droid had a similar voice to F-TO."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
