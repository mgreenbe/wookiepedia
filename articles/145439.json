It had a thirty-hour exposure time for most alien environments, and was constructed of material that was a slightly thicker version of that which was used in the Thinsuit. It was resistant to tear, slashing, and puncturing, and could be folded into a size no larger than a datapad."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
