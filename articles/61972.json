It used powerful algorithms to alter the outgoing signal. It would modify the images and sounds, including species and gender, so that the user's identity would be disguised. It could be preset with 10 different personae, complete with a rotating wardrobe to further fool a viewer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
