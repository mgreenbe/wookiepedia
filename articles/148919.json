During the Clone Wars, a number of these trees were planted atop the Royal Academy of Government on the planet Mandalore, where two rows lined either side of the path to the academy's entrance, with further trees placed regularly around the edge of the building. The academy's trees were pruned to resemble the architecture of Sundari, Mandalore's capital city, where the academy was located. The trees were far older than their small size suggested."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
