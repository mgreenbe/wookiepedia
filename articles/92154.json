A prefabricated building, it could be set up quickly by Imperial commanders on any planet to provide a home for a limited Imperial garrison. This facility was most often used by stormtroopers and scout troopers. Several companies could be housed, but because of this the barracks was quite cramped and very spartan in its accommodations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
