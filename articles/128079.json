The Gran saw themselves as crops, grown by goddess Doellin to be harvested at death. Violence, gambling, alcohol consumption, usage of spice, and other addictive behavior and substances was strictly forbidden, and violations were met with penalties such as exile and death marks, supposingly for the common good; after all, Doellinism was primarily a celebration of life, community, and happiness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To maintain cultural purity, immigration and emigration was tightly controlled by Kinyen bureaucracy, even for Gran citizens. The Kinyen government held the exclusive monopoly of power over who received contracts in the semi-privatized shipping industry, and so Saeduree River Shipping was given exclusive shipping rights for food exports in much of the continent that contained the Kinyen city of Capra. Most other sectors of business was nationalized, including food production and construction. The government had annual quotas in food production, necessitating families and farmhands of the Ayanee Farming Cluster to work together in producing silvergrass."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Socialism was first mentioned in a message to readers that was printed in Trade Federation Basic in the non-canon comic \"Force Fiction,\" published by Dark Horse Comics in the seventh issue of the 1999 comic series Star Wars Tales on March 7, 2001.
