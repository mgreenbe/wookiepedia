Celomar was present during a royal parade on Rydonni Prime, where the aide informed Caerbellak that an Imperial prototype weapon being developed by Rythani Products had been stolen. Celomar later ordered a TIE fighter squadron to go after the thief, Sienn Sconn, but Caerbellak ordered the aide to tell the fighters not to engage. Celomar disagreed with this line of reasoning but followed orders anyway."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
