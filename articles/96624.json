The planet saw brief conflict when the bounty hunter Din Djarin rescued Grogu, an infant that he had delivered to a member of an Imperial remnant in a previous job, betraying the Guild. After Djarin's escape from Nevarro, the planet was taken over by the forces of the Imperial remnant, who were led by the former Moff Gideon. Karga eventually tricked Djarin into returning to Nevarro with the Child, though later changed his mind about allowing the Child to be given to the Imperials, and worked alongside Djarin to defeat them. Despite the arrival of Moff Gideon, Djarin and his associates managed to defeat the Imperial remnant, giving Karga and soon-to-be Marshal Carasynthia Dune the chance to turn the planet into one of respectable business."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin continued on his journey with his small companion before returning to Nevarro for repairs. After reuniting with Karga and Dune, Karga set his mechanics on the repairs and the two showed him the city. Karga then requested that Djarin help them destroy an Imperial base on the planet.

Its orbit caused its sun to set quickly. An ashen world of black sands, Nevarro had rocky and volcanic terrain that consisted of regions of rocky flats and hills along with vast fields of lava, which contained lava rivers both on the surface and underground. Its atmosphere was breathable to individuals of various species, though the atmosphere of Nevarro's lava rivers was burning and sulphuric."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Nevarro's lava plains were inhospitable to most species, the planet was home to a number of different creatures, including a reptavian that would attack unsuspecting beings under the cover of night, able to lift their prey into the air or incapacitate them with venom.

During the Imperial expansion, the Empire established a military base on Nevarro. At some point during the Galactic Civil War, forces of the Rebel Alliance attacked the Imperial-controlled city. However, the lack of cover in the surrounding terrain caused the Rebellion to suffer heavy casualties, and the planet remained in Imperial control until the end of the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the fall of the Empire, the Bounty Hunters' Guild resided on Nevarro, led by the agent Greef Karga, who operated from a cantina within Nevarro's city.

After capturing one such bounty, a Mythrol, Djarin landed his starship Razor Crest in a spaceport outside Nevarro's city. Djarin met with Karga in the Bounty Hunters' Guild cantina, where, unsatisfied with the state of the Guild's regular jobs, he took a job that required directly meeting the client\u2014a member of an Imperial remnant faction. The Mandalorian bounty hunter met his client in a facility elsewhere on Nevarro, learning of the client's target. Following the meeting, Djarin visited the Mandalorian enclave, using his down payment of beskar to have a pauldron forged by the tribe's armorer. Djarin left Nevarro for the planet Arvala-7, where his target was located."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After successfully acquiring the target, the Force-sensitive infant known as the Child, Djarin returned to Nevarro to deliver the bounty to his client, taking the beskar he had been given as a reward to his tribe's enclave in order to create more armor, where he was was confronted by fellow Mandalorian Paz Vizsla for taking a job from Imperials. Djarin met Karga in Nevarro's cantina for his next job, but before he could leave the planet, he felt remorseful for delivering the Child to the Imperials, and returned to the facility to rescue him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounty hunter managed to eliminate many of the Client's stormtroopers and rescue the Child, but, upon attempting to leave, was confronted by Karga and the Guild hunters, who had been notified of his betrayal.

Following Djarin's escape from Nevarro, additional forces of the Imperial remnant led by the former Moff Gideon, who was thought to have been executed for war crimes, took control of the planet. The Imperial rule of Nevarro's city impeded the operation of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. The Imperials also attacked the Mandalorian covert for revealing themselves and assisting in Djarin's escape, which left many of the Mandalorians dead, though the Armorer speculated that some survived and escaped the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Karga attempted to trick Djarin into bringing the Child back to Nevarro, claiming he had a plan to kill the Client, though the Guild's true plan was to kill Djarin and return the Child. Djarin assembled a team of accomplices, consisting of the former rebel shock trooper Cara Dune, the moisture farmer Kuiil, and the reprogrammed assassin droid IG-11, and landed in a remote region of Nevarro to meet with Karga and several Guild hunters. Once night fell, the team set up camp, but were attacked by the planet's species of winged predators, who killed one of Karga's hunters and injured Karga himself.

While Kuiil protected the Child, Karga and Dune brought Djarin into the city, pretending that they had captured him and had come to return the Child. They were met by the Client, but he was contacted by Gideon, who revealed Karga's ruse. Having surrounded the cantina with the forces of his Imperial remnant, Gideon had the Client and his stormtroopers shot and killed through the window of the cantina. While attempting to return the Child to the Razor Crest, Kuiil was shot down and killed, and the  Child was taken by two Imperial scout troopers. However, before the troopers could return the Child to Moff Gideon, IG-11 killed them and rescued the Child."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trapped in the cantina, Djarin suggested escaping through the sewers to the Mandalorian covert. Gideon threatened to raze the cantina with an E-Web heavy repeating blaster unless Karga and his associates surrendered.

Djarin was injured in the ensuing skirmish, and his associates retreated into the cantina. Karga and Dune entered the sewers with the Child, while Djarin allowed IG-11 to heal him, and the two followed their accomplices to the Mandalorian covert, finding it deserted except for the Armorer, who explained what had happened to the Tribe. The Armorer provided the fugitives with an escape route and equipped Djarin with a jetpack and a supply of munitions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin and his accomplices escaped through the sewers to an underground lava river, while the Armorer was confronted by the Imperials, who she managed to defeat. As the fugitives attempted to travel down the lava river aboard a keelboat, Djarin detected a stormtrooper platoon at the exit of the tunnel. IG-11 sacrificed himself to kill the stormtroopers, allowing Djarin, Dune, and Karga to escape with the Child. When the team exited the tunnel, Gideon attacked in his TIE fighter. Djarin used his jetpack to grapple onto the starfighter and destroy it, causing Gideon to crash into the lava fields. With the Imperial remnant defeated, Karga mused that Nevarro could become a haven for bounty hunters once again, Dune decided to remain with the Guild on the planet, and Djarin left to search for the Child's home.

Karga turned the old cantina into a school and saw the city return to a respectable place for a variety of citizens. The city streets became teeming with vendors, gathering places, and potted plants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point, Djarin returned to Nevarro for repairs and happily reunited with Karga and Dune outside the city. Karga told his two mechanics to work on Djarin's ship while he and Dune brought their former companion through the new-look city. Noting that Djarin had some time on his hands while repairs were done, Karga brought him to his office and proposed a mission to take out the Imperial base located close by.

However, as they exited, the group realized that it was a laboratory and noticed several individuals suspended in tubes as well as a hologram that involved Dr. Pershing communicating with Gideon. Realizing the transmission was from three days ago, they realized Gideon was still alive. Djarin used his jetpack to quickly return to the city, where he had left the Child, while Karga, Dune, and the Mythrol blasted their way out in a Trexler 906 Armored Marauder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A number of individuals of various species resided on Nevarro during the era of the New Republic, including many operatives of the Bounty Hunters' Guild.

Din Djarin later questioned if the Mandalorians on the water moon of Trask the \"Frog Man\" knew of were survivors from Nevarro, but they were actually a group led by Lady Bo-Katan Kryze of Mandalore.
