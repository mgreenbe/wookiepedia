The CR90 corvette saw action during the Galactic Civil War, ranging from the Battle of Scarif to the Battle of Jakku. In 34 ABY,[source?] Commander Poe Dameron led a mission in which the corvette took part. It hyperspaced into the area in time to recover New Republic pilot Kazuda Xiono's damaged T-85 X-wing starfighter. During that time it acted as a command ship for the military group. Sometime later, it was used to rendezvous with Xiono for an update on his spy mission on the Colossus. It hyperspaced in time to rescue Xiono again, who was piloting the Fireball, still in need of repairs. Once aboard, General Leia Organa briefed Xiono and Dameron personally before sending them to Station Theta Black, a First Order outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The corvette appears in the 2018 animated series Star Wars Resistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
