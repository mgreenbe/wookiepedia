Home to worlds with long heritages and lineages, the area originally did not experience economic development as The Slice and the Trailing Sectors had. It was burdened with anomalies such as the Radama Void and a constant threat of Mandalorian and Sith invasions, if only by sheer rumor and fear. As the Hydian Way expanded, economic development came. Some worlds, such as Ord Mantell, were established in this area in an effort to protect settlers and investors from various threats. During the Galactic Civil War, the area became known as the \"Borderlands\" due to its split loyalties between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the remaining Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This region was a militarized zone incorporating, among others, the Listehol Run, the Abregado, Breago and Obroa-skai systems, Elom, Jendorn, and Hettsk.
