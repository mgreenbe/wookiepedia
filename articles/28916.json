It was vitally important to Antan Azzameen, who planned to use the satellite to spy on the Azzameen family company's rivals Viraxo Industries and their communications with the Empire. Following an Alliance attack on the communications center carried out by an Alliance squadron which Ace Azzameen was a part of, the satellite's wiring was damaged; Aeron Azzameen used this damage to install a listening device at Antan's request."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
