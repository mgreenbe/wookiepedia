It was a story on why the aiwha ruled the oceans of the planet Kamino and were respected by all creatures of the planet. The protagonist of the story was a god-beast named Protas, considered the most powerful and ruler of the oceans. His claim is challenged first by a titan of the deep, Melkorr, then by the sentient and legion kikla. He defeats both sets of challengers, and becomes arrogant in his old age. In this arrogant mind-set, he prevents a pod of aiwha from fleeing the cold winter. Realizing they would die if they complied with the unreasonable request, the aiwha fight Protas, defeating the god-beast only when one of their own sacrifices himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"The Tale of the Aiwha Pod\" was a tale originating from the aquatic planet Kamino. It served as a lesson to the sentient inhabitants as a reason why the non-sentient aiwha species were to be afforded respect and seen as the rulers of the vast oceans of the planet. The story was originally told in the Kaminoan language, and Ryan Kaufman translated the tale onto a single page written in Galactic Basic Standard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Synopsis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since before the dawn of the second sun, the oceans of Kamino had been ruled by the mystical being Protas. Melkorr, a massive titan from the deep, challenges Protas' claim as the most powerful in the seas. Meeting Protas on the underwater ridge of Thalina, Melkorr attacks the god-beast with a jaw full of sharp teeth and large, pointed fins. Trying to use his size and power to overwhelm Protas, the two battle for six days and nights. Protas uses his agility and speed to evade the titan's attacks, and eventually Melkorr tires. Protas takes advantage of his opponent's exhaustion, dealing a killing blow which leaves the seas bloodied and the fish fed for an eon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An army of sentient kikla, believing that their large numbers would make up for their comparatively small size and allow them to overwhelm Protas, make the next challenge. Protas meets them in the deep waters of the Ancient Trench, where they fight for a month. Though numerous, the kikla are divided in mind, arguing among themselves. Due to their comparative size, they also leave only small wounds on the god-beast. In contrast, Protas is of a single mind and slowly eats the kikla to maintain strength. Protas is again victorious at the new moon, when the last kikla is eaten."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With these victories and confirmation they give of his power, Protas in his advanced age becomes arrogant. He eventually comes across a pod of aiwha, who are swimming south to avoid the cold winter. Protas, for amusement, refuses to let them continue, blocking their path and instructing the aiwha to return north. Knowing if they turn back they will surely die, the aiwha attack without warning, desiring neither fame or glory. Despite combining the swarming tactics of the kikla and the powerful attacks of Melkorr, the aiwha still cannot deal a killing blow through Protas' thick skin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Noticing Protas has briefly exposed the soft flesh of his throat, one aiwha clamps onto the throat of the god-beast in a sacrificial attempt to defeat him. Realizing the danger of this, Protas attempts to dislodge the aiwha by smashing it with his fins, but it will not let go, even in death. This allows the rest of the pod to deal a final blow and end the god-beast's life. Their defeating Protas, which brings peace to the seas, is why the aiwha are given respect by all the creatures of Kamino, great and small."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"The Tale of the Aiwha Pod\" appeared in the short story of the same name, which was published in the 2005 game guide for the Star Wars: Republic Commando video game.
