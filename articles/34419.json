By 1 ABY, Darkstone was on the verge of retirement, when Doctor Bledsoe, an Imperial scientist, was captured by the Rebel Alliance. Despite Bledsoe's whole-hearted support for the Empire's xenophobic views, the Zabrak felt it was his duty to make sure all Imperial hostages were freed before he gave up his post."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fortunately for Colonel Darkstone, a spacer and a group of ragtag Imperial supporters stepped forward to assist. However, before the Imperials could rescue the doctor, Darkstone needed them to find prisoner transfer orders. After searching various locations, including a Droid Engineer's Cave on Lok, the Rogue CorSec Base on Corellia, and the Woolamander Palace on Yavin 4, the Imperials finally found the documents Darkstone sought. The Imperials learned that Bledsoe was being transported on a Rebel corvette. The only option would be to infiltrate the corvette, and carry out a daring rescue operation. In order to save the doctor before anything bad happened to him, the Imperials were immediately given a ticket to hand to an Imperial TIE pilot at the Emperor's Retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From here, the Imperials were flown on a Lambda-class shuttle to the corvette. After boarding the corvette, the Imperials fought their way through the corridors, and rescued Bledsoe. After evacuating the corvette through the ship's escape pods, the Imperials returned to Darkstone, and were commended for their service. The Imperial Valorous Services Medal was awarded to the Imperials for their exemplary work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darkstone is a non-player character (NPC) in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies.
