Trigha possessed green scaly hides that were often mottled with dark stripes and spots. They hunted in family units and bellowed when moving through underbrush in order to flush out prey. Their preferred hunting tactic was to emit a high-pitched shriek when spotting prey to alert the rest of its pack. They would then chase the prey with single-minded aggressiveness, having little regard for their own safety."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A trigha inadvertently rescued Lando Calrissian and Han Solo from a band of Imperial stormtroopers while they were on Ord Vaxal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
