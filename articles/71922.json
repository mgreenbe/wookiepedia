Like fellow Jedi Master Dooku, C'baoth was arrogantly sure of his own skills and talents, believed himself to be a peerless warrior and philosopher, and viewed non-Force sensitives as inferior. A controversial figure among his own peers, C'baoth was regarded as the epitome of a Jedi Master by some, while others were distrustful of him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his exemplary, if unorthodox, career, C'baoth settled a number of conflicts. He notably participated in the demobilization of Ando, defeated a band of Dark Jedi in the Elrood sector, put an end to the Ascendancy Contention of Alderaan, and helped his colleague Tra's M'ins mediate the Duinuogwuin\u2013Gotal conflict. Above all that, he also found time to train a Padawan, the young Human female Lorana Jinzler."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was the main proponent of the Outbound Flight project, which he envisioned as being the precursor to the discovery of unknown species who could be taught the ways of the Jedi. However, C'baoth, like Outbound Flight, was ultimately doomed by his arrogance and events outside of his control. With the failure of his vision and the destruction of Outbound Flight at the hands of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force led by Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo, also known as Thrawn, C'baoth eventually fell to the dark side of the Force when he submitted to his anger and attempted to kill Thrawn. He himself died when a Chiss radiation bomb exploded inside of the expedition's main starship, the Outbound Flight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Sidious, the Sith alter-ego of the authoritarian politician Palpatine, would later use recovered samples of C'baoth's DNA as the template for the insane clone named Joruus C'baoth.

From the time of his birth in 70 BBY, it was evident that the infant C'baoth was keenly attuned to the Force, a mystical energy field that bound the galaxy together. Eventually, his untrained potential drew the attention of the Jedi Order, a group of warriors and philosophers who had been the guardians of peace and justice from the early beginnings of the Republic. As was traditional among the Jedi, C'baoth was claimed from his birth parents and brought to the Jedi Temple on the ecumenopolis of Coruscant, fountainhead of the Republic and headquarters of the Jedi. In the Temple, C'baoth joined the other Jedi Initiates, and the members of the Order became his only family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 53 BBY, at the age of seventeen, C'baoth added to his Jedi studies with an education from Mirnic University. Upon his graduation, he traveled to the Jedi Training Center on Kamparas, home to many Jedi scholars, to continue his instruction in the demanding ways of the Force. After training on Kamparas for two years, he was taken on as a private student. C'baoth's early life was an exception to the rule among Jedi of that time: in principle, Initiates who were not selected to be Padawans by the age of thirteen were shifted into one of the divisions of the Jedi Service Corps."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi Knight and galactic diplomat"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 42 BBY, C'baoth joined the ranks of the Jedi Knights, whose numbers formed the backbone of the Order. He decided to follow the path of the Jedi Consulars, who chose to perfect the art of diplomacy and meditation over physical combat. The knighted Jorus C'baoth became a firm supporter of the Galactic Republic, and served it well in a number of ways, most notably as a negotiator and mediator for many of the galaxy's racially-charged conflicts. He notably served as part of the Demilitarization Observation Group stationed on the oceanic planet of Ando, where the native Aqualish subspecies endlessly feuded with each other over mineral rights. A primary observer within the group, the Jedi from Bortras encountered another member of the task force, the ambitious Senator Palpatine of the Chommell sector. The two got along, and when they returned to Coruscant, C'baoth and Palpatine established a long-standing friendship that helped shape the development of C'baoth's career."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few years after the events on Ando, the Council of Reassignment appointed Jorus C'baoth as Palpatine's personal adviser on Jedi-related matters. During his tenure as a member of the senator's staff, the Jedi discussed the Extragalactic Society, often referred to as ExGal, a community of scientists devoted to the search for life outside the galaxy. The two friends shared a mutual interest for the ExGal's ambitious project. However, a couple of years before the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY, C'baoth received visions of the dark side of the Force growing stronger. Intent on searching for the sources of his premonitions, the Jedi from Bortras chose to leave the service of Palpatine. He was reassigned once again and began his inquiries, which led him to the Elrood sector, in the Outer Rim. In that remote area of the galaxy, C'baoth discovered a group of marauding Dark Jedi who brought terror to the sector. With the help of a small strike team of fellow Knights, C'baoth vanquished the rogue Force-users. Unbeknownst to him, his old friend Palpatine himself was a powerful darksider, a Dark Lord of the Sith known as Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rise to mastery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately following the victory in the Elrood sector, C'baoth bestowed the title of Jedi Master upon himself, a move that was quite unorthodox. In theory, the rank of Master was granted by the Jedi High Council to a Knight that had successfully trained several apprentices and brought them to the knighthood. However, the High Council was so pleased with C'baoth's victory in the Elrood sector that they regarded his self-imposed promotion as well-earned and valid. Decades later, the history of the Elrood insurrection would be confused with that of Grand Master Yoda defeating a band of Bpfasshi darksiders in 19 BBY. Historical facts were distorted by legend, and C'baoth was thought to have settled the Bpfasshi uprising."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 33 BBY, Master C'baoth got involved in the Esseles droid starfighters affair, due to his privileged relationship with Palpatine\u2014now a very influential senator. The High Council had received an anonymous datacard, alerting the Order that a factory named Trinkatta Starships had started building fifty experimental droid starfighters. Worried that these new ships were commissioned by an ally of the Republic plotting a civil war, the Councilmen sent Adi Gallia to ascertain the identity of the one who paid for the starfighters. Master Jorus C'baoth was summoned by the Council, who asked him not to notify Palpatine or any other Senators of Galia's secret mission until they have solid evidence identifying the buyer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jorus C'baoth's diplomatic career went on. He notably became a member of the Senate Interspecies Advisory Committee, was appointed as the ambassador-at-large to the Xappyh sector, and helped Jedi Master Tra's M'ins mediate the Duinuogwuin\u2013Gotal conflict. In 32 BBY, C'baoth was made Jedi Watchman of the Alderaan sector, and was involved in the mediation of a crisis known to history as the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention. The question was whether the line of ascent to the function of Viceroy should go to the House of Organa or one of the other patrician bloodlines. After the third voting deadlock, the Alderaanians appealed to the Senate to resolve that matter. A delegation that included Master C'baoth was sent on Alderaan, and it took less than a month to decide that the Organas had the proper claim. C'baoth requested that the House of Organa and the rival House of Antilles join together in an arranged marriage, which settled the contention for good. The same year, Finis Valorum's second four-year term as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic came close to its end. Despite his long-standing friendship with Palpatine, who ran for the impending election, C'baoth offered his support to Senator Bail Antilles of Alderaan, another potential nominee. The Jedi Watchman was seen in the company of the Alderaanian senator during a gathering on the Perlemian Orbital Facility, a space station orbiting Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, the Jedi diplomat took a female Human named Lorana Jinzler as his Padawan to train. C'baoth's relationship with his good-natured and humble apprentice was unusually tense.

He gained support from his friend Palpatine, now Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. At first, the project excited both C'baoth and Palpatine, and the Jedi played a highly instrumental role in convincing the Republic Senate to authorize and fund what became known as \"Outbound Flight Project.\" During its development, the whole project was maintained in secrecy. The Republic never made any information about the Outbound Flight available to the broader populace. Since the planned expedition would pass through the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, it was decided that its crew members would bring their families so they could plant a few colonies on the way. Although the Republic had its official policy regarding the mission of Outbound Flight, C'baoth had his own designs for the project \u2014 he envisioned it as being the catalyst for the discovery of other Force-sensitive species who might be taught the way of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, as time went by, the enthusiasm of the political class about C'baoth's brainchild began to weaken. It soon became apparent that the Outbound Flight project was in jeopardy of being sidelined by the Republic's bureaucracy when the Financial Appropriations Committee of the Senate imposed a series of budget cuts. Furthermore, the Jedi Order also started to step back from the project. While Grand Master Yoda had agreed to assign several Jedi to the project, in the end of the day he was thinking of allowing only one or two. But Master C'baoth had not yet said his last word, and he was ready to spitefully fight back and raise a fuss in front of the Chancellor himself."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Barlok"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When C'baoth and his Padawan, Lorana Jinzler, met with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to discuss the Outbound Flight project, Palpatine told them that if C'baoth settled a dispute on the planet of Barlok, he would do all he could to make Outbound Flight possible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the first day of mediation, they met Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, who had been sent by Mace Windu, who was suspicious of C'baoth. C'baoth sent them away with Jinzler while he went to mediate. After Kenobi, Skywalker and Jinzler had discovered a terrorist threat, C'baoth had them stationed with Jerv Riske, a bodyguard hired by Passel Argente of the Corporate Alliance. They failed to stop the remote missile that targeted all the people involved in the meeting, but C'baoth caught the missile in a Force grip and convinced the assembly to resolve their differences for the people of Barlok."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following that mission, much to her own surprise, C'baoth asked the Jedi High Council to promote his Padawan Lorana Jinzler.

C'baoth, though, did not suspect that Palpatine would also be the one to secretly sabotage the project. Darth Sidious, the Chancellor's Sith persona, had C'baoth cloned in the disguise of a blood test shortly before the launch of the Outbound Flight project, knowing he would be of later use. Sidious also sent his henchman Kinman Doriana ahead of the Outbound Flight with the purpose of destroying it, thus effectively killing several dozen Jedi in one fell swoop."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As planned, C'baoth was one of the six Jedi Masters aboard the project when it departed from Yaga Minor in 27 BBY. Once the Outbound Flight was launched, C'baoth increasingly took control over all of the ship's aspects, even going so far as to take Force-sensitive children away from their parents in the middle of the night to be trained as Jedi. By establishing himself as the de facto leader over all aspects of the ship, even overruling the captain of the vessel, he earned the resentment of the colonists who had initially joined the Outbound Flight to seek a better life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Outbound Flight entered the Unknown Regions, it was encountered by two local species, the Vagaari as well as the Chiss. Mitth'raw'nuruodo, the leader of the Chiss picket force, contacted C'baoth and boarded the Outbound Flight to meet with him, but C'baoth refused to comply with Thrawn's request to leave Chiss Space. As the Vagaari fleet stormed towards the Outbound Flight, C'baoth performed a Force meld to trick the enemy. At that moment Thrawn launched Vulture droids to engage the confused Vagaari, creating a large disturbance in the Force which overwhelmed the meld participants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the disturbance, C'baoth and his fellow Jedi failed to detect the Chiss forces that were sneaking in, and Thrawn managed to systematically destroy the weapon clusters of the Outbound Flight, killing almost every Jedi aboard. Enraged, the Jedi Master gave into his anger, succumbed to the dark side and Force choked Thrawn across space from Outbound Flight's bridge itself. His apprentice sensed his fall, and tried to reach her former master in time to help him, but it was too late. However, before C'baoth could kill Thrawn, Doriana saved Thrawn's life when he activated the secondary command layer pre-set in the Vulture droids, which then rammed and blasted open the Outbound Flight. The final wave of Vultures employed a radiation bomb of Chiss design on the ship. C'baoth, along with all but fifty-seven of the passengers and Lorana aboard, perished."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was due to C'baoth's arrogance and draconian behavior that the survivors of Outbound Flight, who were discovered in 22 ABY, had such a resentment and hatred for the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 9 ABY it was discovered that a clone of C'baoth, Joruus C'baoth, had been living on the world of Wayland since the time of the Clone Wars.

Walking with long loping strides, he simply expected other beings to make room for him, stepping to either side, for he never conceded to other, inferior beings the right of way. C'baoth's manner of speaking was direct, unadorned, no-nonsense. He spoke in a husky baritone voice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "C'baoth was known to have believed in the \"inherent superiority\" of his own kind, the Jedi\u2014an odd speciesism of sorts: his unapologetic conviction was that the Jedi were far above the galaxy's average non-Force users, and therefore they had the right-to-rule over them, be they outlaws, thieves, bureaucrats, or senators. His proud attitude of superiority caused several Jedi to be disturbed by his views, including his own Padawan Lorana Jinzler\u2014to whom he was especially brutal, considering he was her Jedi Master. But it was precisely because of his brash, arrogant, and powerful personality\u2014not to mention his blunt, and often insensitively harsh attitudes and demeanor\u2014that very few individuals dared to bring this unflattering galaxy-view and trait to C'baoth's attention."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "C'baoth was also extremely arrogant in his dealings, not only with non-Force users, but also with his fellow Jedi. That arrogance, as it combined with his often severe attitudes, divided many Jedi on their perception and/or approbation of the Jedi Master. Some believed that he was the consummate model of what it meant to be a Jedi, while others vehemently disagreed with his methods and remained very wary of him and his extremist views.
