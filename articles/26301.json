A quick survey by Alliance analysts has confirmed that it is an ideal location, with enough activity to disguise any Alliance communications and movements in or out, a large set of unused caverns on the outer moons, and enough distance from the Core Worlds to give them advance warning of any approaching Imperial attack - so ideal, Rieekan remarks, that Ferrouz's offer is either \"a great opportunity or an extremely obvious trap.\" As to Ferrouz's reasons, Axlon explains that he fears an imminent invasion by Nuso Esva, an alien warlord in the Unknown Regions who has been growing more and more aggressive, but Ferrouz's appeals to Imperial Center for reinforcement have been ignored.

LaRone, their unofficial leader, grimly accepts that they have enough left to manage one last vigilante mission, maybe two, before they have to find somewhere to settle down and hide. He decides to take the Hand to Pickerin. However, as soon as they step off the ramp, they are incapacitated by a stun gas grenade. They regain consciousness in binders, being gloated over by Bok Yost, the \"victor\" of a rigged election on Elegasso who guessed that the Hand was on its way and created the situation on Pickerin to lure them there. Yost's gloating is cut short when Mara appears, dispatches Yost's private mercenaries, and \"suggests\" that he step down and hold another election - an honest one this time. After Yost flees, Mara frees the Hand, takes them back to their ship and tasks them with her latest mission.

Turning the discussion to other matters, Thrawn warns that Nuso Esva's growing aggression indicates a planned incursion into Imperial space, and he needs at least six more Star Destroyers to effectively deal with him. Palpatine says the Fleet doesn't have that many to spare, but if the rumors that Esva is courting the Alliance are true, then Lord Vader may be willing to lend the services of his task force, since his sole occupation is hunting the Rebels down.

To his surprise, they meet up with Leia, and Colonel Airen Cracken, who are leading an advance survey team sent secretly to Poln Minor for the same purpose.

LaRone admits that he has not heard of that species, and Vaantaar confides that they inhabit a planet in the Unknown Regions - he and his fellows are refugees, since their world was conquered and their people enslaved by Nuso Esva.

After some grousing, Han agrees. In a tapcaf, he is approached by an old acquaintance who recognizes him and says someone on the planet is recruiting techs to calibrate and install Caldorf VII interceptor missiles on small, heavy starfighter-class ships. Han is alarmed, knowing that someone in the system is intending to use those missiles for something other than giving them to the Rebellion. Trying to stall for time, he says he needs to call in his partner, and is even more alarmed when Leia appears, pretending to be an expert missile tech.

She asks him to explain, and Ferrouz tells her that Nuso Esva's agents kidnapped his family three weeks ago, and blackmailed him into making overtures to the Alliance - though Ferrouz doesn't know if Esva is actually working with the Rebels, or has some other scheme in mind.

Before he can go inside, all hell breaks loose: a squad of armed mercenaries storm the office suite, forcing Mara to evacuate Ferrouz and Axlon out through the Governor's private escape tunnel. At the same time, outside the Palace, another mercenary posing as an agitator yells to the crowd outside the gates that Ferrouz is dead - and before Luke can react, seizes the lightsaber from his belt, ignites and holds it aloft, and names Luke as the Rebel \"hero\" who has killed the Governor.

More to the point, how did they know exactly when the \"assassination\" was supposed to have happened? Without warning, Axlon draws a small hold-out blaster and shoots Grave, Marcross, and Quiller, though not fatally, forcing LaRone to lower his weapon.

Axlon says it is simple: Nuso Esva is arranging a trap over Poln Major for his arch-nemesis, Senior Captain Thrawn; once Thrawn has been defeated, with Axlon and the Alliance's help, Esva will bring his considerable fleet (not to mention his military genius) onto the side of the Rebels. The fact that Thrawn was the \"real power\" behind Grand Moff Tarkin's decision to destroy Alderaan only makes Axlon that much more proud to have helped Esva destroy him. LaRone and the Hand scoff that Tarkin didn't take orders from anyone except Palpatine, and Axlon has been lied to.

In disgust, Mara knocks him unconscious, then ascends to the administration offices and confers with Ferrouz's deputy, General Ularno, who she confirms to be an honest man. Uncertainly, he asks whether he is required to issue Directive 417, a recent imperative from Imperial Center that a sector-wide distress call be broadcast to any Imperial forces, in the event a Governor is assassinated by the Rebellion.

In the midst of this debate, the distress call from Poln Major arrives, and Parck concedes that he has no choice but to obey Directive 417.

Now that they know they have been duped, they need to exit the system immediately, but Cracken admits that they have been delayed by the loading of the military hardware - doubtless that was Nuso Esva's intention in giving it to them. Once they are ready to lift off, there is every chance that their transports will be intercepted and destroyed, either by Esva's missile ships, or the Imperial defenses in orbit. With a little ingenuity, Leia manages to deduce the location of the cavern where the missile ships are being prepared, which will give Wedge Antilles and Rogue Squadron a chance to destroy them with their newly-acquired T-47 airspeeders. That only leaves the Imperial space station and Dreadnaught, and Han comes up with an idea: he can board the Golan, using Axlon's Imperial pass from Ferrouz, and posing as an ISB officer. Hopefully, this will confuse the station's crew long enough for Han and Chewie to get the drop on them - since the Golan is severely undermanned, Han and Chewie will only have to overpower about 300 Imperial crewers, instead of over a thousand. To Leia's astonishment, Cracken approves the scheme."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hand of Judgment and their Troukree allies succeed in fighting off the first assault on the tapcafe, drawing in a second, this one launched by Esva's own elite troops.

Pellaeon grabs a breath mask from the lift's emergency kit and staggers back to the bridge, where he finds most of the crew unconscious and Captain Drusan dying, shot at close range by a blaster bolt. Pellaeon is shocked to hear Drusan admit that he knew \"Lord Odo\" was a fraud, but endorsed his presence aboard the Chimaera because Odo - in reality Nuso Esva himself - promised him a crushing victory over the Rebel Alliance that would secure his promotion to Admiral."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn makes contact from aboard the Lost Reef, and tells Pellaeon there isn't a moment to lose.

Parck's forces are too far away to help, and are fully engaged with a force of Esva's Firekiln-class heavy cruisers. Esva informs Thrawn that he has presented him with an impossible choice: he will have to order either the station, or the Star Destroyer, to open fire on the other, to prevent both being destroyed. Either way, Thrawn will be irredeemably disgraced, and his career and reputation ruined."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han and Chewbacca have bluffed their way aboard the Golan, just in time to see the Chimaera locked on its collision course.
