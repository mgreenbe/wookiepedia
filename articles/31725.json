The planet was left abandoned, circa 30,000 BBY, and the Crown was thought lost but eventually came to be stored within the Jedi Temple on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Crown was studied in depth by the Ithorian Jedi Master Tobar Ka-Teen, who was fascinated by the philosophy of the truth and hoped to duplicate the Crown's powers. During his studies, Ka-Teen was permitted to take the Crown to the vergence on Auratera in the Outer Rim of the galaxy. He was accompanied to the ruins of Acablas by several squads of troopers of the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic. During his time at Acablas, Contingency Order 66 was enacted by his clone troopers. The fate of the Crown, Master Ka-Teen, and the clone troopers was never discovered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A silvered skullcap, rather then a ring of steel or tiara, the Crown of Verity was capable of altering its size and shape to fit on the heads of sentient species. The power of the Crown of Verity was in the fact that it forced any who wore it to discern the truth from lies. A side effect of this, was that the wearer was also inhibited from speaking falsehoods, making them a paragon of truth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
