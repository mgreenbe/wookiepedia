Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Jar Jar Binks wore yellow hazmat suits during the hunt for Nuvo Vindi's secret laboratory on Naboo. Amidala and Binks later used them when some of Vindi's recreated Blue Shadow Virus was let into the lab, but during the effort to destroy the battle droids attempting to escape the facility, Amidala was infected after her suit was compromised."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, orange single-use hazmat suits with darkened faceplates were used on the planet Cynda, its moon Gorse, and the Imperial space station Calcoraan Depot. Starships used by Moonglow Polychemical, including the company's explosives haulers, had a stash of the suits as standard-issue, as part of company chief Lal Grallik's safety precautions. The suits were necessary when handling the volatile baradium bisulfate, as the so-called \"Nasty Baby\" was stored in canisters with a psychoactive coolant, which could cause people to hallucinate if inhaled. While infiltrating Calcoraan Depot in search of information on Count Denetrius Vidian's plans, Kanan Jarrus, Hera Syndulla, Zaluna Myder and Skelly took advantage of the suits' use as disguises amongst a horde of identically-dressed workers, as Jarrus and Syndulla had had run-ins with Imperial personnel and Skelly was wanted for bombing several shuttles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hazmat suits first canonically appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars first season episode \"Blue Shadow Virus\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
