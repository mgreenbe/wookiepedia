The Oktarans thought that painting a treblix produced a desired effect on their mind or body. There existed many different patterns: triangles forming a circle with tips facing inward was the symbol for quick thinking, triangles forming a single star was that of courage, a cluster of four triangles over each eye was for gracefulness, and a triangle made of triangles was for hope. Treblixes were applied and removed with a single tool, a small triangular tube with caps on both ends. One spongy end was used to wipe off the old triangles, and the other end was soaked in gold paint to stamp the new ones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
