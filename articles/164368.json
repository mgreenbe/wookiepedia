Wedge Antilles was referred to as a \"wing commander\" during the Thrawn Trilogy, but only as a \"commander\" in X-Wing: Isard's Revenge, which covers some of the same events, specifically the Battle of Bilbringi. Although it is conceivable that Antilles could have been promoted after the events of X-Wing: Solo Command, the X-Wing book series is consistent in reference to his rank of simply \"commander\" despite the in-universe time gap and previous continuity of The Last Command.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
