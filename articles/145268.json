Additionally, the bomb was set to home in on an implant placed inside the guard, with a location that was different for every guard on the planet. Finding the implant would mean skinning the guard to find the implant and even if the guard was killed, the implant would continue to work reporting its wearer dead. By that time, it would be too late to escape the range of the bomb."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
