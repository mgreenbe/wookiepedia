Following the death of the Eternal Empire Empress Vaylin and the formation of the Eternal Alliance in 3630 BBY, she joined CSF Commander Kallin, an outspoken critic of the Alliance, in organizing a false-flag operation. The rogue CSF officers planned to bomb the Senate Tower and make it look like the Alliance was responsible.
