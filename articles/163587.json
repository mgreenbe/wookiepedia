Located within the Mandalore system, Werda occupied the ninth and outermost orbit around the system's star, Mandalore. A frigid world bereft of any moons, Werda was classified as an ice ball. After the Taung forces of Mandalore the First journeyed from Roon to conquer the uninhabited planet that became Mandalore, the newly renamed Mandalorians spread out to conquer the worlds of the surrounding system, including Werda.
