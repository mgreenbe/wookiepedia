The trunk was smooth and dark gray, with metallic gray leaves. They grew where ore deposits were found. The tree's roots sunk into the planet's crust, tapping the ore for sustenance. The energy from the Kuras system's white dwarf star allowed the tree to refine the ore and convert it into layers of bark."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
