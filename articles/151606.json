The move used one fighter as a decoy in order to draw in an opponent, allowing the decoy's wingmate to drop behind the enemy and open fire. The move made the most of the fact that Imperial TIE fighters usually had superior numbers in battle; however, due to the TIE's lack of deflector shields the maneuver was risky and left the decoy vulnerable. This risk was deemed acceptable, as overall any loses were deemed inconsequential to the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"Under Split\" was first mentioned in the new canon in the one-hundredth issue of the Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon magazine series, which was released in 2016.
