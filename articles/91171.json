Cade Skywalker\u2014a former Jedi and the current captain of the Mynock\u2014had recently begun a personal crusade against the Sith, and Isen became his first target after the scientist poisoned the oceans of the planet Dac. Acting on some purchased intelligence, the crew traveled to Isen's laboratory on Daluuj."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After landing on-world, the Mynock's mechanic, Deliah Blue; co-pilot Jariah Syn; and astromech droid R2-D2 stormed the laboratory, where they killed a group of Imperial stormtroopers but found no sign of their quarry. As Syn planted timed explosives, Skywalker and Jedi Master Wolf Sazen defeated a group of Sith in lightsaber combat on a nearby bridge. Skywalker demanded that his last surviving opponent reveal the whereabouts of the \"Butcher of Dac\" but learned only that Isen was no longer on Daluuj. He thus left his maimed opponent to die as the entire crew rushed to their ship and lifted off in time to escape from the exploding laboratory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In late 137 ABY, during the Second Imperial Civil War, the former Jedi Cade Skywalker\u2014who had recently become the captain of the pirate vessel Mynock\u2014was manipulated by the Sith Lady Darth Maladi into traveling to the planet Wayland. There, Maladi kidnapped the Mynock's mechanic, Deliah Blue, and implanted Yuuzhan Vong coral growths onto her back. Skywalker's former Jedi Master, Wolf Sazen, was also on-world, having been led by the Force to the side of his one-time student. After Skywalker mentally attacked Maladi with the Force and sent her fleeing, Sazen convinced him to heal Blue's sickness using the light side of the Force rather than the dark transfer healing power that he traditionally called upon. Curing Blue caused Skywalker to reject the dark side, and he afterward vowed to wage war against the One Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the same time, Vul Isen\u2014a Sith scientist in the service of Darth Krayt's Empire\u2014poisoned the oceans of the planet Dac. His viral spores killed every living being on the water world who was not evacuated in time by the Galactic Alliance Remnant. When Skywalker learned of the event, he deduced that killing Isen would deal the Sith a severe blow, and the \"Butcher of Dac\" became the first target of his crusade. With Sazen as their newest member, the crew of the Mynock purchased intelligence from the Sakiyan Naxy Screeger that indicated Isen was on the planet Daluuj."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early in 138 ABY, the Mynock landed on Daluuj outside of Isen's laboratory, and Deliah Blue, along with Skywalker's co-pilot, Jariah Syn, and astromech droid R2-D2, stormed the building. Although Isen was not there, they encountered a group of Imperial stormtroopers, who subsequently fell to the might of their blasters. After the lightfight concluded, Blue stood guard as R2-D2 sliced into the laboratory's computer system, while Syn planted timed explosives. Meanwhile, Skywalker and Sazen engaged a group of Sith in lightsaber combat on a bridge adjacent to the laboratory. As their foes fell to their blades, Skywalker demanded that the Sith tell him where Isen had gone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, a lone Sith remained, and he exchanged taunts with Skywalker as they dueled. The former Jedi was able to sever the Sith's legs at the knee, and with his opponent at his mercy, Skywalker promised to spare his life if he disclosed the whereabouts of both Isen and the scientist's planet-killing toxins. The Sith revealed only that Isen had previously used Daluuj as a base and had left none of his secrets behind. Syn then contacted Skywalker and informed him that the explosives had been set, and, having obtained no useful information, Skywalker left his protesting opponent to die as he and Sazen rushed to their ship. The entire crew boarded the Mynock and got the vessel airborne shortly before the base and the bridge exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mynock departed Daluuj, and its crew found themselves without any leads in their hunt for Isen. However, the Hutt Queen Jool soon contacted them and insisted that they come immediately to the planet Nal Hutta. They obliged their old friend's request, and upon arriving Skywalker met with Jool and Vedo Anjiliac Atirue, from whom he learned that Isen had also poisoned the Hutt moon of Da Soocha. Additionally, Vedo's nephew Azzim had been killed in an Imperial orbital bombardment of the planet Napdu. In response, the Hutts had set into motion a plan to lure Isen to the planet Utapau, and they hired Skywalker to follow the scientist there and assassinate him. The Mynock made its way to Utapau, where a final showdown with Isen awaited Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crew of the Mynock's mission to Daluuj appears in the forty-eighth issue of the comic series Star Wars: Legacy.
