Ferece tried to persuade Xer give an oath of fealty, in return for a number of noble titles, and Xer promised to return in a month with a suitable tribute. However, he smashed a Cronese battlegroup at Duinarbulon, and led an attack on Chandaar. Xer stormed the Cronese capital, causing Ferece and his courtiers to flee. In the absence of Ferece, Xer installed himself as the new King of Cron and launched several campaings to expand his territory in the Tion Cluster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
