Though he was the sole survivor, TD-334's mental faculties were negatively influenced by the radiation.

Operating out of his base in the spaceport city of Mos Eisley on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine, Harburik oversaw the command of stormtroopers conducting missions in the area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TD-334 and a number of other Imperial stormtroopers were responsible for guarding a reactor repair facility not far outside of Mos Eisley. However, sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, this reactor facility was blown up Rebel forces. The attack left all of TD-334's comrades dead. As the sole survivor, TD-334 began walking aimlessly throughout the desert, stricken by a sudden desire to desert the Empire to become an image designer. It became apparent that TD-334's brain was negatively affected by the radiation released by the explosion. This drastically altered the trooper's personality, compelling him to start a new life. When Lieutenant Harburik learned of the situation, he became concerned that news of the situation would become public knowledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harburik's concerns were alleviated when a spacer loyal to the Empire agreed to help resolve the situation. Harburik asked the operative to apprehend TD-334 without committing undue harm. He also asked that the situation be kept confidential, as other troopers may misunderstand the situation. Ultimately, the Imperial operative did not betray secrecy, and located the disturbed sandtrooper without resorting to combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When TD-334 was approached by the Imperial operative, he commented that lavender highlights would give stormtrooper helmets a bold statement.

However, following the Rebel attack on the facility, TD-334's mind became adversely affected by the released radiation. This caused a significant change in the stormtrooper's personality, causing him to display unorthodox behavior. The once loyal Imperial stormtrooper had turned into an eccentric free agent, committed to starting a new life as an image designer.

However, this does not make sense, as stormtroopers were part of the Stormtrooper Corps, an Imperial Military branch which operated separately from the Imperial Army. The developers may have simply erred when writing the dialogue, or it may have been an in-character mistake made by TD-334, due to his altered mental state. It is also possible that his use of the word 'Army' was generic, meant to colloquially refer to the Stormtrooper Corps as a whole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
