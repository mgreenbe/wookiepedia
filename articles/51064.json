Da'Gara decided to use the Yo'gand's Core tactic, and bring Sernpidal's moon, Dobido, down into the planet using a dovin basal's . Anakin Solo, Han Solo, and Chewbacca were on Sernpidal doing a favor for Lando Calrissian, and attempted to evacuate as many citizens as possible. After bringing an unconscious Anakin Solo back to the Millennium Falcon, the strong winds caused by the moon entering the atmosphere knocked Chewbacca down. While Han Solo was at the landing ramp in order to grab Chewie, Anakin was piloting the Falcon. As the moon came closer to the planet Anakin had to make a judgment call, and in order to save as many people as possible, he lifted off before Chewie was aboard. Chewie stood behind as the planet was destroyed, and defiantly roared at the moon, having sacrificed his life so that others may live."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Six months after the destruction of Sernpidal, Chewie's closest family members and friends gathered around a circular table on the outskirts of Rwookrrorro on Kashyyyk to honor his death. Lando Calrissian could not attend because he was involved in a battle near Obroa-skai, and Mara Jade Skywalker was on Coruscant because her illness had worsened. Since Sernpidal was completely destroyed, and its debris was being used to feed a worldship, his body could not be recovered, and a proper Wookiee funeral could not be performed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ralrracheen, however, gave a moving eulogy in Basic, which was very rare among Wookiees.
