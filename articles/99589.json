Technically not a quarter, but a city on its own, it was located in a large natural bay on the continent of Forethought. All off-worlders had to report here before being cleared to the rest of the planet. The famous mercenary markets were also located here, as well as a starport, cantinas and casinos. Districts in the Quarter included the Off-Worlders' Quarter Starport, Prosperity Row, the River, the Black Hole, and the Scrap Heap."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
