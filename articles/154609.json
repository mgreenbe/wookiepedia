The starship, piloted by Nien Nunb, was pursued by Rapier Squadron, its hyperdrive having been damaged by Commander Poe Dameron. Dameron chased the starship through the Lost Souls asteroid field, but the Resistance members disabled his T-85 X-wing to prevent him from chasing them any further. With the hyperdrive repaired, Holdo anonymously informed Dameron of the Resistance's nature before escaping into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
