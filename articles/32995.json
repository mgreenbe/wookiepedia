Alongside Vader himself and fellow co-pilot \"Mauler\" Mithel, he had been infamously involved in various assaults on Ralltiir and Mon Calamari, which increased Black Squadron's reputation as the Empire's most feared squadron. He flew Black 3 during the Battle of Yavin, flanking Darth Vader, where he successfully defended the station's Thermal exhaust port up until he got behind Luke Skywalker. At the end of the battle, he was shot down by the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
