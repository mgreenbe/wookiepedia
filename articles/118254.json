While in prison, the former Governor was labeled as \"Prisoner X10.\" He escaped four years before the Battle of Yavin, after the Bridgers organized a prison break. The Bridgers were killed during their escape, so Azadi returned to Lothal to find their son, Ezra Bridger.

Despite these instructions from his superiors in the Empire, in reality, Azadi was complicit and at times directly involved in the activities of Ephraim and Mira Bridger, the couple creating the broadcasts. When Milo and Lina Graf were abducted by the bounty hunter Shalla Mondatha to be turned over to Imperial Captain Visler Korda, Azadi was the first person Ephraim Bridger contacted for help in mounting a rescue of the two  children.

Hoping to gain control of the doonium vein before Senator Domus Renking and the Empire could get their hands on it, Azadi sent his representative Arik Uvis to buy a controlling interest from owner Arihnda Pryce. Pryce, disinterested in letting someone outside of the Pryce family control the mine, turned down Azadi's offer, throwing Uvis out of the mine when he refused to relent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In retribution for Pryce's refusal of his offer, Azadi and Uvis falsified embezzlement charges that led to the arrest of Elainye Pryce. When Pryce went to Renking's office to appeal for her mother's release, he confirmed that Elainye would be held by Azadi until proven innocent and he could not be convinced otherwise.

As a result of his actions, Azadi was charged with treason and incarcerated in an Imperial prison, along with the Bridgers. Azadi was given the label \"Prisoner X10\" while he was imprisoned. Governor Azadi's \"forced retirement\" and imprisonment coincided with Arihnda Pryce winning Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's favor by disclosing the Higher Skies Advocacy Group's illegal espionage activities against the Empire and Moff Ghadi's attempt to use this intelligence to gain advantages over Tarkin. As a reward, Pryce was made the new Governor of Lothal. She oversaw the expansion of Imperial industry, mining, and military bases on Lothal, which under her rule became a major center of Imperial power in that region of the galaxy.

This inspired the Bridgers to rally Azadi and fellow inmates to escape. Azadi was able to escape from the prison, but the Bridgers lost their lives during the attempt. Azadi returned to Lothal in the hopes of finding Ezra, so he could tell the boy what happened to his parents, and Ezra likewise traveled to Lothal from Garel after seeing his parents and Azadi in a vision. Ezra found the former governor in a stone circle on Lothal, though Azadi did not know who it was at first and fired a blaster rifle at Ezra and his Jedi master, Kanan Jarrus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra managed to calm Azadi down by telling him that he was the son of Ephraim and Mira Bridger. Satisfied, Azadi led Ezra, Kanan, and the astromech droid Chopper into the stone circle which served as his adobe. There, the former Governor told Ezra about his connection to his parents. He also informed Ezra that his broadcast had inspired his parents to stage an escape but that they had perished during the attempt. Azadi then stayed inside the stone circle while Ezra went out into the open to grief his parents' deaths.

Kanan and Ezra had invited him to come along with them but Ryder did not want to expose himself to the Empire. While Ezra and Kanan were away, Ryder and Chopper were captured by a group of stormtroopers, who had orders to execute Ryder. Before the Imperials could take their prisoners into the custody, they were ambushed by Ezra, Kanan, Leia, and the other crew of the Ghost.

To hide Alderaan's support for the rebellion, Bail Organa had arranged for the cruisers to be sent to Imperial worlds where they would be \"stolen\" by the rebellion's agents. In response to these \"thefts,\" the Imperials had installed gravity locks on them.

He then offered the rebels his help in escaping offworld with the corvettes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the help of Ryder, the rebels concocted a plan which involved using the Phantom, the Ghost's auxiliary ship, to enter Supply Master Yogar Lyste's base. Still wearing their Imperial disguises, Kanan and Ezra escorted Leia back to the base and claimed to have rescued the Alderaanian princess from the rebels. While the Imperials were distracted, Ryder worked with Chopper and Sabine Wren to disable the gravity locks on one of the cruisers. While Sabine departed on the first corvette, Ryder and Chopper moved to the next ship and proceeded to disable its locks. However, they were discovered by Lyste and several of his stormtroopers. Before any harm could befall Ryder and Chopper, Kanan and Ezra knocked the Imperials out with the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the ensuing battle, Ryder watched Kanan using his lightsaber and quickly realized that the man was a Jedi. Kanan's intervention allowed Ryder and Chopper to disable the second gravity lock; allowing Kanan to pilot the ship. Realizing that the crew of the Ghost needed help, he boarded the third ship while Chopper proceeded to disable its gravity lock. Two stormtroopers pursued Ryder but Ezra used the Force to snatch their blasters while Leia stunned them with her blaster. At the helm of the third Hammerhead corvette, Ryder forced the ship to fly despite the gravity lock by engaging the thrusters, toppling an AT-AT walker in the process. Ryder then escaped with the other rebels into hyperspace with the three stolen corvettes.

Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper managed to jump into Ryder's speeder and the rebels fled for the highway. On the way, they narrowly ran into an Imperial road block and Ryder was forced to do a U-turn. Ezra and Kanan managed to use their lightsabers to cut down the AT-DP walker's legs. Ryder then led the speeder bikes on a chase through the highway. After telling the Spectres about his cell's work as saboteurs, Ryder reassured his comrades that the speeder bikes could not go beyond 190 km/h. True to his word, the speeder bikes exploded and crashed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ryder then drove the rebels to his hideout at a stone circle in Lothal's wilderness. There, they were joined by the Sumars and Jho. Ryder discussed the details of the Phoenix Squadron's plan with Ezra and Kanan. Morad agreed to help Ezra and his team infiltrate the factory disguised as workers and an Imperial courier droid respectively. The mission was complicated by a surprise inspection by the Chiss Grand Admiral Thrawn, who had been sent by Imperial High Command to investigate the high rate of defective vehicles at the Lothal Imperial factory. Thrawn staged a dangerous test demonstration on a 614-AvA speeder bike that claimed Morad's life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kanan tried to contact Ryder but found that the Imperials were jamming all comlinks.
