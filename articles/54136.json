Similar in many ways to the game of bolo-ball, get'shuk was played by teams of multiple players on a large field known as a pitch. Situated at either end of the pitch were goals wherein competitors would attempt to deliver a ball; unlike in bolo-ball, get'shuk players were allowed to handle the ball with limbs other than just their feet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While in his youth, the Mandalorian soldier Mij Gilamar had his nose broken during an intense game of get'shuk. Left with a crook in the bridge of his nose that stayed with him well into middle age, friends of Gilamar noted that the injury gave the typically good-natured doctor a more brutish outward appearance than one would expect."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Get'shuk was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in Order 66, the fourth entry in the Republic and Imperial Commando series.
