The West Fissure also regularly experienced winters. The planet's weather phenomena included clouds of Mooxx fat, dry rain, glacial cysts, irrational echoes, spotted snow, resistance shadows, and talking fogs, as well as rising precipitation that gave way to erupting snow at lower elevation levels. In addition, the surface of the world was affected by magnetic radiation and ionic phase shifts, the latter of which could vary on a daily basis. The mind eel was a species native to the planet, and the creatures and their offspring became excited by the solar flares affecting their homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, The Relevant Farm Act of Thairwsthis 12 established crop boundaries on the planet, although the native mind eels ignored them and thus posed a potential threat to the local farmers. Later, an atomic blast occurred on the moon Raspar-6, which a subsequent weather forecast for the planet's West Fissure region predicted to potentially have a months-long effect on the planet's atmospheric and surface conditions.

A specific calendar was used on the planet, consisting of nine months: Ensi, Stolivea, Aint, Nnters, Hinggnih, Neevlit, Dha, Bababbb, and Aaaaaalt. Several commemorative events known as the Days of Rejection were observed on the planet, with the first Day of Rejection taking place at some point following the start of Ensi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The West Fissure, also known as Region 29, was an area on the planet.
