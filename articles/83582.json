He was born a simple groundpounder in one of the countless slums that comprise the majority of the planet's surface, but he eventually made a name for himself in the gladiatorial arenas, both as an expert fighter and as a man who would do anything for the right price. Eventually he began competing in the floating city of Ektra, far above the urban blight. He worked as a ringer for the Nonsu Corporation, viciously assaulting his opponents and occasionally throwing a fight when ordered to. A quirk of his was to cut a notch in his ear after each victory. When not competing, he wandered the Moridebo District, spying on his fellow Nonsu employees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
