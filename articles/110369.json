It was small and could be carried in a pocket or on a belt clip. The Medisensor has a scanner to detect the patient's injury or illness with a keyboard used to input data or to access diagnostic programs. The low memory capacity meant it could only be used for up to five scans. It linked to a full medical computer via comlink/data transfer module."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
