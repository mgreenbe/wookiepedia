Seeking to lure the Free Ryloth rebels out of hiding, Sidious and his Sith apprentice Darth Vader traveled to Ryloth aboard Vader's flagship, the Imperial Star Destroyer Perilous.

Using Clone Wars droid starfighters and space mines, the Free Ryloth rebels managed to destroy the Perilous. However, they failed to kill either the Emperor, Lord Vader, or Moff Mors. The Sith Lords crash-landed on Ryloth and managed to stay ahead of the Free Ryloth rebels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Moff Mors learned about Belkor's conspiracy and reasserted control over the Imperial forces on Ryloth.

In an attempt to hide his dealings with Cham, Belkor attempted to use his V-wing starfighters to bomb both the village and Cham's forces. However, Moff Mors took command of Belkor's fighters and used them to kill the renegade Imperial. Cham and his forces launched their attack on the village but were neutralized by Mors' forces.

After the Republic was succeeded by the Galactic Empire, the Empire imposed a protectorate on Ryloth. While Ryloth was nominally independent and represented in the Imperial Senate by Senator Orn Free Taa, real power rested in the hands of Moff Delian Mors, the planetary governor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire exploited Ryloth for its spice resources. Eventually, a resistance movement known as the Free Ryloth Movement developed under the leadership of Cham Syndulla. By 14 BBY, Cham had succeeded in training hundreds of resistance fighters.

Cham was also helped by Colonel Belkor Dray, Moff Mors' second-in-command, who resented his boss. In an attempt to discredit Mors, Belkor supplied the Free Ryloth movement with intelligence on Imperial movements and shipments.

After consulting his lieutenant Isval, Cham decided to contact Colonel Belkor Dray to ascertain that it was not a trap. During the meeting, Belkor indicated he was aware of Orn Free Taa's visit but was ignorant about Palpatine and Vader's visit. Belkor also tried to break his relationship with Cham by threatening to reveal the Free Ryloth movement's hidden bases. However, Cham outflanked him by threatening to reveal all records of their meetings should he betray them.

Cham hoped to bring about the collapse of the Empire through the Emperor's death. For the next nine days, Cham and his fellow rebels including Isval, Gobi Glie, Xira, and Kallon spent their time planning for the assault on the Perilous at an underground base on Ryloth's third moon. Their assault force included a swarm of Clone Wars-era Vulture droids, Buzz droids, space mines, droid tri-fighters, and strike teams disguised as repair crew. Cham was able to assemble the strike force in the margins of the Ryloth system because Colonel Belkor had diverted patrol craft and flight clearances away from the periphery under the pretext that Imperial resources were limited."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ambushing the Perilous"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ten days after Cham received intelligence about the Emperor and Vader's visit, the Perilous exited hyperspace in the Ryloth system. Captain Luitt informed Vader and the Emperor that they had entered a space mine field. The Star Destroyer's deflector shields protected the Perilous from damage. Unable to retreat since they were surrounded by mines on all sides, Vader ordered Captain Luitt to dispatch the Star Destroyer's V-wing starfighters and to double the power to the forward shields. In response, Cham ordered Kallon to activated two dozen modified mines which set up a counter-grid that drained the Star Destroyer's shields."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kallon's modified mines drained the Perilous's shields. When the Imperials discovered this, Vader convinced Captain Luitt to let him lead the V-wings to take out the modified mines. With the Perilous trapped and its shields depleted, the Free Ryloth movement deployed several hundred yulture droids from a nearby asteroid field. While Vader led the V-wings in combat, Palpatine remained aboard to watch the battle unfold. Vader and his V-wings quickly found themselves outnumbered by the Vulture droids and the V-wings. The Perilous's hull also sustained damage from the mines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Imperial fighters overwhelmed, Gobi launched a wave of vulture droids carrying hundreds of buzz droids, which were capable of dismantling starships. These vulture droids proceeded to ram the Perilous in an effort to deliver their cargo.

Using the dark side of the Force, Vader ripped apart a wave of vulture droids, causing the droid fighters and their buzz droids to collide and explode in space. While the V-wings formed a perimeter around the Perilous, Vader returned aboard the stricken Star Destroyer to rejoin his master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Isval and a strike team of fighters waited aboard disguised repair ships ready to board the Perilous disguised as repair crew. Upon learning of the attack, Colonel Belkor feigned shock to both his superior Moff Mors and his subordinates. Belkor also learned from Moff Mors that the Emperor and Vader were aboard the Perilous. Belkor dispatched repair ships and fighter escorts to aid the Perilous. He then contacted Cham and learned that the Twi'lek rebel leader's true plan was to kill the Emperor and Vader. Cham forced Belkor to continue with the plan and instructed him to do nothing more than supervise the repair and rescue missions and report for anything suspicious.

Three Free Ryloth boarding teams including Isval's Repair Eighty-Three joined a fleet of Imperial and Rylothian repair ships which departed from Ryloth into space. Isval commanded a team that included Faylin, Drim, Crost, and Eshgo. The repair teams discovered that the Star Destroyer was badly damaged and was leaking flames from dozens of onboard fires. Imperial and Twi'lek fire suppression ships began spraying suppression foam on the Perilous. Isval and her team managed to gain permission to land aboard the Perilous by claiming to be a specialist team that would assist with the engine compartment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon boarding Bay 266R, Isval and her repair team were escorted by a Lieutenant Grolt down a turbolift that led to the engine compartment. On the way, Isval shot Grolt in the head with her concealed blaster and hid him inside their antigrav pallet. Isval's team then made their way past two Imperial officers to the hyperdrive chamber. The boarders found their path blocked by four stormtroopers, who were guarding the hyperdrive chamber. Isval tried to convince the stormtroopers to let them through when Grolt's comlink began beeping. As a result, the stormtroopers drew their arms and Isval and her team were forced to kill them as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Darth Vader returned to the bridge of the Perilous. Overcome by rage, he used the Force to levitate and Force choke Senator Orn Free Taa. After throttling Taa, he hurled the Twi'lek to the floor and reported that there was a traitor among his staff. When Captain Luitt asked whether Taa was a traitor, the Emperor reiterated that one of Taa's staffers was a spy. Taa apologized and vowed to help them root our the traitor. The Emperor ordered Luitt to restrict the senator's staff to their quarters and to deny them access to communications equipment and computer terminals.

As part of Isval's plan, Kallon would deploy two dozen droid tri-fighters to distract the V-wings so that Isval's team count hunt down and destroy the Emperor and Vader. Cham agreed to contact Belkor and get him to transmit the ship ID of the Emperor and Vader.

Mors survived the attack but her pilot Breehld was killed. Isval and Eshgo's escort boat managed to track down Vader and the Emperor's shuttle in the dense debris field.

Two of Cham's rebel freighters eventually found the Sith Lords and their guards trudging through Ryloth's equatorial forest.
