Setting up headquarters in the capital city of Lessu, the Skakoan and his tactical droid TA-175 ruled the planet with an iron fist and many Twi'leks starved as a result of the Separatist occupation. Ryloth was also blockaded by a large Separatist war fleet to deter any Republic attempts to retake Ryloth.

As a result of this counter-attack, the Venator Star Destroyer Redeemer was crippled while another ship, the Defender, was badly damaged.

By this stage, Republic starfighters under General Skywalker had secured the space around Ryloth and General Kenobi had taken the Jixuan desert, allowing the planet's southern hemisphere to fall under Republic control.

While Tambor was alarmed by Dooku's order, the Count explained that he wanted to use Ryloth to demonstrate the cost of a \"Republic victory\" to the galaxy. As Republic forces closed in on Lessu, Tambor ordered TA-175 to prepare his shuttle for departure. Tambor refused to leave until the last of Ryloth's treasures had been loaded onto his shuttle. This infuriated Count Dooku who wanted him out of the city before Republic reinforcements arrived.

Tambor was later freed from Republic custody and rejoined the Separatist war effort, retreating to the Techno Union's headquarters in Purkoll, a city on the planet Skako Minor. At some point, Tambor obtained a captured ARC trooper CT-1409 \"Echo,\" who had been presumed killed during a mission to the Citadel. Tambor used Echo's mind to gain a strategy algorithm. Holding Echo within a stasis chamber, Tambor used the unconscious clone trooper to feed the Separatist Admiral Trench with information on the Republic's tactics during the Battle of Anaxes. Using the algorithm, the Separatist tactics matched plans created by Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" and Echo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the strategy algorithm mined from Echo's mind, Admiral Trench won several victories on Anaxes and seemed poised to conquer the planet. In response, Rex and a group of clone troopers known as the \"Bad Batch\" infiltrated a Separatist Cyber Center.

Before they could access the chamber, the clones were contacted via hologram by a gloating Wat Tambor, who informed them that they had stumbled into a trap. He told them that he had used Rex's strategy algorithm to predict every move they had made since their arrival on Skako Minor. When Tambor accused the clones of violating Skako Minor's neutrality, Rex responded that the Techno Union had already violated the planet's neutrality by bringing a Republic prisoner. Before departing, Tambor praised the clones for doing their part and ordered several D-wing droids to execute the intruders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clones managed to free Echo from the stasis chamber but found themselves trapped in the tower. By that time, Wat Tambor and several aides had arrived on the facility's ground floor. Tambor ordered his Skakoan associates to prepare the Decimator, a spherical device capable of attacking the Republic forces. However, Skywalker and the clones managed to escape the Core Systems room through an exhaust tunnel before the Decimator could breach the chamber. A confused Tambor demanded to know why the Decimator shut itself off and then looked through the hole it had cut into the door upon being informed that it could detect no organic matter, only to see that the Republic troops had left a \"parting gift\" in the form of several thermal detonators planted about the room. Tambor had just enough time to utter \"Oh, no\" before the explosives detonated in his face, wrecking the core systems room and sending Tambor flying backwards several feet. After entering the damaged room, the foreman was incensed to find Echo, whom he regarded as Techno Union property, missing and the stasis chamber destroyed, ruining what he claimed was years of research. He ordered his forces to locate the Republic group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Tambor's best efforts to capture the intruders, Skywalker and the clones managed to tame several winged keeradak reptiles and escape to a Poletec village. In response, Wat sent a force of D-wing droids and octuptarra magna tri-droids to destroy them. However, the clones and their Poletec allies managed to trap them in a valley and defeat them. The surviving D-wing droids retreated and informed Wat of the defeat. The foreman regarded the loss of Echo as a devastating blow to the Techno Union's profit margins and wanted to find a way to recoup on his company's losses.

However, during the closing acts of the battle for Anaxes, Tambor had yet to do so.

The Separatist Admiral dispatched most of his forces to secure the main Republic assembly plant on Anaxes. This enabled Echo to deactivate them. The Republic and Jedi then managed to defuse one of Trench's bombs, kill the Admiral, and destroy his fleet.

Darth Sidious then informed the Separatist Council that his new apprentice Darth Vader would come and accept their surrender. However, Vader instead executed the Separatist Council.
