At some point during the time of the Galactic Republic, Dulce traveled with Thanda aboard the yacht Scourge to the space station Besh gate in orbit of the planet Zygerria, to await the arrival of the Clawdite Prit Kessek, a courier who had been hired to transport some credits for Thanda. However, Kessek's starship was hijacked by a group of spacers that had been sent to capture Thanda and the spacers arrived at Besh gate in Kessek's place.
