During the Clone Wars, Smi struggled to keep his corner market stocked and customers satisfied, and during the conflict, he had a smaller variety of products and suppliers, yet was able to continue to operate his market. To continue to run the market, Smi was forced to collaborate with less legitimate suppliers, though they were reliable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Clone Wars, the Galactic Empire established an Imperial Protectorate on Ryloth, and the planet was subjected to extreme rationing. The promised wealth and security that Smi hoped would come never did, taxes had significantly increased, and Imperial troops often freely took products without payment. The increasing debt forced Smi to take part in black market operations to keep the corner market open."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dicsato Smi's corner market was first mentioned in Dawn of Rebellion, a canon roleplaying 2018 sourcebook that is based on Star Wars Rebels and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
