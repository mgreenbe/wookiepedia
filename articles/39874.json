It was located at the top of the station, with only the long-disused command bridge above it, and accessible from the hallway below via a short turbolift. When the supertanker fuel depot was airborne, it could serve as the station's bridge. Doza kept his old Imperial uniform hidden in the office in a closet next to his desk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
