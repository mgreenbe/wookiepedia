The duology was envisioned as Star Wars's answer to the M*A*S*H film and television series, and it was pitched to Reaves and Perry as \"M*A*S*H in space.\" Both of them were large fans of both the movie and TV show and felt that doctors-during-war were interesting characters\u2014Perry additionally had a medical background\u2014and they made an effort to design characters who felt real, with personal problems that needed to be solved. Jos Vondar in particular has been compared by fellow Star Wars author Daniel Wallace to Hawkeye Pierce, the protagonist of the M*A*S*H franchise. In a review of Battle Surgeons posted on TheForce.net, reviewer Mike Cooper stated that he found it impossible to read any of Vondar's lines without hearing the voice of Alan Alda, the actor who played Hawkeye in the M*A*S*H TV series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the second half of Jedi Healer, Vondar's name is misspelled \"Vandar\" in almost every appearance, until the epilogue when it is once again correctly spelled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
