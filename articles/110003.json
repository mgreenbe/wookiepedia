It was infiltrated into the Imperial Sector Plexus station near Keltos IV. Its duties as an Imperial droid were to monitor the Plexus' computer networks for illegal intrusion. As an Alliance operative, Seecubed (as he was known to the Alliance) recorded information from the Plexus' computers and transmitted important data to the Alliance.
