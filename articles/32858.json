The starfighters were equipped with advanced targeting routines. In 32 BBY, amidst the occupation of the planet Naboo, DFS Starfighter Squadron was assigned to the flagship Saak'ak and was present when the Galactic Republic representatives arrived to negotiate a settlement, although the representatives were betrayed by the Trade Federation. When the representatives, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn escaped the flagship, they encountered resistance from several of the droid starfighters. DFS Squadron was later launched during the Naboo Space Battle to protect the Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palaa by engaging Naboo's Bravo Flight. The N-1 starfighters shot down many units of the DFS squadron, allowing them to attack the Droid Control Ship. After the young pilot Anakin Skywalker inadvertently destroyed the ship, all the droid units shut down. During the invasion, DFS-1308 was one of the starfighters which analyzed the capabilities of the N-1 starfighter but were not able to analyze the Human element inside the cockpit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known members"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DFS Starfighter Squadron appeared in 1999 with the release of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and its adaptations, and it was identified as such in the Star Wars Customizable Card Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
