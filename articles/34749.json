Beaten, Thanaton crawled to his fellow Dark Councilors, pleading for their aid, but Darth Mortis reached out with the Force and snapped Thanaton's neck, killing him instantly for breaking the rules of the Kaggath. With Thanaton's seat on the Council now open, Mortis offered his position to the young Sith. Darth Ravage protested, stating that Kallig, as merely a Lord, could not sit on the Dark Council, but Darth Marr silenced his protests, stating that Kallig had earned the right. In light of the reputation earned as a dark side master, Marr bestowed Lord Kallig with the title of Darth Nox, head of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, one of the twelve power-bases of the Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterwards, the newly christened Darth Nox returned to Dromund Kaas to enforce dominion upon those formerly of the Sphere under Darth Thanaton and gain their allegiance.

The threat of the Revanites had drawn both Nox's attention to the planet and ire upon the Revanites. However, in the midst of ruining the Revanites' efforts, Nox was contacted by Moff Pyron. Pyron had been with searching for Revanite infiltrators within Nox's power base and was giving the Dark Lord an update on the search. Along with this, Pyron reported several situations that Nox needed to choose, including the status of the Silencer weapon and the recruitment of the Alzarians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lastly, Pyron realized Nox was on Rishi, and told the Dark Lord of their servant, Lord Veijel, who had been seeking an audience. Nox and their companion, Talos Drellik, met with Veijel, who had been sent to Rishi thirty years ago by Darth Arctis and tasked with finding the secret of immortality. Veijel told Nox that he had built arrays that were supposed to communicate with others in the Rishi dwarf galaxy and that the arrays had received messages from other beings, supposedly Sith, Rakata, and Gree ancients. Veijel inquired that the arrays and beings were waiting for Nox due to their messages relating to the Dark Lord's past. Per Veijel's request, Nox set out and examined each of the arrays."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At each machine, the phrase, \"The Dark Lord's lifespan increases by one solar cycle\" was repeated. When Nox reported this to Veijel he became enthusiastic. Veijel told how Thanaton and Arctis believed the Rishi Maze held the secret to immortality but he himself doubted. The Sith Lord asked for fleets and scientists and forces so that he could explore the dwarf galaxy and find the secret to immortality. Drellik reminded Nox that the search for immortality was never successful, emphasizing Zash's failed plan. Drellik also told Nox that the Dark Lord's resources should be used to help the Empire rather than this quest. However, despite Talos' warning, Nox granted Veijel's request in pursuit of everlasting glory and immortality."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Revanite crisis, Marr admitted to Nox that no majority council vote would not be needed for military action, just theirs.

In their absence, Nox's crew was dismantled and separated, going off on their own. Talos Drellik returned to the Reclamation Service and was sent to investigate an ancient power on Yavin IV. Xalek was promoted to Sith Lord, but when his father's burial site on Ilum was disturbed by Republic miners, he vowed revenge, believing that his father would no longer be able to attain godhood. Ashara was condemned by the Jedi and couldn't trust the Sith, so she spent the years travelling the galaxy to aid others. When Darth Nox went missing, Andronikos spent his time searching for Nox by raiding ships, and at some point was almost killed by Vaylin during her time as Empress.

An example of Nox's manipulation mastery was when Nox successfully manipulated Ashara Zavros into opening a Sith holocron that began her transition into a Dark Jedi, her abandonment of the Jedi Order and her choice to become Nox's follower. Nox delved deep into experimenting with long forbidden powers and didn't hesitate to develop dangerous yet scientifically advanced weapons of mass destruction in order to increase influence and seize authority. This shows that Nox wasn't afraid to defy tradition, believing that the Sith Empire had to change methods and tactics to achieve victory, which made Nox a dangerous and hated enemy not only to traditionalists like Darth Thanaton but also to the Jedi and the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Nox took great pleasure in the feeling of subterfuge during their political maneuverings, the very suffering of others and would often torture weak minions, prisoners and opponents for simple amusement.

As such, Darth Nox cared little about one's standing in terms of one's species, valuing and respecting those who were useful and loyal to the young Sith Lord and to the Empire, a trait that was rare in the Sith Empire and was shared by Darth Nox's ally, Darth Marr."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Darth Nox's amoral nature and ambition to achieve power, Darth Marr and others note that while the young Sith's methods are unorthodox, they serve the Empire's interests, not just Nox's.

Telekinesis was among the young Sith's talents, such as when Nox threw Thanaton clear across the Dark Council chamber.

As explained by Aloysius Kallig, Nox has a rare \"pull among ghosts\", enabling them to sense their presence from a distance and invoke long hidden emotions.
