The battle took place because the Mandalorians campaigned to take control of the Core World of Duro. Called \"Mandalorian Triumph,\" the charge had two prongs, with one advance beginning within the Dernatine system of Hutt Space, which they had taken the year before, and continuing through the Charros system. This part of their Coreward advance was halted at Randon, where the Republic was able to defend the system. However, the other prong of the Mandalorian Triumph proved successful and Duro was taken."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle in the Randon system was mentioned in the 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas, written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
