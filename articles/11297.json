His craft, belonging to the B-wing/E2 sub-model, was made with a wider command cabin to accommodate a single passenger seated next to the pilot seat. While traveling with Princess Leia Organa on final approach to the planet Vortex, Ackbar crashed his B-wing/E2 into the Cathedral of Winds, destroying the structure and killing over 350 native Vors in the process. It was later discovered Ackbar's fighter had been sabotaged by his chief mechanic Terpfen, an unwilling agent of Ambassador Furgan of Carida."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
