One stage of the operation was a top-secret project to use a memory-wiping drug on people. The project was headed by Jenna Zan Arbor. She required a test subject who had undivided loyalty to the Empire. Senator Sano Sauro ordered Imperial Academy headmaster Maggis to find such a cadet.

With the help of Eve Yarrow, all major resistance leaders were ferried to Ferus Olin's secret asteroid base. Vader then went to the base with the help of Toma's homing device and destroyed the asteroid with a superweapon mounted on his Star Destroyer, a prototype for the Death Star superlaser. However, the project failed to kill all of the targets, which helped pave the way for the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
