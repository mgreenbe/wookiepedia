It was just one of the many conflicts in the war between the native Melida and Daan tribes. The battle took place one month after the Daan Micae and his three oldest sons were killed in another battle. Micae's wife, Leidra, participated in the battle after leaving their last son, Nield, with his cousin. Leidra was killed herself in the battle, leaving Nield an orphan. About eight years later, Nield's friend Cerasi would recount the struggles of his childhood, including this battle, to Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This battle is briefly mentioned in the 1999 young readers book The Defenders of the Dead, the fifth entry in Jude Watson's Jedi Apprentice young readers series. Leidra's death was later mentioned in the entry for Nield in the 2008 compendium The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia. Although Leidra is confirmed to be Daan in Nield's Encyclopedia entry, neither source explicitly states that she fought for the Daan specifically in this battle, nor does either source indicate the identity of the opposing force or the outcome of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
