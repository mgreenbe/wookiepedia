As Kuranu had a pathological fear of germs, the Dynamo was kept clean and sanitized by an army of small droids. The Chekkats utilized the vessel to travel to the Republic Fair on the planet Valo, where the elder Chekkat hoped to sell a four-seven nullifier that Klerin had created to the Galactic Republic senator Tia Toon. However, Toon declined to purchase the device, and the Dynamo was later destroyed by Nihil marauders when they attacked the Republic Fair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
