Thrawn had a low opinion of the man, and composed fitness reports that kept Tolann from rising above the rank of Commander. As a result, Tolann spent the final years of his military career routing waste-management convoys for Sate Pestage and Ysanne Isard during their reigns as rulers of the Empire. Thrawn's actions caused Tolann's grandson, Kester Tolann, to hate Thrawn's species, the Chiss, as well as any nonhuman species who, in Wester's eyes, dared to compete with Humans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
