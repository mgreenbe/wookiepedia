The forward hull section housed the bridge and living quarters for the crew, with cabins and accommodations behind for passengers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to Koensayr's focus on defense, the Citadel was a rugged and durable craft that was heavily armored and incorporated heavy military-grade shielding. As a result, the Citadel quickly gained a reputation for being able to take immense amounts of damage before failing, with it being quite common for Citadels to be rebuilt even after being virtually destroyed in battle. In addition to their defensive abilities, Citadels were exceedingly well armed with stock heavy weapons, a powerful KM-440.a1 reactor, and external docking clamps mounted ventrally amidships that could easily carry a pair of starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the Citadel's durability, it wasn't unusual for the vessel to go through multiple owners and multiple functions over its operation; a Citadel could often have a mix of military hardware, smuggling compartments, council rooms and meeting chambers, and even faded murals painted on the bulkheads."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable craft"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One notable Citadel-class cruiser was The Long Scale, owned by the Trandoshan mercenary Ssorku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Of notable debate is how exactly the Citadel lands on solid ground, due to its three large stabilizers. To date, all images of the Citadel show it docking at hovering platforms or through docking armatures; perhaps suggesting that ground landing is not possible.
