The hunters Winloss and Nokk carried a crossbow during a job given to them by Doctor Chelli Aphra. Nokk threatened to use it to kill a subdued Shadowfang Beast after learning Aphra would not pay them for their work, but handed it to Winloss as she could not bring herself to kill the creature. Winloss was unable to kill it either, and threw the weapon behind him, where it was picked up by Squoxx, who shot and killed the beast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
