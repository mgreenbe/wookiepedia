Their officer reported that they had a visual of two individuals who were loading a ship. IG-88 and Kallus left the starship and greeted the smuggler Han Solo by calling him a \"deserter.\" Kallus accused Solo of being an enemy of the Galactic Empire for helping Enfys Nest on Savareen. Kallus then ordered IG-88 to investigate the cargo Solo was loading. But before he could do it Solo's Wookiee partner, Chewbacca appeared and knocked the assassin droid and the Imperial Security Bureau agent back. Both parties exchanged blaster fire but Kallus ordered IG-88 back to the ship as Solo and Chewbacca escaped."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A daring move"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on the ship, Kallus informed IG-88 that it would be best to warn his fellow bounty hunters about the endless resources of the Empire. But then he looked over and saw the Millennium Falcon making a run for it between two Star Destroyers. Kallus ordered the star destroyers to open fire on the Falcon and to not let it escape. IG-88 believed that was a bad idea, informing Kallus that there was enough room for the Falcon to escape between the two destroyers. Kallus thought that idea was too insane but was shocked when the freighter did previously that."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at the cantina, IG-88 finished up his story.
