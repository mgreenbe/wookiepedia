Along with Valin, she stayed behind in the Great Temple with Anakin Solo, Tahiri Veila and Master Ikrit to fight off the Peace Brigade, much to Anakin's chagrin. While trying to escape Yavin 4, Sannah laughed when Valin caused a group of insects to attack Remis Vehn, forcing Anakin to chastise them for their actions.
