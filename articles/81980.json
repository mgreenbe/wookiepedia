It was obtained by redeeming a \"loot card\" from the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game expansion set The Shadow Syndicate. The loot card was only obtainable during a limited time event known as the \"Booster Shot scenario\" which ran from November 11 to December 15, 2009. Players received the loot card after their first completion of the scenario, in which they had to face Booster Terrik. After obtaining the card, the players could redeem it and then claim it on one of their characters on the same SWG account to receive the actual painting, which could be used as housing decoration. Because Form VII is depicted in both \"Juyo\" and \"Vaapad\" variants, the painting actually depicts eight lightsaber combat stances, not seven. While it would appear that the Aurebesh lettering along the top and left are meant to spell out \"The Seven Forms of Lightsaber Combat\" and \"Jedi Techniques,\" many of the letters used are incorrect."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
