It contained a bountiful garden that was a source of pride to its owner. One of the palace most prominent features was a mushroom-shaped tower, the facade of which contained many ogive windows. Several wings projected from and were subordinate to the main building, including the north wing, which contained a vast corridor. There were several entrances to the palace, including the east gate. King Alaric's audience chamber was a vaulted room with a high ceiling. The monarch sat on his throne at the far end of the room, with his back to the wide windows."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
