When Faeto placed a death mark on him, Oldksam, Sleash and Untas went into hiding. Sleash hided in Vaigon Shinn's Hideout. Nevertheless, Taibela stayed in Mos Eisley where she was questioned by a bounty hunter. The bounty hunter persuaded her to reveal where Oldksam was hiding and, after finding him, persuaded Oldksam to reveal Sleash's location. The bounty hunter finally arrived at Vaigon Shinn's Hideout and questioned Sleash. The bounty hunter gave Sleash his favorite spice and convinced him to talk. Sleash was upset that Untas went into hiding without him and gave his former partner's location, the White Thranta Shipping offices.
