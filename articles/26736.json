He led a mission to rescue the people of Mahranee from their slaughter at the hands of the Separatists. He attempted to evacuate the civilian Mahran population from the planet but the refugees' ships came under attack. He asked Count Dooku to let the civilians flee since they were innocent and the Separatists had successfully taken the planet. However, Dooku refused Chubor's request and allowed the destruction of the escaping refugee ships to continue, with Chubor's Republic frigate among them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
