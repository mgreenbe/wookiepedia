Beasts that varied in size, with four wings and flaps next to their jaws that dripped with extremely toxic acid. They had the ability to spray fire when intimidated, although seldom used it. They attacked Gamorrean villages a few times a year to feed on their Dwoob pets or on the actual Gamorreans. Mostly, though, it absorbed energy from the acid swamps it spent it's days wallowing in."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
