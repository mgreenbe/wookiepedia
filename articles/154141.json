A greatly looked-over fact was that this would possibly leave the Galactic Republic in deeper debt that it already was. After a recent attack on the Coruscant power generator, an enraged Confederacy Head of State, Count Dooku reached out to the Senate and informed them of a Republic attack that took the lives of many. As a result, he pulled back the peace proposal which Padm\u00e9 Amidala had recently erected with the help of her Separatist friend, Mina Bonteri, who Dooku claimed had allegedly been among the victims of the Republic attack. After Dooku ended contact, the Nikto senator shouted that the Republic must remain strong and not show any weakness which was backed up by numerous other senators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
