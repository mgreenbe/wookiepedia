One of their favorites, they played it in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered to find passage from Tatooine to Alderaan. Kenobi and Skywalker got into a fight with patrons Ponda Baba and Dr. Cornelius Evazan shortly after arriving, interrupting the playing of the Modal Nodes, but when the fracas died down, they resumed the song. The song was notably number one on Tatooine's greatest hits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
