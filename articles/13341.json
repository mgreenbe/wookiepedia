It consisted of dividing the Yuuzhan Vong forces into two halves of six clusters each, one stationed at Borleias and the other at Reecee, and having them converge on Coruscant in a pincer movement. It was put into action in 27 ABY after the Yuuzhan Vong were humiliated by the Jedi capture of New Republic hostages from Talfaglio."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The capture of Borleias and the capture of Reecee went as planned, but Tsavong Lah's strategy was undermined by the Battle of the Black Bantha, where the Reecee fleet was detected and wiped out in advance by Sien Sovv. This resulted in the destruction of his pincer strategy, but to compensate, he resorted to the use of mass human shielding via captured refugee convoys. In the end, the plan resulted in the capture of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
