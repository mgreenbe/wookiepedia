His Star Destroyer was part of a flotilla including Commodore Idel's Star Destroyer and Captain Conro's Star Destroyer which attempted to recover the Emperor Palpatine's yacht Imperialis from Lando Calrissian and his team. During the pursuit, both Shan and Conro's ships locked their tractor beams onto the Imperialis. However, Lando Calrissian drew Conro's tractor beam onto Shan's ship, causing the two vessels to crash into each other. The collision allowed Calrissian and his team to escape with the Imperialis into deep space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
