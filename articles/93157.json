During this time, Imperial Intelligence had considered Corde as missing in action, and she eventually felt trapped in her new role as the non-Force-sensitive mother to a Skywalker child. Corde believed that she had a different path to follow than that of Kol and the Jedi, and she felt that by her continuing her military career, she was doing the right thing. In the face of objections from Kol, Corde decided that leaving her husband and young son was what was required of her.

After pointing out that Stazi and Mingo Bovark, Fel's emissary, were discussing an alliance, she suggested breaking up the negotiations, but to do it in a way that made it seem like both parties were going to blame the other. Torlin then proposed using several Command Override Limpet Droids on the Imperial vessel, and once they were attached, the pair overrode the commands of the Imperial shuttle from Torlin's ship and shot at the Galactic Alliance shuttle.

She was the one who realized that Darth Krayt was going to seize power for himself and she therefore warned Emperor Fel about the upcoming coup against him. This makes her the true instigator of the conflict that followed in which she also played a great role. She spent the next seven years trying to overthrow the Sith and even tried to save Emperor Fel when she learnt he was in danger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calixte/Corde refused to let anyone get close to her emotionally, and that extended to her relationship with her children. She had little to no part in her daughter Gunn's upbringing, with Gunn's father, Rulf, being her primary caregiver. For her part, Gunn despised her mother, even going so far as to call her a \"nasty old rancor.\" Her relationship with her son Cade was practically non-existent, having left him and his father, Kol, when Cade was around two years old. However, when she found out that Cade had survived the Massacre at Ossus and was being sought after by the Sith, she reactivated her Morrigan Corde persona for the sole purpose of rescuing him. Because the sight of him would threaten to overtake her emotions, she refused to be near him both times she had located him. Cade, for his part, assumed his mother was long dead, and was shocked to discover otherwise. As for her relationship with Kol Skywalker, she has proven to have fallen in love with him, reasoning that, despite her personality, he still loved her. Whether she truly loved Rulf Yage is unknown, but she did tell him the truth about herself and said she didn't expect his forgiveness for what she had done, meaning she at least hoped to make things right between them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By her own admission, Corde had some success in shielding her thoughts from Force users.

The final scene of the issue, in which both characters are revealed to be the same person at Calixte's apartment, was written in a way so that the reader is the only person privy to the secret.
