The institution boasted many impressive artifacts, including the recently retrieved and restored Great Heep. A former member of the institution was the infamous droid torturer Professor Cantebarius H. Broom, who was motivated by paranoia of droids due in large part to discoveries made during research of the Great Heep, most notably that it was a member of the Abominor race of sentient droids and that no less than eighteen of them, including the Great Heep, were existent in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
