Between 3643 BBY and that year, the music was the anthem of the Galactic Republic who was fighting the Galactic War against the reconstituted Sith Empire. By 22 BBY, at the time of the Clone Wars fought between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, \"All Stars Burn as One\" was still the anthem of the Republic. While the song excited the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi at one point in his life, the tense political and militaristic situations that permeated the Clone Wars eventually made hearing the song uncomfortable for him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war, around the year 22 BBY, Kenobi was sent to the prison planet Ord Cestus to prevent the sale of the Force-sensitive JK-13 security droids, which posed a significant threat to Jedi. Upon his arrival in Ord Cestus's capital, ChikatLik, a band of musician droids greeted the Knight's party with renditions of the Cestian anthem and \"All Stars Burn as One.\" The anthem was also played when a high-ranking officer or visiting dignitary would arrive at a Republic site. In 20 BBY, the anthem was played when Admiral Tarnese Bleyd arrived to inspect Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7 during a battle on the planet Drongar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the Republic became the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, the Empire passed a law known as Imperial Edict 2.33b that forbade the playing of \"All Stars Burn as One.\" Around the year 12 BBY, Princess Leia Organa of the planet Alderaan tampered with the public address system during an assembly at the Collegium for Young Ladies in Crevasse City, re-programming the device to play the forbidden anthem.
