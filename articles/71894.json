A group led by Lieutenant Varias, including Jornel Savas, Officers Hirka, Kener and Mener, and several CorSec troopers, was dispatched from Coronet to investigate. The unit discovered an old and fully automated droid factory, presumably built in secret by the Separatists during the Clone Wars. The CorSec ignored that the factory had been reactivated by IG-88 for his project of Droid Revolution. The droid factory was defended by many battle droids but the Corellian government was reluctant to send reinforcement since it would like to avoid drawing the attention of the Galactic Empire. Agent Savas was therefore tasked to recruit independent spacers to assist the CorSec in the factory. He contacted CorSec agent Taarna who used to work with spacers on Talus and his old friend accepted to help him. Several spacers later traveled to Corellia to fight the droids and shut down the factory. According to Lieutenant Varias, the intervention of the spacers permitted to contain the crisis and avoid a disaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jornel Savas was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
