When the deal fell through, Kayl had ordered the CSF to evict the Guild which had led to them planning the terrorist attack. Winborn asked that the Republic individual confront the Senator as he did not want to be responsible for the end of her career. The individual did so and Senator Kayl agreed to inform the Galactic Senate of the deal, after which, she resigned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Winborn had light skin with brown hair and green eyes.
