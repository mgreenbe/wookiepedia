Using large spinning extractors, pumps and holding silos for its mining operations, it also had a large landing pad for collection of processed materials by cargo craft for transport off the facility. A small main habitable area housed crew, but the facility was almost completely automated with minimal need for sentient intervention or control in normal operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corellia Mining Corporation sold the CMC-A14 design to many different groups including the Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance and Zann Consortium under a deal in which CMC would receive a portion of any profits made from their operation. Such groups employed these primarily to both fund and supply materials for starship construction at their starbases."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
