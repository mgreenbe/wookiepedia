The book was published by Chronicle Books in 2011 and shipped in December of that year as a pack-in with the preorder collector's edition of the massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG) Star Wars: The Old Republic. The book features artwork by Sperasoft Studios, Roman Artamonov, Fedor Losev, Lorenz Hideyoshi Ruwwe, Clint Young, and Arnie Jorgensen, as well as maps and diagrams by Michael Voigt. The book includes three inserts: the Jedi Temple floorplan; Article 15, Section 9 of the Treaty of Coruscant; and the Shield Generator Defense Plan by Master Belth Allusis. The entries in the book all include dates, but the dates are incorrectly offset by ten years; placing events such as the founding of the Galactic Republic as 21,390 BTC (25,043 BBY) instead of 21,400 BTC (25,053 BBY)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
