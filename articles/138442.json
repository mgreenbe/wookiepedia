The sights of the TC-22 were skewed slightly to one side\u2014a common problem among TC-model blasters. Over time, the scope often lost its precise calibration, although that problem was easily fixed with some adjustments. The rifle had decent blasting power and a range of up to sixty-four meters, although each power pack only held enough energy for fifty shots before it had to be replaced. The rifle model used in the Galactic Civil War was black and had a blue firing chamber, and the scope was close to the wire stock."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TC-22 rifles were first manufactured sometime prior to the Battle of Phaseera, which took place in 1002 BBY. The TC-22 was the first rifle that was assigned to most soldiers in the Brotherhood of Darkness's Sith army, and it was reserved for new recruits and soldiers with lower ranks. Sergeant Dessel, a former cortosis miner from the planet Apatros, preferred to use a TC-22 when he fought as a member of the Gloom Walkers, a unit in the Brotherhood of Darkness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An updated replica of the TC-22 blaster rifle was still in use by the time of the Galactic Civil War.

As a purchasable weapon, the TC-22 is worth 1,000 tokens and can be turned into a schematic by the player, then taken to a trader and recreated into a more powerful version of the weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
