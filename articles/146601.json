They were working on creating the Great River, a string of safehouses to transport Jedi across the galaxy. Among the cargo confiscated were three E-wing escort starfighters, 200 kilos of lommite, and a large supply of rations. All this would be delivered to Shelter base in the Maw, as the start of a privateering effort by Solo. The hold also contained amphistaffs grown on Wayland."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tinmolok itself was also taken to the Maw and used forthwith by the New Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
