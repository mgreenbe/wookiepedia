In 3643 BBY, the Mon Calamari General Var Suthra arranged for a Defender-class light corvette to be delivered to the docking bay for a young Jedi Knight to use to travel to the planet Ord Mantell, as part of the Jedi's mission to stop the Sith Lord Darth Angral from utilizing stolen superweapons against the Republic. The Coruscant Spaceport Authority also authorized the Jedi Knight to continue to use the docking bay for the ship whenever the Jedi's crew returned to Coruscant over the next few years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Docking Bay 74 first appeared in the Jedi Knight mission \"New Intelligence\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011.
