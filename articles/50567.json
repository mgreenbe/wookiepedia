It was formerly known as the Stormtrooper One prior to SoroSuub changing its allegiance and throwing its support to the Rebel Alliance and New Republic. The Stormtrooper One was a clone of the BlasTech E-11 rifle, and saw far less use than that weapon, though the Imperial war machine did use both products."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its frame was a simple tubular design, with most of the internal components having been designed to wrap around the barrel. As such, the barrel runs more or less the entire length of the weapon. As a result, it had good long range accuracy in spite of its compactness, and packed a powerful punch, though not nearly as much as BlasTech's A280."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were three settings for the Stormtrooper One: single fire, short bursts, and potentially barrel-damaging full auto-fire. The weapon's sighting package included a computer-enhanced scope, and simple iron sights in case the scope fails in combat. The most apparent weakness of the rifle was the flimsiness of the folding wire-frame shoulder stock."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
