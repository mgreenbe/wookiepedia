By the time of the Battle of Yavin, Mepou was an old man and a very disillusioned Meatlump. Around 1 ABY, the old Meatlump was smashing some generators in Coronet to please her lieutenant, Kaiya Merel, when he encountered a spacer. The spacer was working for Vani Korr, a Corellia Times reporter who was investigating the Meatlumps. Mepou confessed he could not retire from being a Meatlump unless a new person take his place. The spacer, who wanted to infiltrate the Meatlumps, accepted to replace Alliin and the old man finally retired. The spacer moved to work for Kaiya Merel while Alliin Mepou planned to go find some seashells on the beach, or jut sleep all day and watch holovids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alliin Mepou appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
