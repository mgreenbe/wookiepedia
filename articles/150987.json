She was brought with the Scyre and the Claw when they chased Phasma, Torben, Carr, Siv and Gosta, who had embarked on a mission to help Brendol Hux return to his ship that had crash landed on the planet Parnassos. Once they returned to the ship and the First Order came to rescue Hux, Frey, along with Phasma, was recruited into the First Order. She was nicknamed \"warcry\" by her fellow recruits, because of how she would scream when charging into battle. By the time Vi Moradi was captured by the First Order Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Absolution, Frey had been dead for six months due to what Phasma, now a Captain in the Order, described as a weapon malfunction during a training exercise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "UV-8855 first appeared in the 2017 novel Phasma.
