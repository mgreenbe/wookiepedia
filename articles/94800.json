It was centered around the star Naboo. It was kept clean and free of smugglers by the RNSF (Royal Naboo Security Forces) and their trained pilots. However, Hutt crime lords such as Gorr Desilijic Ebelt and Borvo along with their henchmen lurked in the fringes of the system. It was home to humans such as Palpatine & Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and Gungans such as Jar Jar Binks and Rugor Nass."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
