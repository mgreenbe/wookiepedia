Feeling unable to fit the elements of his weapon together, Mace despaired until the architect droid reminded him that it was the Force that bound the pieces together through Mace himself.

Though Guattako believed the Jedi defeated, Mace sent a call to his fellow Jedi through the Force and revealed it had been his intention to get captured all along. As he spoke, he used his telekinetic powers to reassemble his lightsaber, using it to chop off Kyossk's hand and battle Guattako's forces. He engaged Guattako in single combat until one of the warlord's young Padawan captives shot him in a bid for freedom.
