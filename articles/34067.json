Later, he and his four comrades met up with Rebellion heroes Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca and they managed to work out a mutual working relationship between the Rebels and ex-stormtroopers. LaRone and the group ended up on Shelkonwa, where they helped Mara Jade eliminate treasonous Governor Barshnis Choard. After learning the identity of him and his men, Jade let them go and the five stormtroopers made their way across the galaxy intent on aiding other Imperial citizens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LaRone and his ex-stormtrooper companions continued their vigilante actions, eliminating small-time warlords and forcing the resignation of a small-time administrator. Their actions were monitored by Jade, who decided to enlist their assistance in infiltrating the palace of Governor Bidor Ferrouz, who was suspected of treason, on Poln Major. With little other choice but to lend their aid, LaRone and his men helped Jade breach the palace security, only to encounter Luke Skywalker again shortly afterward. Skywalker became embroiled in a plot by a local warlord, Nuso Esva, to seize control of the system after pitting the Rebel Alliance and Empire against each other, and LaRone and his stormtroopers helped rescue him. When Jade caught wind of the plot, she rescued Ferrouz and Rebel ambassador named Vestin Axlon and gave them a temporary reprieve while they deal with Esva. She entrusted the two to LaRone and his men and they hunkered down in an abandoned tapcafe to hold off attacks from Esva's people, several of whom had already infiltrated Ferrouz's palace staff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Axlon proved traitorous and, though LaRone and some local Troukree allies they had acquired were able to deal with him, they soon faced waves of attackers in the employ of Esva. LaRone and his men put up a valiant defense, fending off the onslaught. After the attackers were defeated and Esva's forces in orbit defeated by a newly-arrived Imperial fleet, LaRone and his companions were taken by the Troukree to meet their employer.

In 10 BBY, when Imperial recruiters showed up, he enlisted as a Imperial Army with the call number TKR 330, not wanting to become a poor farmer like the rest of Copperline's residents. Three years later, he was accepted in the Stormtrooper Corps. He enjoyed the first six years of duty, until his service on worlds such as Elriss and Bompreil had made him doubt his loyalty. The turning point for him came when the planet Alderaan was destroyed, and he was ordered to kill civilians during a raid on Teardrop in 0.5 ABY, while stationed as part of the stormtrooper contingent aboard the Reprisal. LaRone was hesitant to open fire on the civilians and was horrified at the deaths that were caused."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Going rogue"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to Reprisal, LaRone was later confronted by Imperial Security Bureau Major Drelfin, who initially criticized him for not following regulations. Once Drelfin realized that LaRone had disregarded orders on Teardrop, though, the ISB officer grew more agitated and was intent on executing LaRone. In response, LaRone disarmed and slew Drelfin with his own blaster. The other stormtroopers who witnessed the event\u2014Saberan Marcross, Taxtro Grave, Joak Quiller, and Korlo Brightwater, along with LaRone\u2014realized that not only were their careers in the military over, but their lives would probably also be taken in any subsequent investigation, stole the Gillia, a Suwantek TL-1800 that had been specially modified by the ISB, and fled Reprisal. To facilitate their escape, they used ISB codes on the ship and pretended to be ISB operatives leaving Reprisal on a secret mission. Exploring the ship, the ex-stormtroopers soon found that the ship was stocked with weapons, several sets of stormtrooper armor, scouttrooper armor and even a spacetooper suit. Also onboard were credits, equipment for forging identities and even a pair of speeder bikes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Journeying to Drunost in their stolen ship, the five ex-stormtroopers landed, in search of food stores and other supplies, with LaRone as the unofficial leader. LaRone and Grave were able to purchase their supplies and were returning to the ship when a group of farmers they were traveling alongside came under attack by a swoop gang. LaRone and Grave held them off with hand blasters, until Brightwater, Marcross, and Quiller arrived with vehicles and heavier weapons, handily defeating them.

After the patrollers left, LaRone learned of the corruption of the local militia from a dockworker who was fueling their ship. The man, Krinkins, told them that Cav'Saran, the chief patroller, was behind the corruption and that the patrollers had been bullying the populace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LaRone, outraged at the injustice, convinced the others to help him take down Cav'Saran. That evening, LaRone drove a speeder truck to Patroller Central, where he had told Krinkins to assemble any who were dissatisfied with the corruption, after having his armored comrades disarm the six patrollers outside the building. Entering the center in civilian dress, LaRone confronted Cav'Saran, who ignored his demands for justice and proper treatment of the populace. In response, Cav'Saran instructed one his men to kill LaRone. At that point, LaRone signaled the other four stormtroopers into the room, and they quickly killed the few who offered any resistance, including Cav'Saran, before the rest surrendered. Turning the town over to Krinkins and some of the former militia that Cav'Saran had forced out when he took over, LaRone coined the Hand of Judgment name for the group when Atmino asked him their unit designation so he could file a mention of appreciation to his superiors."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rebel encounter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to Drunost in search of the connection they had discovered between Cav'Saran and the BloodScars they had fought earlier on Drunost, the stormtroopers began looking for more info to link them to the person behind the pirates, who they deduced would have to be high in the Imperial hierarchy. They were sitting in a tapcafe on Drunost when they saw Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca, although they didn't recognize them as members of the Rebel Alliance. They also saw several known criminals in the tapcafe. When the Rebel trio confronted the criminals after Luke decided to intervene, LaRone and his men helped them when the confrontation turned violent.

However, they decided to keep the Rebels on their ship for further questioning, in case the information they had been given by them was faulty. Extrapolating the data that Solo had given them and the HoloNet data they had gleaned from the pirates, they tracked the location of the pirate base to the Gepparin system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Heading to Gepparin with the Falcon attached to their ship and the Rebels locked into cabins in the Suwantek, they arrived about the same time as Reprisal did, and they came under attack by Ozzel, who was trying to cover his own career by stopping the deserters. Meanwhile, Luke, guided by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi, unlocked the cabin doors and found one of the hidden weapons compartments in the ship. Captain Kendal Ozzel threw a tractor beam onto their ship, pinning LaRone's ship in place. Fortunately for LaRone, the Falcon's crew was willing to help them. While Solo took over the controls of their Suwantek, Chewbacca took the Falcon, detached it, and destroyed two TIE fighters in the path of the tractor beam. Their destruction created enough reflective particles to disrupt the tractor beam, and both ships escaped the Star Destroyer, after Chewbacca's deceptive transmission convinced Ozzel to journey to the location of shattered Alderaan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LaRone and his men, along with the Rebels, landed to investigate the base.

Despite this complication, LaRone and the others resolved to find the traitor responsible for the pirate attacks, as they had deduced that someone in the Governor's office was responsible. Knowing that the Rebels would be soon discovered by the 501st if they went alone, LaRone proposed escorting them through the city, which they reluctantly agreed to.

Penetrating the perimeter of the Governor's mansion, the stormtroopers and Jade swiftly advanced, cutting through any resistance easily, and confronted the governor while Mara dealt with Caaldra once and for all. The governor blustered his way through their orders, and Marcross turned unexpectedly on the others, pointing his weapon at LaRone, as the governor was actually his uncle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Marcross gave Choard just enough time to completely incriminate himself when he changed sides again, placing Choard under arrest, though LaRone insisted that they not kill him. About that time, Mara Jade and Vader arrived, but Jade again covered for LaRone, saying they were on assignment to her. Later, she made them tell her their true story in private. After some consideration, she let them go, after instructing them to lose their Hand of Judgment name.

They eliminated a small-time warlord and a pirate nest, and also forced an oppressive administrator to resign. The Hand of Judgment also settled disputes, helping resolve a water dispute in Griren Province on Hapor. They defeated a group of mercenaries there with little ease, using the advantages of stormtrooper equipment and training, speeder bikes, and the weapons on their modified Suwantek transport to good use. However, their unending streak of vigilante missions had worn away at their cache of equipment, fake identification, and credits. Knowing that their career would soon be forced to halt from these logistical problems, LaRone and the others decided to embark on two last small missions\u2014dealing with a rigged election on Elegasso and a group of enslaved pottery artisans on another world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They flew to aid the pottery artisans, but were ambushed and knocked unconscious by means of a sedative gas. Upon awaking, LaRone found himself and most of his group at the mercy of administrator Bok Yost, the newly elected official from Elegasso, who had created the artisan rumor to lure them there. Yost was intent on having one of his henchmen turn them in as Imperial deserters, but before he could do so, Mara Jade intervened, subduing Yost and dispatching his thugs. She freed LaRone and his men, while forcing Yost to abdicate his ill-begotten position and hold a new election, free from fraud. Jade and LaRone then rescued Brightwater from where he'd been interrogated separately after assuming the role of the pilot to protect Quiller. LaRone asked Jade what she wanted and she replied that they would be helping her infiltrate the Candoras sector governor's palace. Jade had been tasked with investigating allegations of treason against Governor Bidor Ferrouz and possibly eliminating him if they were verified.

LaRone settled the dispute by having the Pineath return the allegedly defective knife\u2014actually in perfect working order, but did not expose the attempted scam in order to retain leverage over the Pineath. For his actions, he earned the gratitude of the Troukree, as well as information on Nuso Esva, a local warlord who had been threatening the Troukree for some time. Once done with the merchant, the Hand of Judgment followed Jade's orders and monitored the spaceport's stormtrooper contingent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having completed her own investigations, Jade then instructed them to abduct a pair of stormtroopers and requisition their shoulder pieces with their distinctive identification markings. LaRone followed orders, luring out a pair of stormtroopers so Jade could stun them with a sonic device. The two hapless troopers were relieved of their armor while Jade planned their next move. The Hand of Judgment was sent to follow her to the palace gate. When Jade crashed a speeder so as to be detained, LaRone and the others appeared, telling the guards that Jade had also robbed an electronics store. LaRone then convinced the guards to let him take Jade to detention, where he turned her over to Major Pakrie. Jade subsequently escaped and went on the hunt for Ferrouz, leaving LaRone and the Hand of Judgment to stand by outside the palace gate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While there, LaRone noticed a riot stirring up, with Luke Skywalker at the center of it. LaRone sent some troopers to assist the Rebel, who was being falsely implicated in the alleged death of the governor. They were successful and Skywalker escaped his assailants.

LaRone and Marcross approached the attackers from the rear and cut them down. Using the governor's private exit from the palace, they retreated through a tunnel into the storm drains, which led them to a tapcafe.

Axlon fired on the troopers, wounding Grave and Quiller and revealed that he had been working with Nuso Esva, who had been planning on pitting the Rebel Alliance against the Empire over Poln Major and then sweeping in to destroy both of their forces. Axlon told them to call in Skywalker, as he intended on using Skywalker's lightsaber to kill the governor, implicating the Rebel Alliance in the assassination. Axlon had hoped to secure Esva's allegiance to the Rebel Alliance by doing so, but after Governor Ferrouz distracted Axlon, Brightwater flipped a knife to Quiller, who stabbed Axlon, killing them.

When Jade, who had been trying to track down where Esva's men were holding the governor's family as hostages, reported in that she had found them but there were too many guards for her to handle, Governor Ferrouz called Major Pakrie, whom Jade had revealed was duplicitous. Ferrouz gave Pakrie their location under the pretense of consulting a security officer, in order to draw off Esva's men from the prisoners.

At first, LaRone thought they had failed, but upon emerging from the tapcafe, he found that the Troukree had neutralized their assailants.

LaRone often utilized flanking maneuvers involving additional firepower, speeder bikes, and snipers to defeat his foes. He was also noble, refusing to murder civilians, even to the point of accepting death. During the Hand of Judgment's vigilante actions, it was often LaRone who started them. He couldn't stand to see corruption or mistreatment of Imperial citizens, feeling that they still had an oath to protect and defend citizens of the Empire. LaRone was also persuasive, but willing to listen to the opinions and concerns of others. He was able to trust his men to carry out their duty and even became the leader of the group. LaRone was also able to look beyond his political differences with the Rebels, aiding Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. Remaining idealistic, LaRone never condoned the slaughter of civilians, nor participated it, as did the rest of the Hand of Judgment.

He was willing to sacrifice himself for his team; they were a close-knit group. Furthermore, LaRone was able to settle disputes fairly while not releasing all his leverage or fully exposing embarrassment. Unlike many Imperials, LaRone was able to view aliens without undue bias or xenophobia, which allowed him to work with Troukree fighters on Poln Major.
