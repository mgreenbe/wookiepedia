As with all Keshiri living in Alanciar, Quarra was raised on the teachings of Adari Vaal, who had managed to escape from the continent of Keshtah Minor, which was ruled by the Lost Tribe of Sith. Thus, Quarra and her compatriots were indoctrinated from youth to defend their homeland from any invasion by the Tribe.

In an attempt to hide her affair, Quarra attempted to return to Uhrar during the fighting. However, they were captured by the High Lord Edell Vrai, the leader of the Sith reconnaissance mission, and his marooned scouting party. In exchange for sparing the life of the wounded Jogan, Quarra agreed to guide Edell on a reconnaissance mission to Alanciar's military capital of Sus'mintri, which was located near the center of the continent.

Orielle compared her former life as a high-ranking member of the Sith tribe to Quarra's station in the Alanciar military. She also warned Quarra of the dangers of \"living within a dream.\" Convinced of the inevitable Sith take-over and intrigued by Orielle's peaceful life in the jungle, Quarra decided to remain loyal to her family rather than becoming the consort of Edell Vrai after the Sith have occupied Alanciar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Towards the end of their travels, the Lost Tribe launched a full-scale military invasion of Alanciar.

These Sith regrouped and succeeded in infiltrating the Alanciari military capital of Sus'mintri where they slew the entire Alanciari War Cabinet; effectively decapitating the Alanciari government.

When Edell and Quarra refused to support his plans, Bentado ordered his men to imprison them. However, they managed to escape and hid for a day within the secret library of Adari Vaal, the Rock of Kesh and the founder of Alanciari civilization.

While Bentado managed to overpower Quarra and Edell with his dark side powers, he was killed by his own Keshiri assistant Squab, who revealed that he had countermanded Korsin's orders to destroy Hilts' ship.

Jogan also told them that Bentado and the Ebon Fleet were the malevolent Destructors, who had been expelled from Keshtah. He also explained that Edell Vrai was a \"trusted friend\" of the Protectors whose airships were pursuing the Destructors. The Grand Lord Hilts also disguised himself as the Kesh-born minion of the Bright Tuash, an avian Keshiri deity.

While many of her people were convinced by the Tribe's demonstration, Quarra alone remained skeptical but found little support from her compatriots.

She and Brue produced three children with their eldest being a daughter who was almost twelve years old, making her eligible for military conscription as a trainee by the following year. As with all Keshiri living in Alanciar, Quarra was raised from her childhood to fear and hate the Lost Tribe of Sith, a group of Human Sith offworlders who had settled on Kesh during the Great Hyperspace War and dominated Keshtah Minor, Alanciar's neighbor in the southern hemisphere. In 4975 BBY, the Keshiri resistance leader Adari Vaal had escaped to Alanciar following a failed attempt to expel and destroy the Sith occupiers. She warned the Alanciari about the threat of the Tribe and the Alanciari subsequently developed into a highly advanced and militaristic society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All Alanciari, who had reached adolescence, were required to contribute in some way to the Great Cause which entailed resisting any Sith invasion of Alanciar. Quarra was no exception and served in several occupations including supply clerk, materials supervisor and finally wardmaster, a senior administrative position. Due to her Force sensitivity, Quarra also served for a period as a thoughtcrier, a Force-user who was able to send telepathic messages through the art of \"thought projection\". By 2975 BBY, Quarra had become the chief military administrator of her hometown of Uhrar. Despite her respectable position, Quarra was unhappy and dissatisfied with her monotonous and boring work. She disliked having to attend frequent distribution meetings which she regarded as pointless and boring. Quarra was also dissatisfied with her relationship to her husband Brue, whom she came to resent as dull and boring. In contrast to the competitive Quarra, Brue did not strive to be any better than a glassblower instructor to the elderly even though he hated his job. His unwillingness to upskill to a better paying job became a source of contention with Quarra."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A Secret Relationship"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quarra Thayn's unhappiness with her job and dissatisfaction with Brue led her to initiate an affair with another Alanciari man named Jogan Halder, who was a signal officer that was posted at Point Defiance, a seaside frontier outpost in the Six Claws of Alanciar's southern region, known as the Shank. This affair began in 2978 BBY while Quarra was making a routine visit to the city of Kerebba, an upstream military supply center on one of the canals that emptied into one of the bays defined by the Six Claws. Her cousin was a signal officer who operated the Kerebba signal station's semaphore system. Her cousin had read Halder's tales and had shared it with Thayn, who enjoyed his writings and fell in love with the author. When her cousin was reassigned, she had managed to transmit signals to Halder through the signal station at Uhrar introducing herself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This began a secret three year secret relationship in which thousands of messages were exchanged via between Halder and Thayn. Most of these dispatches arrived overnight at Thayn's office in Uhrar and she read them in the morning. For Thayn, Halder's letters came to provide a form of solace from the drudgery of her work as an administrator and mother. She soon began carrying these letters with her throughout her rounds, reading them during her free time. Frequent distribution meetings became opportunities for Quarra to brainstorm the responses she sent him before returning home. Quarra came to find Jogan to be an understanding reader who took long nights to craft thoughtful and eloquent responses to his lover. Partly due to the fact that Quarra only corresponded with Jogan by semaphore machine, she was able to hide her affair from her husband Brue and their three children."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2975 BBY, Quarra Thayn's life entered an important new chapter when she agreed to meet Jogan Halder in person for the first time at his workplace in Point Defiance. For that liaison, Thayn pretended to be away on a one-week trip to the industrial cities on the Northern Slope. She also forged a letter of transit by using her travel supervisor's seal to enable her to \"legally\" travel to Point Defiance as a thoughtcrier. As a frontier outpost, Point Defiance was manned by only two full-time personnel: the signal officer Jogan Halder and the thoughtcrier Belmer Kattun. Due to Alanciar's emphasis on defense, the continent had two separate communications systems to provide early warning of invasion and to circulate news and information across a large landmass. Alanciar had a network of semaphore machines which transmitted information through multicolored fireglobe displays. In addition, Force-users were also used to send telepathic messages. To give a reason to be at Point Defiance, she would pretend to be Belmer Kattun's relief."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For this journey, Quarra packed her clothes and travel documents inside a duffle bag. While traveling from Uhrar to Garrow's Neck, Quarra rented a muntok, a six-legged reptilian beast of burden, from a corral in the town of Tandry. Since she did not know the animal well, she was unable to call it by its name. Quarra arrived at a fort in Garrow's Neck which guarded the pass to Point Defiance. Upon arriving, she was stopped at the checkpoint by Captain Ruehn of the 208th Training Division of the Southwestern Directorate, who requested to see her letters of transit and commission. The Garrow's Neck fort also served as a training camp for adolescent Alanciari trainees who were practicing with firing ballistae, an artillery weapon used by the Alanciari. Since Garrow's Neck was considered to be part of the Alanciari frontline, security was tightest there and the fort was stationed by some of the best and most experienced officers in the Alanciari military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Captain Ruehn realized that Quarra outranked him as wardmaster, he apologized to her. However, she assured him that he did not need to apologize since he was close to the \"knife's point\" of Alanciar, the frontier which faced the Sith-controlled continent of Keshtah. When Ruehn expressed his surprise that Quarra had chosen to visit the frontier during a time when preparations were being made to celebrate that year's Observance Day, Quarra merely replied that it was a good time to visit the front. Observance Day was a festival held every ten years on Alanciar to commemorate the ten years of Adari Vaal's secret resistance against the Sith occupiers in Keshtah. That Day also served to instill patriotic duty among the Alanciari. After Ruehn was certain that her travel documents were valid, Quarra was then allowed to continue on her journey to Point Defiance on a winding and rocky road. Air and sea travel was restricted in this area since it was a militarized zone."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A Date with Destiny"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near evening, Quarra Thayn finally arrived at Point Defiance, which consisted of a signal tower and a walled courtyard on top of an artificial cliff known as the \"western barriers.\" Upon arriving at the outpost station, Quarra was greeted by an elderly Keshiri man named Belmer Kattun, whom she initially mistook for Jogan Halder. Quarra quickly realized that Belmer was the station's thoughtcrier and a fellow Force-user. When Quarra produced her documents for Belmer to examine, he told her he did not have to see since his friends at the fort in Garrow's Neck had already let her through. Quarra then entered the tower through its main gate and went into the kitchen, where she found Jogan Halder cooking a meal. Jogan was also humming a popular Alanciari sailor's song. After finally meeting her lover in person, Quarra took an immediate liking to Jogan's appearance; particularly his well-built and fit physique. After apologizing for not greeting her outside since he was browsing through Point Defiance's library, he offered to serve he stew but she declined."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jogan explained that he had been reading a parchment which he had borrowed from the station's library, and that he liked to eat while eating. Since Quarra had come from a big city to the frontier, she was surprised to learn that Point Defiance had a library. Halder explained that having a library with books helped soldiers and signalers posted to the frontier alleviate boredom. He then asked Quarra if she had met his thoughtcrier colleague Belmer while he was on the way out. When she confirmed that she did and had mistaken him for Jogan, he commented that he did send romantic messages out under Belmer's name. He then retracted his comment, saying that he had been joking and that Belmer like fermented beverages. Qaurra commented that such characteristics were not what one wanted to find in a thoughtcrier. While acknowledging that Belmer was obsessed with lovers, he responded that the man did not drink while on duty. Jogan then placed Quarra's duffle bag, which contained her clothes, between the doors to the two bedchambers in the tower. This was the tower's equivalent of a baggage-handling system. The couple had not planned the specifics of their sleeping arrangement for the week of Quarra's visit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Quarra noticed the rustic and informal look of Point Defiance, Jogan Halder apologized that Point Defiance was not up to conventional inspection standards since it was situated at the end of the inspection route and was staffed mainly be old bachelors. Quarra assured him that Point Defiance was tidier than her family home, which was home to three children and her husband, Brue, who was often away at work for long hours. When Jogan asked about her husband, Quarra assured him that he was fine. Halder than took his lover and quest on a tour of the facilities at Point Defiance. First, her showed her his workstation: a semaphore station. Jogan then gave Quarra a demonstration of how to operate the complex semaphore machine, which used a fireglobe grid to transmit various colors in order to send a message. While Quarra was familiar with the semaphore system due to her basic military training, she was unable to send signals as fast as an experienced Alanciari semaphore operator like Jogan, who only took five seconds to send the destination code and begin transmitting his missive. Jogan explained that working as a signaler took regular practice and that it was a considerable amount of work just to transmit a simple sentence like \"Belmer Kattun has headed off to sleep on the floor of a tavern for a week, and that his relief has arrived.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By then, Belmer had gone on leave and Quarra was supposed to be the replacement thoughtcrier. Jogan also assured Quarra that he was not using her name and that she was just one anonymous warrior for the \"Great Cause\": preventing any Sith invasion of Alanciar. For that weekend, Jogan and Quarra had planned to have a different \"Great Cause\": satisfying their romantic love for each other. Jogan showed Quarra where the thoughtcrier's meditation room was. When Quarra asked him whether he could not use the Force, he acknowledged that he was not Force-sensitive unlike her. Halder also commented that he preferred his own way of sending messages. Jogan then took Quarra to the western balcony of Point Defiance's tower, which overlooked the Coral Banks in the Southern Passage.

He then added that this was the same direction where the Sith, the \"greatest evil that Kesh had ever known\", dwelled in their domain of Keshtah Minor. He then changed the topic of the conversation by asking Quarra why she had come to Point Defiance. Quarra claimed that she had been drafted like everyone else. However, Jogan was not satisfied with her answer and demanded to know what she was doing at Point Defiance. When Quarra asked what he had meant, Halder replied that he had assumed that a woman in her position would have better things to do than to come out and \"jaw\" with a \"lifer\" in the Signal Corps. Quarra lied that she had come to see the ocean but Jogan could sense she was lying."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jogan then asked her about her husband Brue Thayn's occupation and Quarra replied that he taught the art of glassblowing to the elderly. When Jogan asked whether her husband got a lot out of working with them, she explained that her husband hated every minute of his job. She explained that he worked with veterans who were still required to do something for the Cause. Brue resented having to work with grumpy elderly people who thought that they outranked him, which they would not if Brue had any rank at all. Jogan assured her that Brue was still putting people to use. Quarra then criticized her husband for not aspiring to be more than a glazier. While she acknowledged that he was a good father for their three children, she resented the fact that he was not interested in improving his social station unlike her.

At that same moment, Quarra noticed a black silhouette moving in the skies above. She sensed the presence of beings aboard the vessel and realized that it was an airship.

This message would be transmitted across all of Alanciar, allowing the Alanciari military to rapidly mobilize and neutralize this threat. However, Quarra hesitated because she was not supposed to be at Point Defiance. However, Jogan convinced her to do her duty as a thoughtcrier since thought projection could travel faster than semaphore signals. Due to her Force-sensitivity, Quarra could also sense that there was a strong presence of the dark side of the Force among the intruders.

This Sith party turned out to be an advance scouting force led by the High Lord Edell Vrai who had been set to conduct a reconnaissance probe of Alanciar prior to the invasion, which would be led by High Lord Korsin Bentado.

Jogan noticed the commotion and followed Quarra, who was looking for her duffle bag which contained her clothes. She intended to leave and return to her hometown of Uhrar while the other Alanciari were preoccupied with the fighting.

In response, Jogan suggested that he would not find out about their affair since he was not in the military. Quarra then told Jogan that meeting him was one of the best things that had ever happened to her. She praised him for being a hopeful and trusting person.

However, Edell needed a guide and he was able to use Jogan, whom he assumed to be her spouse, as leverage. Like all Alanciari sea vessels, it relied on sails which trapped the wind in order to propel the ship. While most of the Alanciari harvester fleet usually worked in the Coral Banks of the Southern Passage, ship captains who were behind in harvesting their quotas of seafood were known to cut corners by fishing in the Western Sea, which was a restricted military zone that was patrolled by the Shore Guard, the Alanciari coast guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Keshiri sailors aboard the Mischance had been unaware of the earlier battle and were taken by surprise, they fought fiercely against the Sith invaders.

Due to their experiences on the previous night, Edell and Peppin noted the strong martial tradition among the Keshiri they had encountered on Alanciar. While the Mischance was a lowly harvester by Alanciari standards, it was considered to be advanced by the Tribe's standards since they had never built anything larger than a boat.

In addition, Quarra also wanted to ask Edell whether the other Sith who were coming and their leader Grand Lord Hilts were as bad as Bentado. Edell quickly assured her that Hilts was a much better person than Bentado, and that he was old but wise. He also confided in Quarra that Hilts was a close friend of his and convinced her that it would be better for the Alanciari to live under Hilts than Bentado.
