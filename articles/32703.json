It was stolen by D-Squad to escape from Abafar. The squad, upon landing on the Star Destroyer, discovered that the capital ship had been turned into a flying bomb. After the Star Destroyer dropped out of hyperspace in the Carida system, all of the members of D-Squad except R2-D2, and the surviving service droids from the capital ship, escaped its destruction in the shuttle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
