The three corvettes each attempted to intercept the Imperial fleet and suffered heavy damage doing so. The hero continues towards the Enkindle, attacking Talon-class Republic starfighters and the escorts while nearing the warship. The hero was tasked with damaging four shield generators and twelve Laser cannons on the Enkindle, as well as eliminating 50 starfighters if the opportunity were to arise. As the battle commenced three additional Thranta-class Corvettes entered the system to aid the Enkindle and its escorts, one of which was destroyed directly after assisting.
