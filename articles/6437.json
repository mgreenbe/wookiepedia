It had tiers of benches surrounding a central open area where the speaker stood, and a concealed opening leading to a command chamber. The Amphitheater was adjacent to the Elders' Lounge, which contained couches and a holochess table, where councillors could relax during official sessions. Both the Amphitheater and its lounge were contained inside the portion of the Palace that survived the destruction of Alderaan by the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
