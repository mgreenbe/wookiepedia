In 28 BBY, the Naboo Royal Handmaiden Sab\u00e9 lived in the house for six weeks while attempting to free slaves on the planet. She tried to ignore the droid during her stay, but her companion Tonra formed an attachment to it through the course of their mission. He suggested to Sab\u00e9 that they take it with them to Coruscant when they were recalled by their lady, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala.
