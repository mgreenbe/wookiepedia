During that same year, Rivi-Anu, along with the Jedi Eon, a Twi'lek Jedi, and a Human Jedi, was placed under the command of Jedi Master and General Ki-Adi-Mundi. They were dispatched to the planet Mygeeto during the Republic's sieges in the Outer Rim Territories to combat forces of the Separatist Droid Army.

She was instructed by Mundi to secure the west flank, but as she was preparing to execute the order, she was shot in the right arm, losing her lightsaber in the process. At that same moment, a Republic Venator-class Star Destroyer which had been destroyed by Separatist forces plunged down through the atmosphere, endangering the forces on the surface. Rivi-Anu did not flee as Mundi ordered his forces to retreat, and elected to stay and attempt to use the Force to grasp the ship and hold it off long enough for her allies to reach safety.
