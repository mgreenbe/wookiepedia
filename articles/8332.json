The vast plant was located just north of D'aarmont. The visible parts of the complex were rolling lawns and small, tidy research labs and offices. Most assembly was done in automated factories built underground in an old mine. The Arden Plant and its satellite factories elsewhere on Bakura produced nearly fifty million repulsorlift drives each year and were sent to multiple vehicle manufacturers such as, Aratech, Ikas-Adno, Merkuun and Bakur RepulsorCorp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
