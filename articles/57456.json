Circa 20 BBY, the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents, traveled to Tolea Biqua to pick up some lightsaber power cells. The former Jedi Zelice Sturm, a local criminal leader, planned to test the agents, so she manipulated the Rancor Riders into attacking them. Griz and a number of other members of the gang subsequently confronted the agents and attempted to steal the power cells, which Sturm had told the gang were experimental droid energy cells. However, the agents defeated Griz and the rest of the Riders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
