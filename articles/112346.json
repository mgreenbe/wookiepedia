Unlike most spiders, the rearing spider would hunt its prey instead of capturing them in webbing, and it has six legs instead of eight. It could usually be found in desert caves or scavenging the rotten meat left by a Gorax. They were sometimes preyed upon by condor dragons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The courageous caravan's encounter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In approximately 3 ABY, a caravan in search of two Human children's missing parents came to the cave fortress of their kidnapper, a Gorax, in the Desert of Salma."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the Gorax's cavernous lair they encountered several rearing spiders.
