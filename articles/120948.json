The city was founded and developed in the years after the end of the Clone Wars by Prince Sono Molec of the Zygerrian Slave Empire. Originating as a slavers' outpost, Sclavos expanded over time into the seat of the Zygerrian prince's power, eventually leading to the city becoming Kowak's de facto capital. Molec and his subjects saw Kowak transformed into a satellite headquarters for the Zygerrian Slavers Guild, and Sclavos\u2014along with Kowak's other newly established settlements, Lanturi and Caden\u2014became a place for local slavers to refuel, resupply, and trade in slaves from a variety of sources."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sclavos was the de facto capital city of the planet Kowak, a rainforest-covered world in the Sevetta sector, located in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. The city was positioned atop a rhombus-shaped plateau of red granite, one that spanned several kilometers in width. Three of the plateau's sides were cliffs that rose thirty meters above steep embankments covered in dense vegetation, while the fourth was a gradual slop of rocky outcroppings that descended into the surrounding jungle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The city's lower landings comprised Sclavos' slave sector, where dozens of huts and makeshift villages were occupied by a variety of beings from across known space, forced into bondage and awaiting purchase. The area was surrounded by tall wire fences, with each domicile connected by a narrow dirt road, and enclosed by a smooth granite wall that served to keep the slaves in and the jungle predators out. An overhead look of Sclavos revealed a patchwork of buildings with bronzium, golden, and patinated rooftops, in addition to numerous rooftop landing platforms spread throughout the southern portion of the city. Sclavos' streets played host to thousands of merchants, thieves, slavers, and prospective buyers, who all flocked to the city's crowded marketplace, full of tents and shops displaying caged slaves. The plateau's northern peninsula was overwhelmingly dominated by the Molec Royal Palace, an enormous jade-colored ziggurat that towered over the rest of Sclavos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The city of Sclavos was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the roleplaying game adventure book Friends Like These, published on December 8, 2016 by Fantasy Flight Games."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sclavos likely derives its name from the Spanish word \"esclavos,\" meaning \"slaves.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
