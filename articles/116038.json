The Battle of Endor became a decisive moment in their fight to topple the Galactic Empire. The Emperor himself, Darth Sidious, was aboard the Death Star and hoped to bait the Rebel Alliance into a trap. The plan failed, however, and the Emperor was killed by Darth Vader, his apprentice, who had been redeemed from the dark side of the Force by his son, Luke Skywalker. Shortly after the Emperor perished, the Alliance Fleet destroyed the Death Star. The two victories left the Empire in chaos, while the Rebel Alliance celebrated their victory on Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The riot"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Rebel Alliance celebrated on Endor, so too did worlds across the galaxy, from the Core Worlds to the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim Territories. One such world was Imperial Center, a Core world and the capital of the Galactic Empire. Coruscanti citizens erupted into celebration in Monument Plaza, where some citizens toppled a statue of Emperor Palpatine. They wrapped chains and ropes around the neck of the statue and began pulling it down, assisted by speeders whose acceleration helped tear the statue from its base. The statue fell to the ground, breaking it into pieces; the head of the statue broke off and fell into a nearby fountain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the statue was destroyed, Coruscant Security Forces arrived in the plaza to restore order and immediately opened fire, killing numerous civilians. Despite their actions, the citizens fought back, throwing chunks of the Sidious statue at Imperial police speeders and even jumping onto the speeders themselves to fight the officers directly. The police continued firing, however, intent on restoring order to the group of citizens that had turned into a mob."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the citizens fighting back during the riot, Imperial Center (known as Coruscant during the Old Republic) remained under Imperial control. Some resistance fighters did emerge in the days following the Battle of Endor and the riot, however, intent on reclaiming the planet from the Empire. The planet devolved into a civil war as pro-Imperial Coruscanti and Imperial forces led by Grand Vizier Mas Amedda and the Imperial Security Bureau battled pro-rebel Coruscanti and resistance forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The riot in Monument Plaza was first depicted in the 1997 Special Edition re-release of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, showing the citizens of Coruscant toppling the statue of the Emperor and celebrating in the streets. The scene was slightly revised for the 2004 DVD release of the film, which inserted the Galactic Senate Building and the Jedi Temple \u2013 later revealed to have been converted into the Imperial Palace \u2013 into the background of the scene. The events were expanded upon by Chuck Wendig in his 2015 novel Aftermath, revealing that the celebration became a full-blown riot upon the arrival of Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
