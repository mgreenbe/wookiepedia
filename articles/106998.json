The tactic called for the pirates to avoid any legal spaceport, and only dock at fringe ports, free worlds, or shadowports. Port shadowing was expensive, as these ports usually charged a premium for their services, and were way above that of the free market. Also, it limited the pirates since there was usually only one or two shadowports operating within a sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
