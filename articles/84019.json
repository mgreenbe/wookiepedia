An ensign then reports New Republic comlink frequencies coming from Epsilon Nine, indicating a Republic takeover of the station, just as Revenant is ambushed by nine X-wing fighters. Lumiya commands Wolf-Pack and Borealis to fire on Epsilon Nine's laser batteries, and sends out two squadrons of TIE interceptors and TIE bombers, the former to destroy the X-wings, and the latter to assist the Corvettes. The X-wings are soon defeated, and Lumiya's fleet continues bombarding Epsilon Nine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Borealis dispatches two A5 Juggernauts onto the station, which plow through fences and barricades and destroy the outer blast doors. Red-armored stormtroopers soon follow, as a Lambda-class shuttle leaves the Revenant for Epsilon Nine. When Lumiya, aboard the shuttle, arrives at the station, a stormtrooper reports that all Republic forces have been killed, and all personnel accounted for. Lumiya walks up to the scientists and reminds them that they are to develop new spy satellites for Imperial Intelligence, and that she will \"overlook consorting with the enemy just this once.\" With that, Lumiya and her crimson stormtroopers board their shuttles and leave Epsilon Nine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
