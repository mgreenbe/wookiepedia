Kol Skywalker and Wolf Sazen lead the Jedi against the invading Sith even though they are vastly outnumbered, Wolf Sazen orders the young Cade Skywalker and Shado Vao to take the younglings and flee Ossus on one of the Jedi Shuttles. When Cade objects and continues to fight, his father reminds him that a Jedi's first duty is to preserve life and that Cade's job was to protect the younglings. However, when Master Sazen is struck down by Darth Nihl, Cade defies his father's orders and goes to join his father in the battle. Kol orders Cade to take Sazen and leave and though Cade is reluctant, he agrees and carries Sazen back to the shuttle. Sazen dies on the shuttle but Cade is unwilling to accept this and draws a tremendous amount of Force power to bring Sazen back to life. Meanwhile, back at the Temple, Kol is killed with Force lightning by Darth Nihl. Cade decides to avenge his father's death and kill the remaining Sith on the planet but the shuttle is attacked by Imperial Fighters.

Fel, who thinks that the New Empire and the Sith are allies, is betrayed and killed by Krayt. Krayt proclaims himself the new Emperor of the galaxy and Morlish Veed swears his allegiance to Krayt. The rest of the Moffs immediately follow suit and Krayt's self appointed position is solidified. As the Moffs leave, Veed complains to Nyna Calixte that Krayt has gone against the plan and made himself Emperor instead of appointing Veed. Calixte tells him that the future is unknown and that he may still become Emperor. After the Moffs have left, It is discovered that Roan Fel is still alive and the Krayt actually killed Roan Fel's double. Krayt blames Darth Maladi for this mix-up and orders her and the other Sith to hunt down the remaining Jedi so that the true Roan Fel cannot gain the Jedi as allies. Krayt reveals that he is plagued by something that threatens his life and that he could sense a disturbance in the force when Ossus fell. Krayt promises to find the Jedi that was able to draw life back from death and to turn that person to the dark side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
