Waru arrived in the galaxy due to a combination of the disturbances in the Force from a crystallizing star, and Hethrir's torturing of his prisoners, many of whom Hethrir sacrificed to Waru in the temple. Hethrir came to Waru in hopes of mastering the Force and as a reward he would sacrifice young Anakin Solo in the temple. However, Hethrir was destroyed during a confrontation with Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo, and Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
