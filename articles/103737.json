While he waited for a ship to take him to Telos, he took up pazaak as a hobby. At first many opponents were willing to play against him, however as his skill improved, fewer and fewer individuals wished to play, so he began offering his rare and expensive armor components he used for his work as prizes for special matches."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He never lost his components until Meetra Surik won all of his credits after several matches, forcing Pato to wager his armor components.
