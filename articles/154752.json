Around 21 BBY, the building became the stage of the Senate hostage crisis when Bounty hunter Cad Bane and his posse secretly raided the building. As the Senate Commandos were changing the guards, the commando was at the barracks of the structure with his colleagues when Bane tossed a thermal detonator on the room, to eliminate both of the switching patrols. The resulting explosion seriously injured the commando and killed his fellow guards. Crawling to the door of the barracks, the commando begged for help from one of Bane's collaborators, Aurra Sing. However, Sing responded by pulling out her blaster pistol and shooting the commando."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
