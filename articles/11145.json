Located in orbit of a volcanic planet in the Outer Rim Territories, the station hosted a number of amenities for the Azzameens and their company's employees, including a holosimulator and a hangar large enough to store and service several YT-series light freighters, including the family's twin YT-1300s, Sabra and Selu, and their YT-2000 Otana. Azzameen Station's design was unique in the galaxy, with its distinctive semi-circular arms flanking a tall central tower."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the war's pivotal Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, family patriarch Tomaas Azzameen thought it time to teach his youngest son, Ace, the family business. Assisted by his siblings throughout his piloting training, Ace conducted a number of missions from Azzameen Station. During Ace's training, Tomaas, sympathetic to the Rebel Alliance's cause, planned to covertly deliver a black-market supply of the healing substance bacta to the Alliance XQ2 Platform Hospital and requested his family's help. However, the delivery ended disastrously for the Azzameens, who lost Tomaas and his eldest son, Galin, in the ensuing battle; the Azzameens, labeled traitors to the Galactic Empire for their actions, were forced to flee the family's holdings, including Azzameen Home Base, which were captured and turned over to Viraxo Industries, a competing trading company allied with the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the station was occupied by a collection of mercenaries who renamed it Falcon's Nest and erected a number of static defenses to protect the unarmed structure.

Ace, now a decorated starfighter pilot in the Alliance Fleet, and his sister, Aeron, tracked the mercenary bulk cruiser Redhawk to Falcon's Nest. Upon arrival, the Azzameens were shocked to realize it was their old home. Acting on this information, the Alliance launched a mission to liberate the station from the mercenary group, in which Ace participated alongside his civilian siblings, Aeron and Emon. After the destruction of the external defenses, an Alliance strike team captured Falcon's Nest, and Aeron thwarted the mercenaries' attempt to destroy the station. With the mercenaries routed, the Alliance took control of the station.

It functioned both as a home for the Azzameens and as a base of operations for their shipping company, Twin Suns Transport Services. In all, the station housed 120 crew members and had a passenger capacity of 325 beings. Members of the Azzameen family were quite fond of their Home Base and spent much of their time aboard it. Family patriarch Tomaas Azzameen's youngest child, Ace, spent his entire life on the station prior to his employment with Twin Suns Transport Services."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Measuring 1.45 kilometers, Azzameen Station's structure was largely semi-circular: A tall, steeply-sloping tower, located between the station's two flanking crescent-shaped arms, extended both dorsally and ventrally from Azzameen Station's central horizontal plane, forming a cross-like shape when facing the station's fore. The central tower structure's most prominent feature was a large hangar capable of holding the family's numerous YT-series Corellian transports as well as various types of cargo containers. The station's hangar was equipped to install various weapon payloads, warhead countermeasures, and other starship devices on landed ships. At the hangar's mouth sat a landing platform. On the top of the tower, flanked on either side by two thin spires, sat a docking port that allowed crew members to enter the station from a docked starship. Each of the station's two arms contained various mooring points that larger craft, such as a modular conveyor, could utilize to dock with the station. A tower was positioned at the end of each of the two flanking arm structures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The station was protected by a deflector shield generator rated at 1920 SBD and had a hull rating of 1664 RU.

A tractor beam projector assisted pilots with landing their ships in the station's main hangar. Azzameen Station included a central computer and a communications datacore, which stored all communications entering and leaving the station. In addition, a holosimulator was kept aboard Azzameen Home Base, which Ace Azzameen frequently used to improve his piloting skills."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of the family company's longstanding feud with fellow shipping conglomerate Viraxo Industries as well as the Imperialization of Azzameen assets by the Galactic Empire following a failed Azzameen supply run for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, control of the station was turned over to a mercenary group, which renamed it Falcon's Nest. Under mercenary ownership, the station's interior was kept unkempt, and bombs were installed into the station's wiring to prevent it from changing hands again.

The Azzameens stored and serviced their two YT-1300 light freighters, the Selu and the Sabra, as well as the YT-2000 light freighter Otana, in the station's main hangar. These duties as well as general upkeep and cleaning often fell to the family's maintenance droid, MK-09, known as Emkay. Some of the Azzameens used the station as a permanent residence. Ace, the youngest of Tomaas's four children, had lived his entire life aboard Azzameen Station prior to his employment with Twin Suns Transport Services.

Aeron retrieved the contraband and brought it back to Azzameen Station. Using the container of spice, Antan devised a plan of retribution against the Viraxo for their continued meddling in Azzameen affairs. He dispatched Ace, Aeron, and Emon to the Viraxo cargo facility Viraxo 54 to instigate a feud between the Viraxo and their Imperial allies.

The resulting battle proved disastrous for the Azzameens, as the family lost its GR-75 medium transport, Vasudra. Tomaas and Galin, who were aboard the ship, were presumed to have perished.

Antan Azzameen, now the chief officer of Twin Suns Transport Services, ordered both Azzameen Station and Twin Suns Station evacuated. Antan also instructed Ace and Aeron to fetch a container of warheads and the contents of the family safe aboard the emptying Twin Suns Station, while he and Emon left Azzameen Station to retrieve supplies from one of the family's storage yards.

Upon their capture of Azzameen Station, the Empire deemed it and its sector off-limits to civilian traffic and gave provisional control of Azzameen Station as well as the Azzameen's other facilities to Viraxo Industries.

The mercenaries also hardwired a number of explosive devices into the station's wiring. These bombs were set to detonate if Falcon's Nest changed ownership again and could only be deactivated by someone with existing knowledge of the station's onboard systems. The bulk cruiser Redhawk, under the mercenaries' employ, occasionally visited the space station, as would Antan Azzameen, who had been rescued from his earlier Viraxo capture by the surviving Azzameens. Without the knowledge of the rest of his family\u2014with whom he had been conducting missions since his escape\u2014Antan made contact with Falcon's Nest in an attempt to restore Twin Suns Transport Services to its former standing by cooperating with the mercenaries and their Imperial connections.

The Empire contacted the mercenaries at Falcon's Nest shortly after the destruction of the Hurrim and instructed them to interrupt a key meeting between the Alliance and a contact from the Bothan Spynet, an intelligence agency operated by Bothans with key information that the Alliance needed. Though the mission's main focus was the capture of Borsk Fey'lya, leader of the Bothan Spynet, the Imperials were more focused on the mission's potential to strain relations between two species whose contributions to the Rebel Alliance were crucial: the Bothans and Sullustans, the latter being the supposed employers of the mercenary group.

The Azzameens successfully intercepted the Redhawk at the cargo platform Cargo Station and downloaded the suspected coordinates before heading off to what they expected to be the mercenary base.

The strike force, consisting of a group of B-wings; a group of X-wing starfighters; Emon's Firespray-31-class starship, Andrasta; the Otana; and the assault transport Storm Unit, departed from the MC80 Star Cruiser Liberty and began the assault on Falcon's Nest after a brief trip through hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mercenary Preybird and IRD starfighters as well as the present Redhawk moved to engage the approaching Rebellion forces.
