It was mentioned in the archaeology crew skill mission entitled \"Memoirs of a Crimelord\" which was available for players of both the Sith Empire and Republic factions. In a crew skill mission, the player would send one of their companions to complete the mission, but due to the mission being available to all classes it was unknown who met with Zirchros. As a reward for the mission, the player received some lost artifact fragments, which were the artifacts from the civilization. Due to the game saying that the civilization had been dead for a long time, it was impossible to determine when the civilization existed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
