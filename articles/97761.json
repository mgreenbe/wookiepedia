It was entirely made out of wood and its windows were very large and contained stained-glass art. It had a large T-shaped stage which featured many high quality acts and had a large wide bar along one wall. The stage had a trap door that led to a several meter long angled shaft which ran under the stage and to a back door. The tavern was serviced by three bartender droids and had two large Human bouncers for protection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brinaloy N'Vaari was a frequent performer at the tavern."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
