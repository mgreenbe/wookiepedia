When he was met with a squad of 18 mercenaries and their employer, a wealthy industrialist, who wished to hire his boss for a hit on the Sith Lord Darth Vader to avenge his son, he attempted to deny them access to his boss. While the associate was speaking with them, the assassin also made sure to silently kill off the hired guns before confronting the industrialist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, the draconian associate encountered Vader (who had disposed of his boss earlier) and was presumably murdered by him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
