The planet was the site of the Battle of Chabosh where Sith Lord Tulak Hord, his apprentice Ortan Cela, and their Dashade Shadow Killers Khem Val and Veshikk Urk led Sith Empire to victory over the rebel and Jedi forces stationed on the planet following the Battle of Yn. It was during this battle that Tulak Hord performed a ritual that allowed him to draw the strength of his enemies into himself.
