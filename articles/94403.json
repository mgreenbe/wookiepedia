It depicted the silhouettes of two sharnaff, a species found on the planet Corellia, at a waterfront. One of the creatures had lowered its head to drink from the water while the other looked off to the right. The poster was colored in sepia shades and written on it in large Aurebesh letters, the Galactic Basic Standard alphabet, were the words \"Mystic Corellia\", while text at the bottom listed several cities of Corellia: Coronet, Tyrena, Bela Vistal, Kor Vella and Doaba Guerfel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mystic Corellia appeared in the 2003 MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. It was one of three \"chapter gifts\" given out randomly to every player that logged in during the release of Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives on June 8, 2006. The player would receive a \"rolled up poster\" item upon logging in and when used, would randomly award you one of the three posters. The other posters of the three were Survive The Rryatt Trail and It Came From Mustafar!. The player could use the poster as decoration in their house.
