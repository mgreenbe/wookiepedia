This began the Sacking of Coruscant, a battle between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. The conflict ended with the Treaty of Coruscant, an agreement that forced the Republic to abandon long-time allies and give many outlying worlds over to the Sith, putting an end to the Great Galactic War in favor of the Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Femi was a blue-skinned Twi'lek female with blue eyes.
