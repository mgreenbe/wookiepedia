In 3630 BBY, con artist Gault Rennow and his partner Vette planned a heist of the Guilded Star, for which they recruited Gault's old acquaintance Dretcher and a contingent of forces from Anti-Zakuul Alliance, including the Alliance Commander, Lana Beniko, Theron Shan, Senya Tirall and SCORPIO. The group was able to get onboard and plant a missile warhead inside the vault, which vaporized its entire content of precious metals, which was then pumped into a tanker, before making their getaway."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vandin first appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire Chapter 13: Profit and Plunder.
