After narrowly escaping death at the hands of the Imperial officers General Durpin and Plumestriker, the Freemakers managed to find the sixth crystal only to be attacked by Naare and the bounty hunter Dengar.

Their quest brought them in conflict with the Sith agent Naare and the Hutt crime lord Graballa. Having already obtained the first three crystals with the unwitting help of Rowan, Naare stole the fourth and fifth crystals from the boy on Takodana and Ningoth. She used the B1-series battle droid Roger's transmission pack as a means of tracking them down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to prevent Naare from reforging the Kyber Saber, the Freemakers traveled to Naboo, which was home to the sixth Kyber Saber crystal.

The Museum was guarded by a contingent of stormtroopers led by the Imperial officers General Durpin and Commander Plumestriker, who regarded Naboo as a comfortable, plush posting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Night in the Museum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Freemakers decided to infiltrate the Emperor Palpatine Museum at night in order to find and steal the sixth Kyber Saber crystal. As part of the plan, Zander disguised himself as a maintenance crew and delivered Roger, who was disguised as a Clone Wars exhibit, inside the museum. That night, Roger broke out of his case and let the Freemakers inside the Museum. The Freemakers soon became distracted. Roger was distracted by an exhibit of his fellow B1 battle droids, R0-HK."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zander soon got distracted by an N-1 starfighter hanging from the ceiling. Kordi was mesmerized by the sight of the regal gown worn by the late Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Despite being briefly distracted by a motorize pogostick, Rowan resolved to continue his mission and soon stumbled into several giant statues of Emperor Palpatine at various stages of his life.

However, Rowan had disguised himself as the Emperor, claimed that the Freemakers were wealthy donors and demoted Durpin and Plumestriker.
