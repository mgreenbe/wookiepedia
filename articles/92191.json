MSE-6 droids were installed with a single matrix, and the matrices were cheap, compact and easy to switch. Each matrix was programmed with a single skill, such as the repair of a specific system. MSE-6s could perform one task, then have the circuit matrix switched out to then perform a different task."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
