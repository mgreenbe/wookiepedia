All those who died were sent to the Lands of the Dead, where they were judged by the True Gods. Only those deemed worthy were allowed to remain with the Gods. Those who were deemed unworthy were doomed to roam the Lands of the Dead, never to return to the living nor feel the grace of the Gods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Yuuzhan Vong reformed the planet Coruscant into a new version of Yuuzhan'tar, the Yuuzhan Vong mythology was updated to include a Guardian of the Gate, known as the Ganner or the Jedi Giant, in reference to Ganner Rhysode's stand against the Yuuzhan Vong while protecting Jacen Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
