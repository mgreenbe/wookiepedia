Scranges were beaked and had many bioluminescent patches on their body, arranged in a ridge along its spine. When prey got close, attracted by the lights, the scrange would lift out of the mud on its six crustacean-like hind legs to make a quick attack or it would use its four tail tusks to impale its prey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scranges somehow found their way to several worlds. During the Clone Wars Battle of Brentaal IV, a scrange attacked Jedi Master Shaak Ti and her crew of Quinlan Vos, Lyshaa, Ryyk, Sagoro Autem, and a clone trooper. The predator was able to kill Ryyk, but was killed by Ti when she pierced its head with her lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
