While there, he encountered a spacer who was tasked with re-assembling an R2-series astromech droid. The droid was wanted by both Imperial Commander Barrezz and Rebel Captain Bastra. The junk dealer Watto had informed the spacer that he had sold the main casing to Peggin. However, Peggin told the spacer that he had discarded the casing when he realized it would not fit in his R2 unit. However, he also told the spacer that he saw some Jawas fishing through his trash, and that they may have retrieved the casing. The spacer, using this information, set off to the Jawa Mountain Fortress to get the missing piece from Ji'Ni Sil."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Peggin Dulin was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
