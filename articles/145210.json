Born to a family of miners, he decided to break tradition in order to serve in Naboo's capital city, Theed. He was eventually assigned to Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, serving as a bodyguard. When the Separatist Crisis began spreading across the galaxy, Danl\u00e9's family suffered the effects. Jamillia, the incumbent Queen of Naboo, opened her world's borders to refugees from all over the galaxy, and, as a result, the Danl\u00e9s' mining industry suffered, as the ports were overworked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Danl\u00e9's family sunk into poverty, and his grandfather died, forcing him to become a fierce critic of his Queen's policies. Making matters worse for him was that his charge, Amidala, supported Jamillia's actions. One night, the disenchanted Danl\u00e9 let a journalist onto the Senator's J-type diplomatic barge to plant a listening device. What he did not realize was that the journalist was a bounty hunter, and that the listening device was an explosive, which was detonated sometime afterward.

He applied to join the Royal Naboo Security Forces, and did so successfully, with both exceptional aptitude scores and physical achievements. Although he initially found it difficult to stray from family tradition, he acquitted himself well while serving in Theed, and he sent what income he could back to his family at Kwilaan. He eventually came to serve the Chommell sector's representative in the Galactic Senate, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Separatist Crisis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the growing Separatist Crisis threatened the stability of the Galactic Republic, Naboo's queen, Jamillia, opened borders, allowing refugees, displaced by the secession of worlds to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, to find sanctuary on her planet. As a result, the outlying ports, such as Kwilaan, were over strained, and in turn, the mining business of Naboo suffered. Danl\u00e9's family was hit hard by the new development, and was forced to rely on his income. The money was not enough, however, and his family sank into poverty, with Danl\u00e9's grandfather passing away due to his greatly deteriorated lifestyle. His family was devastated, and Danl\u00e9's faith in both his monarch and his charge, Amidala, who supported Jamillia's policies, was shaken."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One night, Danl\u00e9 ventured into a local bar, and turned to drink, which loosened his tongue. In the crowded location, he began making scathing and loud criticisms of Jamillia and Amidala, which attracted the attention of a woman claiming to be a local journalist. The journalist claimed that she wanted to expose Amidala, but in order to do so, needed access to the senator's J-type diplomatic barge. Danl\u00e9 agreed, and let the journalist onto the ship to plant what he believed to be a listening device. What he did not know was that the journalist was actually bounty hunter Zam Wesell, who had been hired to kill Amidala. When the senator made her journey to Coruscant to vote against the Military Creation Act, Danl\u00e9 was aboard the barge. As it touched down on a landing platform and the passengers disembarked, Wesell remotely detonated the \"listening device\"\u2014actually a powerful explosive. The ship was ripped apart instantly, and Danl\u00e9 perished in the blast. However, the senator had not been on the ship at all, and instead, one of her handmaidens, Cord\u00e9, had taken her place, and died in her stead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A gifted and skilled individual, Danl\u00e9 initially performed well in his role as a security guard. However, as the years went by, he let his personal feelings get in the way of his job, particularly when Jamillia's refugee policies led to the death of his grandfather, and the destitution of his family.
