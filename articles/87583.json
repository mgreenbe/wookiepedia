It handled many minor programs such as lighting, portals, and commo. The unit could also network more advanced systems like primary defense and security systems. The master-control unit itself was not self-contained and needed ancillary equipment to link the small unit to its primary control circuitry. Before its destruction around 2 BBY, the ancillary system at Stars' End had receptor circuitry built into the walls of the tower, always in close proximity to the master-control unit that Viceprex Hirken carried."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
