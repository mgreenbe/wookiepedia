She was an only child and the daughter of Mesa and Bomo Greenbark. Her father Bomo was a Commander in the Nosaurian resistance during the Clone Wars and fought against the newly\u2013formed Galactic Empire in 19 BBY. The resistance made a last stand at Half-Axe Pass and held off the Imperial forces while those Nosaurians not involved in the fighting were evacuated. Bomo oversaw the evacuation of Resa and Mesa on the last of the transports but, having a duty to return to the fighting, was unable to join them despite Resa's pleas. The evacuees were taken to Cadgel Meadows where Mesa and Resa hoped to take a ship to Sullust, but Imperial forces at the spaceport captured all of the evacuees. Deeming them inadequate to add to the workforce, the Empire took them to Orvax IV to be sold for a profit as slaves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Orvax IV, Resa was taken to be sold by a Chagrian slaver, Orso Meeto. This resulted in Mesa being killed when she attempted to stop a number of slavers from subsequently taking her daughter. Meeto sold the Nosaurian youngling to Dezono Qua, a Human noble on Esseles. Bomo and the crew of the Uhumele, who had rescued him and his companion Dass Jennir from New Plympto, arrived on Orvax IV mere hours later, too late to find Resa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Qua's fortified villa on Esseles, Resa was killed for E-10\u2014Qua's protocol droid\u2014to prepare her as a meal for the noble, as was always done with the young slaves he purchased. However, unbeknownst to him, the crew of the Uhumele had located Resa's buyer and attacked the villa soon after Resa had been eaten. Jennir confronted Qua as he attempted to escape, with Bomo and the other crewmembers arriving shortly before Qua revealed that he had eaten Resa. Jennir then shot and killed the noble with his blaster to spare Bomo from suffering the after-effects of killing Qua himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Resa was much loved by her parents, with her mother even dying to try and stop Resa being taken away from her. Bomo, Resa's father, wore a holoprojector around his neck that displayed a hologram of Resa. During the evacuation, Resa begged her father multiple times to go with her, but Bomo refused, having a duty to stay.
