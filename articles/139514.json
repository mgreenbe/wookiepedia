The Ministry of Orbital Commerce was widely considered the most powerful administration on Tallaan due to it overseeing the orbital stations, shipyards, and the millions of financial transactions associated with them each day, such as the massive portion of Tallaan's dockyards leased by the Thyferran government to inspect transported bacta, which by law could not be done in Thyferran space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Military"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the most powerful and strategically-placed system in the Freeworlds Territory, Tallaan accordingly had the largest planetary military in the sector, and indeed had one of the largest planetary navies in the entire Colonies Region.

It was the most active trading world in the sector. It also had prominent mid- and high-tech industries of its own. Tallaan hosted several prominent spaceship manufacturing firms (including the Tapani Starship Cooperative) as well as companies that made vehicles such as tractors and transports, and repulsorlift vehicles such as speeders. Since Tallaan was able to obtain raw ore at very low prices, its goods could be manufactured and sold far under standard galactic prices. Though there were superior and better-established brands around, Tallaani vehicles were popular in the Colonies and Inner Rim because of the low prices and high quality."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4000 BBY the Tallaani Shipyards were established in orbit around the planet.[source?] Tallaan would remain a prime manufacturer of starships throughout the centuries of Republic rule and retained its facilities during the reign of Emperor Palpatine.
