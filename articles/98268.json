They were tall and thin (measuring 2.3 meters), with long snouts resembling those of the Kubaz. They rode lava fleas on the cooled, crusted-over surface of lava flows. They had tough, blaster-resistant skin, but still required protective armor while working around the lava of their volcanic habitat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
