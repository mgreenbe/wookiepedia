It had a recording time of one hundred hours. The data was stored in chips or storage crystals and the recording material played in two-dimensions on a screen on the exterior of the rod. Data ports allowed the rod to interface with computers and datapads, and interpolation coding allowed computers to extrapolate the two-dimensional data into near-authentic holgraphic images."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
