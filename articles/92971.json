It was a main sequence star, accompanied by the white dwarf Termadus. Morasil was the much older member of the pair, possibly as old as the galaxy itself. Unassisted by the dwarf star, its cold, yellow light could not reach the asteroid belt. However, together with Termadus and the gaseous haze between them, they gave off the equivalent light of a single bright star, and also created a much bigger hyperspace shadow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
