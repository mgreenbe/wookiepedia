After forcing the dark side entity Abeloth to flee from battle on the moon Pydyr, exiled Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, and Sith apprentice Vestara Khai tracked her\u2014using a blood trail established by Luke\u2014to Meliflar Station. Abeloth had put Fala, the daughter of the station's leader, Hallaf, into a subconscious state, and ordered that the smugglers at the station set up explosives that would detonate upon the arrival of Khai and the Skywalkers in their ship, the Jade Shadow. However, after Abeloth left the station, the crew of smugglers decided that they would rather capture the ship. Led by Cardya, they mutinied and put Hallaf and Fala in the station's brig, and then set up an ambush for Khai and the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the Jedi's arrival, a firefight ensued, although Khai and the Skywalkers were able to overcome the smugglers' defenses and force them to cease fire.
