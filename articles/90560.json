These were destroyed by the Harbinger when the ship, commandeered by Darth Sion fired on the Ebon Hawk and missed, destroying Peragus II."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Certain promotional shots seem to show an earlier concept of what the mining droid Mark II looked like.
