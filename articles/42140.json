The lifeboat served as Yoda's initial shelter, providing a convenient camp with protection from the torrential rains, pests and predators. However, it started to degrade within a year due to Dagobah's swampy environment. As the first shelter was consumed by the swamp, Yoda built a new home for himself (using several cannibalized parts from the pod) and lived there until his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The E3-standard starship lifeboat would have appeared in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith in a scene where Yoda travels to Dagobah on board the ship.
