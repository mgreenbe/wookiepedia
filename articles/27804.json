The war was named after the clone troopers utilized by the Republic against the battle droid forces of the Separatists. These armies, the Grand Army of the Republic and the Separatist Droid Army, were two of the largest ever pitted against each other in galactic history, and the fighting between them rapidly spread to countless inhabited worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beginning with the First Battle of Geonosis, both sides scored significant victories over the other, and at different times during the war either seemed likely to triumph. The first two years of the war saw both sides skirmish with and raid each other, while fighting a handful of significant battles and trying to gain allies while they built up their respective war industries. A series of Republic defeats in the war's second year culminated in Operation Durge's Lance, a major strike into the Core Worlds led by the Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies, General Grievous. After the defeat of Grievous' forces in the Core, however, the Republic gained traction when it mobilized its greater industrial base. Using superior numbers, the Republic drove Separatists from the Core and Colonies and engaged them in their own territories, a series of attritional campaigns known as the Outer Rim Sieges. In an effort to reverse the course of the war, Grievous launched a massive strike on Coruscant through the Deep Core. Much of the Confederate fleet was lost and their Head of State Count Dooku was killed over Coruscant. General Grievous was subsequently killed at the Battle of Utapau. This, coupled with the issuing of Order 66 and the deactivation of the droid army, brought an end to the fighting. At the time, it was the largest galactic conflict to date."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unbeknownst to most of those involved, the conflict was started, maintained, and eventually ended by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who was actually the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, whose ultimate goal was the transformation of the Republic into the Galactic Empire with him as Emperor as well as the eradication of the Jedi Order through the Great Jedi Purge. The conflict led to the Order of the Sith Lords controlling the dominant galactic government."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tensions in the Rim"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Clone Wars officially began in 22 BBY at the Battle of Geonosis, their origins could be found over a century earlier. Though a fictive event controlled by Darth Sidious, the war had its origins in the age-old divide between the galaxy's inner and outer systems. In 124 BBY, the Galactic Senate passed two critical pieces of legislation: the entire Outer Rim Territories were declared a Free Trade Zone, repealing numerous sector-level taxes. Since the Ruusan Reformations of 1000 BBY and the abolition of a centralized Republic Navy, the Outer Rim had been plagued by piracy and slavers, breeding political isolation. The act hoped to jump-start legitimate commerce and so restore ties between the Core and the Rim. Additionally, the status of \"functional constituencies\" was extended to include Senatorial representation of the galaxy's largest guilds and corporations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These twin acts benefited various mega-corporations, including the InterGalactic Banking Clan and the Corporate Alliance, but none more so than the Trade Federation, a Neimoidian trade cartel. The Trade Federation rapidly expanded into the Outer Rim, stifled competition, and enforced deals with its powerful Trade Defense Force. By 67 BBY it enjoyed full voting privileges in the Galactic Senate, and within a decade commanded the votes of hundreds of systems. Many on Coruscant supported the Trade Federation, admiring the TDF's rapid extinction of piracy on the major hyperlanes. Others bemoaned Trade Federation corruption and the extinction of representation for the systems it controlled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The issue of the Outer Rim polarized the Senate. By 52 BBY, a faction known as the Militarists had emerged on Coruscant, calling for the restoration of the centralized Republic Military to restore order on the Rim. Meanwhile, a terrorist group known as the Nebula Front declared its intention to fight the Trade Federation by any means necessary. Amid this political storm began the career of one Senator Palpatine of Naboo, representing the Chommell sector. Unbeknownst to all at the time and unclear to the rest of the galaxy until many decades later, Palpatine was in fact Darth Sidious, apprentice to the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis. Over the next two decades, he would manipulate the tensions between the Core and the Rim and the government and the Trade Federation to finally fulfill Darth Bane's Grand Plan, a thousand-year scheme by the Order of the Sith Lords to foment a war that would destroy the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Sidious, he fomented the Stark Hyperspace War of 46 BBY, a ruse cooked up by him, the Federation, and Iaco Stark so that the Trade Federation could demand additional rights to increase protection on its ships. As Palpatine, he worked his way into Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum's confidence as an opponent of the Trade Federation. In 33 BBY, he encouraged Valorum to restore taxation on the Outer Rim trade routes in order to break the Trade Federation's power. In exchange, Valorum offered the Neimoidians the right to unlimited defense of their merchant ships. However, the attack on their finances through taxation drove the Trade Federation, the IG Banking Clan, and the Corporate Alliance together. After a disastrous summit on Eriadu that saw four Federation board members murdered at Sidious' behest, Nute Gunray was elevated to the position of Trade Federation Viceroy. With the Trade Federation radicalized and Baktoid Armor Workshop and Haor Chall Engineering filling its ever-larger orders for a new Droid Army, Darth Sidious approached Gunray and encouraged him to make a stand that would force the Senate to back down over the taxation of trade routes."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Battle of Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Sidious' behest, the Trade Federation began a blockade of Palpatine's homeworld of Naboo. The entire incident made Valorum look weak, and in the Senate debate over what action to take over the blockade, Palpatine induced the enraged Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo to demand a Vote of No Confidence in his leadership. In the aftermath, a strong sympathy vote for Naboo rode Senator Palpatine to the office of Supreme Chancellor. Thus, a Sith Lord had control of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The invasion of Naboo saw the continued existence of the Sith exposed to the Jedi Order after Sidious' apprentice Darth Maul killed Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn during the liberation of the planet.

With Qui-Gon's death, Anakin was apprenticed to Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Chancellor, Palpatine promised to bring an end to the corruption that had so often plagued the Galactic Senate. The first few years of his tenure saw very little done to fulfill that promise, however.

Having killed his old friend Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas to seal his fate and become Darth Tyranus, Dooku was then ordered to eliminate any reference to Kamino from the Jedi Archives: having had a vision that war was imminent, Sifo-Dyas had contacted the Kaminoans to organise the creation of a clone army for the Republic. Sidious did not intend to have the Jedi discover the clone army secretly being grown for them until they were desperate for an army. After being deemed worthy, Jango Fett was commissioned by Dooku to be the template for this army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the future Grand Army of the Republic was being prepared on Kamino, however, other forces of clone warriors were already active in the galaxy. Cloners and their products were no secret to Jedi like Obi-Wan Kenobi and fringers like former gunrunner Dexter Jettster, and around the time that Outbound Flight was destroyed in 27 BBY, the Galactic Republic's military forces were engaged in combat with clone warriors, rendered dangerously unstable and prone to clone madness by being very rapidly grown to maturity. Veterans of these campaigns, such as the future Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, would later consider these campaigns as the start of the Clone Wars, but to most people, they were probably only a symptom of the unrest in the Republic at the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 24 BBY, Palpatine's eight year term as Supreme Chancellor was coming to an end.

The Raxus Address triggered a wave of secessions, beginning the Separatist Crisis. Fearing instability amid the crisis, the Senate permitted Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to stay in office longer than the term limits the Galactic Constitution permitted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next two years, many systems left the Republic to join the Confederacy, including Geonosis and the Elrood, Danjar, Tantra and Sluis sectors, bringing most of the Rimward leg of the Rimma Trade Route under the control of the Confederacy. From the beginning the Separatists' territory was highly dispersed, dominated by a pocket in the New Territories based around Muunilinst, the southern Rimma, a pocket stretching Coreward down the Perlemian Trade Route from the Tion Cluster, and an enclave on the Corellian Run stretching from the Allanteen system to Mon Gazza. The wave of secessions intensified after the disastrous Battle of Antar 4, where the Republic suffered a humiliating early defeat trying to overthrow a Separatist-affiliated insurgent government, and had to resort to heavy-handed tactics that harmed many Gotals to put down the insurrection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, these systems would be joined by the corporate entities of the galaxy: the Baktoid Armor Workshop, the Commerce Guild, the Corporate Alliance, the Techno Union, the InterGalactic Banking Clan and of course the Trade Federation.

Other seceding systems simply wanted independence and were wary of forming a new centralised government.
