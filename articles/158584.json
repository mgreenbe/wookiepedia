Often deployed in conjunction with planetary shields, its purpose was to defend planets while the shields reached full power. It could disrupt Star Destroyers with a single ion bolt, however its stationary nature made it vulnerable to attack, and its blast shield was required to retract in order to utilize the cannon. It was also equipped with an independent power generator buried roughly 40 meters below the weapon emplacement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Battle of Hoth, the Alliance to Restore the Republic used a v-150 to allow their transports to slip past Imperial Star Destroyers. Coordinated by Commander Toryn Farr, the cannon did its job well and disabled at least one Destroyer, the Tyrant, allowing the first of the rebel transports, the Quantum Storm, to escape into hyperspace. The cannon was later destroyed during the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The v-150 Planet Defender first appeared in The Empire Strikes Back and was based off of concept art by Ralph McQuarrie."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
