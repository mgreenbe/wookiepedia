Due to their vast respect towards their old people, Ka'hren elders were commonly elected to lead the government of V'shar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The government of V'shar was a representative democracy with a great amount of theocracy: Leaders were elected to represent each of the religions in V'shar.

Upon the sacred Jydan Writings, a god's teachings were to be written by the three prophets of that god, and the Volumes of Truth, also written by the three prophets of each gods, would tell of that god's laws and ethics. Upon their religion, the galaxy was ruled by the gods since the beginning of time, and the gods provided their favor to the Ka'hren species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ka'hrens were so respectful with each other that they could not grasp the idea of betrayal until they were contacted by other species.
