The weapon was mounted in a dual-barrel configuration on the AT-ATs, and could fire in a \"one-two punch\" pattern or simultaneously; with both of those settings seen in action at the Battle of Hoth. The MS-1 fire-linked heavy laser cannon's firepower could also be altered from the command section by the pilots, ranging from light bolts to a devastating beam that could destroy most ground-based targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
