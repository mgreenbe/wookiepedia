From there, he became the complete basis for the main character's voice and appearance in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. His likeness was created through motion capture for the game to build the character's appearance and range of facial expressions. Witwer's performance was recorded on HD cameras (as were all the actors who worked on the game). While the game was in production, Witwer only knew his character as \"Starkiller.\" Witwer also voiced Galen Marek (known only as \"The Apprentice\") in Soulcalibur IV. Witwer returned to play Starkiller in the sequel Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II. For this character, he served in the same capacity as before by providing his voice and likeness to the main character. Witwer also voiced Palpatine in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, and gave his voice and likeness to the imperfect genetic replicas and the Dark Apprentice in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterwards, Witwer appeared on the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series as the voices of the Son and Maul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Witwer took over voicing Palpatine from Tim Curry for the second season of Star Wars Rebels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He voiced Maul in the season 2 finale of Rebels, and a few episodes for the third season."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Witwer voiced various characters in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, including several stormtroopers, an announcer and a First Order officer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Witwer also provided additional voices in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Witwer voiced the characters of Darth Maul and Emperor Palpatine in the game Star Wars Battlefront II."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Witwer provided the voice for Maul in Solo: A Star Wars Story."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Witwer voiced the New Republic fighter pilot Hugh Sion for the premiere episode of Star Wars Resistance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Witwer provided additional voices in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Witwer expressed an interest in being in the live-action TV series, presumably reprising his role as Galen Marek."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On May 27, 2020, it was announced on StarWars.com and The Star Wars Show that Witwer would be portraying the voice of the dark side in the web game series Star Wars: Jedi Temple Challenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to his work in Star Wars, he frequently competes in Star Wars trivia competitions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars voice work"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
