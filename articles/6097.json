Celz was attacked by Kenobi and Rex, who had revealed the truth about the Dark Jedi.

She was instructed in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually rising to the rank of Jedi Knight. During that time, she befriended fellow Jedi Et Rex. However, in 25 BBY, Celz succumbed to the dark side of the Force and began to commit various crimes. When Celz invited Rex to join her, he refused, and she subsequently framed her former friend. The Dark Jedi took Rex prisoner and attempted to bring him to the Jedi High Council on the galactic capital, Coruscant, piloting the Consular-class cruiser Radiant IX. En route to Coruscant, the starship's power couplings failed due to a flock of mynocks, forcing Celz to crash on the surface of the asteroid Poison Moon, which was located in the Hoth system's asteroid field.

Celz caught Kenobi with the lightning, however, and proceeded to torture them both. She was interrupted by Rex, who had thrown a mynock at her so that it would attack and distract her from Kenobi and Skywalker. After he threw a second mynock at her, she attempted to get them off her, which resulted in Celz stunning herself until she was incapacitated.
