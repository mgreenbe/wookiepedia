Ostracized by fellow Weequay because of this, Redath-Gom was seemingly unaffected as he graduated the academy and was selected by a Jedi Master for training as a Padawan. Navigating his way through his apprenticeship, Redath-Gom forged for himself a green-bladed lightsaber using crystals from Ilum before preparing to undergo the Trials of Knighthood. Passing the trials successfully, Redath-Gom was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council and ready to begin his service to the Republic independently.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Separatist Crisis between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems reached a powder-keg, Redath-Gom was stationed at the Coruscant Temple and responded to Master of the Order Mace Windu's summons to join a strike team to rescue Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from execution on Geonosis. Journeying to the Outer Rim world with his colleagues, Redath-Gom helped storm the Petranaki arena and meet head on with the Separatist Droid Army.
