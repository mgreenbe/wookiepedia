Jedi General Anakin Skywalker used it to evacuate Jedi General Aayla Secura and some of her troops from her flagship Liberty during the Battle of Quell. However, during the frigate's attempt to return to Skywalker's flagship, the Resolute, the ship was damaged by Separatist fire, killing the pilot and causing the hyperdrive to activate, flinging the starship into hyperspace on an unknown trajectory, carrying both Jedi Generals, Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Clone Commander Bly, Clone Captain Rex, and several other clone troopers. Skywalker had also been severely injured holding back an explosion while the others boarded the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The damage to the ship's hyperdrive caused it to enter a collision course with the sun of the Maridun system, with the stellar collision only averted by the ship's power being completely shut off, forcing it out of hyperspace and allowing Tano and Bly, who were flying, to divert the ship's course around the star. However, the damage to the ship forced it to crash-land on the planet Maridun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
