The conflict with the Flesh Raiders reached its peak in 3643 BBY, when the Jedi finally reached out to the villagers in an attempt to combat the Flesh Raider threat.

However, Morr soon contacted the village again and changed their deal, demanding the life of Din's Padawan as well.

The Padawan soon recovered and questioned the villagers' intentions, and Moorint explained that Morr was demanding the Jedi's life. Before the villagers could attack, the Padawan reached out with the Force and convinced the trio to leave the building peacefully.
