The flower had a number of uses, including in the creation of teas. During the time of the New Republic, drought on Haneli caused the price of the haneli flower to increase substantially. Because of the drought, a genetic science professor at an academy on the Mid Rim world Eroudac hired one of her students, Izal Garsea, to smuggle a quantity of the flowers for her. Garsea was caught while attempting to carry the flowers aboard her starship, the Meridian, and abandoned the cargo, choosing not to return to the academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, around 34 ABY, Garsea recounted the story of her smuggling attempt on Haneli to her friend Julen Rakab, a farmer on the Outer Rim planet Batuu.
