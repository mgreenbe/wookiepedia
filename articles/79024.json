BlasTech used the DL-87 Firespray stun rifle as the LBR-9's starting point, and worked to increase the range, incorporating a longer barrel that featured an upgraded Galven-pattern, as well as a proprietary blend of blaster gases to achieve a coherent stun beam at range."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to its steep price of 2,800 credits, the LBR-9 was most common among law enforcement sharpshooters in the Core Worlds and wealthier regions of the Rim. Bounty hunters who favored standoff tactics adopted the weapon as well, preferring its customizability and reliable stopping power over the traits of BlasTech's civilian-grade M-300 hunting blaster. These same qualities also made it popular with commercial big game hunters. Stunning dangerous prey allowed for live capture, a necessity for hunters working for research laboratories, zoological societies, or eccentric trillionaires that sought exotic pets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
