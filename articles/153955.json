In 22 BBY, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano stole the frigate to help them transport the slave workers in the shipyards off-world during a battle on Gwori."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The frigate was not fitted with armaments, so the Jedi were unable to fight through the blockade around the planet. They were forced to play safe; when traffic control ordered them to pass through the scanning station, they obeyed. Unfortunately Overseer Juhm, in charge of the operations on Gwori, ordered the station to activate its radiation beam, which would kill everyone on board the frigate. However, Jedi Masters Saesee Tiin and Plo Koon opened fire on the station from their interceptors, destroying it and allowing the frigate to pass safely through. Since their hyperdrive rings had been destroyed, Koon and Tiin boarded the frigate, which then flew safely to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
