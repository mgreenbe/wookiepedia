Refusing to accept this he goes looking for any hints of the Promised Land, he succeeded which led him into the Undercity sewers, he also recorded his discoveries in a journal but failed to inform the Outcast village of such as he was attacked and killed by rakghouls, with his journal and its evidence being lost with him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His son, Rukil's father also went on the hunt and was more successful in tracking the Promised Land and recorded them in his own journal but became a casualty of the sewer-dwelling rakghouls too, with his own news also failing to emerge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rukil himself would continue the quest but never came close nor had recovered his father's or grandfather's journals, he was eventually forced to give up due to old age, and hired Malya to takeover.
