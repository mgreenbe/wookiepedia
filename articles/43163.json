Born the daughter of technician Lema Xandret, she was separated from her family and trained in the Sith Academy under Darth Chratis. At the age of 17, she was confronted with her past, as evidence of her family's whereabouts, now considered a traitor to the Sith Empire. Ax herself took over the search for the planet, which eventually led both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic to the planet Sebaddon. The two parties formed an alliance to destroy the hex droids made by Lema Xandret, who had the potential to depopulate the entire galaxy.

It was later found that the remnants of the ship named Cinzia were found and were being auctioned off by a Hutt named Tassaa Bareesh. Prior to giving this information to the Sith Dark Council, Darth Chratis removed the memory block he imposed on Eldon Ax and told her the true story of her existence. Chratis and Ax were dispatched by the Dark Council to steal the remains of the Cinzia and execute Lema Xandret if she was found. During the attempt to steal the remnants of the Cinzia, mysterious and deadly hex droids appeared and thwarted the theft. Although the attempt to steal the artifacts was unsuccessful, Ax was able to use the remains of a hex to trace their origin back to a planet called Sebaddon. The Jedi were also able to do the same.

During the battle, Ax found a clone of herself that was being kept alive in a tank filled with amnioid fluid. Ax also found that her mother had been killed by her own Hex Droid creations, but continued to exist and speak to her clone through the amnioid fluid. Ax learned from her clone that the Hex Droids were created to protect her. Upon release from the amnioid tank, the clone immediately died, but not before instructing Ax to feed her DNA into the hex computer. The hexes recognized Ax as Cinzia and followed her commands.
