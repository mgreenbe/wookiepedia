In the year 34 ABY, during the attack on the Resistance fleet, he piloted the Nebulon-C escort frigate Anodyne. Attempting to flee from the First Order with the other Resistance ships, this pilot's ship was the first to run dry. The ship was then destroyed as General Armitage Hux commented that the ship was the beginning of the end of the Resistance. This pilot elected to remain behind on the Anodyne whilst the rest of the crew evacuated. He informed Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo of this development and wished them good luck just as the ship was completely destroyed, killing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character was played by Danny Sapani in Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi.
