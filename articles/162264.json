Their most distinctive feature was a coat of crystaline bristles/spines that served as protection against their predators. The jingling sounds resulting from this coat helped warn other vulptices about danger. Their facial bristles (or whiskers) also helped them gauge whether they could fit into a tight space. Vulptices had excellent low-light vision and keen senses. They were omnivorous, feeding on tubers and small burrowing mammals they dug out from under Crait's salt crust. According to Doctor Paqin Mesoli, who wrote field notes on the vulptices for the Nupayuni Mining Consortium, those creatures might also have been sensitive to magnetic fields."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vulptices were most active at dawn and dusk. They congregated in cave dens at night. Vulptices dwelled in highland caves and canyons. Dr. Mesoli theorized that they had summer dens beneath Crait's salt crust, and winter dens in caverns. They lived in groups referred to as skulks, regrouping three to four families with as many as ten creatures by family. Dr. Mesoli, however, observed those skulks came together in larger social structures, with as many as one hundred vultpices sharing a particularly advantageous den."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although not sentient, the vulptices were clever animals that formed strong bonds and hunted in cooperation. Dr. Mesoli suspected that they used their bristles to communicate, shaking them or brushing them against stones to generate specific sound patterns. They also appeared to be empathetic, even to members of other species, demonstrated by the individual that led trapped members of the Resistance out of their base on Crait."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Rebel Alliance abandoned their outpost on the planet, a skulk of vulptices had come to roam free through the abandoned structures. In 34 ABY, an extremely curious skulk of vulptices was present near the base during the time of a battle that broke out between the First Order and the Resistance on Crait's surface, but retreated into the outpost, remaining inside for the duration of the battle. When the battle stalled thanks to a distraction by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, the vulptices managed to locate and exploit an unrecorded exit to the base. However, one vulptice stayed behind and led the surviving Resistance members to the escape route used by the skulk, a narrow crevice within a mound of boulders that was unfortunately too small to be used by the desperate rebels. Luckily, the Jedi-in-training Rey noticed the vulptices leaving the outpost through the blocked exit, and was able to use the Force to move the rocks out of the way, allowing the Resistance members to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vulptices were designed for Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, the eighth film in the Star Wars saga, which was released on December 15, 2017. They were first revealed in The Last Jedi behind the scenes footage from the D23 Expo released on July 15, 2017, displaying the animatronics that were used to bring the creatures to life.
