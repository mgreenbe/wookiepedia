Fu is a visual effects art director at Industrial Light & Magic who has worked on all three movies of the prequel trilogy.

Like many children of the time, he owned Star Wars action figures. His family moved to Southern California when he was still young, and there he discovered a passion for aerosol art in his early teens. In fun, he would compete with his friends painting giant productions on the legalized graffiti walls of Huntington Beach."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After high school, Fu went on to the University of California, Berkeley and was about to begin his final semester as an economics major when he learned about an art internship at Industrial Light & Magic. He got the intern position and discovered that he enjoyed drawing spaceships and creatures more than drawing supply and demand graphs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately following graduation, he was asked to join ILM's Episode I team, and over the next four years, worked his way up to become a visual effects art director. He received his first film credit as a visual effects storyboard / concept artist and learned a little about everything during the process: conceptual art, storyboards, animation, matte painting and even graphic design. Fu contributed to the prequel trilogy in the form of spaceship, droid, and environment designs, along with some costume and character work."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the workplace he is known for his dry sense of humor.
