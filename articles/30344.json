Considered a veteran by the time of the war, Costi commanded the \"Diligent\", a PB-950 patrol boat. Costi was an honest, dogmatic and no-nonsense lawman although he was willing to accept bribes in order to overlook minor non-violent offences by criminals such as smugglers. Contraband he and his crew were willing to overlook for a cost included medical supplies, alcohol, small arms, starship parts or some less harmful spices. He would not overlook more serious offences such as smuggling extremely harmful spices or slavery. The crew of the Diligent were willing to follow Costi in any choice he made to overlook a crime. Whilst on duty Costi carried a CR-2 heavy blaster pistol, a stun baton and wore an armored uniform suit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corran Costi first appeared in \"The Long Arm of the Law\" adventure module in Suns of Fortune, a sourcebook released in 2014 for Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system. He is given as an example enemy for players to face if they are wanted by the law, with a brief outline of his use given in the module but without any specific detail. This article therefore does not describe the encounter in the module as it is purposely left vague. The book doesn't make clear his species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
