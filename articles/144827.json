It was published in the Star Wars: Republic Commando: Prima Official Game Guide, which was released on March 8, 2005. The story is the tale of a Kaminoan deity, Protas, as translated by Ryan Kaufman from the Kaminoan language to Basic. Protas' rule of the seas of Kamino is challenged first by a great titan named Melkorr, then by an army of sentient kikla. Killing the challengers, Protas becomes arrogant and prevents an aiwha pod from migrating south. Realizing they must attack or die, the aiwha pod attacks and defeats Protas in a bloody battle, in part due to one aiwha sacrificing itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The story opens with the line \"Translated from the Kaminoan by Ryan Kaufman\" to credit the real-life author, thus placing Kaufman in the Star Wars universe.

The story explains that before the dawn of the second sun, the mystical being Protas rules the oceans of Kamino. His claim as the most powerful in the seas is challenged, first by Melkorr, a massive titan from the deep. With a jaw full of sharp teeth and large, pointed fins, Melkorr meets Protas on the underwater ridge of Thalina. Trying to use his size and power to overwhelm Protas, Melkorr battles for six days and nights. However, the god-beast uses his agility and speed to evade the titan's attacks, tiring Melkorr. Taking advantage of his opponent's exhaustion, Protas deals a killing blow, leaving the seas bloodied and feeding fish for an eon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Protas is later challenged by an army of sentient kikla, who believed that their large numbers would make up for their comparatively small size and would be able to overwhelm the god-beast. Meeting Protas in the deep waters of the Ancient Trench, they fight for a month. Though legion in number, the kikla are divided in mind and argue amongst themselves, leaving only small wounds on the god-beast. In comparison, Protas is of a single mind and slowly eats the kikla to maintain strength, and at the new moon, the last kikla is eaten and Protas is again victorious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Becoming old and arrogant in his victories and power, Protas eventually comes across a pod of aiwha, who are swimming south to avoid the cold winter. Blocking their path, Protas refuses to let them continue and instructs the aiwha to return north, simply for his amusement. Knowing they will die if they turn back, the aiwha attack without warning, since they do not desire glory or fame. The aiwha combine the swarming tactics of the kikla with the powerful attacks of Melkorr but cannot deal a killing blow through Protas' thick skin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One aiwha, noticing Protas has briefly exposed the soft flesh of his throat, clamps onto the god-beast in a sacrificial attempt to defeat him. Realizing his dire position, Protas attempts to dislodge the aiwha by smashing it with his fins, but it will not let go, even in death. This allows the rest of the aiwha to deal a final blow, ending the god-beast's life. The story is told as an explanation of why the aiwha rule the oceans and are given respect by all the creatures of Kamino, great and small, as they defeated Protas and brought peace to the seas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"The Tale of the Aiwha Pod\" is a one-page Star Wars Legends short story published by Prima Games in the Star Wars: Republic Commando: Prima Official Game Guide, which was released March 8, 2005.
