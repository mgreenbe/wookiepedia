A maze of gorges, buttes, canyons, and ridges, the Madlands was not occupied by any signs of civilization as the conditions were too dangerous to sustain permanent residents. Despite this, raiders and bandits said to be as mad as the region's name preyed on the caravans that occasionally crossed the wastes on their way to Highland Lakes and the Sunrace Citadel on the other side of the region. While occasionally warlords would take control of these raiders and lead them to war with the prosperous northern or southern regions, most were content to search after legendary techno-relics said to be hidden among the gorges by the first colonists of Weik."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
