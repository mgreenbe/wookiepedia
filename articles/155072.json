The Tarinna encountered the cartographer Emil Graf in the Lost Library of Nelgenam, and intended to feed on his memories and the tales he had heard. Graf's Kowakian monkey-lizard Noni managed to reactivate the droids CR-8R and BB-00, who the Tarinna had deactivated, and CR-8R distracted the Tarinna with holographic images of numerous individuals and the promise of many stories to feast upon. Graf and his companions managed to knock down one of the library's shelves on top of the Tarinna. However, the Tarinna had caused Graf to lose the memories of the many stories he had heard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
