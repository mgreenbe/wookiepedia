When the queen was informed that count Dooku was making his way to Zygerria, she trusted the guards to watch over Skywalker as she didn't want him to participate in the meeting. As the queen was leaving, the other guard hit Skywalker with his weapon and made him turn around. R2-D2 then saw this and bumped into that guard as a diversion, drawing this guard's attention as well and allowing Skywalker to jump down and evade them.\nThe other guard then sent this one one down to look for the Jedi after which this guard was never seen again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
