The attack failed due to mass fire and superior tactics on behalf of the temporarily allied New Republic and Galactic Empire, and Serpent's Smile was destroyed. Red Gauntlet surrendered shortly after, to the combined force of Solo's Star Destroyers, as well as Stellar Web. She carried six squadrons of TIE fighters even after her capture by the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
