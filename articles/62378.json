Before being able to connect, Baasen Ray intercepted the drop and detained Han and Chewie. Baasen was an old friend of Han's who had turned bounty hunter trying to capture Han and delivering him to Jabba the Hutt. Han and Chewie were able to escape, shot off Baasen's hand, but ran into Imperials right after. Using the Imperial's uniform, Han managed to locate Hark and get her out. Hark, however, planned on completing her mission and convinced Han to help her. They retrieved critical data from the Imperials and then went to Kiamurr to intercept Hunter Mass who had stolen information on how to control hyperspace travel. On Kiamurr, Leia Organa had been hosting a meeting for friends of the rebellion. Lots of which were killed when the Imperial fleet arrived chasing Hunter Mass. Baasen was attacked by the potential credits to be made and joined the rebels. He also shot Hunter Maas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The data they were chasing contained Essio Galassian's discovery of a hyperspace nullifier superweapon designed by the extinct K'kybak. The K'kybak had secluded themselves thousands of years ago and mastered physics developing hyperspace control. After the K'kybak went extinct their planet fell to ruin. Leia, Han, Chewie, Hark, Baasen and Sunnim went to their planet, Seymarti V, after Leia had sent Luke on an unrelated mission to the Seymarti system just a few days prior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving in the Seymarti system, Luke and the red star-fighter waves led by Wedge Antilles helped Han, Chewie, Leia, Scarlet, Baasen and Sunnim to land on Seymarti V. Sunnim was killed by a local animal. Entering the ancient K'kybak temple the crew fought off booby traps and storm troopers before reaching a chamber kilometers inside the temple where they faced Essio Galassian. Essio used the power of the machine to fight them. Baasen was shot but with his last move pushed Essio off the platform. It turned out that the planet was hollow, its surface held in place by the K'kybak machine. Essio fell thousands of kilometers down to the planet's core. When stormtroopers arrived shooting at Han, Leia and Scarlet, Han decided to destroy the control panel and therefore the entire planet. They were able to escape Seymarti V with Luke's help before Chewie picked them up in the Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
