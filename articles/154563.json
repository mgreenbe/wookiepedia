By 3643 BBY, the Republic Military stored heavy weaponry and munitions at the warehouse, and the facility's computers had access to the design files for the Planet Prison superweapon. That year, a group of thieves led by the Rodian Vistis Garn raided the warehouse on behalf of the Migrant Merchants' Guild and Black Sun crime syndicates. The group sliced the warehouse's computers to steal the design files along with munitions, rockets, and heavy weaponry before retreating to the Old Galactic Market, the area of Coruscant under the Guild's control. However, Garn's face was seen by security cameras, allowing the Republic Strategic Information Service, the Republic's intelligence agency, to identify him and send a young Jedi Knight to recover the files and weaponry from the criminals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The warehouse is briefly mentioned in the Jedi Knight class mission \"Stolen Secrets\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
