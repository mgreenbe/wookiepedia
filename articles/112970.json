After jumping to the Wobani system, Red Three joined the other members of Red Flight in dodging large asteroids and shooting smaller ones. While navigating through the asteroids, Red Three warned Red Two of an incoming asteroid right before he collided with it. After flying his way through the asteroids, Red Three told Red Leader that he had spotted Bravo One, a U-wing which was carrying Jyn Erso and Extraction Team Bravo. After K-2SO, who was piloting the U-wing, informed Red Flight of their technical malfunctions; Red Three joined the rest of Red Flight in defending the ship. On the way to the rendezvous point to meet the CR90 corvette Vigilant, Red Flight was ambushed by numerous TIE fighters and Red Three assisted in fending them off. Soon after, the Vigilant was destroyed by an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer that jumped into the system. After witnessing this and taking evasive action as ordered by Red Leader, Red Three identified more TIE fighters approaching them. Soon after Red Flight was tasked with buying more time for Bravo One to be repaired to escape the Star Destroyer's tractor beam, Red Three was chased by three TIE fighters who were subsequently destroyed by Red Four. After Red Four destroyed the Star Destroyer's targeting array, Red Three, Bravo One, and the rest of Red Flight successfully jumped to the Yavin system where Bravo One departed from Red Flight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Red Three is a non-playable character in the 2016 Star Wars Battlefront: Rogue One: X-wing VR Mission, a downloadable virtual reality add-on to the 2015 canon video game Star Wars Battlefront.
