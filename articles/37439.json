Yoda discovers a planet in the middle of a small, glowing, golden nebula. When he and R2-D2 enter, the instruments and Artoo malfunction, but Yoda (remembering Qui-Gon's advice) allows the Force to steer his starfighter, which leads him to a planet generating a large amount of energy. On the surface, they land near a geyser, and Yoda decides to leave R2-D2 behind and gives the droid his lightsaber before re-entering the craft to journey inside the geyser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Yoda reaches the other side of the geyser, he is greeted by a world which is flourishing with life. There he hears the voice of Serenity, one of the Five Priestesses, who welcomes him. Yoda meets the other priestesses, who each symbolize an emotion. Yoda is skeptical about their tests, as he is a Jedi Master and doesn't know what others have to teach him. The Priestesses allow Yoda to train because he himself will later train someone of great importance to the universe. Yoda says that he is not afraid, but that is doubted by the priestesses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they all disappear, he is told by a priestess where they are located.

The dark side fights Yoda, but Yoda says that the shadow is not part of himself and rejects it. The more Yoda rejects his shadow, the more he seems to become it.

Yoda then vanquishes his dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Priestesses awaken Yoda and give him his next trial. In the Valley of Extinction, Yoda will be challenged by temptation. He is shown two scenarios. The first is inside the Jedi Temple, where he finds the dead bodies of Mace Windu, Petro, and a dying Ahsoka Tano, who asks him if she'll still be able to become one with the Force even after leaving the order. Then Katooni brings Yoda to another scenario, a utopia where the Clone Wars never occurred, and everyone Yoda knows is still part of the Jedi Order, including those who lost their lives and those who left/betrayed the Order due to circumstances connected to the war. Yoda soon realizes that this is an illusion, since Jedi like Adi Gallia, Tiplar, and Qui-Gon Jinn are dead, and Dooku has become a Sith Lord. Yoda, realizing that this is another vision, denies Dooku's request to join them, and Dooku turns into a savage Sith Lord. When Dooku attacks Yoda, the entire vision disappears once more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoda wakes up and wants to see the true face of the Priestess.
