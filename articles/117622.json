A peaceful people, the Naboo retained only security officers and guards rather than a true military organization."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Royal Naboo Security Forces existed after 67 BBY on the planet Naboo. Captain Maris Magneta was the head of the force under King Ars Veruna. Magneta resigned after Veruna's mysterious death and was replaced by Quarsh Panaka, who instigated tighter security procedures for Queen Amidala, including decoy handmaidens. The members often got off-world experience, but returned out of loyalty to serve. The Security Forces were stationed in the main hangar in Theed, the capital city."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Battle of Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Security Forces were forced into their first real battle against the organization called the Trade Federation in 32 BBY, and fought valiantly, yet in vain, against its battle droid legions during the Invasion of Naboo. The Federation detained them in prison camps until some were freed by Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes, while survivors formed a portion of the resistance. The Federation established their own patrols on the planet. Queen Amidala and Captain Panaka rallied the troops upon their return to Naboo, and were able to capture the Federation's leader, Viceroy Nute Gunray, and end the droid occupation. The Security Forces continued to protect Naboo following these battles, though adopted many increased security measures during the Separatist Crisis and the eventual Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 22 BBY, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine arrived back on Naboo for the Festival of Light. The Security Forces established a defensive position around the Chancellor's Podium, but a team of bounty hunters managed to abduct the Chancellor. He was successfully rescued by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around that time, the ELG-3A blaster pistol was a standard-issue blaster aboard all RSF ships, including their battleships."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The rise of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Security Forces had to show their determination when the Galactic Empire became the new galactic order. In 19 BBY, the security guards, along with some Gungans, attacked the Imperial garrison in Theed. The object of the attack was to stop Inquisitor Malorum from transmitting a vital secret. Ultimately, ex-Jedi Ferus Olin killed the Inquisitor in the Plasma Refinery Complex, while the Royal Naboo Security Forces and the Gungan Grand Army achieved the victory in the city and in the Imperial garrison. To hide the attack an illegal weapons cache in the Theed Hangar was detonated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, peace for the security forces was short-lived. Naboo's then queen, Apailana, had been housing Jedi runaways fleeing from the Empire's Great Jedi Purge at her own risk. When it was ordered that Apailana be executed for treason, the Empire had prepared its elite 501st Legion of stormtroopers. The Security Forces tried their best to hold off the 501st during what was later called the Fall of Naboo. However, the Royal Palace was soon besieged. The Naboo forces were quickly beheaded without a strong leader like Panaka had once been. Auto-turrets were shut down and the grid console destroyed. Most of the security and palace fighters met their dooms. At last, Apailana was assassinated in the royal plaza in the midst of the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Royal Naboo Security Forces were at last defeated, and most of the remaining survivors loyal to Apailana were quietly arrested and transported to the secret Death Star detention centers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Period, the Royal Naboo Security Forces owned a Mon Calamari Star Cruiser, the RNS Queen Amidala IV."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Queen's Royal Guard (established for the following queen, Kylantha) took the place of the once-experienced Royal Naboo Security Forces, who were relegated to being a type of police force. Rather than having many branches as the old security forces, the Royal Guard was made up of only a select few bodyguards whom the monarch knew personally. While the RSF continued as a small police force, protection of Naboo and its systems was mainly performed by the Imperial stormtroopers until the rise of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, the weakened RSF police force had severe problems with the many criminal gangs that had swamped the planet after the rise of the Empire. At that time, the four major criminal organization on Naboo were the Skaak Tippers, Borvo the Hutt's criminal empire, the Darkwalkers and the Mummers. Furthermore, other criminal groups included the Naboo pirates, the Maulers, the Peddlers, the Muskegs, and the Mountaintop smugglers. With little help from the Imperial garrison, the RSF had lost the grip on the overwhelming criminal activity. Fortunately, they were able to enlist the help of groups of unidentified travelers, whose assistance enabled the Security Forces to put a stop to many gang-related crimes. Quarsh Panaka would on occasion delegate missions to the agents of the RSF, as would Pooja Naberrie."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, a spacer working for Panaka successfully confiscated Skaak Tipper weapons crates and raided the Skaak Tipper Hideout, preventing the criminals to steal all bank terminals in Kaadara. The spacer later joined the RSF under the orders of Gregar Typho. Together, they eliminated the warlord known as the Mauler Usurper, captured the criminal Doogal Belstar, assaulted the Mauler Stronghold, and defeated the Naboo pirates in space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The same year, the city of Theed was victim of a terrorist attack. RSF agents commanded by Major Franchels, Sergeant Brunser, Lieutenant Dunnels and Sergeant Bragg identified the Mummers as responsible and then raided the Mummer bunker to eliminate the terrorist leaders. Around the same time, the RSF rescued Karl Eckener, kidnapped by the Darkwalkers. A short time later, Lieutenant Sundria Khartoor caught the criminal Hunnos Jarkey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, in 4 ABY, a coalition of remaining Naboo loyalists and the Gungan Grand Army were able to openly defy the Empire and liberate Theed.
