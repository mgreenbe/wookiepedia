During the Battle of Gazzari, Dackett took a recovery team to salvage what was left of Tun-Badon's Serraknife Battalion, unaware that the entire battalion had been killed. Dackett was injured, but was pulled to safety by the clumsy young Duros Beadle Lubboon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He had an artificial arm and gapped teeth which often whistled when he talked.
