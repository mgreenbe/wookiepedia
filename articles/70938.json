He was evidently the commander of the garrison's legion of stormtroopers, but inasmuch as the Imperial Navy guardship Harridan had been withdrawn three weeks earlier, it is not clear whether in normal circumstances he would have had authority over the Black Fifteen shipyard, or the Super Star Destroyer Intimidator, fitting out at the docks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Commander Paret's plans were foiled by a revolt among the native Yevetha, led by Nil Spaar.
