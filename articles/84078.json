Lungru was also head of the assassination attempt on the life of Mika Anjiliac Chiera on Nar Shaddaa during the New Order. Lungru had a diamond-shaped tattoo in the center of his forehead. Mika questioned Lungru's part in the plot on his life, which was actually masterminded by Mika himself to deflect the attention of his father, Popara, from his plans for the tempest spice plot. Lungru showed interest at the idea of assassinating Mika, since he had become one of Popara's partners. After Popara's death, Lungru took notice that the entire business surrounding the tempest seemed like a family affair, and guessed that Zonnos had been behind the assassination of Popara. Lungru chose to ally himself with Zonnos, and dispatched his own forces to hunt down Popara's agents and track down the source of the tempest spices."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
