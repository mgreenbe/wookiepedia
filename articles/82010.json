The Flying Tigers were also noted for the shark teeth nose art on their planes, and well as their high kill ratio. Urquhart also noted the similarities between the T-65s of the Lightspeed Panthers, and the P-40 Warhawks of the Flying Tigers, stating that they were both pilot-friendly multi-role fighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
