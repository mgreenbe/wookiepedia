He resided in the underside of the Spire and was the sector's prime info broker. Shortly after, Chelli Lona Aphra visited him searching for information about Commodex Tahn, the mortician that buried Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Aphra then returned to the Ante, this time searching for information about Luke Skywalker. Shortly after exchanging this info for a hefty amount of credits, Darth Vader and Inspector Thanoth attacked the outpost. When the Ante tried to exchange information regarding Vader and Thanoth's investigation, Vader redirected a blaster bolt into the Ante's chest, silencing him and eliminating any connections between Aphra and Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
