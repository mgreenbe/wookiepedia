He arrived on the planet of the Tchuukthai species, deep in the Unknown Regions, where he discovered that the Tchuukthai, commonly thought to be unintelligent beasts, were in fact beings capable of extraordinary intellect. He befriended Thon, and eventually offered to train him in the ways of the Force. Thon was originally hesitant, as he thought that if people knew of his species' intelligence, they would exploit them. The Jedi agreed to keep it a secret, and trained Thon in the ways of the Jedi. Thon would go on to become a great Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
