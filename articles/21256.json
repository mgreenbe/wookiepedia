The bulk cruiser's large and bulbous forward section contained a medium sized hangar for up to one squadron of starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One kind of bulk cruiser was produced by Keizar-Volvec and used by the Sith Empire as a command ship during the Great Galactic War.\nThe more famous designs were produced during the Clone Wars, meant to be second-line Republic ships. Not deployed until after the conflict was over, they became among some of the most common designs seen in space, although most were modified, due to their stock design being prone to breakdowns, slow speed and expensive refueling. The term came to be used to describe a number of ships that fit the general characteristics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Modifications to the ships to make them more battleworthy were often seen as useless by Alliance commanders. Instead, most were converted into carrier cruisers, with extensive docking bays and repair facilities. The crews were told to stay out of any serious engagements and rely upon their starfighter squadrons as their primary weapons. Bulk cruisers that were converted into carriers were capable of carrying three squadrons of fighters. Other ships were kept as escorts for Alliance convoys."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire and various corporations kept bulk cruisers as patrol vessels, guarding systems where important corporate assets were to be found.
