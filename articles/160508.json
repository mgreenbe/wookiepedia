For the first fight, Mondo-Mod unveils a wampa, who Unduli quickly dispatches by jumping up, grabbing him by his horns, and flipping him, using simple physics. Second, the Hutt announces a durkii, who the Jedi defeats by darting underneath his legs and back, causing the creature to flip onto its back. Finally, quite displeased, Mondo-Mod declares the final contender: a heavily outfitted droid, who is quickly disabled when Unduli flicks a rock into its visor. Winning their bet, Unduli returns to Mondo-Mod, who obliges their deal by handing her the coordinates of a Separatist droid factory on Diorda. Afterwards, the Master meets with her Padawan, Barriss Offee, who, disguised as a masked gambler, managed to win 10,000,000 credits, forcing the Hutt to go out of business. Their mission a total success, Unduli and Offee return to their starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
