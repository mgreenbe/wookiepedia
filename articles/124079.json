Because of this, before each mission the sergeant appointed the trooper with the skills most appropriate to the assignment to take the rank of brevet corporal. Each trooper was completely briefed on the mission objectives, and were considered to be skilled enough to act independently and improvise if the sergeant and brevet corporal were killed in action. Officially, sharpshooter squads were not issued with light repeating blasters. However, most squads had acquired them, and their belief in their effectiveness led to the decision to issue the weapons to standard line squads. Several members of sharpshooter squads were drawn from the ranks of the Special Missions forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
