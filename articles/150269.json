When he proved unable to qualify for flight school, Hack chose to serve the Alliance in communications and tactical assistance.

Hack was impressed by the young pilot's skill and enthusiasm for the Rebellion and encouraged him to continue his pilot training with the Alliance. Hack helped tutor Rookie One during his early flights, and served as both a friend and mentor to the young pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Battle of Toprawa, Hack was working in Tac-Comm control on the morning when Rookie One took his trials through the nearby Beggar's Canyon, the culmination of his training on Tatooine. After granting Rookie One's T-16 skyhopper clearance to depart, Hack wished his friend luck, assuring him that Beggar's Canyon was not as difficult as the runs he used to do. Rookie One succeeded in navigating the canyon in close formation with two members of Green Squadron and engaging target drones, seeing him proceed to R-22 Spearhead training under Commander Jake Farrell, leaving Hack behind on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after Rookie One's trials, the CR90 corvette Tantive IV arrived at Tatooine, carrying Princess Leia Organa and the plans to the Empire's new battlestation, the Death Star. When Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader arrived to capture it aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Devastator, Organa dispatched the plans to Tatooine in the care of the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. When Vader realized the plans were no longer aboard the Tantive IV, he ordered his forces to begin searching Tatooine. This search eventually led the Imperials to discover Anchorhead Base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels called for help from Kolaador, where Rookie One was training under Commander Ru Murleen. Murleen responded, leading Rookie One and Thurlow Harris, in a three-ship flight of T-65 X-wing starfighters, to Tatooine. After fighting their way past Imperial forces in orbit, the group proceeded into Tatooine's atmosphere and headed for Anchorhead base. Murleen signaled the base for a status report and Hack responded, telling them an Imperial attack was already underway. Hearing his friend's voice, Rookie One promised to get their as soon as possible\u2014however, it was already too late. While Hack spoke to the approaching Rebels, a group of three TIE/LN starfighters entered the canyon and opened fire on Anchorhead Base. Their laser cannon blasts destroyed the hangar and control center in which Hack was working, killing him instantly. Rookie One and the other Rebels eliminated the TIEs responsible for destroying the base and engaged other Imperial forces before they were forced to withdraw."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hack was dedicated to the Alliance Starfighter Corps.
