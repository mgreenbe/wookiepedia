The operation was carried out on the orders of the Sith Lord Sadic, who sought to capture the Republic's Power Guard supersoldier project as part of his master Darth Angral's campaign of vengeance against the Republic. After learning of the center's location by torturing the operative in charge of the project, Sadic's forces captured the facility and imprisoned the recruiter Vell Narroc and the volunteers. At Sadic's orders, the Imperials began taking the project's volunteers to the project lab for experimentation. The facility was later liberated by a young Jedi Knight, but most of the refugees had already been taken by that time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The capture of the recruitment center was first mentioned in the Jedi Knight class mission \"The Search for Agent Galen\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game released by BioWare in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
