The mate of Crado, she trained in the Jedi arts under the Krevaaki Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas on Dantooine, along with Crado and the Human known as Exar Kun. When Kun left Master Vodo's tutelage to become a Dark Lord of the Sith, Sylvar found herself swept up in the events of the Great Sith War. She fought for the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic alongside such notables as Nomi Sunrider and Master Thon of Ambria. In the course of the war, Sylvar saw much action on Coruscant, Ambria, and the library world of Ossus, where she had a chance to confront Exar Kun himself for his crimes. However, the war also had terrible repercussions, her master was mercilessly slain by Kun after a duel on Coruscant and her mate Crado turned traitor and was ultimately killed by his Sith masters. When the Republic eventually won the war and Exar Kun was defeated, Sylvar found that she had lost everything that she held dear, including the future life she thought she would live."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in life, Sylvar made it her personal mission to see to it that Ulic Qel-Droma, the last surviving member of the Sith regime, answer for his crimes. In a brush with the dark side, in which she could not put aside her bitterness for the events of the war, Sylvar attempted to evade her desire by traveling to Ryloth and then to Cathar on missions, to no avail. Only when she faced Qel-Droma, and he refused to fight back, did she finally understand her error and return to the light.

As her species mated for life, Sylvar chose Crado to be her companion, and together they traveled to Dantooine to study the ways of the Force. The pair took as their master the Krevaaki Vodo-Siosk Baas, who had previously trained such Jedi as Dace Diath, Qrrrl Toq, and Shoaneb Culu. During the time of their training, Master Vodo had another apprentice, the Human known as Exar Kun. Crado and Sylvar were pitted against Kun regularly in training for lightsaber combat, and found the Human to be a very skilled adversary. But while Crado developed an attitude of deference towards Exar Kun in defeat, Sylvar was less easily subdued."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After one match against Exar Kun in which her mate was defeated, Sylvar was called upon by their master to challenge the Human next. Sylvar was more than willing to accept, and the two rivals faced each other. During their combat, Kun attempted to break Sylvar's will, as he had done with Crado, by goading her and insulting nonhumans. But the effect was contrary to his goals, as the Cathar lashed out, raking his face with her claws. Exar Kun would bear the scar for the rest of his biological life and would not forget the being that inflicted it. Having been caught off-guard by the slash, the Human cast Sylvar to the ground indignantly, then demanded she take up her weapon and fight him as a Jedi. When Sylvar questioned Kun's very motives as a Jedi, the man prepared to attack her, only to have his lightsaber intercepted by Master Vodo's staff. Exar Kun was disarmed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crado then tossed his own weapon to the Human, challenging him to prove his assertions concerning nonhumans. In the duel between Sylvar's master and fellow apprentice, the Krevaaki Jedi continued to use only his staff, in an effort to teach Kun a lesson in strengths and weaknesses. But Exar Kun would not allow himself to be beaten, and, calling his own lightsaber back to him using the Force, the Human defeated Master Baas with an aggressive twin-weapon style of fighting. Exar Kun then departed, declaring himself a Jedi Knight and going in search of long-forgotten Sith secrets."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Krath conflict"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Exar Kun sought his own Sith knowledge, another dark side cult was on the rise. The Krath were led by members of the Tetan elite who had traveled to Onderon and begun to dabble in the magic of the Sith; the cult and its followers had recently begun to stage attacks on the Galactic Republic and the Jedi. Master Vodo received news of a great meeting of the Jedi Order on the planet Deneba, which would address the growing problem as well as the Order's response to it. En route to Deneba, Sylvar shared moments of closeness with her mate Crado, who asked her to marry him. He expressed his desire to return to Cathar, where the pair could use the Jedi knowledge imparted to them by their master to gain notability. Sylvar evaded the proposal, telling Crado that while she was more than willing to bear his offspring, she would always remain a Jedi. Meanwhile, during the trip to Deneba, Master Vodo received intense Force-visions of Kun falling to the dark side and attempted to shield his former student with the light side. Sylvar, sensing Vodo's exertion in the Force, rushed to her master's aid; Master Vodo advised Sylvar that Exar's fall to the dark side was but the beginning of a storm that would consume the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi on Deneba did not suspect that the Krath were plotting against them even as they gathered to discuss the threat. The Jedi Masters' servant droids had been reprogrammed by the Krath to attack their owners at their true masters' signal, and a ship loaded with war droids was ready to be deployed on the planet. Master Vodo and his remaining apprentices arrived as the attack began. Sylvar quickly joined the action when she spotted a Krath war droid attempting to kidnap Vima, the daughter of Jedi Nomi Sunrider. Before Nomi could respond, Sylvar quickly beheaded the automaton and introduced herself to Nomi, who would become a good friend from this point on.

The Human, having secretly begun to study the knowledge of the Sith, sought more Jedi to join his cause, as well as an ancient Sith holocron in the possession of Master Odan-Urr. After Kun killed Odan-Urr and took possession of the holocron, he lied that the Draethos had declared him a Jedi Master and then died of natural causes. He was joined by a number of young Jedi who believed in his visions of a new Jedi Order. Crado was among those who left with Exar Kun for Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after this, rumors began to arise that the Krath were apparently being led by a Jedi in their assaults on the Republic. Master Vodo-Siosk Baas, determined to convince the Galactic Senate to allow the Jedi to investigate and deal with this threat, gathered a group of Jedi Knights to travel to the galactic capital of Coruscant. Sylvar joined her master's party, which included his former apprentices, the Jedi Shadows Dace Diath, Qrrrl Toq, and Shoaneb Culu, as well as Nomi Sunrider, the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta, and Cay Qel-Droma. Arriving on the ecumenopolis, the Jedi were quickly informed that the rumors were, indeed, true. The Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma, the brother of Cay, had been spotted leading the Krath forces.

The Republic forces, under the command of Netus, put up a strong defense, but found considerable difficulty in dealing with the Mandalorians' Basilisk war mounts. The Jedi were quick and efficient in joining Coruscant's defense. Sylvar, fighting alongside Dace Diath, deflected attacks by the Basilisks, allowing Cay to activate an aerial defense cannon while Nomi Sunrider rushed Master Vodo and the Supreme Chancellor to safety."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The party boarded a landspeeder headed for the Republic military control center, where Master Vodo and the Chancellor could gain control of the defense. However, Ulic Qel-Droma himself was also en route to the war room in order to crush the Coruscanti defense at its source. A group of Mandalorians accosted the Jedi before they could reach the command center, delaying them just long enough for Ulic to arrive. Before Master Vodo and his group reached them, Ulic's lover, the Krath sorceress Aleema Keto, arranged for Qel-Droma to be left behind, betraying him as she and Mandalore retreated with the bulk of their forces. Ulic Qel-Droma, fallen Jedi Knight and betrayer of the Republic and the Jedi Order, faced the Jedi alone once they had fought their way to the war room. Master Baas and the other Jedi present quickly disarmed Ulic, projecting a field in the Force to imprison and subdue him. Once his resistance had ended, the Jedi handed him over to Republic jurisdiction. The Chancellor promised the fallen Knight a trial, as well as a death sentence, for his crimes."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The trial of Ulic Qel-Droma"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sylvar was present on Coruscant when the trial began, and was joined by Nomi Sunrider and Cay Qel-Droma, who had rushed to the capital aboard the Nebulon Ranger to speak on behalf of their former friend. Sylvar did not share in their enthusiasm, believing that Ulic had brought his fate upon himself. As the trial proceeded, Ulic held forth in the Senate Hall, speaking out against the leadership of the Republic and prophesying the coming of a Golden Age which they would have no part in\u2014a Golden Age of the Sith. Sylvar was furious, while Cay rushed to aid his brother. At that moment, Sylvar's old rival Exar Kun arrived, with Mandalore at his side, to rescue his new apprentice. It was then confirmed that Qel-Droma was not only a fallen Jedi, but a Dark Lord of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Senate and the crowd were frozen in their seats, under the Sith spells of Exar Kun, Nomi rushed to beg Ulic to stop, and Sylvar attacked. Killing and maiming several of Kun's Massassi guards with her claws, the Cathar Jedi Knight demanded that Exar tell her what he had done with her mate Crado, who had always idolized the Human. The Sith Master, remembering the scar he still bore from his duel with her, told Sylvar that her mate was learning to become stronger than she was, and was on an errand for him. As Ulic Qel-Droma held the Jedi at bay, Exar Kun took control of the Chancellor, using the leader as a living puppet while he proclaimed the superiority and infallibility of the Sith and their ways. When Ulic told Cay that he'd either have to join him or die, Cay refused to confront his brother\u2014but someone else did not."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, Master Vodo-Siosk Baas entered the Senate Hall, challenging Qel-Droma and Kun. He came to confront his former apprentice, still trying to instill a lesson in the Human. When Exar Kun asked that Vodo join his cause, the Jedi Master refused, and Kun drew his weapon. Master Vodo fought Kun, using his humble quarter staff as usual, debating with the Sith as they dueled. Yet Kun had a surprise\u2014his lightsaber ignited from the other end, forming a saberstaff nearly unprecedented in the galaxy at the time. Exar Kun struck his older master\u2014and Sylvar's\u2014down, killing him. Sylvar immediately rushed to face the Human, only to be blown back by Kun's amplified new Force powers.

Nomi's first master, the Tchuukthai known as Thon, resided on the planet. On Ambria, Sylvar and Nomi hoped to find a much-needed respite from the war, as well as some additional training from Thon. However, Exar Kun wanted the Jedi Master dead, as part of his extensive plan to kill the aging Masters of the galaxy in order to make room for his new order. Thon's old student Oss Wilum, now possessed by Sith spirits and obedient to the Dark Lord, was sent to dispatch the Tchuukthai, and was accompanied by none other than Crado."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pair summoned hssiss, dark side monsters, from Lake Natth, and proceeded to direct the beasts to Thon's house nearby. As they came over the last ridge, Crado saw that the Master was not alone: Nomi and Vima Sunrider were there, along with his former mate, Sylvar. With little hesitation, Crado ordered that all present must die for the Sith cause, betraying the woman he'd loved. As the hssiss set upon the Jedi, Sylvar and Nomi were hard-pressed to defend themselves\u2014and Vima\u2014from the monsters. Master Thon threw himself at the beasts, tearing at them with teeth and claws. Meanwhile, Nomi used her skills at battle meditation to throw the creatures into disarray, so that Thon and Sylvar could finish them off. After the Tchuukthai Master had confronted and disarmed Oss Wilum, Sylvar was approached by Crado, who did not think she would strike him. This was not so; Sylvar viciously slashed the face of her mate, declaring him a traitor and murderer for helping Exar Kun, who had gone on to kill their master.

Crado, unaware that his mission would effectively be a suicide, joined Aleema Keto in command of the Sith forces attached to the attack. The mission was successful, and the Republic and Jedi pursuing the Sith forces involved were destroyed\u2014along with the Sith ships themselves and their commanders. Crado, along with Aleema, was dead.

Critically injured, Sylvar was unable to prevent the Sith Lord from departing. Ulic Qel-Droma, after having realized his error when he killed his own brother Cay, was caught, however.

His living body perished along with most of the life on Yavin 4, but his spirit sought escape.

Arriving at a kiltik nesting mound, Sylvar and Tott Doneeta entered, igniting their lightsabers as they detected the insects drawing near. Quickly cutting their way through the colony's sentries, the Jedi arrived at the central chamber, and beheld the massive queen as well as her equally massive accompaniment of guardians. Sylvar nearly lost all control, declaring that she would kill all the kiltik present, and then doing so. As she continued to hack away at the dead bodies, Tott called for her to stop.
