A swarm of those creatures dwelled in the secret temple built by the Jedi Master Lucien Draay to hide a Sith artifact known as the \"Gauntlet of Kressh the Younger\". They had formed a column around the Gauntlet and had become overwhelmed by the power of the dark side of the Force. After centuries of prolonged exposure to the artifact's energy, the sarls had become nearly invulnerable: their armored body could sustain both blaster bolts and lightsaber strikes. Additionally, their twin mandibles were strong enough to pierce through plastoid armor. At the time of the Clone Wars, the Jedi Master B'ink Utrila confronted the sarls in the temple with her Padawan Rennax Omani and a few clone troopers, but they were forced to pull back when confronted with the bugs' near-invulnerability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
