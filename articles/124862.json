The camp was run from a command center that was surrounded by five farms in its upper section. The upper section of the camp also held a spaceport in the north and a power core and an ore processing center in the west. The midsection of the camp had an animal nursery, two prefab shelters and another power core. The lower section of the camp near the entrance had a food processing center, a carbon processing center, and another prefab shelter. The western side of the camp contained a significant number of trees, with a clearing through them leading to a Jedi holocron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The entire camp was surrounded by walls, with one gate at the south and another later added on the north eastern stretch. The eastern wall was bordered by a river. Another camp led by the Wookiee Chewbacca was located to the south, and a listening array belonging to the Trade Federation was later found in the east. The camp had access to various resources which were harvested by the nine Wookiee workers residing there, including significant ore deposits, nerfs, and muja fruit bushes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The camp was built between 39 BBY and 36 BBY, during the Wookiee colonization of Alaris Prime, of which Shoran was a leader. The Wookiees were engaged in a war with the Trade Federation, who had launched an illegal colonization effort, and the camp was built in what was believed to be a safe area. At Chewbacca's camp, the Wookiee's Jedi advisor, Qui-Gon Jinn, lectured him on the benefit of having allies and instructed him to build a spaceport. After Chewbacca's workers completed the spaceport, the Wookiees were able to access Holonet technology, which allowed them to find Shoran's camp. Chewbacca then built Corellian HoverFreighters at the spaceport and sent them to Shoran's camp to exchange resources, which Shoran also did. Afterward, Shoran found the Jedi holocron in his camp and informed Jinn, who had Chewbacca build a Jedi temple in which to store it. Jinn sent his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi into Shoran's camp to retrieve the holocron. After Kenobi passed through its gates, Shoran spotted a group of Trade Federation battle droids sent by the droid LUH-989 to attack Chewbacca's camp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shoran warned Chewbacca and Jinn of the attack, which was fought off by Chewbacca and his Wookiee soldiers. Afterward, Shoran requested 100 nova crystals from Chewbacca to help recover from the attack, which Jinn and Chewbacca agreed to. Shoran sent ore to Chewbacca's camp in return. Later, scouts from Shoran's camp discovered the Trade Federation listening array, and Chewbacca suggested the Wookiees destroy it. One heavy bowcaster trooper from Shoran's camp began attacking the sentry posts at the entrance of the array but was killed by the droids guarding it. Chewbacca's forces marched through Shoran's camp towards the listening array and destroyed it, joined by Shoran."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shoran's camp was first mentioned in Prima Games' strategy guide, released on November 7, 2001 for the LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, which was released on November 11, 2001. The camp appeared in the sixth level of the Wookiee tutorial campaign, \"Allies and Jedi.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The camp serves as a method of teaching the player the mechanics of working with teams, particularly through the use of spaceports. At the start of the level, only the spaceport is visible to the player, who is instructed to research the Holonet transceiver at their own spaceport to see the rest of the camp. For most of the level, the camp only has one gate at the south, but after retrieving the holocron another gate appears in the north-east wall, allowing the player to attack the listening array. Unused audio files from the level portray Shoran assembling forces in his camp in preparation to attack the array, with Jinn suggesting that the player send any newly created units to join them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
