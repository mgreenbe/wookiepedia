Led by actor Tetran Cowall, posing as the vanished Baron Soontir Fel, former commander of the genuine 181st Imperial Fighter Group, the impostor 181st was composed half of organic pilots and half of droid-piloted wingman fighters accompanying the organic pilots. The droid fighters were packed with explosives, and it was Zsinj's plan to lure New Republic commander Wedge Antilles of Rogue Squadron, known to be seeking out Fel, into investigating the unit and then destroy Rogue Squadron with the flying bombs. Antilles and the Rogues ultimately foiled the scheme."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
