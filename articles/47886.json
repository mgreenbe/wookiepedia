During the festival, Ewoks would give gifts of camby berries to one another to demonstrate trust and acceptance. Tribe members would also prepare meals, sing, and dance. One popular beverage served during the celebration was Chak juice. Although primarily celebrated on Endor for obvious reasons, it also was celebrated on other planets, including Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one such celebration in 1 ABY, Queen Kylantha of Naboo invited Chief Chirpa and his tribe to visit her city. Chirpa accepted and traveled to Theed, along with the shaman, Logray. As news of the Galactic Civil War had not yet reached the Ewoks, the pair were equally welcoming to Rebels and Imperials alike. The second annual celebration for the festival on Naboo occurred at the Oceanside city of Kaadara."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During subsequent annual events, the Ewoks once again celebrated across the galaxy, this time in Tyrena, Kaadara, and the Southern Ewok Lake Village on Endor. During these celebrations, spacers were tasked with participating in matchmaking between couples, bundling love cards for Ewok children, and helping a disillusioned love sage rediscover the true meaning of love. By completing these tasks, spacers were awarded Chak hearts which could be turned in for a variety of gifts. Spacers also made an effort to find an Ewok named Kyoopid, honoring him during this time of love."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Festival of Love was a live event held annually in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
