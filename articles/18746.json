Their numbers consisted of those that crossed the line even in a criminal society, lost everything and had no place to go, or those that outraged their Hutt employers. These individuals were thus exiled into the planet's swamps, where most died quickly, though some managed to survive, learning to endure in the swamps using respirators to decrease toxic gas inhalation, medicinal compounds to counteract absorbed chemicals, and use of specially treated clothes to alter their scent. These pariahs often carried blasters for self-defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, they were unable to stop the changes that came with living in the heavily polluted area. They began to suffer from paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations, becoming known as \"bog people\" among the planet's locals. They were, for the most part, not organized, but tended to gravitate into small communities, or \"packs\", while seeking out new exiles. Encounters with them were almost always violent, and these outcasts targeted anyone in the hopes of obtaining their valuables."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many Bog People dwelt in the Evocii swamp outside Jiguuna."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
