She and Yoponek embarked on a wandering year prior to their final education, choosing to travel the Chiss Ascendancy. When Haplif of the Agbui attempted to study the Chiss in order to spark a civil war within the Ascendancy, he encountered Yomie and Yoponek, offering them passage aboard his starship. He claimed it would save the two Chiss funds and provide guidance for the Agbui, but in reality wished to learn about the Ascendancy to sow the seeds of civil war. Haplif secured Yomie's consent to journey with the Agbui by giving her a beautiful nyix brooch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their travels, Yomie recorded information about Haplif and his people in her cloud diary. Yomie eventually deduced that the Agbui were manipulating them and that they were telepathic, forcing Haplif to kill her.
