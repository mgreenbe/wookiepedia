An anti-capital ship proton beam cannon was also constructed on the surface of Dubrillion during the height of the Galactic Civil War. Capital ship-scaled cannons were a feature of both the Eclipse-class and Sovereign-class Super Star Destroyer models. These guns could sear entire continents in a moment, but not pulverize an entire planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Empire's height, a much smaller proton beam cannon was mounted on the modified Imperial-class Star Destroyer, the Accuser. Decades later, Booster Terrik had his private Star Destroyer Errant Venture fitted with a similar weapon said to be based on the Darksaber project. A fighter-scale proton beam cannon was fitted to the Lancet Aerial Artillery vehicles used by the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
