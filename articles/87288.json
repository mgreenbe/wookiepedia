The devices had once been common, operating on stygium crystals mined from the planet Aeten II in the Dreighton Nebula. Eventually, the Aeten II mines ran dry and cloaking technology became increasingly rare.

Under Batch's command, the Empire began fitting modified V38 assault fighters with the technology at the facility on Imdaar Alpha, with the aim of producing a fleet of the cloaked starfighters. In addition to the stygium, the fighters required a supply of oridium fuel, and the Empire established a mining facility in the Belt of Arah to extract and process the ore. To protect his investment, Batch requisitioned the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Terror, under the command of Admiral Sarn.

The entire fleet of TIE phantoms was destroyed in the process except for one, in which the Rebels made their escape. For his incompetence, Admiral Sarn was executed by Vader before the Dark Lord escaped the Rebel attack.
