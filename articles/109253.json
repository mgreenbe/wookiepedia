Often these are small crystals with specific applications. The smaller of the two stars that formed the Crseih system was condensed into a huge quantum crystal. Its energy emissions were so strong that they eventually warped the very fabric of the Force. This, when combined with the suffering induced by Hethrir in the prisons on Crseih Station, caused the being Waru to be pulled into the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
