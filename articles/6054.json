In 19 BBY, following the rise of the Empire and the fall of the Jedi Order, Brenne oversaw the alterations made to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. All traces of the Jedi were wiped, and the temple was transformed into Emperor Palpatine's Imperial Palace.

Aboard the starship, Brenne and Roggo pondered what aesthetic would best suit the Dark Lord's fortress. Brenne initially believed Vader would prefer a minimalist approach to his castle, but the elegant design of Vader's J-type 327 Nubian starship made Brenne doubt her conclusion. An ancient, \"sinister\" mask aboard the ship caught the eye of Brenne and Roggo.

In a panic Brenne reached for her blaster, but she was quickly disarmed by the Dark Lord, who reiterate that the Emperor had placed her and Roggo under Vader's authority. The three landed on the Gahenn Plains near a Sith cave Vader had previously visited. The once pristine mirror finished hull of the Nubian starship had melted to a crisp as a result of Vader's hazardous approach.
