They tried to rob Princess Leia Organa, who was visiting Delaya to help the Alderaanian refugee efforts, but were dissuaded by Ferus Olin, a former Jedi.

The day before Alderaan was destroyed by the Galactic Empire's first Death Star, Lan went to see a smashball tournament on Delaya\u2014Alderaan's sister planet\u2014with his friends Mazi and Jez. Despite Lan's young age, Mazi was able to convince Lan's parents to allow him to go. Lan's mother, who worried a lot, thought that the three of them were too young to go on their own. However, his father was easily convinced and the three friends made the trip."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Alderaan was destroyed, Lan and his companions were left to fend for themselves, surviving on Delaya by becoming thieves. Ferus Olin, a former Jedi and another survivor of Alderaan, tried to dissuade them from turning to crime by giving them various small jobs to earn credits. When Princess Leia Organa made a visit to Delaya to assist the refugee effort and recruit new members on behalf of the Rebel Alliance, Lan, along with Mazi and Jez, attempted to rob Organa. Han Solo, who was one of the individuals accompanying Organa at that time, tried to placate the orphans but was unsuccessful. The standoff was broken when Olin arrived at the scene and disarmed Mazi\u2014who was holding Organa at knife-point with a vibroblade\u2014by shooting the vibroblade away with his blaster. After being told by Olin that he would stop giving them errands if they continued getting into trouble, Lan and his friends ran away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Organa was captured by a rogue Alderaanian faction that blamed her for the destruction of their world, Lan and his group provided Solo and Organa's other companions the location of the ringleader's hideout. The information eventually led Solo and the others to successfully rescue Organa from the Empire, to whom she was handed over by the faction for a reward. Olin surmised that the orphans, who were willing to do anything for credits and knew where the faction ringleaders were hiding, might have been hired by the faction to rob and capture Organa previously. After Organa's rescue, Lan and his friends spoke with a Rebel recruiter and decided to join the Alliance as soldiers. They eagerly told Solo\u2014whom they had grown quite fond of\u2014the news, hoping to impress him. The orphans were scheduled to be shipped that night and Solo wished them luck, although he thought Lan and his companions were too young to serve in the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his young age, Lan displayed bravery and loyalty to his friends. When Han Solo confronted Lan and his friends on Deyala, Lan, along with Jez, refused to leave Mazi, who was in Solo's grasp, behind. It was Solo's observation that they were terrified of him and were putting on a brave front, which earned his grudging admiration. As a result of Alderaan being destroyed, Lan and his friends became orphans overnight and had to look out for each other. Mazi became the unofficial leader due to his age, and Lan, being the youngest of the three, started looking up to Mazi with something close to hero worship. When Solo didn't turn them in to the authorities for trying to rob Organa, the orphans began yearning to impress the smuggler."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lan was a character created by author Alex Wheeler for the 2008 novel Rebel Force: Hostage, the second volume in the Star Wars: Rebel Force series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
