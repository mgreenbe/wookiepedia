Fett came to the facility in search of information from the plant's owner, a man named Groff Haugg, on Komari Vosa, the leader of a secretive criminal cult known as the Bando Gora. After fighting many of the facility's Guineo and Draag guards Fett found that Montross, another Mandalorian bounty hunter, had managed to reach Haugg first and had killed Haugg by freezing him in carbonite after obtaining information from him. However, Haugg lied to Montross due to his fear of Vosa, and Fett was able to discover one of Haugg's associates, a Twi'lek Senator named Connus Trell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
