For this reason those Felucians who showed interest and exceptional aptitude in the Force were usually trained in ways of shamanism whether they wanted to or not, because shamans could not risk a potential powerful Force-user growing up among them without receiving a proper training to resist the lure of the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When pressed into battle, they were capable of defending themselves but often attempted to flee such engagements in order to use a combination of Force talents and their innate camouflage abilities to seemingly disappear to a safer distance from their enemies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Numerous shamans were present on Felucia to defend Jedi Master Shaak Ti from Darth Vader's assassin.
