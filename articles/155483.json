Alongside a group of fellow workers, the Wookiee gathered resources such as food, carbon, nova crystals, and ore to sustain a base on Alaris Prime.

Along with two other Wookiees, the worker went to a base to collect resources under instructions from Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who was sent by the Jedi Council to oversee the colonization effort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The workers began their task by harvesting food from muja fruit bushes close to the command center, the only building in the base. The workers soon had gathered enough food to allow the base to support a fourth worker to join them, and once even more food was collected, another worker arrived at the base. Jinn then instructed the workers to practice a drill in case they were attacked by gundarks, a predatory species on Alaris Prime. The drill required the workers to cease activity and take refuge in the command center. After the drill was completed, the worker and the other Wookiees were told to focus their attention on gathering carbon, a resource collected from trees that could be turned into duraplast and used as building material."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, one of the leaders of the colonization of Alaris Prime, Chewbacca, arrived at the command center. Simultaneously, four gundarks attacked the base, forcing the worker and the other Wookiees to take shelter in the command center as they had previously practiced. With assistance from Chewbacca and using the building's turret system, the workers were able to fight off the gundarks and kill them. Chewbacca then explored the nearby area, finding deposits of nova crystals, which could be used as a form of currency in the galaxy, and ore, a resource that could be processed into durasteel. The worker took part in gathering these resources for the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiee wore a belt and a piece of orange clothing that covered the worker's torso and part of the the worker's legs.

The worker then appeared in the game as well as its 2002 expansion, Clone Campaigns. This worker is featured in the second level of the Wookiee tutorial campaign, \"Gathering Resources,\" in which the Wookiee is one of three generic worker units that the player starts off with and uses throughout the level. This particular Wookiee stands directly in front of the command center when the level begins. The player may determine the order in which the workers collect the resources, so this article follows the order corresponding with Qui-Gon Jinn's instructions. The Wookiee's gender was not identified in the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
