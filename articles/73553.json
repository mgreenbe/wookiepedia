However, Kalesh is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. According to the game's creature database, this character would have spawned under either one of two Interchange Files, including the \"tatooine_jabba_thief\" template, or the \"tatooine_jabba_thug\" template. The former would have depicted Kalesh as a Human female, and the latter would have depicted Kalesh as a male Zabrak. An emulated depiction pulled from these two Interchange File Formats reveals what Kalesh would have looked like if added to the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
