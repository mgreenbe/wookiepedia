While the first prototype was unarmed, the second was and was able to provide cover for the Verpine corvette Shantipole and the shuttle Falcon which would pick up Admiral Ackbar. The prototype, along with some X-wings managed to destroy all of the corvettes and transports, allowing the Shantipole to escape.
