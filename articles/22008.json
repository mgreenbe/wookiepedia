Shortly after the Black Fleet Crisis, General Garm Bel Iblis used a pair of CC-7700 frigates in an attempt to capture Admiral Daala. Daala was able to escape after desperately ramming her flagship, Scylla, into one of the frigates. However, this action severely damaged Scylla's navigational systems, and Daala's jump into hyperspace was a blind one.[source?] As of 44 ABY, at least one such frigate, the Fireborn, was part of the Galactic Alliance Navy. It was destroyed in an act of sabotage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CC-7700 frigate was one of several new ships created for the PC game Star Wars: Rebellion.
