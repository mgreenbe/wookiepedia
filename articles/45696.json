Like all Imperial Gozanti-class ships, it could transport either four TIE/ln space superiority starfighters, four All Terrain Defense Pods or even two All Terrain Armored Transports on underside-mounted docking clamps. Its hull was painted a light gray, in keeping with the Empire's preference for muted colors. After it became a rebel ship under the name of Evac One, its appearance remained mostly unchanged save for an orange starbird painted at the starboard side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was known to the Empire as Transport Ship 63378. Five years before the Battle of Yavin,[source?] it was stolen by the Spectres to rescue their leader, Kanan Jarrus, from the Mustafar system. Sabine Wren made a distraction at a Lothal hangar while her fellow rebels absconded with the cruiser. They then added their previously stolen TIE fighter in order to enter the system. They rendezvoused with the Star Destroyer Sovereign for the rescue, leaving their droid C1-10P to pilot it. After rescuing Jarrus, they fled the Star Destroyer, but C1-10P had left with the transport. He then returned leading a rebel fleet, and together they escaped the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was later used by the larger rebellion, seeing action as an evacuation ship under the callsign Evac One, such as the skirmish on Imvur."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Transport Ship 63378 first appeared in \"Fire Across the Galaxy,\" the finale of the first season of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was later confirmed to be the same ship as Evac One by the author Martin Fisher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
