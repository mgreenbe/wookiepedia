When the Jewel's tractor beam captured the ship of Rebel agent Kyle Katarn, the Gamorrean and another escorted Katarn to the ship's beast pit, which held Jabba's favorite Kell dragon. After Katarn took part in an ill-fated discussion with Jabba the Hutt over a hologram, the two Gamorreans pushed Katarn into the pit. The agent was stronger than they realized, however, when Katarn killed the dragon with his bare hands. Katarn eventually rescued his partner, Jan Ors, and together they escaped the Star Jewel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
