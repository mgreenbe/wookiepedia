Small enough to mount on a BTL-S8 K-wing assault starfighter, lob bombs fired in ballistic arcs, allowing targets to be hit on the other side of planetary curvatures while not exposing the starfighter to enemy fire. The K-wings of the 24th Bombardment Squadron used lob bombs to destroy the hypervelocity cannon on Bessimir's alpha moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
