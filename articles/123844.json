In The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, Shalini's reason for entrusting the disk to the Jedi is to transmit its information \"back to the Republic.\" In Jude Watson's Jedi Quest: The Moment of Truth, nowhere does it state that the Republic was even advised of the disk. Skywalker, as a Tomo Camp prisoner stripped of all clothing and possessions, including his comlink, utility belt, and lightsaber, had no means to communicate the information to anyone in the galaxy except through his Master's rescue, reclamation of his belongings, and, after fighting their way through a nest of gundarks to secure transport, racing to get the disk (just in time) to the governing officials of Typha-Dor\u2014the sole basis and intent of Shalini's giving the disk: to provide Typha-Dor with its only hope of escaping invasion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
