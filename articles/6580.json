Born to the slave Shmi Skywalker in 41.9 BBY, Anakin was conceived by midi-chlorians, the symbiotic organisms that allowed individuals to touch the Force, and he and his mother were brought to the desert planet of Tatooine to be the slaves of Gardulla the Hutt. They soon ended up as the property of the Toydarian Watto, and Skywalker exhibited exceptional piloting skills and a reputation for being able to build and repair anything even at a young age. In 32 BBY, Skywalker encountered the Jedi Qui-Gon Jin and Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and he helped them secure the parts they needed for their starship by winning the Boonta Eve Classic podracing event\u2014only to learn that he had also won his freedom in doing so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reluctantly leaving his mother behind, Skywalker accompanied Jin and his group to the Republic's capital of Coruscant and participated in the Battle of Naboo, helping to free Amidala's homeworld from the armies of the Trade Federation. While Jin was killed during the battle, Jin's student Obi-Wan Kenobi followed Jin's wishes and took on Skywalker as his Padawan, and much of the Jedi Council believed that Skywalker was the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy: one who would bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith Order. Skywalker and Kenobi had a number of adventures during the Padawan's decade of training to become a Jedi, but as the Separatist Crisis threatened to tear the Republic apart in 22 BBY, Skywalker was reunited with Amidala when he was assigned to protect her from assassins. The two grew close during the course of the assignment, though they were caught up in the Battle of Geonosis and the beginning of the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Losing an arm during the fighting, Skywalker received a cybernetic replacement, and he and Amidala were secretly married in the days after the battle, despite the Jedi Code's restrictions on romantic attachments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, which raged for the next three years, Skywalker was granted the rank of Jedi Knight and became known to the public as the \"Hero with No Fear.\" Taking on the Togruta Ahsoka Tano as his apprentice, Skywalker fought alongside Kenobi and his fellow Jedi in scores of battles, and his friendship with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine deepened despite the Jedi Order's wariness of Palpatine's rapid acquisition of further powers during the course of the war. Throughout the Clone Wars, Skywalker's anger and sense of loss pushed him ever closer to the dark side of the Force, and his visions of Amidala dying in childbirth in 19 BBY made him desperate to find a way to save his wife. Palpatine, who was in fact the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, manipulated Skywalker into becoming his apprentice with the promise of saving Amidala, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader as Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire and eradicated the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader and Kenobi clashed on Mustafar after Vader attacked his wife in the belief that she had betrayed him, and the newly christened Sith Lord was left limbless and ravaged by fire at the end of their battle.

The Sith Lord trained a number of secret apprentices and Dark Jedi, though his plans to overthrow his master had not advanced far when the Galactic Civil War erupted between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic in 2 BBY. In 0 BBY, the Death Star\u2014the Empire's greatest superweapon\u2014was destroyed by a young Rebel pilot despite Vader's efforts, and Vader became obsessed with discovering the pilot's identity, only to learn that it was Luke Skywalker: his own son, born before Amidala's death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader continued to pursue both Skywalker and the Alliance over the next three years, finally luring his son into a trap on the mining colony of Cloud City in 3 ABY where the two dueled.

When Darth Sidious learned of Skywalker's existence, he set in motion his own plans to recruit Skywalker and thereby replace Vader, but Skywalker surrendered himself to Imperial forces on the forest moon of Endor in 4 ABY in hopes of redeeming his father and turning him back to the light side. In a final duel on the second Death Star as the Battle of Endor raged around them, Skywalker and Vader fought each other, and Vader refused his son's attempts to redeem him, learning that Skywalker had a twin sister named Leia in the process. Skywalker defeated his father but refused to kill him, and when Sidious attempted to kill the young man, Vader\u2014moved by his son's love\u2014abandoned the dark side and sacrificed himself to destroy the Emperor, fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One.

He was able to resurrect the Bith Darth Venamis (whom he had been using as a test subject for years) using only the power of the Force. Using his newfound power to heal his own body, Plagueis decided to take his powers further and reached out to the midi-chlorians across the galaxy in order to gain dominance over them, but the Force resisted his efforts and refused. In response, the midi-chlorians acted of their own accord and conceived a child within the Human slave Shmi Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Life as a slave"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human male Anakin Skywalker was born to Shmi Skywalker in 42 BBY (7:4 BrS).

During the flight, Anakin had premonitions of podracing, and he saw a vision of himself as an older man, racing across the flats of Tatooine. He was awoken from his dream by his mother, who carried him out of the ship when they landed, and they were lined up before Gardulla and her aides."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, when a shot rang out in a nearby alleyway, Skywalker did not duck for cover like the others in the area and instead watched as an Arcona slave rushed through the area to escape his pursuers. The Arcona's slave transmitter exploded moments later, killing the slave and showing Skywalker what would happen should he ever try to escape. Shortly afterward, Skywalker was implanted with his own transmitter. In the city of Mos Espa, the Skywalkers were forced to share quarters with six other slaves while they were owned by Gardulla, but the fact that he was coupled with his mother allowed Skywalker to endure slavery with relative good humor. Though Anakin was not altogether fond of Tatooine, he set about learning as much about the desert world as possible. He listened to traveling spacers and Gardulla's attendants, learning about the history and function of the planet in the galaxy. He heard of the Tusken Raiders, apparently bloodthirsty savages that roamed the wastelands, Jawas, and krayt dragons, but the element that interested the boy the most was Podracing, descriptions of which matched his premonition. He tired quickly of Tatooine, however, and one day hoped to visit Coruscant, the galactic capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While he was a slave of Gardulla, he became friends with fellow slaves Kitster Chanchani Banai and Pala Kwi'teksa, a Human and Twi'lek. Though the three were eventually sold to other masters, they remained friends, as they all lived in Mos Espa. Several months after his arrival on Tatooine, while repairing a vaporator outside Gardulla's residence, Anakin decided to take the initiative, and modify the device. His handiwork was observed by Watto, a Toydarian junk dealer who frequently gambled with Gardulla on podraces. Impressed, the Toydarian gambled for custody of the Skywalkers and won, becoming the pair's owners two days later. Skywalker began working at Watto's Shop as a mechanic, and Watto reluctantly allowed the two to move into a small hovel on Slave Quarters Row in the city of Mos Espa, though he intended to quarter the rest of the slaves he intended to purchase with the Skywalkers when he could afford to buy more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At an early age, Skywalker exhibited signs of Force-sensitivity; he could sense things before they happened, occasionally sensed the emotions of others, and had exceptional piloting skills which Watto put to use when he made the child race his podracer\u2014the first Human to survive and excel at the sport. Only Shmi knew of her son's abilities, and by the age of nine, Anakin was strong, quick, an expert driver, and an expert at building things. A child prodigy, Anakin excelled at mathematics and engineering. Skywalker did not mind working for Watto as a mechanic, as he enjoyed building and repairing machinery and droids, and his room was filled with a workbench, tools, and various projects in different stages of completion. Skywalker always had something to do at Watto's junk shop; with his mechanical aptitude, he was often called upon to fix the unfixable. Watto kept the Skywalkers in line by threatening to let other slaves share their hovel, should they disobey him. Over the years, Skywalker became familiar with the Mos Espa locals, picked up alien languages, and would often familiarize himself with the controls of starships, by \"practicing\" with derelict cockpits found in the junkyard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even at a young age, Skywalker had a reputation for being able to repair or build anything. Around 34 BBY, Skywalker began to build both a podracer from the pieces he could salvage from the junkyards, restoring a junked podracer cockpit and a pair of Radon-Ulzer 620C racing engines. Knowing Watto would try to take it if it was valuable, Skywalker purposely kept the podracer in a state of seeming disrepair underneath a tarp. Watto gave Shmi an aeromagnifier that she used to clean computer memory devices, allowing the Skywalkers to have a modest income, but Anakin refused to give up on his dreams of freedom, making plans to create a scanner that could locate the transmitter in his body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 34 BBY, when Skywalker was seven, Watto traveled to Anchorhead in order to bid on parts from a recent crash, leaving the boy with a long list of chores to do. However, Skywalker was able to program the droids around the shop to finish the chores by midday, allowing him to take his pack that his mother had filled with meat pies and fruit and meet with his friend Amee for a picnic. In a small canyon near the city that had a strange tree with flickering leaves, the two ate Shmi's meat pies and turnovers made by Amee's mother Hala, but when they returned to Mos Espa, they found the city almost empty. From their neighbors, the two children learned that the pirate Krayn had conducted a slave raid, capturing a number of slaves and overriding their transmitters with their own. Terrified for his mother's safety, Anakin raced home but was relieved to find Shmi safe and sound at their house\u2014unlike Amee's mother Hala. When the boy noticed Amee and Hala's master, Yor Millto, dismissing the abduction of Hala as a \"nuisance,\" Skywalker resolved to remember every moment of that day, save the look of terror on his own mother's face, in order to fuel his ongoing struggle as a slave, and his eventual quest to free slaves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 33 BBY, Skywalker met a retired pilot who told him about the moons of Iego and the angels that supposedly lived there. That year, Skywalker was searching through Watto's junkyard when he came across an ancient battle droid. Curious, the boy dragged it behind Watto's shop and then once Watto was gone hooked it up a power source. The droid was too rusted to move, but its holoprojecter was able to display a damaged and chaotic recording of a battle that involved the Sith. Disturbed by the recording, Skywalker headed home later that day and encountered the pilot, who panicked and thought that the boy was saying the Sith had returned when Skywalker questioned him about the Sith. The pilot explained the history of the Sith Order and the New Sith Wars, a thousand-year conflict between the Sith and the Jedi, though the pilot also noted the rumors that some Sith had survived their defeat in the conflict."}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "The Ghostling children"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker continued to race for Watto, frequently encountering the Dug racer Sebulba and losing to him, as the Dug was prone to cheating. One afternoon in 32 BBY, Skywalker was working in Watto's shop when Banai arrived and told his friend about the arrival of Sebulba and another racer named Gasgano in the spaceport, and Banai was able to convince Watto to let Skywalker investigate by telling the Toydarian about a mysterious crate that Sebulba had brought on his freighter. The two joined the growing crowd at Mos Espa's spaceport to watch the two racers' freighters unload. Studying Gasgano's podracer, Skywalker could instinctively sense that nothing was new or important about the changes Gasgano had made, but Sebulba's podracer drew his attention, and he soon noticed the new Kuat 40-Z stabilizers that had been installed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Skywalker's friend Kwi'teksa was uninterested in his discovery, and the other children nearby gathered to listen as she told them how she had been sold to the pirate Lord Tantos so that Tantos could train her as an assassin. Angry and saddened, Skywalker questioned Kwi'teksa as to Tantos's location so that he could go study Tantos and try and figure out a way to help his friend, but he suddenly realized that he had failed to investigate the crate when it was moved to a secure warehouse nearby. Kwi'teksa and the other children then served as a distraction to lure away the Gamorrean guards at the warehouse door, allowing Skywalker and Banai to slip inside and look at the crate, which they soon realized was an energy cage that was holding captured children. One of the children, Princess Arawynne, told the two boys that they were Ghostlings from the planet Datar and begged for their help, but Skywalker was unwilling to do so until she stated that the Ghostlings had not yet been implanted with transmitters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Dug Khiss entered the warehouse at that point and opened fire on the two boys, who were wearing hooded cloaks and who he thought were trying to free the slaves. Banai and Skywalker fled into the darkness of the warehouse and escaped via another entrance, and the two returned to Watto and told him of their findings about Sebulba's pod\u2014though Skywalker did not explain in detail about the Ghostlings. Dismissing Banai, Watto then ordered Skywalker to head out into the Jundland Wastes, where he was to barter with a tribe of Jawas\u2014scavengers that were one of Tatooine's two native species. Taking his sandskimmer out into the Jundland Wastes, Skywalker reached the towering rock known as the Market after a few hours, where hundreds of the sandcrawlers that the Jawas used to traverse Tatooine's deserts were parked in the shadow of the monolith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Searching through the endless array of junk that the Jawas had laid out on the sand, Skywalker found the items he needed within an hour and negotiated a good price, though he decided to wait until nightfall before heading back to Mos Espa. In order to preserve his money and buy a present for Kwi'teksa before she left Tatooine, Skywalker settled for a hubba gourd to satisfy his hunger and thirst, and then he began exploring the junkyard in order to find a present. However, he was drawn to a Jawa who was offering a large Radon-Ulzer podracer engine, one that Skywalker believed he could use to repair his podracer, but the Jawa insisted on selling it for cash. When Skywalker was heading back to his sandskimmer, he noticed an old Jawa who was offering a pile of random items, and his attention was drawn to an ancient-looking cube that was small enough to fit in his hand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Studying the device, Skywalker noticed a number of pictures on the cube's sides, including two Jedi Knights battling each other, a star map, and a lamp with a knife blade through it\u2014a symbol of forbidden knowledge. Unnerved by the darkness that he could sense in the cube, Skywalker was about to set it down when the Jawa offered to sell it for three wupiupi, which was the exact amount that Skywalker had in his pocket. Despite his reservations, the boy purchased the cube and headed back to Mos Espa, though he was unable to open it through any means. He was surprised to find his mother still awake and working on a maintenance droid when he arrived, and Shmi explained that she was helping her sick friend Matta finish her quota of repairs so that she would not be sold by her master Dengula. Anakin stayed up with his mother to finish the droid, though he continued to think about the Ghostling children and what he could do to help both them and Kw'teksa as the night went on and as he went to sleep."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following day, Banai and the Bothan child Dorn, both of whom were slaves of Gardulla, came to him with Pala and told him how they had hacked into Gardulla's computer network to learn that the Hutt intended to use the Ghostlings as lawn ornaments in her underground pleasure garden. Disgusted by Gardulla's disregard for how the Ghostlings would die in less than a year in those conditions, Skywalker agreed to help his friends break the Ghostlings out of Gardulla's dungeons. Donning Jawa robes and disguises, the three approached Gardulla's fortress on their sandskimmers, taking advantage of the dusk shadows to hide them, and Kitster led them to a narrow chasm that allowed them to reach the walls of the fortress unseen. An enormous cliffborer worm attacked them as they passed through the chasm, though the three escaped unharmed and reached the fortress, which they infiltrated through a ventilation grate in the outer wall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, their plans went awry when Kitster was forced to stay with Gardulla the Hutt in the fortress's pool room, forcing Skywalker and the others to find their own way to the dungeons, and Dorn went ahead to scout around while Skywalker and Kiw'teksa stayed behind. When Kitster avoided being eaten by Gardulla, the fortress was thrown into chaos, and Skywalker and Kiw'teksa fled deeper into the dungeons when a Gamorrean guard pursued them\u2014but Skywalker was unaware that his current route was taking them straight to the security control room. Skywalker managed to prevent the security chief from setting off the alarm by using his ion blaster, and Kiw'teksa closed the door just before the chief shot at him, causing the blaster bolt to ricochet and strike the man."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The four children rendezvoused at the slave infirmary, but when Dorn opened the infirmary, they were confronted by an enormous Abyssin whom Skywalker was able to convince to leave, as he claimed that they were replacement guards for the Ghostlings. However, the four accidentally locked themselves in the infirmary, and Arawynne came up with a plan to use a box of bomb transmitters to blow open the door. Taking the rest of the transmitters, Skywalker and the others led the Ghostlings through the fortress to the open hangar, but the young slaves soon realized that they needed to hide the children and come back for them later, so Banai hid the Ghostlings in Gardulla's pleasure garden. The four slaves then snuck out of the fortess alone, with Skywalker using the transmitters to destroy the passage and a seeker droid that was pursuing them with a group of battle droids, and they then headed back to Mos Espa and their homes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next day, Watto berated Skywalker for his lethargy, and the boy showed his owner the box he had bought at the Jawa market the previous day. Watto allowed Skywalker to go home and take a nap, but on his way, he encountered Banai, Dorn, and Kiw'teksa, who told him that Gardulla's security had a sample of Kiw'teksa's skin and would soon identify her as one of the perpetrators of the break-in. The old woman Jira brought the four of them into her apartment and began to scold them for trying to free the slaves, but told them that she knew someone who might take the Ghostlings off-world for a high price. Skywalker then offered to make a signal jammer so that Kiw'teksa could evade capture, and he split up with his friends to head back to Watto's in order to make the jammer. As he was heading back to his friend in the market, Skywalker had a strange sense that he was being followed, and Dorn confirmed his suspicions by pulling him aside and pointing out a Sakiyan tracker with a seeker droid who was searching for him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Donning a Jawa robe, Skywalker hid in a crowd of Jawas while Dorn distracted the hunter Djas Puhr and his partner, Sebulba, and Kiw'teksa sent him toward the podrace hangar before she disabled the seeker droid with a bucket of ganno juice that blocked its olfactory sensors. Grabbing his goggles from Watto's podracer, he heeded Banai's advice and stole Sebulba's podracer as a getaway vehicle, dodging the seeker droid's stun darts and destroying it by catching it between the podracer's energy binders. The reinforced podracer was able to smash straight through the partially open hangar doors, catching the Dug Khiss on one of the stabilizer fins as Skywalker struggled to slow down. To prevent the Dug from reaching him and Banai in the cockpit, Skywalker toggled a random lever that caused the engine to vent fire, sending the Dug flying."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Sebulba began to pursue the two in Brant Rumble's podracer, and when Sebulba prepared to ram the podracer and kill the boys, Skywalker gave Banai the signal jammer and let him leap off the vehicle before he tried to open the throttles and escape. When they responded slowly, Skywalker realized that the reinforced engines Sebulba used as battering rams meant that he could not rely on speed alone, so a smaller and faster vehicle would be able to beat Sebulba. Evading Sebulba's blaster shots, Skywalker realized that the Dug was trying to protect his own podracer, and he tossed Sebulba's own goggles and hydrospanner towards Brant Rumble's podracer\u2014where they were promptly sucked into the engine and caused massive damage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the chaos, Skywalker escaped and returned to Jira's apartment that evening, where Banai, Dorn, and Jira were waiting for him. Banai explained that he had hidden Kiw'teksa with the Ghostling children, and the three slaves began to pool their money. However, when Anakin returned home, Shmi confronted him about Kiw'teksa, and though she did not say it outright, Shmi knew that Anakin had been one of the children who had broken into the fortress. That night, Skywalker had a dream of an evil voice telling him to open the cube, and when he awoke in the middle of the night, he was sure that the voice had been real\u2014and he realized that the cube was giving off a small amount of heat, just as living creatures did."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next day, Jira confirmed that the smugglers would arrive the following sunset to pick up the Ghostlings and Kiw'teksa. However, that night, Dorn contacted him via comlink and reported that his master Jabba had ordered him to track down Kiw'teksa. Dismayed, Skywalker told Dorn to meet him at noon so that he could give the Bothan a signal jammer, and he fell asleep after remembering that he had just had a dream of a man with intense eyes, a lightsaber, and a tan poncho who had come to take him away from Tatooine. The next morning, Skywalker headed out to give Dorn his jammer, but he intercepted Sebulba when he noticed the Dug and his crew attempting to locate the Bothan. After giving Dorn the jammer, Skywalker incited a bar fight in the nearby Racer's Edge Cantina when Sebulba and the hunters tried to follow Dorn into the building."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, when Banai, Skywalker, and Dorn headed out to Gardulla's fortress in disguises, they were followed by Djas Puhr, Sebulba, and other hunters. The pursuers attacked the children in the pleasure garden, separating them, and Skywalker evaded the Abyssin Gondry by trapping him in quickclay from the planet Circarpous V before Sebulba began to pursue him. Coming across a Myrkr SS-23 sewage cannon, Skywalker fled into the bushes\u2014only to come across an unconscious Dorn while trying to stay ahead of Puhr. When Dorn did not waken, Skywalker encountered a green Wistie, a small radiant creature who led him to the Ghostlings and Kiw'teksa just as Djas Puhr captured them. At the Wistie's urging, Skywalker fled the garden and headed home, leaving the Ghostlings and his three friends in Puhr and Sebulba's hands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he reached Mos Espa, Skywalker headed straight for Jira and told her what had happened, just as a slave execution was announced for that evening. Jira suggested that Skywalker himself go with the smugglers, and she regretfully explained that she had been unable to gather all of the money necessary for the children and the Ghostlings to escape. However, the boy refused and told Jira to be ready at sunset before he departed, determined to rescue his friends. Selling some of the valuable junk from his room, Skywalker purchased glowrods, sandmasks, and a hand-held beamdrill, and he headed to the Mos Espa Grand Arena where his friends were being held. Entering a large drain in the unguarded holding pens, Skywalker soon located his friends and freed them, ushering them into the sand-drainage system through the drains in their cell just as a guard sounded the alarm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they fled through the drainpipes, Skywalker gave the others sandmasks while Dorn led the way with a glowrod and Skywalker followed at the rear of the group with another. The group made their way towards the Podrace hangar, fighting off capture droids with Skywalker's ion blaster, but their path was blocked when sand began to pour into the tunnels and sent the children rushing along the pipes in a torrent of sand. Fighting off a rock wart that tried to steal his glowrod, Skywalker finally came to a stop with the others in a large catch basin, and Skywalker set off to find a way out through the pipes. Using his beamdrill to ward off womp rats and to mark his path, Skywalker was nearly detected by two Morseerian pirates who heard him through the grates, but he managed to steal their treasure from their storeroom after they departed the chamber, giving him enough money to buy passage for the Ghostlings and his friends."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Searching through the pipes and the various grates, Skywalker was able to convince a slave man to let the Ghostlings and his friends out of the drainpipes by removing the grate in his house, but Skywalker was dismayed to learn that Dorn and an unconscious Ghostling named Coniel had been separated from the rest by slave hunters and would meet them at Bantha Rock, the place where the smugglers were supposed to meet the group. Using Watto's landspeeder, Skywalker ferried the Ghostlings and his friends out of the city, away from the slave hunters and to Bantha Rock, where Jira was waiting for them. The smuggler, whom Kitster recognized as his father Rakir Banai, accepted Skywalker's payment and took the children aboard, though Skywalker refused to go with them and leave his mother behind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, when Dorn and Coniel arrived, Rakir informed the group that his ship's life-support systems could not take that many people\u2014one of them would have to stay behind.

Jira gave the two boys the rest of the money, and Skywalker decided to save his money in order to one day buy his freedom. When he reached home, Skywalker found his mother up late working again, and she refused Anakin's offer of help and instead ordered him to clean himself up. Two days later, Skywalker raced Watto's pod yet again, but Sebulba used his exhaust vents to send the boy flying out of control as they went over Metta Drop, wrecking Watto's racer once again."}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "Podracing and looking to the stars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day when Anakin was working, Watto kicked W.

While Sebulba was not looking, Skywalker and his friends opened up the podracer's engines, and Skywalker was able to identify a vertigo flux override in the engine before an overeager Wald dropped the lightsaber in the open hatch. Skywalker was barely able to pull the lightsaber free before an angry Sebulba reached them, though Skywalker was unaware that the ancient weapon had damaged the inner workings of the podracer. The three of them headed back to Watto's shop, but when the owner returned and found them, he kicked Wald and the other boy out.

Shmi, apprehensive, explained that it was a protocol droid, and not very useful in their line of work. Anakin protested, claiming that the droid would be able to help with chores and converse with those using alien languages. Shmi relented, but explained to Anakin that the droid was his responsibility alone. Skywalker felt that the droid was a sort of kindred spirit, speculating that he had perhaps tried to escape from his masters, but had been demolished in the process.

Particularly during situations where he believed himself to be facing an inferior opponent, Vader could be taken off guard or frustrated, causing lapses in his usually staunch defense. For example, during his duel with Galen Marek on the first Death Star, Vader began the duel with an all-out offense, believing he would quickly overwhelm his opponent. Marek, however, initially took a defensive stance against Vader, blocking or dancing around Vader's attacks while expending as little energy as possible. Additionally, Marek's taunts concerning Vader's inability to free himself from Sidious' control interfered with his focus. Ultimately, Vader expended most of his energy in an unsuccessful attempt to batter Marek into submission and was brought down when Marek suddenly counter-attacked with Force lightning, breaking Vader's momentum and causing the duel to shift decisively in Marek's favor. Vader quickly learned from his mistake, as he demonstrated during his duel with the Starkiller clone on Kamino a few months later. During this battle, he utilized a more defensive set of tactics against Starkiller and maintained a more controlled, less prideful mindset, allowing him to battle on par with and even gain the upper hand, causing Starkiller, who was even more powerful than his template, to ultimately realize that the best he could possibly hope for in a duel against Vader was a stalemate.

Mirroring his father's Form V technique, Skywalker responded with his own furious demonstration of the style's raw power, and his marked increase in skill enabled him to meet Vader strength-to-strength. Luke ultimately bested Vader by drawing on the power of the dark side, boosting his physical prowess with the use of his rage.

This seems to partially proven by how after Vader regained much of his self-confidence, he became among the most powerful Sith Lords in galactic history. However, Vader always remained haunted to unseen levels by the choices he had made, to the point of even being able to become briefly insane during his mission to Atoa. Thus, while Vader made progress in that regard, he was never fully able to accept who and what he had become, and therefore never fulfilled his potential. Sidious would ultimately come to realize that Vader would never be the apprentice he longed for. He would try to replace him on at least two occasions with more powerful Force-sensitives, Galen Marek and Luke Skywalker. The Prophets of the Dark Side also saw Vader as too much of a Jedi to truly embrace the dark side. Nevertheless, Vader remained tremendously powerful in the Force, noted to hold eight-tenths of the strength of the Emperor, who was noted to be the most powerful Sith Lord in history (although he admitted openly he was not capable of defeating Sidious alone, Vader was confident that with aid from an apprentice of considerable power, he would be able to aid in defeating his master.). Vader also learned from his mistakes and trained and studied in the ways of the Force, especially the Dark Side, much more extensively and his mastery of the Force grew to tremendous levels, enough to use the Force to overpower almost any opponent he could not defeat with his lightsaber. Had none of the events on Mustafar taken place, he would have been far more powerful than the Emperor.

He could use Tutaminis to absorb and repel back the energy of blaster bolts, shown when he absorbed several blaster bolts from Han Solo's blaster on Bespin and repelled it back to disarm him, and Force deflection to redirect blaster bolts, sometimes even at whoever fired them. Vader was also capable of using two separate forms of Force Destruction, one that involved him blasting a massive amount of red energy and another that had him surround himself with a red energy field which acted also as a barrier strong enough to protect Vader from Marek's attacks, both with his lightsaber and the Force, showing Vader had became proficient in single-handedly creating Force barriers, whereas previously he was only able to create one with aid from other individuals. In addition, he utilized either a semi-visible Force barrier or a protection bubble several times during the Gentis coup to fend off the attacks of Gentis's traitorous soldiers, capable of reflecting enemy fire rather than simply dissipating it.

In addition, Vader retained his proficiency in using the Force to enhance his physical abilities. In fact, despite the cumbersome weight of his armor and prosthetics, Vader's profiency with Force Speed still made him capable of moving faster than the human eye could perceive by using precisely unleashed bursts of Force augmented speed. He showcased on multiple occasions the ability to both lift and hold a grown man off the ground at arm's length with no apparent effort. As he demonstrated on Captain Raymus Antilles and Shadday Potkin, among others, he could crush a human throat bare-handed. Vader demonstrated remarkable physical durability and resistance to pain throughout his time as a Sith. At least once, he was stabbed straight through the chest with a vibroblade and hardly reacted in either case. Additionally, his prosthetics and armor allowed him to survive deadly environmental hazards such as explosions, toxins, diseases, and even the vacuum of space. It also provided Vader with a constant supply of pain-suppressing drugs to help him function with his wounds.

However, he had confidence that should he continue to practice and acquire the necessary willpower, he would eventually be able to use it permanently and no longer be bound to his suit. Indeed, during his mission to Atoa, his deranged state of mind and immense rage granted him more than enough rage to use this healing technique to a far greater degree to the point he was able to operate in standard atmospheric conditions for a considerable length of time without his helmet, even while physically exerting himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides the life support it provided his ravaged body, Vader's Sith armor offered limited protection against the blades of lightsabers. In a climactic duel with his son in the depths of Cloud City, a quick blow from Luke's lightsaber appeared to cut the armor only shallowly, although this was enough to draw a surprised cry from the Dark Lord. However, most of the armor was purposely made out of non-lightsaber-resistant material, as Vader worried that he might grow sloppy if he relied too much on his armor to protect him in duels.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being a powerful Sith Lord, Darth Vader rarely generated Force lightning, as the extensive cybernetic augmentations in his body as well as the presence of the electronic life-support system in his suit caused any attempt by Vader to generate Force lightning to carry the great risk of causing these systems to short-circuit, possibly to deadly effect. However, while unable to directly channel Force Lightning, he had learned an assortment of alternative ways to use it from other sources, most notably when he was close to the Force-enhancing Kaiburr crystal. In this case, he proved proficient in using the \"Force energized lightning\" of Kinetite, which he used against his son. The crystal, however, was also seen to erode Vader's self-control to the point that he was actively trying to kill Luke during their duel, despite the fact that he very much wanted only to capture him. Thus, it is not known whether the crystal shielded Vader from the potentially fatal effects of generating Force lightning, or eroded his self-control to the point that he simply disregarded the risks. Regardless, Vader's attack was potent enough that it was able to exhaust all of Kenobi's spirit power upon him giving Luke the strength to deflect it. On one occasion, he also demonstrated the ability to re-direct already existing electricity. During his battle with Starkiller on Kamino, he was able to gather residual electricity from the lightning rods surrounding the battleground and blast it at his opponent. He had a variant of Force Lightning that allowed him to summon Force Lightning from directly above an opponent, and then directing it from a storm he generates with the Force. Vader also became incredibly adept in defending against Force Lightning attacks, as he proved capable of not only both blocking and redirecting even Marek's Force lightning with the Force during their duel on board the first Death Star and could use his lightsaber to ground the extremely high-intensity blasts of Force lightning from the even more powerful Starkiller with little effort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In combat, Vader was extremely adept at utilizing telekinetic attacks, and often made liberal use of his telekinetic abilities during duels.

He was also very proficient in the application of Force Repulse and Force Wave, and could generate enough power with both attacks to easily kill Force-insensitive assailants. In particular, he was capable of using Force Waves to kill dozens of opponents simultaneously. Making often use of both the Force Choke and Force Crush abilities in his life, Vader proved to be highly powerful in their application. In addition to only needing a live visual to choke a target with the Force, even able to easily kill them, he was also one of the few capable of achieving the same effect without needing to look, as shown by how he choked a man while not staring at him.

This served as both an effective practical attack and a way of demoralizing his opponents. Darth Vader first utilized this technique during his duel on Mustafar with Obi-Wan Kenobi, slicing shards of metal from the walls and shooting them at his opponent. However, Kenobi's mastery of Soresu allowed him to deflect the shards. After gaining his armor, Darth Vader used this tactic to bring down Roan Shryne on Kashyyyk, ripping apart the wooden platforms in their battleground and flinging waves of debris at the Jedi from all sides. Arguably his most well-known usage of this ability was against Luke Skywalker during their duel on Bespin, when he used it to batter Skywalker with objects in the room they were in. His effectiveness with this technique was further bolstered by the fact that he was capable of telekinetically gripping and hurling objects without the need to utilize the \"throwing\" motion that nearly all Force sensitives used. This was most evident during his fight with Luke on Bespin, where he surprised his son by telekinetically throwing a metal box at his head while maintaining a two-handed bladelock.
