While under the authority of Harrar\u2014priest of the goddess Yun-Harla and a friend of his father\u2014the warrior Lah helped spearhead the effort to capture and sacrifice the Solo twins Jacen and Jaina. Following Jaina's hasty escape from Myrkr aboard Nom Anor's personal ship, Ksstarr, Harrar and Lah tracked her to the world of Hapes. While on Hapes, the Solo girl found out how the Yuuzhan Vong track their ships, and how to confound that technique. By utilizing a small repulsor device created by Lowbacca, she was able to send up countless decoys, both to test her theory and to infuriate the Vong.
