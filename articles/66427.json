When the rest of the Alliance fleet had fled the system on Stazi's orders, he ordered the ship to be evacuated so he could ram it into the Mon Calamari Shipyards, but was knocked out by Rogue Leader Jhoram Bey. Instead, it was the ship's captain and Stazi's second-in-command, Jaius Yorub, who piloted the ship into the shipyards.
