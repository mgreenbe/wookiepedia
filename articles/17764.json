When the Empire rose to power, BlasTech was pressured to sign an exclusive agreement with the Imperial Military, but corporate leadership held firm and maintained a standing policy of selling weaponry to anyone and everyone who had the credits. As such, many BlasTech weapons were found in Rebel hands during the Galactic Civil War. Despite its relatively notable independence from the total Imperial control which dominated major galactic companies at the time, BlasTech's famed E-11 blaster rifle became the standard Imperial sidearm and the favored weapon of the dreaded Imperial stormtroopers. Many other BlasTech designs were also integrated into the Imperial arsenal and remained even into the days of the Imperial Remnant and Second Imperium, kept for their versatility and durability. BlasTech Corporation was a division of BlasTech Industries, which manufactured the personal and military blaster weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
