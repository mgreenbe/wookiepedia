When Coruscant took on the planet of Fondor's visiting team, the inexperienced Team Coruscant lost the game, with one score to Fondor's three. The stadium was the origin of a HoloNet News article covering the results of the Coruscant\u2013Fondor game and the Galactic Cup's other opening matches that were played across the galaxy.
