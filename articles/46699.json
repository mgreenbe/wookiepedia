Upon the defeat of the Honorable Union of Desevro & Tion in the Tionese War around 23,900 BBY, an arc of Galactic Republic fortress worlds was established along the Coreward boundaries of the Tion Cluster, which eventually became a part of the Republic. The fortress worlds included Falang Minor, Haashimut, and Ossus, the home of the Jedi Order at the time. On those worlds, Jedi Knights acted as the Republic's watchmen, monitoring the restless star cluster. Despite Falang Minor being a Republic fortress world, it nominally remained outside the borders of that government around 22,000 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the end of the Tionese War, a Republic Guardsman was assigned to serve the Jedi watchmen on Falang Minor. While still a boy during the war, the soldier had survived a Tionese attack on the celestial body Okator VIII that had destroyed his home, after which the youth had enlisted with the Republic Military. The soldier's duties on Falang Minor included monitoring starship traffic, intelligence, and transmissions originating in the Tion Cluster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After serving on Falang Minor for twelve years, the soldier imprinted on a Baragwin sense lattice an audio-visual account of the attack on Okator VIII. In the record, the soldier noted his displeasure at both the world he was stationed on\u2014as opposed to the pastoral Okator VIII\u2014and the nature of his duties, which gave him too many opportunities for introspection. Nevertheless, the soldier re-affirmed in the narration his distrust for the Tionese and his determination to continue watching them indefinitely, along with a conviction that all the personnel on Falang Minor would similarly do so."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Falang Minor was first mentioned in the 2004 Wizards of the Coast sourcebook Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds.
