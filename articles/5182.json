Built on a series of metal platforms, the facility's amenities were built on the underside of the docking platform. These included cantinas, shopping centers, restaurants, maintenance facilities, and refueling stations. Turbolifts connected Aleron Starport to the city of Daekun, which was located over one thousand meters below the planet's surface. Due to Aleron's position on the Shapani Run, Aleron Starport was extremely busy and generated a sizable amount of income."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
