However, they were pulled out of hyperspace by Empion mines deposited by a support ship of Admiral Apwar Trigit. The mines shorted out their starfighters and astromech droids. It also erased all of their navigational data, which prevented them from leaving the system. Faced with this dilemma, Wedge Antilles ordered the squadron to land on Xobome 6 to make repairs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Ambush"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surmising that the ship would return once again to check its trap, the Wraiths managed to convince Wedge Antilles that they could board the enemy ship by using parts from the broken X-wings. Kell Tainer and Cubber Daine constructed a small vessel they named the Lunatic out of Ton Phanan's damaged X-wing. They outfitted it with thrusters, a stripped down laser cannon and an astromech droid to help the navigation. Their plan was to hide a pilot inside the smuggling compartment and have the Imperial ship tractor it in. Once inside, the pilot would access one of the ship's terminals and send a rescue request to the New Republic. Voort saBinring volunteered to the be intruder due to his Gamorrean physiology, which would better insulate him from the cold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The enemy ship that appeared turned out to be a modified Corellian corvette, designated Night Caller. It towed the Lunatic into its hold while also launching a pair of TIE Fighters to scout the area. The other Wraiths were lying in wait on a nearby asteroid field where they easily destroyed both TIE's. Aboard the Night Caller, saBinring emerged from the smuggling compartment and managed to subdue the stormtroopers guarding the area. He then fired his cannon into the hold ceiling and climbed his way to the ship's bridge; where he demanded and received the bridge crew's surrender. He later learned that the ship's captain, Zurel Darillian was killed by the shot he made to the ceiling."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the quick capture of the Night Caller, the ship's crew were not able to send a distress signal. This meant that Zsinj's forces were not aware of the ship's capture. Based on this, Antilles decided on his own initiative that they would pretend to be the ship's crew and perform all it's missions with the intent of finding a way to deal a critical blow to Zsinj."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
