Presumably, like the Gungan personal energy shield, it had the same basis as other Gungan plasma technology. The force field created by this device was capable of deflecting energy weapons, including shots from AATs, projectiles, and other small objects, but can be breached by infantry. These generators are usually brought to battle by large war beasts such as fambaas. These generators provided excellent protection for the Gungan Grand Army during the Battle of Naboo until they were disabled by Trade Federation infantry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
