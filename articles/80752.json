In the distance a fireball erupts from three line signaling the destruction of the Jedi's transport. Jariah and Deliah take no time in doubling the price for transporting Marasiah, Astraal and the Jedi to Marasiah's father Roan Fel. The conversation is interrupted by Darth Talon and several beasts under the Sith's persuasion. Darth Talon quickly gets the upper hand on both Jedi using Force lightning until Marasiah intercepts the lightning with her lightsaber claiming that she won't let another person die. Darth Talon easily Force throws Marasiah to the ground and tells her to run.
