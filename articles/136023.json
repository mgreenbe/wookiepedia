In 1 ABY, two Bothan siblings, Jural and Talper had arrived on Mustafar, intent on studying the crumpled Jedi ruins that dotted the Mustafarian landscape. During their journey, they came upon the ruins inhabited by the Storm Lord. The Storm Lord and his minions quickly attacked the helpless Bothans and forced them out of the ruins. Shortly after, Talper became deathly ill, and soon lost consciousness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after these events, a spacer whom was also exploring Mustafar came upon the stranded Bothans. Jural was convinced that the Storm Lord had cast a \"spell\" on her brother, as none of the medicine she carried was helping him. She asked the spacer to please find and kill the Storm Lord and his minions. The spacer agreed and battled through the ruins, killing many of the Storm Lord's followers, including his prophet. Soon he came face to face with the dark Jedi. After a long and arduous battle, the Storm Lord was slain. The spacer returned to the Bothans to find Talper in good health. Jural was ecstatic and thanked the spacer profusely. She rewarded the spacer's bravery with a special Mustafarian medicine injector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Storm Lord was a non-playable character in the massively-multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
