Situated in a cave hidden in one of Ryloth's extensive canyon networks, the outpost was well-hidden and difficult to find, keeping it secret from the Separatists who had occupied the planet. After the end of the war and the formation of the Galactic Empire, Cham's daughter Hera hid at the outpost with her astromech droid Chopper after her parents were arrested by the Empire. Calling on her new friend Omega for help mounting a rescue mission, Hera had Omega and Clone Force 99 meet her at the outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
