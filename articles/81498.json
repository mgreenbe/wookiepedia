However, the Stromma envoy Nyama believed that the Imperials would be defeated during the attack, so he ordered all of the Stromma aboard the Admonitor to leave the ship. However, Lhagva chose to disobey the order and he remained on the Admonitor, because he wanted to save the Quesoth from Esva and because he was an orphan, so he had no family to dishonor by remaining behind. Shortly afterward, the battle commenced, and Lhagva and his stormtrooper squad landed on Quethold and entered the Red City aboard an A-rack carrier vehicle. The stormtroopers were then attacked by a large group of Quesoth Soldiers in the street Setting Sun Avenue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
