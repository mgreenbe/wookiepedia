An accomplished Senator, Leia Organa was most famous for her strong leadership during the Galactic Civil War and other subsequent galactic conflicts, making her one of the galaxy's greatest heroes.

During this conflict, Leia's son Jacen turned to the dark side of the Force, becoming the Sith Lord Darth Caedus.

Her heavily-pregnant mother, the Naboo Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, had been suffering a Force choke by her spouse Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight who had fallen to the dark side of the Force. Amidala had been brought in a panic to a hospital of the Polis Massa Base by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had arranged rendezvous with Yoda, Grand Master of the Jedi Order, and Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan. Due to Amidala's condition, the Polis Massan surgeons were nearly forced to remove the twins she was carrying, but the children were born just in time. In a few, feeble breaths, Amidala named her twins \"Luke\" and \"Leia.\" The Senator died mere moments after their birth, effectively orphaning Leia and her older twin brother.

Amidala's corpse was sent back to Naboo, with the instruction of making it look like she was still pregnant. In this way, nobody would know of the children's existence. When they decided it would be best if the twins were separated, Master Kenobi suggested that he would take the boy, and Master Yoda would take Leia. However, Yoda disagreed, arguing that they should wait for the right time before training the twins in the ways of the Force. At that point, Bail Organa offered to adopt baby Leia, as he and his wife were childless and longing for a daughter. The Jedi agreed, and the infant boy Luke was sent to live on Tatooine with his father's stepbrother Owen Lars and his wife Beru. As promised, Leia was adopted and raised by Bail Organa and his wife, Queen Breha Organa, who had been friends of Amidala during the antecedent conflict known as the Clone Wars.

Even though the Inquisitorius was not aware of the child's gender, Kenobi feared that the toddler might be Leia and wanted to turn the Empire's eye away from Alderaan. Olin covered up the incident, stating it was nothing more than a rumor, and Leia's heritage remained a secret. The Imperial informer turned out to be Deara Antilles; Queen Breha had mercy on her sister, but exiled her from the royal family forever. Following the incident, Olin settled on Alderaan. The former Jedi was tasked with protecting the Princess, following her like a shadow under the guise of the obsequious botanist Fess Ilee.

Leia's best friend and companion since earliest childhood, Winter possessed a natural grace and poise that often led court visitors to mistake her for the Princess of Alderaan, while the tomboy Leia was regarded as a domestic girl. The Princess's lack of upper-class gentility remained a constant source of despair to her aunts Tia, Rouge, and Celly, who were nevertheless determined to turn her into what they called \"a Proper Princess,\" and hired deportment teachers to drill into her manners fitting for the heir of an Ancient House. One part of making her a lady was to learn how a princess dresses up and does her hair. According to Alderaanian customs, Leia's hair was allowed to grow long and arranged into elaborate hairstyles. Ironically, one of Leia's trademark symbols\u2014her signature \"bun\" coiffure\u2014was inherited from her mother's homeworld of Naboo, although a long time passed before she came to know it.

Wanting to expose her to as many experiences as possible, Bail Organa often took his daughter along to trips to other worlds, such as Ithor, where he attended the Time of the Meeting as the representative of the Imperial Senate. About six years old at the time, the Meeting was an unforgettable experience for Leia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite knowing that she was loved, Leia sometimes felt an outsider to her family. Winter was like a sister to her, but the young Princess still wished she had a brother or a sister of her own, someone she could truly feel close to. In her growing years, she often felt that she was just slightly different, without exactly knowing how, and that a part of her was missing. Winter remained a comfort to Leia, despite the differences in their personality. Though the pair's physical resemblance was tempered by Winter's stunning white hair, the friends soon learned to employ similar looks for tactical advantage, a practice they would continue throughout their lives. Winter sometimes disguised herself as Leia so that the Princess could escape the Aldera Royal Palace to create mischief and visit inappropriate boys. Leia also befriended Neena, a musically talented girl about her age who lived in the Organa household."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides receiving palace education, Leia attended the Collegium for Young Ladies in Crevasse City as of 12 BBY.

The harmless joke, however, took a more serious turn when it was discovered that the moth had eaten the budget for the whole next year, written on a sheet of flimsiplast. As a means of punishment, Leia was banned from participating in a party held in the Grand Ballroom of the Royal Palace. The Princess and Winter attended the gala anyway, hidden behind a marble staircase with a store of scavenged food. Having accidentally crossed the eyes of Fess Ilee, the young girls were afraid and got out of their hiding place, bumping into Bail Organa, who promptly banned them to their rooms. The following night, the Princess got over the wall so she could join Winter at the Gingerbell blossom festival. Walking alone in the deserted streets of Aldera, Leia was almost kidnapped by a trio of goons who worked for Senator Ask Aak of Malastare. Aak wished to use the child as a bargaining chip so that Bail Organa would vote they way he wanted. The rapture attempt, however, was thwarted by Ferus Olin, who had been following the Princess in the streets. Later that night, Leia lost her way. The Princess climbed upon a half-finished building so she would be able to see the Palace in the distance, but she nearly fell while trying to climb down.

During this time, Leia saw the downside of the upper class as well: many of the girls had a condescending attitude towards ordinary people, and expensive parties were thrown in the court even though many in the galaxy were hungry and suffering. Once she reached her adolescent years, Leia discovered that one of her school friends used drugs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, her adolescent years also had their share of cherished memories. Leia became friends with Heeth and Raal Panteer, two scions of the patrician House Panteer. Once, the Princess snuck out at night with Raal Panteer to swim in the reflecting pools of Aldera. The pair, who had fallen in love, exchanged their first kiss on that occasion, but the relationship failed to last. Organa and the Panteer brothers would meet again during the Galactic Civil War. At age thirteen, Leia and Winter met Jahan Cross, the son of the Alderaanian diplomat Davim Cross. Both young girls had a \"mad crush\" on him, which, according to the Princess, \"lasted three whole days.\" After a long hiatus, the three met again in 3 BBY, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention.

She had heard a lot about the Moff from her father, none of it good. She instantly disliked him, maintaining that he represented everything that was wrong with the Empire. Leia was particularly disgusted with the idea of Tarkin having a slave, as she did not understand how it was possible that the Emperor allowed slavery. She even dropped a water balloon on his head while \"watering her plants.\" The visit made Leia seriously contemplate what kind of galaxy she lived in, and what she could do to change it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the age of sixteen, Leia attended the University of Alderaan together with Winter, whose holographic and audiographic memory, as Leia would joke, was very useful with homework. They studied history and art, two subjects the Empire seemed eager to suppress, which in Bail Organa's opinion was all the more reason to study them. Leia also began training with Giles Durane, a mercenary her father had hired to teach her self-defense and marksmanship.

At the age of 18, she became the youngest Imperial Senator ever elected, and Bail Organa formally presented her to Palpatine shortly before she assumed her Senatorial post.

When she met the Emperor, however, she became frightened by the dark side radiating from him and was unable to do anything more than mutter thanks to his compliments as Darth Vader watched. Following the reception, Bail assured her that there was nothing to be ashamed of, as it was a common reaction to seeing Palpatine, especially for the first time. To make her feel better, Organa told Leia how proud he was of her, and related a piece of good news\u2014he had arranged for the Caamasi she saw arrested to be released.
