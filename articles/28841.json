In the early days of its existence, COMPNOR's Commerce agencies worked with the commercial houses within their jurisdiction to design and promote economic programs to improve planetary economies in the Galactic Empire. Amongst the successes credited to Commerce was the Corporate Sector System Development Programs, known as \"D-Progs\", which rendered aid to frontier worlds that suffered during the fall of Galactic Republic to make them self-sufficient. Other programs, such as the Native Management and Industrialization Service on Gamorr, were less successful. One of their major successes was the establishment of spice-mining operations on Sevarcos II using prison labor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Commerce was used to conduct industrial espionage against the large commercial houses and targeting those companies that were suspected of sympathizing with the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
