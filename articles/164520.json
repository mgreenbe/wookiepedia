During the Waymancy Storm, Waymancy's religiously-motivated war against the Galactic Republic, the pulse-wave weapons of the Wives of Tingrippa's ships were considerably more powerful than those of the Republic Navy, while efficient power generators meant that their deflector shields could absorb any Republic attack. This put the Republic Military at an extreme disadvantage until it reverse-engineered Waymancy weapons and power generators captured at Sif-Alula."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
