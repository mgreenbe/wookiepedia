When the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra and the smuggler Sana Starros traveled to the planet to search for the source of a Nihil Path engine sold to Beol De'Rruyet by the smuggler Remy, they spoke with the bartender, who recognized Remy, having been bragged to by the smuggler about his find. The bartender informed Aphra and Starros of the details of Remy's sale, pointing the two in the direction of the starship wreckage where Remy had found the hyperdrive. General Vukorah of the Unbroken Clan criminal organization followed the two to Dol'har Hyde, where Vukorah also learned of the Path engine's location. The Unbroken Clan subsequently left the bartender and her patrons dead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
