Over the years, the indigenous Twi'leks found a multitude of uses for the flavorful fungus, from simply eating it raw to cooking it in various soups and stews, where the fungus' presence helped to cultivate a rich and hearty broth. Further, munch-fungus could be baked into Munch-fungus loaf, a traditional type of Twi'lek bread."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Artiodac chef by the name of Strono Tuggs discovered munch-fungi during a trip to Ryloth, where he came to appreciate the wild mushrooms for their flavor and versatility.
