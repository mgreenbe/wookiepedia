Normally non-toxic, slabin could become harmful if an improper concentration was ingested, leading to severe illness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, a group of Moogan smugglers led by Tee Va illegally imported Ardees Beverage tea into the city of Sundari on the planet Mandalore, using slabin to dilute the tea to sell more of it. When the tea was served at the Sundari Mandalorian school, several New Mandalorian children suffered the ill effects of a slabin overdosing. As many children began to occupy the beds at the newly opened Sundari Mandalorian hospital, Doctor Zak Zaz ran tests on the tea when it was acquired by Duchess Satine Kryze and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. When Zaz discovered the source of the illness, Kryze, Amidala, and police forces were able to shut down the scheme and eventually obtain a viable antidote."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
