Geith and Callista were amongst the Jedi who hid from the Great Jedi Purge on Belsavis. Master Plett dispatched them in a Y-wing to infiltrate the Eye of Palpatine. Once aboard, they realized that they couldn't stop the Eye of Palpatine alone. However, the two Jedi disagreed on how to get help. Ultimately, Geith convinced Callista to let him attempt to escape the Eye of Palpatine in a Skipray Blastboat, leaving Callista behind to try to disable the ship. Geith surmised that he had figured out the pattern on which the Eye of Palpatine's automated defenses fired. Unfortunately for Geith, he was wrong and was struck by an unanticipated shot from the Eye of Palpatine's automated defenses. That unexpected shot sent his Skipray Blastboat into an asteroid and Geith's ship was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
