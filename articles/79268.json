In c. 31 BBY, the droids of Uffel opened up their facilities to outsiders, and LV-15 was assigned to work as a tour guide. He met a tour group\u2014which included the Heroes of Cularin\u2014at the Uffel landing pads, and escorted them to the city X2-4, where he handed the tourists over to the droid HG-211.
