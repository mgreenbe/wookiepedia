The scavenger discovered that only the droid's microwave sensors were still working and sold all of the unit bar its head to the junk dealer Unkar Plutt. A month or two after the transaction, the treasurer hunter Zool Zendiat and his Zendiat Collective kidnapped Plutt in search of the J9 unit. Rey then rescued Plutt from the Collective, letting them take the J9 unit's head as she escaped as the scavenger had previously checked it and discovered that its memory banks were damaged beyond repair and wiped clean."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The J9 worker drone first appeared in the comic story \"Better the Devil You Know, Part I,\" which was published in the first issue of the Star Wars Adventures series on September 6, 2017."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
