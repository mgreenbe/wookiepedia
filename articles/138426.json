He helped Phasma, Brendol Hux and their troops into safety, after the latter had fallen desperately ill, leading them into the facility via a hidden door buried underneath the sand and showed them the medbay, where Hux would be treated. Then, he lead the group to deal with payments. In a fancy room, they received beverages and food, which the Scyre folk find amazing and weird, due to them never seeing or tasting such things. Afterwards, TB-3 asked them on how they would wanted to pay. They were incapable which resulted in them being forced to work as laborors to keep Hux alive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
