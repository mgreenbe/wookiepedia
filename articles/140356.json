A hybrid of several different species, the being was one among several subjects designed to be weapons of war, but the project was eventually shut down by Tarkin and all experiments were ordered to be terminated.

After seeing his creator's cruelty, the creature took pity on the vessel's crew and helped propel their pod from the doomed ship, dying alone in the ensuing explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The creature first appeared in Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 2, a comic book written by Cavan Scott."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
