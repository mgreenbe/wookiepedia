Ergesh were very wet, and fluid meant everything to them, so there was no word in the Ergesh language to mean \"dry\"; there was a word though, meaning \"not wet\", which was usually used as a curse. Most members of the Ergesh species preferred to speak Basic, though it sounded as if the speaker was talking underwater."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
