Generally dismissed and belittled by her parents, Bug was nicknamed after S\u00eddi's native ash-beetles at a young age after one she had attempted to tame as a pet was squashed by her mother Leera, with Bug eventually forgetting her real name. During the Clone Wars, Bug met Falta, a Dathomirian witch who had come to S\u00eddi looking for news of her lost daughter, Yenna. After impressing Falta and helping her locate a transmission picked up by an abandoned military relay tower which placed her daughter in the Mid Rim, Bug persuaded Falta to allow her to come along, deciding she would eventually choose a new, better-fitting name."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
