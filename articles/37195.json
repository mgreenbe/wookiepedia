They were one of the more common predators on Sileron. They were aggressive and individual creatures seemed to have no fear of death. They consumed large quantities of food in preparation for the long winter. In the colder seasons, they hibernated in large burrows; some related species migrated to other other continents on the warmer side of the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
