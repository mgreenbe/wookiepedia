Later he was seemingly captured by the Yuuzhan Vong and put into the Embrace of Pain. After some amount of time in imprisonment an explosion shook the torture chambers where \"Dulac\" was held, freeing him. He found an opening caused by an explosion and left through there. He was than grabbed by the resistance members dressed in seaweed. They took \"Dulac\" into the water where they had their hidden base and took off their disguises. \"Dulac\" then saw his King Caled Galfridian alive and leading the resistance. Around that time Finn Galfridian learned of Dulac's true nature from an information broker on Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finn, together with Jacen and Jaina Solo, raced back to Artorias to warn his father, but when they arrived it already was too late, \"Dulac\" had revealed himself to Caled and had attacked him. During their fight Dulac praised the King for his Yuuzhan Vong-like spirit. \"Dulac\" realized the fight was over when Finn's droid, Prowl, arrived at the scene and shot him. However, \"Dulac\" had one final card to play: a plaeryin bol. He successfully spat the venom contained in the bol at the king's face, but was cut in half by Jacen and Jaina Solo shortly after."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
