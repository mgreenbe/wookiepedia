Its specific role was a hybrid fighter/bomber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like most other TIE Series starfighters, the TIE Aggressor sacrificed shields and armor for firepower and maneuverability. It was strong in multipurpose mission profiles, but was more expensive than specialist fighters, like the TIE/IN interceptor or the TIE/sa bomber, and its pilots required more training. As such, it was noted as being a TIE fighter that was a combination of a fighter and a bomber, the craft saw limited use, and never really left the experimental phase. In addition, the fighters also had similar maneuverability to the Y-wing starfighter, which combined with their lack of a shield generator made them fairly easy to ambush by Rebel fighters. The overall frame was longer than a TIE/LN, but it nonetheless possessed similar features to various TIEs, including the lack of shielding, the series' signature twin ion engines, the spherical command pod, and the broad solar collector wings. Unlike the other TIEs, the command pod's hull is extended to include room for an on-board gunner to operate the fighter's primary weapons system: the dorsal-turret mounted light laser cannons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This ship had a laser cannon turret on the top-back of the craft used to defend the craft from pursuers. With a good gunner, the rear turret could be very accurate and hard to evade, which made attacks from the rear or above very difficult even with all shield power channeled forward. Many TIE Aggressor pilots were trained to skirt the outer edges of a combat zone, letting their gunner take shots at any enemy fighters that were currently engaging Imperial craft. If any enemy fighters attempted to pursue the Aggressor, the pilot would fly away from the combat zone, exposing the pursuing craft to the rear turret, while the Aggressor's wingmate would fall in behind the Rebel fighter. The ship represented a distinct break in typical Imperial Starfighter design philosophy, placing survivability and performance over cost efficiency and ease of maintenance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like most Imperial fighters, the Aggressor sported a small profile, making it a difficult target to hit. Its maneuverability suffered however, as what limited space was available was needed to provide additional power for the turret. In addition, as the turret needed extra firing space around the sides of the ship to line up shots, the Aggressor had a distinct shortage of ionization and radiation paneling in comparison to most TIE fighters. Because of this shortage of space, the standard TIE cockpit pod used for the Aggressor was lacking its usual chin-mounted weapon hardpoints, instead utilizing external racks for modular forward-facing laser cannons. These cannons rounded out the already impressive dorsal turret."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Aggressor was developed prior to the destruction of the first Death Star as a direct response to a perceived growth in the amount of heavy shipping aligned with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, both in terms of legal sales and smuggling. The Aggressor specifically was to participate in missions relating to commerce raiding and interdiction. Its development, alongside that of the TIE/HU Hunter multi-role starfighter, TIE/D Defender, and the TIE/ph phantom, had been overseen at the Imperial Classified Flight Yards by then-Captain Soontir Fel. Even under the brief time under Imperial deployment, the TIE/AG nonetheless garnered a reputation of being reliable, easy to fly, and a deadly combatant, with it being required that those who pilot the ships have the minimum rank of Lieutenant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Aggressor also underwent several test runs by specialists affiliated with Sienar at affiliated space stations. Because of its distinctive properties, it was usually a favorite for Imperials who were free spirited and enjoyed longer missions away from base and apart from the large numbers usually associated with Rebel bombardments. It saw use in the Outer Rim to harass Rebel shipping. As such, the ship and squadrons possessing them had an infamous reputation among various Rebel starfighter pilots and freighter captains who encountered them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Aggressor saw some use with Onyx Squadron, with at least one being dispatched to a mission on a stormy planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Aggressor was created as an Imperial counterpart to the turret-oriented Y-wing for the Jump to Lightspeed expansion for Star Wars Galaxies. They were considered one of the more difficult starfighters to defeat in PvE combat due to the rear turret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though not one of the most popular PVP ships due to its low maneuverability, the TIE Aggressor was one of the most versatile ships in the game. It could be very successfully flown with a single player or when utilized with a gunner. As the fourth smallest ship in Jump to Lightspeed, it was difficult to hit, even though it was relatively sluggish, and at ~125k mass, it was able to utilize a dizzying array of diverse ship parts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
