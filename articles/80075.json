With a total of 16 omnidirectional laser cannons mounted in pairs, eight on the upper and eight on the lower part of the hull, the Large Gun Emplacement was extremely dangerous to incoming starfighters. Each laser cannon was operated by two gunners, but there was space aboard for a few extra beings, perhaps technicians or comm operators. The platform was too small to house living quarters, so the crew members had to be ferried in by shuttle at the beginning of their shift to one of the four ingress/egress hatches."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With a heavy shield rated at 80 SBD\u2014though relatively light armor\u2014this weapons platform might have at first appeared vulnerable based on appearance and size alone. However, it could bring formidable firepower to bear on attackers. If a starfighter was close enough to inflict damage with its lasers, it was also in range of at least eight of the gun platform's lasers. Experienced gunnery crews were also able to shoot down incoming warheads, forcing starfighters to engage at close quarters. Nonetheless, a skillful squadron of pilots working together was often able to overwhelm the gunners aboard one of these platforms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Station commanders often utilized these defense platforms in conjunction with minefields."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
