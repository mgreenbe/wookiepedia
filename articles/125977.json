She opposed Grand Admiral Savit's operations against pirates in the sector, and was cautious of spies and Imperial agents. When Eli Vanto and Brierly Ronan were sent on a mission to investigate Project Stardust shipments from Aloxor, Sisay's gang surrounded them and their disguised death trooper escort. Vanto provided a cover story, which Sisay reluctantly claimed to believe for some time, until she decided to kill them. However, the Imperial Security Bureau agent Dayja Collerand, who was undercover as the slicer \"Mole,\" had been asked to keep an eye on Thrawn's mission, knocking the members of Sisay's gang unconscious before threatening the gang leader with a blaster. Sisay attempted to fight back, but Collerand fired before she could, killing her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
