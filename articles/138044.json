Around 3 ABY, he began contacting the cyborg hunter Beilert Valance after the notorious Nakano Lash resurfaced with a large bounty on her head. While attempting to contact Valance, the bounty hunter Ooris Bynar, who accompanied him, offered to take the job at half the price.

Through a hologram, Syphacc revealed to Fett that Lash had reemerged, and offered the bounty to him.
