Although the Tempest Scout 1 card identifies the walker as one of the AT-STs seen during the onset of the Battle of Endor of the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, it is difficult to tell if the walker's onscreen occupant is the same extra used for the \"Lieutenant Arnet\" CCG card. As the \"Tempest Scout 1\" CCG card further does not explicitly identify that the extra is Arnet and not the walker's gunner, this article avoids linking Arnet to the Return of the Jedi movie extra, and treats the Star Wars Customizable Card Game's \"Lieutenant Arnet\" and \"Tempest Scout 1\" cards as the licensed Star Wars products that first introduced the character."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
