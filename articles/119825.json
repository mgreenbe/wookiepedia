It was located atop a hilly area a short distance north of Mos Entha, overlooking the city. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Coris Mao tasked a commando with disrupting operations at this base when they began interfering with his business partners' trade activities. Mao claimed that any transport which found itself within a thousand meters of the base would face blaster fire from the Sand Pirates. In order to eliminate this threat, the commando dispatched by an Imperial by the name of Sergeant Snopel set off towards the base. The commando killed the two guards at the base's entrance, and eliminated at least ten others within the bunker's confines in order to send a message that innocent citizens could not be terrorized with impunity. At the base's lowest level, the commando encountered and killed the boss of the Sand Pirates, thus disrupting their activities for the time being. Sergeant Snopel congratulated the commando via comm unit when it was confirmed that the operation was a success. The interior of the base was decorated with a number of items, including a painting of a Tatooinian town, and hunting trophies of a Bane Back spider and painted spat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sand Pirate Base was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
