During the battle, Ramchak fought in hand-to-hand combat with the Imperial agent Jahan Cross. Cross overpowered the Gotal, and went on to destroy the Bloodskull by commandeering one of its deck-mounted turbolasers, using it to blow a hole in the hull. Ramchak and the rest of his crew later surrendered and were sent to the Spike. Cross later released Ramchak and his crew to use them as a distraction so he could free Aveca Dunn from the prison."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
