He typically welcomed guests to the sinkhole spaceport and offered them his services."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the final weeks of the Clone Wars, Medon was forced to accommodate General Grievous and his associates from the Confederacy of Independent Systems in his sanctuary. Members of the Separatist Council used the city as their base of operations around the time following the Battle of Coruscant. Sometime later, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived on Utapau in search of Grievous. Medon welcomed Kenobi to the spaceport, and discreetly divulged helpful information pertaining to the Separatist presence on the tenth level. Kenobi advised the administrator to help his people find shelter, and, offering a secret in kind, to bring the city's warriors to bear on the Separatists. Kenobi then sent his Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor on an automated decoy voyage back to his fleet while he surreptitiously continued his search to find Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After speaking with Kenobi and passing the Jedi General's veiled message to the Utapaun Security Forces, which served as their local resistance force against the Confederacy, Medon anxiously waited for a signal. Elsewhere, thanks his conversation with Medon, Kenobi knew where to confront Grievous, leading to a lightsaber duel between the two rival generals that was soon interrupted by a Republic battalion dropping in from above, providing Medon with the signal he had been waiting for. The Utapaun forces bolstered the Republic clone troopers in the ways they could, but, after Kenobi killed Grievous, Darth Sidious's execution of Order 66, and the defeat of the Separatist Droid Army, the clones quickly turned against the Utapauns, occupying the planet and arresting the Security Forces, with Medon being among those who were captured."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Physical appearance and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like other Pau'ans, Tion Medon was a tall, gaunt humanoid with lined, gray-skin and thin bodies. Their appearance could be intimidating, with jagged teeth and nails, and dark, red-rimmed eyes. Standing at over two meters in height, Medon was nonetheless a helpful and gracious individual, welcoming guests to his homeworld and running Utapau's government alongside other members of his species. When Kenobi arrived, Medon recognized him as a Jedi immediately and initially pretended to be unaware of Grievous's presence before whispering a warning to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tion Medon was portrayed by Bruce Spence in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the third and final installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially, it was undecided how Medon was to be realized onscreen\u2013whether a practical makeup effect or a computer-generated character.
