The design was reminiscent of the AT-AT used by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. Two First Order AT-ATs were deployed alongside the larger All Terrain MegaCaliber Six during the Battle of Crait. The walker featured increased armor and a boarding ramp under its chin in place of the heavy laser cannons; instead, its primary cannons were mounted on the sides of its head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
