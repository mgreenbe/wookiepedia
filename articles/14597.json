Although cautioned by one of his officers, Grigor opted to advance into the mountains, leading his forces into a trap. Rebel troops occupied the high ground and hit the Imperials with small arms fire and a barrage from well-placed 1.4 FD P-Towers. Grigor's troops, largely mercenaries in stormtrooper armor, were then cut down by Rebel infantry. Attempting to hold Queen Mora, the Rebel heir of the M'haeli royal family, hostage, Grigor died at the hands of former Imperial officer Ranulf Trommer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Rebel forces were forced to retreat as 'real' offworld Imperial reinforcements arrived, spearheaded by AT-ATs and led by Grand Moff Lynch Hauser.
