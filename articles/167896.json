He united with Marn Hierogryph and two mysterious Arkanian Offshoots, Camper and Jarael, in his quest to avenge his murdered friends and force the Masters to confess their crime and clear his name.

Haazen was stopped by the combined efforts of both Carrick and Lucien Draay, though the latter was believed to have perished with Haazen. In the wake of the events, the High Council offered Carrick the title of Jedi Knight, though he turned down the offer to begin his partnership with Gryph as a loner Jedi\u2014looking out for the people who fell beneath the Jedi Order's notice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carrick would participate with Gryph in various schemes to swindle deserving targets out of their credits.

After rescuing famed racer Goethar Kleej and his son Aubin, Jarael admitted to Carrick that she had been a reluctant member of a slaving organization named the Crucible before she was able to escape.

The trio decided to mount a desperate rescue mission of Jarael, little knowing that Demagol had already revealed himself to the Arkanian Offshoot as her former teacher Antos Wyrick.

Not only was it his late arrival that saved him: it was expected, and the Masters were prepared to wait for him as long as needed; Shad Jelavan was originally going to be blamed for the crime. However, the delay, and the fact that Lucien was carrying his lightsaber like the other Masters, indicated that Zayne was going to be knighted, which the Masters confirmed with a hastily concocted story about his alleged \"special relationship\" with the Force and the increasing demand for Jedi Knights due to the Revanchists' decision to fight the Mandalorian invasion.

Initially both Jarael and Camper refused to help Zayne\u2014Jarael because of Zayne's indirect role in convincing Lhosan Industries to leave Taris, and Camper because of Gryph's failure to pay him for their last transaction; however, when a force led by Constable Noana Sowrs and Lucien arrived on the scene, Jarael and Camper allowed Zayne and Gryph to escape with them on their ship, The Last Resort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, The Last Resort had not flown in years, and soon stalled in the asteroid field in orbit around Taris.

While there, the duo uncovered the destroyed droid T1-LB (\"Elbee\") that might have had information as to why the Masters murdered their Padawans. Elbee had been present for the Jedi Trials but had foolishly fallen off the edge of a cliff. Zayne realized that his masters had thrown Elbee off the cliff to prevent him from witnessing their conversation, as the Padawans had jumped from orbit without harm.

Zayne asked Elbee to recall the last moments of his recordings on the Rogue Moon. Zayne saw a revelation: a dark secret had been kept by his own masters. The four Masters (bar Lucien), as it turned out, had all seen terrifying visions of the future, which ultimately led them to commit the murders.

Gryph and Zayne made an alternate plan: Zayne would go and then distract the guard and take The Last Resort for his escape. However, they did not predict that Jarael was waiting there to cut him off. She reminded him that there was nothing wrong with running, but one must not endanger others to save oneself. Zayne did not want to die, but neither did he want to lose his new found friends.

The same hologram had been shown to Vandar Tokare when Zayne had traveled to Coruscant to clear his name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Zayne's failure to help Celeste would have dire consequences for the galaxy. Because of its mysterious nature, Dreypa's Oubliette would later start a cycle of greed and bloodshed across many planets before the device was opened. Celeste, who never died, emerged expecting to see Zayne, but when she learned of the years passed, she knew her friend had failed. Taunted by the ghost of Karness Muur for centuries, Celeste eventually came to think that Zayne had abandoned her, until she encountered a former Jedi, Cade Skywalker, several more years later. When she entrusted Skywalker to end her life and destroy the Talisman, Celeste believed that Zayne had sent someone to help her after all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Padawan, Zayne showed himself to be very dedicated to the goals of the Jedi Order, as evidenced by his dogged and unsuccessful attempts to bring Marn Hierogryph to justice. However he was rather insecure about his place in the Order. He recognized that he was far behind his fellow Padawans in his training and feared that he would not attain Knighthood. He was so certain about his fate that he made plans to start a relationship with Shel Jelavan after he flunked out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even after he was accused of killing his fellow Padawans and went on the run, Zayne remained faithful to the ideals of the Order, such as self-sacrifice. Although he faced the possibility of death, Zayne willingly surrendered to the bounty hunter Valius Ying to keep Jarael, Camper and Gryph from danger. He would later demonstrate this again when he surrendered to Saul Karath in order to warn him of the Mandalorians' plan to bomb the cities of Serroco."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is also notable that Zayne, despite having participated in many battles during his exile, had not directly killed anyone. During the rescue at Flashpoint, he was able to free the imprisoned Revanchists without violence. After Celeste Morne asked him to strike her down to free her from the control of the Muur Talisman, Zayne was unable to bring himself to do the deed and found another solution that would not result in her death. Despite engaging in duels with two Jedi Masters of the Covenant, as well as a former Sith Acolyte under Exar Kun, he was not responsible for their ultimate demises."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the case of Raana Tey, he attempted to save her life despite her attempt to murder him just a short time before. Another instance where Zayne tried to save the lives of his enemies was when he notified Cassus Fett about the outbreak of the rakghoul plague among the Mandalorian army mobilizing on Jebble and advised him to cease landings on the planet to avoid more Mandalorians from succumbing to the disease."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the events of Vindication, Zayne grew more confident in his ability with the Force. He no longer held back from a battle, particularly when it meant rescuing his friends. He was able to rescue Gryph from the clutches of Nunk Plaarvin when he took on several Sentinel droids who were attempting to shove him out a viewport. Later, he attacked the Sith adept Toki Tollivar after he attempted to strangle Jarael to death. His confidence also manifested itself in other ways. Previously he had been on the receiving end of two kisses, both of which were meant to convey information or maintain a cover. However, when Jarael was hesitant of joining Malak and the Revanchists, Zayne took the initiative and kissed her to let Malak know that she would be following him and the crew of the Hot Prospect."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he was first accepted into the Jedi Order, Zayne was thought by Vandar Tokare to only possess a \"marginal\" ability in the Force. However, Vandar noted the young boy's natural ability to form close friendships with his fellow trainees and hoped that initiation would help this ability grow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zayne possessed a \"random destructive power\" which referred to his tendency to accidentally cause havoc as well as his reputation as an incompetent Padawan (only Marn Hierogryph viewed this as an asset).

This signified a connection to the Unifying Force as well, but unlike his masters who deliberately induced their visions to learn the future, Zayne\u2014who had seen firsthand how easily visions could be misinterpreted\u2014believed spontaneous visions to be the most reliable. He was understood to have had at least two visions, one which was of the devastation of Serroco. The first vision regarding his masters' fates was later revealed to be a trick thought up by Gryph."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Through access to Master Vandar's records from the Jedi Temple on Dantooine, Haazen found out about Zayne's \"special relation\" to the Force, a relation which Lucien was aware of but failed to report, and which the Jedi reportedly \"didn't know what to do\" with. Haazen described it as \"a reversal of fortunes\". It was thought of as an odd connection to the Living Force, one that allowed him to become stronger as a result of failure. Zayne was able to use this to unleash a powerful Force push against Lucien."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was until Zayne's brief conversation with Gryph before reaching Osadia that he revealed the bizarre nature of his force abilities -- \"Learning disabilities\" as he puts it. While others use force to achieve their desired outcomes like, lifting a wine cup with Telekinesis. Zayne failed to produce the most desirable result as he literally spilled his cup. Only for Gryth to \"enlighten\" him on the fact that while the Force didn't offer him a winning deck, the game itself is fair, and all that matters is how he play it. It was later that Zayne utilized this fact to outbalance Wyrick's Force grip, which resulted in Chantique and him killing each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Zayne's strengths in the Force, he had little success when forced to fight with his lightsaber. When he fought against Master Raana Tey of the Jedi Covenant, he was defeated, despite utilizing a jetpack during the duel. Only the intervention of Shel Jelavan saved his life. His fight with Feln, despite not using his lightsaber almost ended with Zayne's death until Borjak and the Feeorin people put an end to Feln's life. Zayne would also be defeated by the Sith adept Toki Tollivar, and almost killed until the Sith's droid Kayo and Demagol intervened. One of the only lightsaber duels in which Zayne was able to hold his own, the duel with Lucien Draay, turned out only to be a ruse for Zayne to gain Haazen's trust; the second example was shown in Zayne's brief fight against Chantique, despite the advantages given to her by Exar Kun's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zayne's ability in the Force showed a marked improvement after he cleared his name and entered his partnership with Gryph. During his fight to free the comet mining slaves in the Koornacht Cluster, Zayne used the Force to levitate almost eighty miners away from a rapidly disintegrating comet.
