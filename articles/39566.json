Eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master, Se'ol was a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. When the war came to an abrupt end as the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, Palpatine, betrayed the Order and dissolved the Republic, Master Se'ol fled execution by the Grand Army and took refuge on the planet Volik deep in the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Volik, Master Se'ol assisted the colonists he found there rebuild their homes that had been destroyed in recent time by groups of smugglers. During his exile there, Master Se'ol began a relationship with a woman called Vorena, whom he later married and produced a child with, whom they named Jolee. While Master Se'ol had been loyal to the Order, he had had many disagreements with the Jedi High Council. Despite this, Master Se'ol began training all of the Force-sensitives he could gather, guiding them as they grew in the Force and helping them control their emotions. Despite his training however, Master Se'ol was brought dangerously close to the dark side of the Force when his wife, Vorena, died."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his loss, Master Se'ol remained in the light and did not succumb to grief; instead he realized that through confronting the dark side, he came to further understand the Force and grow. Despite Master Se'ol's attempts to remain inconspicuous in the Unknown Regions, the Sith-controlled Galactic Empire came to Volik in search of the Jedi. Led by Sith Lord Darth Vader, an Imperial assault team attacked Volik and found Se'ol's compound. Confronting Vader, Master Se'ol was able to distract the Sith long enough for his students to escape. While Se'ol was cut down by the Sith Lord, his students escaped with his holocron, which would survive the collapse of the Empire and be discovered by the reformed Jedi Order during the Yuuzhan Vong War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
