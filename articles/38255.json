It was programed to serve Iden and Del faithfully during their service to the Galactic Empire and their subsequent defection to the New Republic. After being disabled by an ion pulse during the Battle of Theed and subsequent reactivation, the droid received a new yellow and white paint job and also acquired a very affectionate personality which caused it to constantly hound the Duros Shriv Suurgav.
