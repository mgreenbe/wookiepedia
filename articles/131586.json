It uses the d20 System, from the Wizards of the Coast Star Wars Roleplaying Game rules. The game also allows the player to either be a servant to the light side of the Force or the dark side, using an alignment system that tracks actions, from simple dialogue choices to major plot decisions. Combat is turn-based. Time is divided into discrete rounds, and combatants attack/react simultaneously. However, the number of actions a combatant may perform each round is limited. While the round's duration is a fixed short interval of real time (around six seconds), the player can configure the combat system to pause at specific events or at the end of each round."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A sequel - Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords - was developed by a different studio, Obsidian Entertainment, using an updated version of the Odyssey Engine from the first game.
