The planet Lanz Carpo fell under the governor's jurisdiction, but he had an agreement with the crime lord Boss Carpo and his syndicate, in which Carpo reported rebel operatives to the Empire. The Rebel Alliance sent Leia Organa and Han Solo on a mission to Lanz Carpo so that they could plant false messages and trick the Empire into believing that Carpo was a rebel collaborator. However, upon meeting District Advocate Dar Champion, Organa chose to instead upload messages tricking Carpo into thinking the governor was planning to attack him, hoping Carpo would leave Lanz Carpo to fight the Empire himself. During the mission, Solo was captured, forcing Organa to reveal their previous plan. In exchange for the rebels' freedom, Carpo requested that they eliminate the Imperial governor for him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
