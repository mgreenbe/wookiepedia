Growing weary of the general's disregard for droids, the tactical droid deliberately altered the orders before the Battle of Alamass. The new strategy ultimately resulted in a loss for the army, but it significantly cut down on casualties. Grievous stormed the bridge in response and destroyed the tactical droid with his lightsabers. Word spread of the droid's actions, eventually honored by the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid appears in the 2019 short story \"The Droid with a Heart\", in the anthology Myths & Fables."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
