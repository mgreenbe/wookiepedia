Purse-worlds were all located in the Colonies region of the galaxy, near the Neimoidian homeworld of Neimoidia. Cato Neimoidia, Deko Neimoidia, and Koru Neimoidia were such worlds. Because Narq was situated in the heart of the Purse Worlds, the Neimoidians ended up occupying that planet and reducing its natives to slavery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
