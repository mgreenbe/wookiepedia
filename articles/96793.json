Tavion, with the support of the Imperial Remnant, had established a Sith cult called the Disciples of Ragnos, whose aim was to resurrect the ancient Sith Lord Marka Ragnos and take over the galaxy. The Reborn serving Tavion became known as the \"New Reborn\" and replaced their hooded uniforms with heavy battle suits. They were elite cult members, possessing superior fighting skills and a greater knowledge of dark side Force powers than the ordinary cultists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Force and combat skills"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the experience gained from serving Desann and their subsequent retraining by Tavion, the New Reborn were the cult's most deadly members. They possessed superior lightsaber skills and greater knowledge of dark side Force powers than the ordinary Sith Cultists or Reborn under Desann's leadership. In combat, they were sufficiently skilled to the extent of being able to hold their own against, or in some cases defeat, average Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Reborn wore either red or blue battle suits. It seemed that those who wore red suits had a greater knowledge of dark side Force powers than those who wore blue, although their lightsaber abilities remained equal. Many were able to apply Jar'Kai and double-bladed lightsaber combat techniques. When fighting, they expressed arrogant behavior and often taunted their opponents to try and lower their resolve. The New Reborn sometimes preferred to spring on their opponents from a hiding place such as a ledge, ceiling or alcove rather than face them head on like a cultist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the same manner as Desann, Tavion dispatched her Cultists and New Reborn on various missions to locations all over the Galaxy. The New Reborn were generally deployed sparingly, usually present on missions of higher importance where the skills of the cultists were insufficient to accomplish their objectives. On these missions they faced several Jedi Knights from Skywalker's academy, among others Kyle Katarn, who was now a Jedi Master, and his highly talented apprentice, Jaden Korr. Korr most of all proved to be a nemesis of the Cultists and New Reborn, as he slew many of them on his adventures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Defeat at Korriban"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Reborn gathered in force but met their ultimate end on the planet Korriban. The battle was heated and the New Reborn and cultists proved fierce opponents for the army of Jedi from Skywalker's academy, especially due to their numerical advantage. The epic battle took place among the ancient Sith temples and tombs in the Valley of the Dark Lords. Despite their initial success in keeping the Jedi at bay, Jaden Korr eventually penetrated their defenses and killed most New Reborn who had fortified themselves inside in the Tomb of Marka Ragnos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prominent New Reborn"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Especially prominent New Reborn members were the Kothos twins, a pair of vicious Force users."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ranks of the New Reborn also included a handful of Reborn Masters. These skilled darksiders wore purple battle armor and wielded long lightsabers with hilts that resembled that of their original master, Desann. They were very powerful in both light and dark side Force techniques and were more than a match for most Jedi, such was their skill."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All the Reborns in the Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy game are voiced by the same two voice actors: Alastair Duncan and Dee Bradley Baker. These are different from the Reborn's voice actors in Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, unlike in the German dub of the series where the same set of actors can be heard in both games. Due to the New Reborn's different character (less organized, more secretive), however, their mannerism and speaking habits were radically changed in Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. Whereas the \"Old\" Reborn followed a rather formal speech pattern, up to using almost outdated honorifics and addressing opponents with \"Ihr\", the New Reborn stick to the colloquial \"Du\" and use more rude speech patterns without the elaborate language of their predecessors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
