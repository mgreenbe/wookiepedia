After Bane's success in obtaining the Kyber memory crystal at Devaron, Bane retreated to his station, located in the Outer Rim. The bounty hunter contacted the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, and told him that he retrieved both the holocron and crystal for him. Offering to help the Dark Lord once more, Bane asked the latter if he needed something else to be \"taken care of.\" Agreeing to Bane's wish, Sidious gave Bane a new mission: capture a total of four Force-sensitive infants, that are listed in the holocron, and deliver them to the remote planet of Mustafar. The Dark Lord planned to use them as test subjects in his experiments for the alteration of Force-sensitives to build his own personal corps of spies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Coruscant, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker meditated, along with Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and Yoda.

While Kenobi left for Rodia, Skywalker, along with his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, traveled to Naboo, where they were greeted by Captain Gregar Typho of the Royal Naboo Security Forces. The captain introduced the two Jedi to Lunker, a Gungan captain in charge of the operation of stopping Bane. Tano told Skywalker that she should go with the Gungan, and Skywalker agreed.

On his list, the bounty hunter was after a female infant Gungan named Roo-Roo Page, who was with her mother. After Bane entered the city, he soon arrived to his destination, and spotted the Gungan mother leaving an infant cradle. As the mother left the room, the bounty hunter approached it, and noticed a sheet covering something small underneath. Upon lifting the sheet, a toy tooka doll was exposed, with Page not found in the cradle. Behind Bane, Tano emerged from behind a blast door. Knowing that the Togruta Padawan hid the child from him, the Duros bounty hunter engaged her in a duel. Using his whipcord launcher, that was activated through his wrist gaunlet, Bane grabbed the Padawan's lightsaber from her grasp. Retrieving one of his LL-30 blaster pistols, the bounty hunter began to shoot at Tano, although the unarmed Tano dodged Bane's blaster fire, and hid behind some furniture. However, as she attempted to retrieve her fallen lightsaber, Bane evacuated the room using his jetpack-equipped boots. Before Bane could escape the city, Skywalker appeared on top of a roof, and grabbed onto Bane's boots. With the extra weight, Bane's boosters were disabled, and as the two tumbled onto a roof below, the hunter's hat was knocked off. The pair struggled before landing on the ground, and the outmatched Bane looked up to see Tano's ignited lightsaber pointing at his face."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon capturing Bane, Tano placed the bounty hunter in binders.

Although, Skywalker began to push Bane out the room. Taking Bane captive, the two Jedi sent the Duros to Skywalker's flagship, the Venator-class Star Destroyer, Resolute.
