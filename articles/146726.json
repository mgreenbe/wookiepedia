Commander Astred was in charge of the outpost, which was staffed by around 140 personnel. Sometime during the war, the base personnel were afflicted with the Direllian Plague which was introduced via bacteria in the food supplies and then went airborne. The base was quarantined and a continuous broadcast message was sent out to direct returning supply freighters to nearby Kirtania to acquire Shiarha Root and the services of Doctor T'Jaleq Kith'Araquia to combat the plague."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A group of Rebel agents successfully acquired a cure for the plague, and saved the base personnel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
