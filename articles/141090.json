The Union was also a droid producer, but, two years prior to the rescue of Yoda, a batch of their battle droids were stolen by Chagrian smugglers. Though the Jedi Order recovered the droids, at least several of which were B1-series battle droids, the Union was told that the units were now property of the Galactic Republic after they petitioned the Jedi Council for their return. The droids were later used in a staged kidnapping of Grand Master Yoda, which was part of a test for Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and Padawan Anakin Skywalker. Kenobi initially assumed the Union was behind the kidnapping, though Skywalker and him would ultimately learn it was a test."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the closing stages of the Separatist Crisis, Foreman Wat Tambor pledged his loyalty and droids Confederacy of Independent Systems, integrating its droid army into the Separatist Droid Army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Techno Union's droid army was first mentioned in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.
