He had a long and tumultuous career that helped shape the fate of the entire galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born in 57 BBY on Stewjon, Kenobi was taken as the Jedi apprentice of Qui-Gon Jinn and traveled on many missions with him. During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, Kenobi became the first Jedi in approximately 1,000 years to defeat a Sith Lord in combat when he defeated Darth Maul during the Battle of Naboo, yet lost his master in the same duel. He would suffer another loss In 22 BBY in the form of the death of fellow jedi Siri Tachi whom Kenobi had romantic feelings for. That same year, Kenobi found the Clone army on Kamino, and he was captured and almost executed in the Petranaki arena on Geonosis, along with Skywalker and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. The newly arrived clone troopers rescued them, but the following battle began the galaxy-wide Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a High Jedi General, Kenobi fought during many battles of the Clone Wars, and was one of the last members of the Jedi High Council. Even after his apprentice became a Jedi Knight, Kenobi and Skywalker fought together many times, becoming a widely renowned pair. Kenobi earned the sobriquet \"the Negotiator\" through his charm and calm demeanor as well as the quiet threat of his abilities with a lightsaber. During the war, an old enemy returned to haunt Kenobi: Darth Maul, the murderer of Qui-Gon Jinn. With aid of his brother, Savage Opress, the revived Sith Lord went to create a criminal empire, all the while plotting revenge on his most despised adversary. Kenobi clashed blades with Maul on occasion across the galaxy. He was devastated as Maul slew the Jedi's past love interest, Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore, in cold blood, yet remained strong throughout the conflict. Later in the war, Skywalker saved his life in a battle fought over Coruscant, after which Kenobi killed General Grievous on Utapau. However, he was soon betrayed, as Commander Cody, following Order 66, opened fire on him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi met up with his old mentor Grand Master Yoda, and the two realized that not many Jedi had survived the attacks. The two returned to the Jedi Temple, where they learned the agonizing truth: Skywalker, now lost to the dark side of the Force, had led an attack to kill all Jedi remaining in the Jedi Temple, following orders from Chancellor Palpatine, the ruler of the successor of the Republic, the Galactic Empire. Kenobi traveled to Mustafar in order to duel his former apprentice and friend, now the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Finally, Vader was taken in by a storm of lava, and Kenobi remorsefully left him to die. While Yoda, one of the few other Jedi to survive the Great Jedi Purge, went into exile, Kenobi took the son of Skywalker and Amidala, Luke Skywalker, to live with the Lars family on Tatooine. He became a friend of the young Skywalker as he grew up, but he did not tell Skywalker his actual identity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi re-emerged in 0 BBY, shortly before the Battle of Yavin. After Leia Organa, Vader's daughter and Luke Skywalker's twin sister, was captured by the Empire, she contacted him desperately. Kenobi gave Luke his father's lightsaber and traveled with him to Alderaan in Han Solo's Millennium Falcon, only to realize that the Death Star had destroyed the planet. Kenobi entered the Death Star with Luke, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2, in order to rescue Organa, but Darth Vader sensed his presence. In a duel with his former apprentice, Kenobi gave up his life to allow Luke to escape, vanishing into the Force the moment Vader struck him down with his weapon. Three years later, his spirit returned to Luke to lead him to Dagobah in order to learn from Master Yoda. He even carried out his role as a mentor to the younger Jedi beyond his natural life through use of the Force, remaining a significant influence on Luke Skywalker's foundation of the New Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life (57 BBY\u201332 BBY)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan Kenobi was born in 57 BBY, the first son of a moderately wealthy family, and was taken to Coruscant to begin his Jedi training while still in his infancy. His homeworld was Stewjon, from which Kenobi himself believed that he had once visited, possessing vague, pleasant memories of playing with his brother, Owen. In reality, Kenobi would later conclude that these memories were visions from the Force of Owen Lars. The fraternity he felt between himself and Owen was true, from a certain point of view. As Kenobi felt a brotherly bond with his former student, Lars too would be his brother."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Youngling"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Jedi Initiate, Kenobi trained under Grand Master Yoda alongside other Jedi hopefuls of his age; later he would be placed into a clan under the tutelage of Master Vant. Bant Eerin, Garen Muln and Quinlan Vos became Kenobi's friends, and he eventually fell in love with fellow Padawan, Siri Tachi. Others would become rivals, and even enemies, such as Bruck Chun and Aalto. His lightsaber instructors included Anoon Bondara and Cin Drallig."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a youngling, Kenobi had been fascinated by machines, building models of ships and even dreaming of becoming a pilot. Ironically, as he grew older, Kenobi came to despise flying. His ability to repair machinery and reprogram computers would serve him well in the future, but because of his ability to learn quickly, Kenobi became arrogant and was often impatient. Under the careful guidance of Master Yoda, however, Kenobi became more humble and reserved."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Becoming Qui-Gon's apprentice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his rapid growth as a Jedi, by the time Kenobi reached the age of twelve, it seemed that his chances of becoming a Jedi Knight had all but passed him by; Younglings who weren't selected to be Padawans by the age of 13 would be shifted into one of the divisions of the Jedi Service Corps. One day, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn visited the Jedi Temple to watch the matches. Kenobi dueled one of his competitors, Bruck Chun, to draw the attention of the maverick Jedi Knight. Kenobi fought valiantly to the point of exhaustion. The final offensive against Chun was carried out so fiercely that Jinn thought Kenobi too dangerous and declined training the boy. Kenobi was sent to the mining colony of Bandomeer to work as a ploughman for the AgriCorps. Strangely enough, Jinn happened to be sent on a mission to the same place. The youngling and the Jedi Knight had to work together if they wanted to survive the mission, which was a trap set for Jinn by his former Padawan, Xanatos. Kenobi showed Jinn that he was worthy to be taken as a Padawan learner en route, when they were attacked by members of Xanatos' criminal organization, the Offworld Mining Corporation. After putting an end to the tense situation, the two arrived on Bandomeer, where Jinn received a letter signed by Xanatos. It turned out that Bandomeer was not in need of Jedi assistance; it had all been organized by Xanatos, who was revealed to be the leader of Offworld, a company whose ruthless business practices and mining operations terrorized all of the citizens on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn sent Kenobi off to his AgriCorps duties while he planned to meet with Xanatos, not as old adversaries, but as ambassadors, working to find an agreement between Offworld and Bandomeer. Xanatos, however, planned all along to sabotage their meeting and kill Jinn. With the help of Kenobi, Jinn once more attempted to end Xanatos' acts of terror. Jinn dueled with his former apprentice, and though they ended Offworld's business on Bandomeer, Xanatos was able to escape. During their altercation with Xanatos, Jinn discovered Kenobi's true potential, and took him as his new Padawan learner. Their relationship got off to a bad start, as the pair's personalities were constantly at odds; Jinn was headstrong, while Kenobi was more practical. As time went on, however, their opposing natures blended them into an effective duo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For his thirteenth birthday, Kenobi received a river stone from Jinn, something that came from the River of Light on the Jedi Master's homeworld. The stone was later revealed to be Force-sensitive. It had helped Kenobi save his memories when he was almost erased by the Syndicat, a criminal organization on Phindar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi and his master were later called to monitor the elections on Gala. The two discovered that the leader of the hill people, Elan, was the actual heir to the throne. The Jedi also saw through the current Prince Beju's plan to secretly cut off the planet's bacta supply, wait for the people to suffer and then fix it again, making him look like a hero in the eyes of his people, however the two Jedi were able to expose this plan. After Beju withdrew from the elections, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon attempted to convince Elan to run for queen, but she instead wanted Wila Prammi, who was far more experienced, to become queen. After the elections ended with Wila becoming queen, Elan returned to the hills with her people, now living more peacefully with the people of Gala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time with Jinn, Kenobi temporarily left the Jedi Order. Caught up in the civil war on Melida/Daan, Kenobi elected to stay and help the children, otherwise known as the Young, who were fighting against their tradition-obsessed elders. The planet's residents had been fighting a pointless war for generations, and had actually forgotten what had started the feud. Kenobi befriended a boy within the Young called Nield, and possibly developed an attraction for another of the Young named Cerasi. Soon after Kenobi's decision to stay, Cerasi was mortally wounded and died in Kenobi's arms. For a time, Kenobi remained on the planet to continue helping the war effort, but soon enough felt that his place was with the Jedi and was taken back by Jinn, though it took a long time for them to fully trust each other again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn and Kenobi eventually caught up with Xanatos when the Dark Jedi was planning an attack on Master Yoda. The two were able to find and engage him before his plans went into effect, though. It would be while foiling Xanatos that Kenobi was forced to fight his long time rival, Bruck Chun. Chun had kidnapped Kenobi's friend Bant Eerin while working with Xanatos, and Kenobi engaged the misguided youth in a lightsaber duel. Kenobi won the duel when Chun fell off a ledge and died, though he would carry the guilt for many years. After he escaped, Xanatos returned to his homeworld of Telos. Kenobi and Jinn went after him. On Telos, however, they were not very welcomed. They were astonished to find out that Xanatos wielded significant financial and political power there. He was considered a hero to his people. What the people of the planet did not know is that while Xanatos and the government had been distracting them with a form of gambling called Katharsis, Offworld had been pillaging the planet's resources. The two Jedi were then framed and wanted for a crime they did not commit. Xanatos captured them, but the two Jedi managed to escape. Xanatos committed suicide by diving into a pool of acid after Jinn stopped his plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was during this time that Kenobi first spoke to Siri Tachi, whom he had met during lightsaber training at the Temple. They started off on rocky terms, as she was angry at him for leaving the Order, but would later forge a friendship that would last the rest of their lives, and even develop into something more. Kenobi and Tachi were together sent on a mission with their respective masters, Qui-Gon Jinn and Adi Gallia, to the planet Kegan. A simple mission to test a child for Force-sensitivity quickly devolved into a non-violent uprising to overthrow Kegan's Benevolent Guides after Kenobi and Tachi were mistakenly captured for truancy and sent to the planet's Learning Circle. Unable to slip away, the Padawans had to withstand brainwashing at the hands of the Teaching Guides, who sought to enforce The Learning curriculum upon them to teach the two the value of the General Good. After being reassigned to the Re-Learning Circle for lack of discipline, Kenobi and Tachi, having learned to work together and with a little help from their Masters, soon escaped with their new friend Davi and O-Lana, the child they had originally come to the planet for. The Keganites, upon discovering what really went on in the Re-Learning Circle, quickly voted out their leaders while Kenobi and his fellow Jedi were still on-planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, Kenobi would travel with Jinn to Ilum to make his first lightsaber. While there, Jinn and Kenobi were sent to Ord Sigatt to investigate the disappearance of a Republic refinery ship. After noticing the low attitudes and that no one had any weapons (except for guards), Kenobi met the Besalisk Dexter Jettster, who was selling weapons to the people of Ord Sigatt. Jettster was told to wait for Kenobi as a fight had broken out between a boy who threw a rock at a guard. The Jedi jumped in and sliced the guards weapons before returning to Jettster, who commented on how a lightsaber could stand for danger and for hope. Jettster and Kenobi would soon become friends. Jinm soon came back with information that a senator from Denon, Denon-Ardru Mutual, had sent a small army to put a monopoly on the mining business there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi fought alongside his master in the Stark Hyperspace War, one of the last of the many small-scale conflicts that plagued the Galactic Republic in its final days. It was during the Fourth Battle of Qotile when Kenobi's enduring friendship with fellow Padawan Quinlan Vos truly began.

The rulers of each planet temporarily exchanged children when they reached the age of seven and raised them in an effort to get the future leaders to appreciate each other. The plan backfired after hundreds of years of success, however, when the heir of Rutan decided he wanted to remain on Senali, forsaking his royal title and home planet. This infuriated his father, King Frane, who believed his son had been brainwashed by the Senali, and he threatened to declare war on Senali. Kenobi and Jinn arrived to mediate the dispute, and after meeting with King Frane, they went to the ocean world of Senali and attempted to convince Leed to return to Rutan, thus avoiding war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan returned to Coruscant, they were asked for help by a man called Didi Oddo, who was being targeted by a bounty hunter called Ona Nobis. After a series of brief fights, all ending with Nobis escaping, Nobis was able to kidnap Qui-Gon. Obi-Wan, with the help of Jedi Adi Gallia and her Padawan, Siri Tachi, was able to find Nobis again on planet Belasco, where the four fought on a rooftop. Nobis had her whip lassoed around a drainpipe and their duel ended with Gallia cutting the whip in half, resulting in Nobis falling to her death. Obi-Wan figured out that a scientist who experimented on Force-sensitives named Jenna Zan Arbor was responsible for hiring Nobis. Together with his friend, Astri Oddo, Obi-Wan went to Jenna Zan Arbor's secret laboratory and rescued his master, however Arbor was able to escape. Obi-Wan joined his master, Adi Gallia and Siri Tachi in their search to find Arbor again, but they were unsuccessful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point between 44 and 32 BBY, Kenobi and Jinn were sent on an extended mission to Mandalore, which was engulfed in the Mandalorian Great Clan Wars.

Together, the two Jedi spent a year on Mandalore protecting the Duchess from the hostile insurgents threatening her world.

The two Jedi spent days on figuring out that an organization called the Absolutes had kidnapped her, as they had seen her protect one of their enemies. Qui-Gon soon found Tahl again, however he found that it was too soon, as she had been drugged with paralytic drugs to the point of her death. Obi-Wan later reflected upon Tahl's death, remembering seeing the refusal to accept the fact in his Master's eyes: as a Padawan, he'd thought it impossible that a Jedi Knight could die, but he later came to believe that the first moment of his adulthood had come when he'd seen Qui-Gon's face register the fact that Tahl was dead. The death of his partner resulted in Qui-Gon becoming obsessed with finding the drugger, Balog, but as he was about to strike him down, he realized what he had become and stopped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One year later, Obi-Wan and his master were sent to Frego, where they had to protect Lena Cobral, a woman who wanted to testify her husband's death in front of the Galactic Senate, but was too afraid to go alone, as she believed that the murderers of her husband, who were also her family members, were out to kill her.

A natural swordsman, Kenobi's ability was evident even at a young age. During his training under Qui-Gon Jinn, Kenobi chose to specialize in Ataru, his relatively advanced skills reinforced by his youth and stamina, which helped compensate for his relative inexperience. While he relied on the acrobatics to flank his opponents, and to facilitate his strong penchant for physical attacks, Kenobi largely eschewed the more impractical elements of Ataru, such as the open flourishes, favoring more simplistic and direct moves. In addition to Ataru, Kenobi also studied Shien, as evidenced by his accurate blast-deflections and his occasional use for the reversed grip, and Niman, to develop his ability to incorporate Force abilities into his fighting form. He also studied the martial art Tae-Jitsu, and was very fond of chaining hand-to-hand combat strikes into his lightsaber sequences. His degree of skill with this martial art was such that he was able to break the knee of the hulking Savage Opress with a well placed kick, though it should be noted that Opress's knee had been weakened from repeated trauma earlier in the duel. Kenobi also displayed an early interest in studying Form VII, specifically Mace Windu's Vaapad variant, but Qui-Gon refused to let him study it. Ultimately, Qui-Gon Jinn's death due to Ataru's lack of defensive capabilities prompted Kenobi to abandon Form IV as his primary style, but he mastered it nonetheless. Kenobi began studying the defensive Soresu, intending to create a hybrid between it and Ataru to compensate for Form IV's aforementioned lack of defense. Though Soresu eventually became his primary fighting form, he implemented elements of Ataru into his swordplay from time to time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ten years of study into Form III resulted in Kenobi developing an extraordinary amount of proficiency in the form. His tight defense and energy-efficient moves stood him in good stead against masterful gunslingers such as Jango Fett, or during the chaotic firefights of the First Battle of Geonosis. However, Kenobi's Soresu proved unable to effectively counter Dooku's skills during their first confrontation. On that occasion, Dooku's elegant Makashi strokes and jabs worked away at Kenobi's defense; many of Kenobi's cutting parries missed Dooku's blade entirely, while Dooku's feints confused the Jedi and forced him to retreat, ultimately bringing him down. Over the course of the Clone Wars, Kenobi continued to develop his technique. His blast-deflection skills were further honed to the point where Kenobi could literally walk unscathed through what were described as hornet-swarms of blasterfire, single-handedly deflecting blasts from all directions simultaneously. Thousands of hours of sparring and practice sessions considerably advanced his skills as a duelist as well. Even unarmed, Kenobi was a formidable opponent, evading enemy attacks and working his way inside their defense to physically assault them, as he did against Asajj Ventress and Pre Vizsla. In addition to Soresu, Kenobi would also master and incorporate elements of Shii-Cho and Niman into his fighting style. He also was highly well versed in the art of Jar'Kai, which was perhaps most prominently displayed during his duel with Darth Maul and Savage Opress, as he proved proficient enough to hold his own against both brothers and he even managed to break Opress's left knee and sever his left arm. The dual ultimately ended as a stalemate when Maul used his Force powers to briefly incapacitate Kenobi, giving the Sith brothers time to escape. Earlier on, he momentarily used Jar'Kai against Asajj Ventress, General Grievous, and Cad Bane."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the end of the war, Kenobi's study into Soresu had resulted in absolute mastery of the style. His skill was such that he was considered by Mace Windu not to simply be a master of Soresu, but to be the master of Soresu. In his final duel with Dooku, Kenobi caught the Count off-guard with his advanced application, with Kenobi's simplicity and efficiency as well as also his bewildering speed and precision being praised by Dooku, and was able to fight him to a standstill, to the point that Dooku recognized that he couldn't defeat Kenobi in blade-work. Therefore, he relied on his Force abilities to defeat Kenobi, twice using telekinetic attacks to floor the Jedi Master. In his duel with Grievous, Kenobi provided one of his purest applications of Soresu. His blade's intricate pattern of blocks and parries moved just fast enough to subtly interfere with Grievous' multiple strikes, while his slight dodges and shifts of stance allowed him to simply evade the rest. His mastery allowed him to comfortably counter up to eighteen of Grievous's strikes per second. When Grievous intensified his attack, Kenobi stopped stonewalling the general and simply began altering the angle of his parries, cutting off two of Grievous' mechanical hands. Kenobi proved to be one of the only Jedi able to engage Darth Vader and survive, as his Soresu mastery perfectly countered Vader's angry Form V. Kenobi simply gave ground before Vader's onslaught, waiting until Vader grew frustrated and overconfident, and then dismembering the hapless Sith Lord when his defense lapsed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of his rematch with Vader on the Death Star, however, Kenobi's seventeen years of not duelling, apart from the one point where he fought and came out on top over A'Sharad Hett, had made him out of practice, causing his skills to atrophy to an extent. However, Kenobi retained enough skill in Form III to be able to fight against Vader's newly improved skills well-enough that even the Dark Lord had to praise Kenobi's skills and acknowledged them enough that he opted for a cautious, controlled assault instead of an all-out attack despite Kenobi's older age due to having previously learned from his mistake in Mustafar. Although he was not able to find any openings to exploit, it was still impressive that Kenobi was able to still predict all of Vader's attacks and counter them, considering how Vader's new style contained elements of all forms of lightsaber combat and he was even able to briefly force Vader into the defensive with a flurry of attacks when the Dark Lord was off-guard. Ultimately, however, due to his age, lack of practice, and the sheer physical force of Vader's attacks, Kenobi recognized that his defeat was inevitable despite having put up a good fight and rather than continue the fight, he opted to sacrifice his physical self and become one with the Force. In this way, he taught both of his Skywalker students one final lesson."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force powers"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Kenobi focused largely on lightsaber combat he was also very skilled and powerful in use of the Force. At one point, Anakin compared Kenobi to Mace Windu in terms of Force power. He was trained in use of the Mind trick, Force persuasion and the more advanced Dominate Mind skill.

The two struggled against each other for a short time, and though Kenobi was clearly giving ground, they both ended up being hurled in opposite directions across the room they were in. The fact that Vader's connection to the Force was, at the time, stronger than any known Force user in history further exemplifies Kenobi's mastery of the technique. Obi-Wan was capable of other telekinetic feats and could use the Force to increase his body's endurance and agility, amplifying his speed to such an extent that he could literally disappear from sight in a blur, either to avoid attacks or to strike first with his own.

This was all the more impressive considering that flamethrowers were so difficult to counter with the Force that they were considered a favorite among Jedi hunters. He later demonstrated the ability to deflect blaster bolts from a destroyer droid with the Force. During Kenobi's second bout with Durge, which occurred only a few minutes after their first encounter, Durge absorbed the Jedi Master into his body and attempted to smother him. However, Kenobi managed to use a Force Repulse (or some variation of the technique), to destroy the bounty hunter's body from within.
