A tubular rifle, the device launched a cone of chemically treated high-tensile filaments. On striking an object, these filaments coil themselves tightly around the intended target, while simultaneously beginning to expand and contract. Within seconds, the wires fuse themselves into a hard cocoon like shell, effectively incapacitating the victim within."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
