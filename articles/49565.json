In 3999 BBY, Fnnbu accompanied a group consisting of both Stonebone's pirate gang and enforcers in the employ of the Stenness Node\u2013based crime lord Bogga the Hutt, on a mission to the desolate planet Ambria. The ensemble was sent by Bogga to retrieve a lost shipment of Adegan crystals from Bogga's sworn enemy, Jedi Master Thon, in exchange for Bogga's granting of freedom to Stonebone's crew, who had been captured after a failed raid on an Ithullian ore hauler. The group descended onto Ambria's surface adjacent to Master Thon's compound, and soon encountered Master Thon, who to their surprise refused to fight back. One of Bogga's men soon found the Adegan crystals, although the enforcer refused to share them with the pirates. While Fnnbu and Stonebone argued with the enforcers over who would claim credit for the discovery of the crystals, Thon's Jedi apprentice, Nomi Sunrider, used a Force power called battle meditation, hoping to influence the minds of the invading crew to turn them against each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fnnbu was the first to fall under the will of Nomi Sunrider's battle meditation.

A large brawl broke out between the enforcers and the pirates, and eventually pirates and enforcers were fighting beings on their own respective sides. Fnnbu personally squared off with C'borp, a fellow pirate and chief gunner on the pirate ship Marauder Starjacker.
