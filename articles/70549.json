Jensyn arrived on Korriban with reinforcements and struck down Dark Council member Darth Soverus in the Dark Council chambers inside the Sith Academy. After the Republic strike team that cleaned Jensyn's way inside the Academy reported back to Colonel Darok, Jensyn secretly recovered a Rakata artifact from the Academy and arranged for its transportation offworld. Before Jensyn could leave though, he was confronted by an Imperial strike team that came to retake the Sith Academy. Realizing that his destiny was happening, Jensyn engaged his opponents but was overpowered and mortally wounded. As he lay dying, Jensyn defiantly stated \"It's already happening,\" but died without giving an explanation over the plan or revealing Revan's plan to build the Infinite Army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jensyn is voiced by Steve Blum."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
