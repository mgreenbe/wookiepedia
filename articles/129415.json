Examples included landspeeders such as the XP-38 sport landspeeder; the term also applied to airspeeders, which were not strictly repulsorcraft as they did not hover above the ground. Some speeders had afterburners that enabled high-speed flight. Airspeeders were able to fly at altitudes higher than landspeeders, some reaching heights of more than 250 kilometers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
