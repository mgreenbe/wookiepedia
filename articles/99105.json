Investigations into missing ships and the death of Rapier Squadron pilot Muran led New Republic ace Poe Dameron to this system. While tracking the freighter that had killed Muran, Dameron entered OR-Kappa-2722 and ended up engaging a force of First Order TIE/sf and TIE/fo space superiority fighters, where he destroyed four ships. It was this event, and the New Republic's inaction despite the death of one of their own, that led to Dameron leaving the fleet of the New Republic and joining the growing Resistance movement headed by Leia Organa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
