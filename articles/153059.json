Tagge, along with a group of bounty hunters, was actually searching for the Great Life Jewels, two red gems that could create a fatal disease known as the Crimson Forever when they were separated. Tagge hoped to use the gems' deadly powers in order to destroy both the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Star Destroyer encountered Tagge's Mining Explorer on its way back from the Red Nebula, it destroyed the bulk freighter's drive engines. Stormtroopers boarded the vessel and forced Tagge to surrender her find. The Imperial boarding party received only one of the two gems, placed by Tagge in a carbonite cannister rigged to open under the pressures of hyperdrive. Tagge also gave the Imperials the location of the new Rebel base on Golrath, which she had learned from her spies. Tagge then orchestrated a firefight between her bounty hunters and the stormtroopers, which forced the boarders to leave the Mining Explorer, effectively separating the two Great Life Jewels."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In the Golrath system"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the firefight, the Imperials abandoned the damaged Mining Explorer on the fringes of the Red Nebula. The Star Destroyer set a course for Golrath and jumped to hyperspace. As a result, the carbonite cannister holding the gem opened and the Crimson Forever spread aboard the ship. When the Star Destroyer arrived in the Golrath system, the entire crew had succumbed from the effects of the plague."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after its arrival in the Golrath system, the Rebels detected the Star Destroyer and sent Red Flight to intercept it. The group of X-wing starfighters, led by Commander Luke Skywalker, found no life form readings from inside the Star Destroyer and decided to board the ship to investigate. Aboard the Star Destroyer, the Rebel pilots found the crimson bodies of the Imperials, most of them still at their stations. They also discovered the red gem in one of the ship's laboratories. The Rebels soon became infected with the Crimson Forever and Skywalker ordered an immediate evacuation of the boarding party. After their return to Golrath Station, all the Rebels that were in contact with the plague perished, except Skywalker whose Force-sensitivity enabled him to fight it better."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fortunately, Han Solo and Chewbacca had previously encountered such red gems during a previous misadventure in the Red Nebula. After hearing the Wookiee's tale of the event, Leia Organa, Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca decided to travel to the Red Nebula aboard the Millennium Falcon in hopes of finding a cure for the Crimson Forever. On their way to the Red Nebula, they encountered the derelict Mining Explorer. After a short fight, they agreed to free Tagge and her companions in order to reunite the two red gems and end the Crimson Forever. The Rebels then left the Great Life Jewels inside the Star Destroyer's bridge and programmed the ship to jump to hyperspace toward the Intergalactic Void."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In the Unknown Regions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During its journey however, the Star Destroyer was pulled out of hyperspace in the Unknown Regions because of the gravity well generated by a sun about to go supernova.

This mission was funded by the Tof resistance, which also sought revenge on the New Republic after the Tof defeat during the Nagai\u2013Tof War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a hunch, a New Republic team went after the Star Destroyer in order to stop Tagge's plan. There, they found the red gems but were caught up by Tagge and her mercenaries. To their surprise, the cyborg Beilert Valance also arrived on the scene in hopes of using the gems' powers to restore his damaged body. Eventually, Valance sacrificed himself to reunite the two red gems and save Skywalker. Plunging in the vacuum of space, Valance brought the Great Life Jewels together, healing his body in the process, and let himself be pulled by the sun's gravity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This unidentified Imperial-class Star Destroyer first appeared in issue 50 of the Marvel Star Wars comic series, published on May 19, 1981.
