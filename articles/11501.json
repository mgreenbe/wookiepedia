The BL0-series was designed to neutralize its targets rather than killing them, using an array of non-lethal countermeasures including stun whips. The droid scuttled on three legs and had robust hyperarticulated arms. Their effectiveness in combat led many of them to be repurposed as security droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
