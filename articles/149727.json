V-Tarz, one Truant Guide, captured Obi-Wan Kenobi and Siri Tachi during a sweep, not believing they were visitors to the planet. Although he had been told by Security Guide V-Brose that physical force was not necessary, V-Tarz used an electro-jabber to capture the truants, then roughly hauled them back to the Learning Circle in a landspeeder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
