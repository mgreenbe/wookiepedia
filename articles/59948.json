Because of this, if the wielder did not have the skills perfected and attempted to use them during a storm, they would be repeatedly struck by lightning. However, when perfected, they allowed the wielder to disable prosthetics and electric implants, interfere with shock shackles, become a range-boosting antenna for a comlink, among other uses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ayna-seff\u2014which translated to \"dead brain\"\u2014technique was in the hassat-durr family.
