When it was destroyed by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, they caused a radiation experiment to backfire on him, confining him to a protective suit that only slowed his eventual demise. As part of his final experiment, Arakkus used an abandoned Imperial transport to accelerate the collapse of a dwarf star through negatron impact charge bombardment, making it so dense its gravitational pull was impossible to overcome, and lured others to their doom, eventually creating a Graveyard of Lost Ships. He was killed when Han Solo detonated Arakkus' cargo of negatron charges to free the Millennium Falcon from the dwarf star's grip."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Human, Arakkus had gray hair and light skin, which was covered in green splotches after being contaminated by radiation.
