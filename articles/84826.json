Capable of firing ten high powered shots, the disruptor was advertised as being able to stop a charging Wookiee dead in its tracks. While more than capable of living up to its advertising, the weapon did generate an abnormal amount of kick per shot for a blaster, as well as a large amount of heat; flash-heating of the barrel has burned the hand of many an untrained user when trying to holster the weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
