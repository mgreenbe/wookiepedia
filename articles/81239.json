As with the worlds of the Lan system, except for Lan Barell, Lesser Galam was incapable of supporting life, having a scorched climate and a desolate, waterless and rocky surface. Lesser Galam was extremely ore-rich, a fact which lead to its discovery by the Galactic Republic, sometime around 1300 BBY. Soon after, the Gaminne Group, Inc.\u2014a Human mining conglomerate\u2014purchased the system's mining rights from Lan Barell's native species, the Qieg, and started exploring the mineral resources, shipping ore to many resource-poor systems. The Qieg and the Human colonists would in time form a stable government, the Human-Qieg Guild, administrating over the entire system. The system would eventually become part of the Galactic Empire's space, although the Empire didn't have official presence there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lesser Galam first and only mention, thus far, was in the article \"Lan Barell,\" written by Paul Sudlow and published within the Star Wars Adventure Journal 1 in 1994."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
