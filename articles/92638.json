Baras ordered his apprentice to track down kill Monk, however the admiral and his top men had fled the space battle and jettisoned to the planet before the Sith even arrived on the scene. On Quesh, Monk and his men made a stand inside Fort Phalanx, where the Sith Warrior engaged them and struck them all down. Monk was disgusted at the treachery of Baras, who acted to take him down with seemingly no reason and told the apprentice that no one was safe from Baras, not even the Warrior himself, before dying. This prediction came true, ironically on Quesh itself, where Baras betrayed and tried to kill his apprentice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
