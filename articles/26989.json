The Saresh family were natives of Taris, but in the past they were known for their arrogance and cruelty as much as their immense wealth and political influence. As such, when Guun Han's father commissioned the Circlet as a gift marking the young Twi'lek's entry into the Jedi Order, he made sure that it was crafted in such a way as to make it usable only by a servant of the light side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Circlet boosted its wearer's abilities in the Force. It was lost when Guun Han was devoured by a terentatek during the his attempt to kill the creature during the Great Hunt. Revan later recovered the Circlet and may have worn it at some point during his quest for the Star Forge during the Jedi Civil War. It is also possible that five years later, Meetra Surik may have come across the Circlet and used it during the First Jedi Purge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and its sequel, the Circlet provides a +5 bonus to the character's Wisdom attribute."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There is a mistake in Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords which allows the item to spawn at random.
