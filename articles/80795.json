His hope was that events in the crossover would genuinely affect the characters of each series, keeping existing fans satisfied while simultaneously attracting new ones. John Ostrander and Jan Duursema, the creative team behind Legacy, helped Stradley plan the crossover, which was eventually dubbed Star Wars: Vector. They were committed to telling a good story within Legacy's chapters of the tale. As a twelve-issue event that would be told in the pages of all four series throughout 2008, Vector would conclude within issues 28\u201331 of Legacy. Ostrander and Duursema decided that the death of Darth Krayt, the series' primary antagonist, would be the large event that would bring Vector to a close. Accordingly, nearly every issue of Legacy published in 2008 served to build up to Krayt's death, moving various pieces of the story into motion. Legacy 23 introduces the character of Azlyn Rae, a character who would go on to play a large role in Legacy's chapters of Vector and deliver one of the killing strokes to Krayt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The comic is the twenty-third issue of Legacy and the first of two issues in the series' Star Wars: Legacy: Loyalties story arc.

It is the first issue of Legacy since its nineteenth to feature the bounty hunter Cade Skywalker, the series' principal protagonist. The nineteenth issue saw Skywalker escape from the clutches of Darth Krayt, and Legacy 23 focuses on his actions and decisions immediately thereafter. Skywalker speaks several words of Huttese in the issue, and a short glossary appears within the comic's letters column. Ostrander consulted the Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide, published in 2001, in order to accurately portray the language."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The issue was written by Ostrander, penciled by Duursema, and edited by Stradley.

A reviewer called \"Graceland Geek\" at the website Geeks of Doom felt that it was a filler issue where not very much happened, but praised the cliffhanger ending for leaving the reader wanting to read more. They asserted that the issue's best quality was that it felt like a genuine Star Wars story, but believed that the art was rough in some places. On TheForce.net, reviewer JF Boivin awarded the issue 7.5/10, praising its personal story for balancing out the galaxy-shattering events of previous issues, yet still depicting the Sith as manipulating events behind the scenes.
