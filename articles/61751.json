Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala served it at one of the meetings held in her apartment for the Delegation of 2000, a group of senators opposed to Supreme Chancellor Palpatines use of emergency powers during the war. At the meeting Amidala's protocol droid C-3PO served the broth on a tray, and Pantoran senator Chi Eekway Papanoida drank some, although she refused a second tube of it. Amidala's husband, Anakin Skywalker, later realized she had held the meeting after he smelt Hoi-broth and knew she would not have consumed it herself.
