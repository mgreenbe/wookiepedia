They used this tactic to infiltrate Borsk Fey'lya Army Base on Vandor-3 by disguising the droids as blaster cartridges. In order to speed things up, the Wraiths attacked the base's patrols and confiscated their weapons under the guise of the Quad-Linked Militant Pacifists a fictional terror group created for that purpose. This required new requisition orders for weapons which meant that the Wraith-modified weapons were issued to the patrols."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
