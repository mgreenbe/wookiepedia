One such farm was owned by Condren Foreck, a potential suitor to Lando Calrissian.\nIt played a minor part in the Yuuzhan Vong War as a base for the New Republic/Galactic Alliance. After the war the Galactic Alliance abandoned the base. It was never a part of the Alliance until after the war. The Prime Minister of the planet decided to join the Alliance, so he sent two senators to Coruscant to the Galactic Alliance Senate. The planet turned out to be valuable during the Second Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The PC game Star Wars: Rebellion and Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide misspell the planet as \"Azbian.\" Ambush at Corellia and The Essential Atlas confirm the correct spelling as \"Azbrian.\" Additionally, Rebellion places Azbian in the Jospro sector of the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
