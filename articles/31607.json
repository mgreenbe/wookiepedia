Crodium was used in the early spacecraft that traveled via the hyperspace cannon, though was rarely used in modern shipbuilding. Crodium was also mined on Terephon used in making security fences. It was refined to plate other metals. If exposed to the elements for too long, it could tarnish."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
