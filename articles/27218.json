The ClanRing would be held by the Riileb whom controlled Riileb society, the eldest female member of the motherclan, a group of Riileb supposedly descended from the First Riileb. The female would inherit it at the age of 30 in local years, which was the equivalent of 30 standard years. Political infighting and deceit was common amongst the motherclan and heirs would often be disposed of by other members who stood to inherit after them. Tere Metallo was one such heir and was sold into slavery by a jealous sister at the age of 25."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ClanRing was first mentioned in the short story \"Rendezvous with Destiny\" written by Charlene Newcomb which was published in 1995 in the sixth issue of the Star Wars Adventure Journal series of roleplaying supplements for the West End Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
