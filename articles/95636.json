It sold native crafts, local fruits and datacards about the Cularin fauna and flora. When Sethven discovered a drug that could be made from the star-mist plant, he contacted the company Genasys and they sent a security team to the shop, to meet with him. However, Culpharm, a rival company of Genasys, were tipped off about the deal and they sent a security team of their own, to prevent the meeting from happening. The Culpharm team attacked the Genasys one, resulting in a firefight in and around the shop. DeWitt, Vale and Sethven remained inside the building and were eventually rescued by the Heroes of Cularin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
