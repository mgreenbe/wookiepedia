The track featured an array of twists and turns, and offered obstacles such as rough terrain where Podracers would lose traction and slow down considerably. Other obstacles included large rocks and turns within canyons with hard cliff-sides on either side of the road. The Nuknog pilot Ark Roose, sometimes called Ark \"Bumpy\" Roose, was favored here. Roose would challenge other racers to one-on-one matches."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The course first appeared, unnamed, in the 1999 Gameboy Color video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
