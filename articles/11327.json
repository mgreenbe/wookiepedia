The model also proved to be too willing to override orders and often caused greater chaos, furthering the confusion of standard B1s by providing conflicting orders. Its example incited B1 units to attempt to independently predict orders, which proved disastrous, and as a result, the B1 supervisor droids were fielded when T-series military strategic analysis and tactics droids were made unavailable, but there were no plans to continue production of the model."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Armed with an E-5 blaster rifle, the B1 supervisor droid also came equipped with a mini probe.
