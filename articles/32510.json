Following the Battle of Yavin, he was a lieutenant of the technology-hating Meatlumps and operated out of the Meatlump Hideout in Coronet City. Around 1 ABY, he tasked a spacer to destroy droids in the lower maintenance areas of Coronet's maintenance tunnels. The spacer therefore descended into the hostile lower maintenance areas and attacked the droids, mostly utilitarian droids, working in the area. As ordered by Sarkee, the spacer avoided to attack the security droids, S-1 and S-2 security droids, patrolling the tunnels to not alarm the Corellian Security Force. The spacer finally destroyed thirty-four EG-6 power droids, MSE-6-series repair droids, R5-series astromech droids and blastromech droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cyru Sarkee appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
