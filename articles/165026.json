While Wookiees were more often known for their exertion of brute force, Wrruushi was surprisingly widely known, due to the natural violence of Wookiee society and rites. Together with the natural strength of a two-meter arboreal, it made a fearsome weapon. The martial art focused on using the immense upper body strength of the species, with an emphasis on punches, jabs and throws, and usually only a few strikes at a time. Also surprising were the non-lethal options available to the Wookiee using the art, practitioners capable of disabling an opponent with a single blow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
