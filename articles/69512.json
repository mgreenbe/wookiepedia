After the fight, the two officers were conducting crowd control and guarding a medwagon with two wounded GAG agents when they were approached by Jedi Knights Jaina Solo and Leia Organa Solo. Needing the medwagon to pursue the GAG doomsled carrying Skywalker, Jaina told Jat'ho and his partner she was investigating their sergeant, Qade, and needed the medwagon to conduct her investigation. She also insisted that no report be written; when Tobyl was initially hesitant, Solo utilized a mind trick to convince the cops of her story.
