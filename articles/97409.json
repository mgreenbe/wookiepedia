The campaigns saw the Ascendancy seek out and destroy the scattered Nikardun forces. Though the Ascendancy typically did not permit military action without having been attacked first, the threat that the Nikardun had posed led the Syndicure to allow the defense forces to bend the protocols regarding preemptive strikes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the course of the Nikardun campaigns, Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet successfully interpreted a Paataatus Prince Militaire's plea for assistance to liberate his people and homeworld from the yoke of the Nikardun. The Prince Militaire put up a false display of attack against the Chiss, mindful that he was being observed by Nikardun forces. Thrawn and his first officer Mid Captain Ufsa'mak'ro understood that this was not a real danger, and named the display a \"light show\". Thrawn made apparent threats against the Paataatus to \"demonstrate the full military might of the Chiss Ascendancy\", which were actually promises to act against the Nikardun occupying the system. Thrawn's forces, allied with the Paataatus military, successfully liberated Nettehi from the Nikardun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nikardun campaigns serve as the secondary plot for the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good, and as a device to introduce the protagonists to the main plot; the plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
