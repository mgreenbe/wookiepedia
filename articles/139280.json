By the era of the High Republic, Bota was considered an iconic Jedi, and younglings such as Lula Talisola and Farzala Tarabal watched holostories of his exploits. In the holovids, which were heavily fictionalized, Bota was depicted as going on solo missions where he fought dozens of Sith minions at once and pulled Star Cruisers out of the sky single-handedly.
