This, incidentally, kept him alive, as he did not wish to see his master going hungry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Porcellus sometimes used to cook large wild creatures for Jabba, including dune lizards, rock beetles (to prepare beetle broth), squills (to prepare squill liver salad), dragonets or zucca boars.

Porcellus's life was soon in jeopardy, however, when Jabba accused him of putting a fierfek, or hex, on the food, noting that others such as Oola and Jubnuk, who consumed his cooking, died shortly thereafter. He was sentenced to death. However, Jabba was killed before the sentence could be carried out and Porcellus was freed by Malakili. They later founded a restaurant together called the Crystal Moon in Mos Eisley."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the article Who's Who in Jabba's Palace, Porcellus is illustrated as a heavy-set man with a mustache and cap.
