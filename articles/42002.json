Selecting the young Initiate Ephaan Kenzon as his Padawan, Master Tassjun had difficulty controlling the unruly apprentice, often clashing on missions. Padawan Kenzon did not agree with the Jedi High Council's stance on several important political issues and frequently questioned their decisions in a very vocal manner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Tassjun as well as the Council, discussed the issue with Padawan Kenzon numerous times to no avail.

The rift between the Council's views and Tassjun's Padawan came to a climax when the Master-Padawan pair were on a mission in the Zeemacht Cluster. Despite Tassjun's guidance, Padawan Kenzon could not reconcile his views and those of the High Council and took it upon himself to resign from the Order, forswearing his vows and abandoning his master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
