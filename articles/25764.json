However, the Knights' elite red apricot squad was sent to retrieve their lost shipment, and the squad leader, Captain An Ping, realized Zhang's ploy. Red apricot squad's newest member, Sean, therefore proposed to continue with their pursuit of the enigmatic tenebrae and place the blame of recent incidents at Fire on Zhang afterwards, hoping that Chen Yao would become weary of Zhang, making the latter's days miserable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chen Yao was mentioned in The Vow of Silver Dawn, a Chinese web novel written by \"His Majesty the King.\" Chen was first mentioned in a chapter released in 2021, and he is named \u9648\u8000 in the original simplified Chinese text."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
