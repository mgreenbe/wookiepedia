The precursor species were social in nature and possessed antennae. They lived on the few islands amongst the swamps of their homeworld, where they built complex labyrinth-like mounds to live in. The Riileb retained many aspects of the species's insectoid heritage including their antennae. They also built cities similarly complex to their ancestors mounds. The First Riileb to have evolved from the precursor species was an important figure in Riileb legend."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Riilebs' precursor species was first mentioned in \"Alien Encounters,\" an article written by Brian Smithson for the thirteenth issue of the Star Wars Adventure Journals, a supplement to the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game by West End Games published on May 1, 1997."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
