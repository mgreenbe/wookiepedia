The Aqualish sport their blasters but are ambushed by Carasynthia Dune, now the Marshal of Nevarro, who engages them in physical combat. She quickly bests them in combat and uses one of them as a shield. After eliminating the hostiles, she goes through their stolen goods and befriends the lava meerkat, telling the creature that no one is eating it today and that it is free.

Din asks how much his credits are worth around here. While stroking the Child's face, Cara says that they can work something out.

The Mythrol asks how close they want him to drop them off and expresses fear.
