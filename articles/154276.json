The droid was later acquired by Roark Garnet, who took the unit when Fuller offered it to him in place of a sum of credits he owed him. During a battle between Garnet's ship and Imperial forces, the droid misunderstood a simple command, and dropped Garnet's deflector shields. Garnet later spaced the droid and vowed to have words with Fuller."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
