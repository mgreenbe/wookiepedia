During the final days of the Clone Wars, a clone trooper of the Grand Army of the Republic crashed with his ARC-170 starfighter on the planet. Having sustained head injuries, the trooper started uttering cryptic messages and took refuge in a mountain cave. His seemingly mystical behavior began to attract pilgrims to Du Mai and he became known as the \"Lost Prophet\". It was not until 21 ABY that the journalist Cindel Towani identified the Lost Prophet as a clone trooper, discovering that his gnomic utterances actually consisted of scrambled bits of his Kaminoan conditioning and flash-training."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
