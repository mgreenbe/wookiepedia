Around 34 BBY, Trench, while in the employ of the Corporate Alliance, destroyed a pirate base on the planet. For some time before the destruction of the first Death Star, Engira served as a supply colony for the Galactic Empire. Convoys of supplies dispatched from Engira were transported to Imperial garrisons and facilities throughout the galaxy. This had the effect of making the planet a prime target for pirates. During the Galactic Civil War, a convoy of three freighters carrying several hundred metric tons of food and ammunition\u2014valued at 18.2 million credits\u2014was ambushed near Engira."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide misspells the planet as \"Enigra.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
