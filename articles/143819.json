Producer Rick McCallum compared it to Deadwood and The Godfather, and hinted that it would involve bounty hunters. At the 2007 Toy Fair, a poster teased upcoming Star Wars projects, with the TV series represented by a picture of Boba Fett. After 50 scripts were completed, Lucas and McCallum felt that the show would be too expensive to produce with the current technology, and thus decided to put the project on hold.

He expressed interest in doing something with the Mandalorians, having reflected on some concepts he had developed when he first heard that Disney gained control of the franchiose. In November, Favreu met with Kennedy and Carrie Beck to pitch his idea for the show. At the meeting, Kennedy told him that Dave Filoni was also interested in telling stories about Mandalorians. (Filoni had also talked with Kennedy about wanting to work in live-action; She then sent him visit the sets of some of the contemporary Star Wars films to study the productions.) Favreau was familiar with Filoni, having voiced the Mandolorian character Pre Vizla on Star Wars: The Clone Wars.

He had this story, and suddenly the two of us realized, not only could this be told in the television space, but we could also push technology.\u201d During an interview with Dan Casey of Nerdist at the premiere, Favreau confirmed the show would take place seven years after the Battle of Yavin and feature all-new characters.

As writing continued, he had many discussions with co-executive producer Filoni, who would give him feedback based on his experience working directly with George Lucas on The Clone Wars. Filoni would make sketches of Favreu's ideas, which would be given to the department. Reflecting on the writing process, Favreau told GQ Middle East, \"One thing [George Lucas] said to me was, 'remember, Jon, the real audience for all stories and all myths is the kids that are coming of age', because he's really a Joseph Campbell adherent.\" He also made a conscious effort to appeal to all types of Star Wars fans, telling Entertainment Weekly: \"Part of what's fun is to see if we could merge the worlds of the original trilogy, the prequels, the sequels, The Clone Wars, and what's been considered canon up to this point and what's been considered part of Legends.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On August 6, 2018, The New York Times reported that Favreau's Star Wars series, which would be produced for Disney's new streaming service, was expected to cost around $100 million for 10 episodes.
