The other droid was called R4-D1. Both droids were used aboard a Delta-6 starfighter during the Clone Wars. R4-D2 and his companion often provided more input data than the ship's flight computer could handle, causing instabilities at the worst of times. Both droids also tended to argue with each other over their input, causing more problems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
