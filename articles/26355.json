The Crimson Axe was a vessel captained by Rav, a notorious Feeorin pirate whose opportunistic crew helped him attack ships and settlements throughout the galaxy. While serving aboard the vessel, Chonyo taught the young Human Jariah Syn to manipulate Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology and to operate illegal Yuuzhan Vong weaponry such as thud bugs and amphistaffs, both of which Syn could easily handle by 137 ABY. Chonyo was fluent in the Yuuzhan Vong, a tongue that he also taught to Syn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Created by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema, Chonyo was first mentioned in 2007 in the seventeenth issue of the comic series Star Wars: Legacy, although he was not given a name until 2010 when he was again referenced in Legacy's forty-fourth issue.
