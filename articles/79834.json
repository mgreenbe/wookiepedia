However, their escape path is blocked by three Imperial-class Star Destroyers. The Imperial ships are commanded by Commodore Idel, Captain Shan and Captain Conro and are given orders to recover the Imperialis. Before proceeding with their mission, Idel orders the Star Destroyers to destroy Orbital Shipyard CC-24 to punish the shipyard for failing to respect the Emperor's property. Commodore Idel deploys several gravity mines to warp the local space so that they can't jump into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Imperialis's automated defense systems destroy the mines. While Lando powers up the ship, Commodore Idel promises a million credits to whoever brings him the Imperialis. When Korin Pers demands that Lando tell him and Aleksin and Pavol what he has gotten them into, Calrissian realizes that the Star Destroyers are not destroying them because the ship carries something valuable. Two of the Star Destroyers trap the Imperialis in their tractor beams. However, Calrissian undertakes a risky maneuver. He draws the tractor beam of one of Star Destroyers towards the second ship, causing both Destroyers to collide. Calrissian and his companions then flew into deep space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile on the Inner Rim world of Amethia Prime, the bounty hunter Chanath Cha pursues the alien crime lord Big String who flees on his aquatic yacht into the ocean.
