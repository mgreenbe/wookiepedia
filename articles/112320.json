At some point after the Battle of Endor, Eron was present in Isis's office when the bounty hunter Boba Fett brought the pirate Feldrall Okor to Isis, whom the governor had put a bounty on. Eron and the others in the office were petrified when Fett activated a thermal detonator, demanding a larger sum of money. Isis eventually conceded to paying the bounty and Fett deactivated the detonator. The incident caused Eron to request a reassignment to the Imperial Navy. Eron went on to serve as the chief gunnery officer of the Star Destroyer Eradicator, and at some point related the story of the incident between Fett and Isis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
