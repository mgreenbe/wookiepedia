Aelto worked briefly on various projects researching the stimulants known as adrenals before he was assigned to review the files on planets to determine whether they were habitable. When he was studying chemical scans from the planet Quesh one night, Aelto recognized a molecular chain from his work on adrenals\u2014a chain found in a compound virtually identical to venenit shadaaga, a major ingredient in adrenals that was also known as Hutt venom. The similar chemical, which Aelto dubbed venenit queshaaga, or \"Quesh venom,\" could be converted to a usable compound through a simple chemical process, and as a result of his research, the Republic established mining operations on Quesh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bardian Aelto was first mentioned on the Holonet portion of the official site for the 2011 BioWare massively multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, and he was first named in the game's Codex entry for Quesh venom."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
