Fen estimated its age to be about 4000 years old, placing its origin around the Great Sith War. To further understand the device, they required a Force-user, seeking out the Nightsister Silri. Initially, Silri was only able to uncover ancient star charts. Zann was displeased, and had Bossk return the holocron to Thrawn; Silri was furious. When the Consortium commanders came to Coruscant to gain the codes to the Emperor's vault, Silri and her rancor pet, Cuddles, recovered the artifact. After Zann got to the vaults, Silri explored the device for herself and used it to find the Carbonite Sith Army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
