Though it was slower, smaller, and less durable than the Light Corvette or the Guardian-class light cruiser from Sienar Fleet Systems, it required a smaller crew, and its six heavy laser cannons had significantly greater firepower at short range."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like other vessels used by Imperial Customs, it was able to do battle with most smugglers' light freighters, the forces of small-time pirates, or even Rebel starfighters.

It was also coveted by pirates, who captured the vessel or bought illegal copies of the design built in criminal shipyards. One such pirate vessel was the Counter-Puncher, commanded by Tor Skylow and crewed by Imperial deserters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The stats of the Imperial Customs Frigate first appeared in the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
