After a lightfight with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in the ceiling rafters of Eriadu City's Seswenna Hall, the assassin plummeted to the building's floor. The ruckus caused the Directorate to activate a force field around themselves, which ultimately sealed them from protection as their security droids fired on and killed them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
