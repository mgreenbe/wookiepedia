Belonging to no clan, she was renowned for her skills at making magical objects, and lived in a hut on the far side of the swamp near the Nightsister fortress. She had owned a few rancors. Falta eventually used her skills to perform an unprecedented act of magick, creating for herself a daughter whom she named Yenna. Mother Talzin, the leader of the Nightsisters, was intrigued by Yenna, and eventually persuaded the girl to join her clan, despite Falta's worries. During the Clone Wars, after the Battle of Dathomir in which the Nightsisters were almost completely wiped out, Falta travelled to the Nightsister fortress in search of her daughter, and was told by the dying witch Daka that Talzin had had Yenna evacuated off of Dathomir during the battle. Falta's search eventually brought her and her pet tooka, Ichor, to the planetoid S\u00eddi, where she met a young human girl named Bug and found a transmission indicating Yenna had been sent in a pod to somewhere in the Mid Rim. When she left S\u00eddi, Falta took Bug with her as her new apprentice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
