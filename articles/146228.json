The Tibanna mynocks resembled normal mynocks, but possessed specialized gills that allowed them to breath air that was highly concentrated with toxic fumes. They also consumed Tibanna and their bodies contained pockets of the gas. In about 17 BBY, an Ugnaught inadvertently disturbed a group of six Tibanna mynocks that were perched on top of a Tibanna container in Cloud City on Bespin, causing the mynocks to attack a nearby group of Alderaanian Resistance agents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
