Along the longitudinal spines of the ship ran tensor fields and the inertial compensator that helped maintain the structural integrity of the vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They had four extensive sensor and communications arrays affixed to the center of the hull in a cross-pattern. Several docking rings were located underneath these and the vertical arrays also had room for several point-defense cannons."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Offensive and defensive systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Banking Clan star frigates were light CIS warships armed for heavy combat with oversized guns, a massive twin turbolaser cannon, and two long-range ion cannons for use against capital ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Complementing the heavy weaponry were 38 point-defense laser cannons for anti-starfighter firepower, and 26 twin turbolaser cannons and 20 light turbolaser turrets for flexible response."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The twin turbolaser cannon was powerful enough to melt an ice moon measuring 1,000 km in diameter or pierce the shields of a 10 km-wide Grade III battle station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five Munificents were unable to stop the Resolute when it was trying to rescue Bolla Ropal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship had high-performance sensors with a range of several light-days positioned on the dorsal side of the ship. A forward scanner was situated on top of the vessel's command tower."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Complement"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each ship of the class was capable of carrying 150,000 battle droids for boarding or ground operations, and were capable of shielding droid starfighters within their hulls. A system of docking rings lined the sides of each ship. In the forward hollow areas, war materials could be stored for transfer, while in times of peace, they were used to transfer valuable financial assets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In some models, hangar bays were positioned in the middle of the ship, where several starfighters were stored.\nThese ships were also heavily shielded and could withstand significant firepower until destruction. However, its hollow hull was highly vulnerable to Republic attacks if its shields failed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Propulsion systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The class was powered by twin reactors, placed side by side towards the middle of the craft. One reactor was enough to power the ship in an emergency. The two reactors together annihilated up to 2,300 tons of fuel per second. The Munificent's superdense reactant tanks were positioned at the ventral side of the ship, underneath the reactors. A series of power feeds ran from the reactors out to the various antennas and sensor systems, where power cells were stored."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Bridge tower"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The command tower on a Munificent-class ship was located at the bow, rising diagonally from the superstructure. The tower contained a turbolift shaft that connected the various stations.

The Munificent-class acted as a key component of the Banking Clan's network by carrying hyperwave transceivers and communications arrays that allowed secure financial transactions to occur across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Banking Clan joined the Confederacy, Chairman San Hill devoted a fleet of star frigates to the cause. The class became a staple of the Confederate Navy during the Clone Wars and formed the backbone of the fleet, with tens of thousands produced. The ships' hulls bore the blue-and-white Confederate emblem and paint scheme, although many ships also bore both the green stripes of the Banking Clan and the Confederate colors. Towards the end of the war, thousands of Munificent-class frigates participated in the Battle of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Munificent-class star frigates assisted the navigation and coordination of Confederacy fleets deep in enemy space. They also escorted and coordinated Separatist fleet actions such as attacks on the interstellar HoloNet relays to demoralize and isolate Galactic Republic forces. The Confederacy also took advantage of the star frigate's powerful antennae to broadcast anti-Republic propaganda while using its jamming devices to hinder enemy sensors, targeting systems and distress calls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Clone Wars ended, many crews took their Munificents past the reaches of the Galactic Empire, becoming pirates and mercenaries. Some vessels later ended up in the Rebel Alliance, where many ships were extensively modified to the point where they barely resembled their original design."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The official Databank entry on the frigate indicates that the organic, rounded appearance  for the starship was meant to provide a stark opposite to the clean, triangular designs of Galactic Republic and Imperial starships, instead being more similar to the Mon Calamari cruisers participating in the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the young readers adaptation The Clone Wars: Grievous Attacks!, the starships are erroneously identified as freighters in the Mission to sweep outer corridor of space chapter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It should also be noted that the warship's depiction in Star Wars: Battlefront II is fairly different from that seen in the film; specifically, it is much simpler in design and somewhat truncated in appearance.
