Guild members deserving punishment were sent there. But the Guild motivated other corporations to join them by opening new offices of their own in the Korriban spaceport of Dreshdae. But by 23 BBY, local Guild executives were being robbed in their hotels with alarming frequency by black market thieves, as a Jedi coalition team learned from their Korriban informant, Teluron Thacker. Using \"rampant local crime against Guild workers\" as an excuse, therefore, but in violation of Republic law, the Guild sent to Korriban a droid army, which it placed in the front ranks of its local officers and troops clad in full plastoid armor and battlefield helmets. The droid contingency included dwarf and homing spider droids. The aim of the Guild's army and security forces on Korriban, beyond protecting the Guild's workers from petty crime, was to crush the local black market, for Guild executives were tired of having to buy back their own items from the thieves who stole them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Commerce Guild Army and Punitive Security Forces on Korriban also got caught up (surely by the machinations of the Guild with the galaxy's re-emergent Sith) in the pursuit of a Jedi Order coalition team (headed by Obi-Wan Kenobi) sent by the Jedi High Council to track down galactic criminals Granta Omega and Jenna Zan Arbor. While the army battled Kenobi and three other Jedi Masters within the Great Sith Temple's long-abandoned Sith Academy, the Guild's local security forces\u2014the Commerce Guild Army Patrol\u2014led a high-speed chase of the Jedi (whose Koro-1 airspeeder was piloted by 18-year-old Anakin Skywalker) into the Valley of the Dark Lords, which ended in the scorching demise of each of the patrol's cruisers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This pre-Clone Wars state of affairs in the galaxy's \"cradle of darkness\" provided the setting for what was likely the beginning of the corroborative relationship of Guild Presidente Shu Mai and Count Dooku. For, in addition to the spider droids, the illegal new super battle droids were employed by Dooku's alter-ego Darth Tyranus in fending off the Jedi's intrusion into the Sith Academy. There, the Jedi Master-turned-Sith Lord had set up a base for rendezvousing with Omega and Zan Arbor, to establish an 'alliance' with them, which, in actuality, was but a cover to exploit their uses for his recently established Confederacy of Independent Systems\u2014the Sith-backed prelude to galactic civil war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early stages of the Clone Wars, the Punitive Security Forces maintained their original organizational system; however this was inefficient as the command structures of the various commerce guild armies proved incompatible.
