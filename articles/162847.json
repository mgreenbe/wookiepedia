By the time of the Battle of Yavin, the old warehouse belonged to Horace Korr, a retired Corellia Times reporter. Circa 1 ABY, Korr accepted to help Wernell Covington in finding the kidnappers and murderers of his daughter Felicia. In the meantime, the warehouse had been occupied by a group of thugs. To gather evidence on the identities of two kidnappers, Horace Korr tasked a spacer with fighting the thugs and recovering the datapad he left behind in the lower level of the warehouse. Horace Korr eventually discovered that the two escaped murderers were Jurgen Nath and Vladlun Travan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The warehouse in Narmle was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
