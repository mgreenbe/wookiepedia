Unlike some of his fellow scientists Lanniter volunteered to work for Grathan due to the fact the Sith was the only person who had the resources he required for the scientists work. While on Lord Grathan's estate Lanniter designed revolutionary cybernetic replacement limbs for the Sith Lord who intended to give them to his wounded soldiers, although Lanniter himself hoped that they would also be given to the civilian victims of the Great Galactic War. However Ismar Brengle, one of Lanniter's colleges planned to steal the cybernetics and sell them to the highest bidder much to Lanniter's dismay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
