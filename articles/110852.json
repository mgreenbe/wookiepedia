Discovering Kota's Force-sensitivity, Windu took Kota back to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to be trained as a Jedi. Despite being well over the traditional age of acceptance, Kota was schooled in the Force by Master Yoda. He took Falon Grey as his Padawan sometime before the Clone Wars, training him to Knighthood. During the Clone Wars, Kota was made a general in the Grand Army of the Republic. He did not believe that clone troopers were fit for battle, however, and refused to lead them. Instead, he commanded his own militia, comprised of volunteers. In 19 BBY, when Order 66 was issued\u2014an emergency contingency that ordered the clone forces to terminate their Jedi commanders, who had been deemed a threat to the Republic\u2014Kota survived the slaughter of his fellow Jedi since there were no clone troopers serving with him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Going into hiding with his militia, Kota allied himself with Alderaanian Senator Bail Organa.

After completing his mission, Windu sought to have Kota return with him to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to train in the Jedi arts. Despite the fact that he was well past the traditional age of acceptance for new apprentices, Kota was inducted into the Jedi Order and trained under Jedi Master Yoda himself. During his training, his gruff and forthright personality earned him few friends.

He did not believe that clones could be as creative or as intelligent in the field as non-clones. Instead, he organized and trained his own militia, comprising dedicated beings from across the galaxy, which included members of local planetary militias, mercenary groups, and even Separatist prisoners-of-war. Kota and his militia served with distinction, fighting as both a regular unit and a special operations force on several fronts, including several successful offensives in the Outer Rim Territories.

Kota allied himself with Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan, who was fomenting rebellion within the halls of the Imperial Senate and secretly assisting fugitive Jedi who had escaped Order 66.

Vader's apprentice brought his lightsaber blade down, engaging the General in a saber lock.

He employed telekinesis to hurl objects at enemy combatants or repel them from his presence, and had enough mastery to detach the command tower from the TIE Fighter Construction Facility over Nar Shaddaa and send it plummeting toward the planet. He possessed training in farsight and had received at least one vision of the future, during his duel with Marek, when he sensed his future and his opponent's would be intertwined.

Kota also possessed some skill in healing himself with the Force. After Kota's seven-day incarceration in the Tarko-se Arena on Cato Neimoidia, the medical examiner recorded that, despite several severe injuries, Kota was in no danger of dying and needed only quick treatment before returning to duty.

Kota was one of the main characters and featured in The Force Unleashed video game, novel, and comic. Kota later gained mentions in source material publications, including The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide and The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia. A toy was also made of the character, released as part of The Force Unleashed toy line. In 2009, Kota was included in both the PSP and Nintendo DS versions of Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron, and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition, which was a release of the original game with several newly-added levels. While the majority of the new content in the Ultimate Sith Edition was non-canon, the Jedi Temple level was first released as downloadable content and takes place within the storyline of The Force Unleashed. As there is nothing to suggest that the level is non-canon, unlike the Tatooine and Hoth levels, this article assumes it is part of the \"proper\" storyline. In 2010, a sequel to The Force Unleashed was released, and Kota was once again a main character. His role was expanded on in both the novelization and the comic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kota is voiced in The Force Unleashed video game and its sequel by actor Cully Fredricksen, whose likeness was also used as the basis for the character's appearance. Fredricksen was the first actor cast for the game. One of several actors who read for the part, Fredricksen felt the audition was akin to a theatrical audition, as he was given a longer time to prepare for the role than he would have had if he were reading for a film part. LucasArts also provided Fredricksen with the script, character breakdown, and concept artwork of Kota before the audition. Fredricksen approached the reading fully in-character, which initially made the casting director believe that the actor may be standoffish and difficult to work with. However, it was soon realized that Fredricksen was just being Kota. Fredricksen, however, had a different take on the audition, believing that he had not \"walked in as Kota.\" Impressed by the team at LucasArts and how seriously they took The Force Unleashed project, Fredricksen felt that the team wanted him to succeed, and their attitude made him comfortable during the process. The actor felt that the team was able to bring Kota out of him, remarking that \"it was like the collaboration had already begun before I was ever given the part.\" Fredricksen later told his wife that the audition had been one of the most gratifying he had ever attended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fredricksen's convincing audition, combined with the actor's physicality and his ability to produce a wide range of facial expressions, convinced the production team to hire him as the gruff General.

One element that Fredricksen positively commented on was the fact that, during recording sessions, the entire cast for that scene would record their lines together, allowing them to act against one another. This was in contrast to other voice-over recording sessions Fredricksen had been involved in, where he had just delivered his lines by himself with the director reading for the other characters.

If the player takes the option to kill Vader, however, the Emperor attempts to sway the apprentice back to the dark side by persuading him to kill Kota.

Originally, the concept called for the disembodied spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn, preserved in the Netherworld of the Force, to fulfill this role. However, George Lucas did not approve of this concept, since he wanted a completely new cast of characters for the game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ideas for the character were explored, including a hermit Jedi in the tradition of Yoda, and even bringing back the character of Darth Plagueis in some form.

Haden Blackman, the project lead on the game, and the production team decided that they wanted a Jedi who was different from the established Jedi Master mentor characters already established in the Star Wars universe. Instead of the mystic Jinn, or the nurturing Obi-Wan Kenobi, the mentor was meant to be \"less Gandalf and more Army General.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With this in mind, the developers turned their attention back to the original concepts. Artist Amy Beth Christenson returned to the original concepts and found the artwork of the Samurai Jedi.

The original concept art went through several revisions but did not evolve much from the original drawing. With the basic appearance of the character established, the script evolved and a downfall was introduced.
