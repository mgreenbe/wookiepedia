A small league of dissidents had emerged, calling themselves the Rift Alliance. Members of the Rift Alliance represented planets whose infrastructure was crucial to the Republic's survival.

Upon arriving near the Fortitude, however, the Jedi Master was contacted by Nadia Grell, the daughter of Tobas Grell, Senator of the planet Sarkhai and one of the members of the Rift Alliance.

Considering the Consular's case worth fighting for, the lieutenant came to regard his service aboard the Barsen'thor's ship as the best posting he ever had, and he promised to always cover the Jedi's back when needed. After the Barsen'thor's disappearance, Iresso's loyalty led him on a foolhardy mission to investigate rumors of the Jedi's presence on Zakuul, which resulted in the lieutenant's capture and imprisonment by the Eternal Empire.
