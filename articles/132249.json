The clone is suffering from visions, including a forest burning, and a woman's voice in his head. Vader informs him that they are but memories of a dead man, and that they would fade in time. Telling him that his objective is to kill Starkiller's old Jedi mentor, Vader presents him with two identical red-bladed lightsabers, and instructs him to cut down several training droids, which assume the identities of Rebel soldiers and a mysterious woman. The new Starkiller cuts down all the soldiers, yet realizes that the woman is none other than Juno Eclipse, the original Starkiller's old pilot and love interest. He is unable to kill her, prompting Vader to step in. Cutting the last droid down, Vader tells Starkiller that the accelerated cloning process used to create him is imperfect. All previous clones had gone mad within months. Vader states that he had expected this Starkiller to be the first success, but it seemed that this clone was going to suffer the same fate.

He begins to carve his way through various Imperial troops: Riot troopers, stormtroopers, two Carbonite War droids and jumptroopers. After avoiding an Imperial dropship, Starkiller comes to a large tower, which he knocks down by throwing several TIE fighters at it. The tower crushes one of three AT-STs guarding his master's starfighter. Destroying the remaining two, Starkiller managed to steal the fighter, just as Vader blasts his way to the landing platform.

The Baron, Merillion Tarko, requests that they 'try the Corellian slice hounds'. He is informed by one of his Neimoidian aides that Vader's ship was approaching.

Starkiller kills many more Imperial forces on the way, but he is attacked by one of Tarko's Nemesis-class gunships, which promptly destroys a bridge, killing Imperials and destroying buildings relentlessly. Starkiller evades the ship, but it would not be the last time he would face the gunship. After entering a gambling hall, filled with many game machines, he came across several Carbonite War Droids in the lower levels, which had seemingly frozen many unfortunate Neimoidian citizens. After going through another, smaller room with three game machines, the Nemesis attacks yet again, destroying the bridge Starkiller was standing on. Starkiller manages to reach a tram, and utilizes it as a passage to the Eastern Arch. He is forced to destroy many TIE Fighters in order to save the tram, but the Nemesis catches up, firing its hellcaster cannon and several missiles.

Tarko, on the other hand, is enraged, and tells his aide to 'send out the Gorog'. His aide panics, informing Tarko that the restraints of the arena had not been properly tested. Tarko insisted that the Gorog gate be opened. A Rancor enters the arena. Starkiller ignites one of his lightsabers, and looks smugly at the Rancor.

The Gorog pulled its hands free, and Starkiller had to repeat the process again. He then leaped at the Gorog, slicing off a metal plate on its forehead. He stabbed at a gash that was hidden behind the plate. The Gorog, now fully enraged, pulled its left wrist free, completely shattering the manacle. It flung Starkiller on to the arena's side wall, pulled its other wrist free, and proceeded to climb the arena. Kota, who had gone after Tarko, suggested destroying the arena's supports. Starkiller realized this would bring down the whole structure, but did it anyway. Just before the arena gave way, he proceeded towards Tarko's observation box. Kota was already dueling Tarko and three stormtroopers. The Gorog punched its way into the box, still seeking to kill Starkiller. Tarko was promptly eaten, yet Kota was trapped in the beast's grip. He was pulled down with it when the arena gave way. As Kota was the only one who knew where Juno was, Starkiller dived after him, dodging debris on his way down. Unable to kill the Gorog, or at least harm it in such as way that it would relent its grip on the suffocating Kota, Starkiller used the Force to charge towards the Gorog at an insurmountable speed, punching a hole through the Gorog's chest with his own body.

After being told that the thing he had lost was inside the cave, Starkiller entered, his TIE Fighter garb changing to more traditional Jedi robes as he did so. Inside, he encountered several clones of himself, entangled in vines. A little way on, Starkiller saw Juno standing in a fog, which turned into a bridge of a ship.

He blasts his way through, and after fighting yet more droids, he sees an entire corridor melted by an unseen creature. The damage appeared too great to be done by the small Terror Droids, and similar damage was throughout the ship. It served as an excellent guide for Starkiller, and he was able to access the engine room, where he encountered a large, terror-trooper like droid, which he easily defeated. It was after this that he accessed the hangar, where he witnessed Boba Fett's Slave I leave, taking Juno with it.

Starkiller then progressed back the way he came, going through the drive core, clearing Imperials out of the engine room, and accessing the gunnery area. A lucky shot from a nearby Imperial I-class Star Destroyer rendered the Salvation's main gun offline. Starkiller used the Force to power the main gun, firing at the Star Destroyer with a shot so powerful, it cleaved it in half. From there, he proceeds to the bridge, where Kota ordersthe fleet to keep up the assault, despite numerous casualties. After informing Starkiller that Kamino's Planetary shield was preventing any ground assault, Starkiller told him that the shield would not survive a direct hit from a cruiser, and also advised him to get to the Rogue Shadow.
