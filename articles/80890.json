Because it was based on the hull of a combat ship, the Legates were fast and study vehicles that with resistant hulls. Their hold was modular and could be reconfigured to accommodate hauling both cargo and living passengers comfortably. Its sleek forward hull, stubby, sponson-like wings, and aft engines were similar to its Skipray cousin. With port and starboard nacelles holding the ships fusial thrust engines, long, thin vertical stabilizers extended from the ventral and dorsal surfaces of the reactor housing. The ship had forward mounted laser cannons under the nose and a dorsal turret."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
