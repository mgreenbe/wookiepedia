After the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron was captured by the First Order in the village of Tuanul on the planet Jakku in the year 34 ABY, HX-1072 worked alongside fellow troopers FN-2198, FN-3156 and JY-834 to perform a deep scan of Dameron's T-70 X-wing starfighter. The four reported to their commanding officer Captain Phasma that the scans had shown nothing of significance, and Phasma ordered the ship destroyed. Dameron eventually obtained a copy of Phasma's report on the scan results and included it in his flight log."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "HX-1072 was first mentioned in the replica journal Poe Dameron: Flight Log, which was written by Michael Kogge and released in 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
