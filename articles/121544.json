This time the Rogues were the ones to wreak havoc among the Imperial fighters. Corran Horn also engaged two TIEs that were moving to attack one of the Rebel's assault transports. He was able to destroy them but at the cost of being left behind. He did not have the fuel needed to leave the system and return to the Rebel base, so he hid on the surface of Borleias' moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperials then began to search for the last Rogue across the moon's surface. Corran managed to hide for a time but was soon discovered by the TIE fighters.
