Crafted out of lightweight plasteel, the crossbow weighed very little, and was equipped with an underslung bin holding ten arrows or quarrels. Upon firing, a new quarrel was automatically loaded into the weapons firing groove and the bowstring was automatically recocked, allowing for multiple shots without pause. The repeating crossbow magazine held 10 quarrels. Each magazine cost 30 credits and weighed 1.2 kilograms. A variant of the repeating crossbow was the Auto-caster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The repeating crossbow was used by hunters but was also a collector's item for historical aficionados."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
