The two Dashades hired a group of criminals to run a mobile way station on behalf of Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit, capturing stolen starships from the Kurost transfer point to steal components from Project Stardust. The station was attacked by the Grysks, who killed Maliss and captured the surviving criminals, including Sorath. The prisoners were interrogated by the Grysks, who attempted to enslave them, but the prisoners were rescued when Commodore Karyn Faro of the Imperial Seventh Fleet boarded the Grysk starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
