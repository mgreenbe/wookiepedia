In 5 ABY, Han Solo and Leia Organa visited the Asteroid Theater while vacationing at Hologram Fun World and saw a magic act performed by Bithabus the Mystifier. The performance was sold out for six months, but Lando Calrissian used his influence to acquire tickets for the couple. During intermission, however, Zorba Desilijic Tiure attacked Bithabus and replaced him with Cobak the bounty hunter, who then selected Leia from the audience for his magic act and kidnapped her, taking her to Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
