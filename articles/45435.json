Whilst on Espinar, she set eyes on a man named Galen Erso, who later became her husband, for the first time. Lyra served as his guide as he led a field team that studied minerals. Lyra and Galen failed to uncover any kyber crystals. During her time in captivity on the planet Vallt, Lyra recalled the first time she and Erso met on Espinar. Erso ran into Orson Krennic very shortly after returning from the planet, unexpectedly introducing his new love to Krennic for the first time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
