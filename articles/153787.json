However, the Mandalore managed to capture the droid, reprogramming it to kill the usurper, a task at which HK-47 succeeded, though the droid would later consider it his poorest performance. In 3956 BBY, he sent a team of Mandalorians to the Shadowlands of Kashyyyk, and ordered them to test the effectiveness of new stealth field generator technology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some time before 3951 BBY, he encountered Canderous Ordo, who had recovered Mandalore's Mask and sought to unify the clans. Already dying, the Taung did not survive this meeting. He proclaimed that Mandalore the Ultimate had usurped the title with Sith assistance, and that he was the true heir of Mandalore the Indomitable. He asked Canderous to adopt his clan and take his armor, in order to preserve their heritage. Ordo would do this, integrating this Mandalore's mask into his own helmet, subsequently becoming Mandalore the Preserver."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Abel G.
