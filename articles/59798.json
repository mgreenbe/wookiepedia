In 3631 BBY Harris and Doctor Narissa Delau were part of Lieutenant Talos Drellik's expedition on Yavin 4. Drellik eventually left to join the Anti-Zakuul Alliance, but remained in contact with the team. The team managed to uncover a set of Sith relics dated to the era of Exar Kun: a medallion, a coffer and a set of tablets. When Harris tried to sleep while wearing the medallion, the nightmares came almost instantly. Harris eventually uncovered a new artifact in the Architect's Hollow, but when she brought the medallion and one of the tablets to it, a hulking Massassi attacked the team, killing Harris and the escort and scattering the rest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harris appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire during Talos Drellik's Alliance Alert mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
