However, these mountains had a certain grandeur while the dust oceans were spectacular, restless, and dangerous. With the correct weather conditions, they produced beautiful light effects which were known as \"dustbowls\" which attracted tourists looking for luxury holidays at a suitably inflated price. The Ananuru Express was built to deal with these tourists and ran from Ananuru City along a monorail suspended above the dust seas which were protected from the dust by force fields."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
