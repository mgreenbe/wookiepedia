In 44 ABY, Bann developed a psychosis brought on by the dark side entity Abeloth, causing him to believe that everyone he knew had been replaced by impostors. He succumbed to the psychosis while inside the Jedi Temple, although he was captured by the Jedi there and confined in the Jedi Temple Detention Center. Jedi Master Cilghal drew up a report that went into detail about the psychosis in Bann and another Jedi who was suffering from the same illness, Turi Altamik, putting forth her belief that the rate of Jedi succumbing to the psychosis was accelerating. Before long, however, exiled Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker successfully completed his mission to kill Abeloth, resulting in the immediate termination of Bann's psychosis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bann later participated in the rescue attempt to free both Valin and Jysella Horn from the clutches of Galactic Alliance Security.
