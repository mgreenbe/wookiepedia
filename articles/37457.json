It was based on the Battle of Yavin from A New Hope. Players moved X-wing squadrons along the board to enter the trench and fire the torpedoes that destroy the Death Star. The game is much more difficult to find than the similar Escape from Death Star, released in the same year."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1978, Palitoy in the United Kingdom also released a game with the same title, except that theirs was a battery operated game in which players moved fighter squadrons (shaped pieces of transparent brightly colored day-glo perspex) across a blue translucent plastic game board. Players had the chance to destroy enemy targets (and the Death Star itself) by estimating the target co-ordinates from their position using two rotational knobs (one for horizontal, one for vertical) and then pressing the firing button. This operated a small bulb underneath the gameboard, and if the light was directly on a target and illuminated by the bulb, the target was destroyed and removed from the playing board, whereas if it was not directly on a target, it was considered a miss. The Palitoy game was entirely based on the Palitoy Parker games named 'Salvo' which was released in 1975. Cosmetic changes were made to Salvo, to transform it from a battleship based game to a space arena."}]}
