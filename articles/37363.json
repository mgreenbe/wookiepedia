Following the defection of one of Fonada's trooper detachments, Captain Sandrex Olotho devised an unorthodox means for her and the remaining loyal troopers to escape. By capturing several deshfinops, coating them with a slow-burning resin, and releasing them, she sowed confusion among the defector's ranks and set fires in their encampment.
