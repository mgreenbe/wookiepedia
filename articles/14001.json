Knowing that attacking the enemy from the air would ruin their chances of a surprise, the soldiers of Twilight Company, numbering at barely two-hundred, trekked through the ruins on the surface for several days in order to flank the enemy. As supplies dwindled, however, many troops were lost to hunger and weakness. Others vanished to the alien technology or were killed by beasts that lurked in the wilderness. When Twilight Company met the enemy warriors, they won the ensuing battle and rescued the captured rebels, though only thirty-seven survived the fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mon Mothma, the leader of the Alliance, considered the battle of Ferrok Pax a very costly battle and published her opinion in the document \"Short Notes on the History of the Rebel Alliance Navy\" in her personal files.
