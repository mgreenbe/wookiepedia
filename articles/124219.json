The shop was an unkempt affair that offered general goods. Sheeb hated Gamorr and had become more and more depressed from living there. This affected his mood; unlike most Squibs, Sheebareevadee only haggled half-heartedly, and he preferred lying about to doing actual work. He entertained vague notions of selling off his wares and relocating, but he simply lacked the initiative to follow through."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sheebareevadee is a gamemaster character in Timothy S.

The Squib does not actually appear in the story itself, so this is considered a source rather than an appearance.
