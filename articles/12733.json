Barbo suggested that Jinn talk to D'zor, a resident outlaw who, along with his thugs, camped outside Barbo's shop. He allowed Jinn access to the back of his shop, a move that put the Jedi's life at risk when D'Zor and his thugs attacked Jinn, who was forced to kill them in self-defense as well as destroy a repeating blaster that D'zor kept for protection. Jinn then took the fuel converter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Barbo appears in 1999's Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game, where he was voiced by Tom Kane.
