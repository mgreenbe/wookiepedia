As long as Gacerites didn't cause any problems, he made sure his troops left them alone. He wanted to maintain good manners even with criminals, such as Rebel prisoners.

He was usually generous with Corellian whiskey, which sometimes helped him to get some vital information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gostech's goal was only to gain reputation as an excellent administrator and an enforcer of Imperial law. Still, his apparently soft touch on the governorship disturbed his superiors and Imperial officers around him, such as Captain Engar Ret.
