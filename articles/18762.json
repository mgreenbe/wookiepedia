The interior walls of the monolithic structure were decorated with inscriptions etched into the metallic plating which lined the walls. The Vaults interior was filled with ancient, fragile offering vessels, left by pilgrims in the distant past. The Vault was only accessible by Force-sensitives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Master Eno Cordova discovered the Vault while studying the Zeffo, who had long been extinct. Cordova later used the Vault to hide a holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children in the event that the Jedi Order needed to be rebuilt. Several years after Order 66, Cere Junda brought former Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis to the Vault, hoping to use the holocron to rebuild the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once Cal returned to the planet with the Astrium from Dathomir, he placed the astrium in the vault, causing him to see a vision of Padawans he was training. The Empire then attacked and Cal appeared to be an Inquisitor with the younglings being tortured to surrender. Cal awoke and grabbed the holocron only to see the Second Sister before him. They engaged in a duel with Cal eventually stealing her lightsaber. This caused him to have a echo of her past trauma. Trilla made off with the holocron leaving behind a detachment of stormtroopers to deal with Cal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Bogano Vault was visited by the rebels Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, who were verifying that Bogano could host a base for the Rebellion.
