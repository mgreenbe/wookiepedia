In time, the fabled helm became the symbol of leadership among the Mandalorians. It was passed down through the ages to those Mandalorians who proved themselves worthy of the title of Mand'alor, leader of the Mandalorian clans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the concluding battle of the Mandalorian Wars, the Jedi Knight Revan and Mandalore the Ultimate faced each other in single combat. Revan was the victor of the duel, and learned from Mandalore that the invasion had been orchestrated by a mysterious agent of the Sith. After slaying his opponent, Revan and Malak traveled to the planet Rekkiad, where Mandalore and the Sith had discovered the tomb of an ancient Sith Lord. There, the two Jedi found a datacron that would lead them to the planet Nathema, but Revan left the mask in the Sith's sarcophagus. By hiding the mask on Rekkiad, Revan condemned the clans to wander without a leader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An unidentified Mandalore attempted to claim leadership of the scattered Mandalorian Clans during the Jedi Civil War without the aid of the mask, but no claimant to the title of \"Mandalore\" would successfully rule the Clans until after the war.

When the Taung Mandalore died during their meeting, Canderous took the Taung's armor for himself and he integrated the mask of Mandalore into its helmet. Through guile and martial skill, he gathered followers and declared himself Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A 'Mandalorian Mask' is able to be obtained in Star Wars Galaxies from buried treasure and is a part of the Treasure Hunter Masks Collection; the mask bears a strong resemblance to Mandalore's Mask."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
