A shining golden metropolis that sprawled outwards from the central tower, the Spire was a vertical city, with skyscrapers and pyramid-shaped buildings suspended above each other in a climb nearly to the atmosphere. All roads on Zakuul eventually led to the Spire, which was built atop the Old World\u2014Emperor Valkorion's first attempt at building a city, which had not been grand enough for him. The very peak of the Spire reached out past the planet's atmosphere and contained the Emperor's throne room, where the Eternal Throne was located."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
