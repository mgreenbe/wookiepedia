Using the standard N-1 fighter as a starting point, Naboo engineers designed a dedicated craft to deliver explosive payloads through bombardment. For its increased power requirements, the bomber boasted a second engine: a modified Nubian 321. This engine was environmentally friendly, since the Naboo were dedicated to defending their ecologically sensitive planet.[source?] In total, the vessel had five engines, one under the fuselage and two on either wing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The standard proton torpedo launching system was removed and replaced by a newly designed Nubian[source?] ion bomb rack/launcher system.
