After his fighting days ended, Grigmin took his flying skills on the road by operating a barnstorming outfit called Grigmin's Traveling Airshow. Grigmin primarily plied his trade on backwater worlds, dazzling natives with tricks on a variety of outmoded craft, including clunky, old airspeeder, a jetpack and an X-222 high-altitude fighter for his grand finale."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, Grigmin picked up a pair of smugglers, Han Solo and Chewbacca, as his pit crew\u2014Grigmin and Solo clashed frequently over Grigmin's arrogance and overtaxing of his speeder, concerns Grigmin constantly ignored. Things came to a head with Solo during a trip to the backwater world of Saheelindeel, where Grigmin's tricks attracted a large crowd of the indigenous Saheelindeeli. In between repairs to Grigmin's airspeeder, Solo received a lucrative job offer to deliver learning materials to a university on Brigia, giving him the opportunity he had been waiting for to leave Grigmin behind. Wanting to take a shot at Grigmin on the way out, Solo borrowed an acquaintance's cobbled-together barge and upstaged him on his grand finale, infuriating Grigmin with his display of superior flying abilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A tall, broad-shouldered and handsome man, Grigmin was regarded by many around him, especially Han Solo, as infuriatingly arrogant man who had a much greater assessment of his flying skills than was merited.
