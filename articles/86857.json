She was cast out of her clan on Trandosha because of her force-sensitive abilities and lived in Aurilia on Dathomir during the time of the Galactic Civil War. She was outspoken and had an outgoing personality and championed the idea of bringing more people to Aurilia, to study the ways of the Force. She helped to do this through her role as the village's ambassador to the outside world, although she was also a skilled healer. She had feelings for Noldan, but did not want to act upon them until she knew Aurilia was safe, as it was under attack from the Dark Jedi Mellichae and his Sith Shadows."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marite featured in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, but was removed as part the New Game Enhancements of 2005, along with Aurilia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
