The ra-lugg had six legs and yellow or black eyes. It used its two grasping pincers and web-shooting tail to catch its prey, such as the tiny Fleebogs. One of these creatures in particular terrorized the Fleebog tunnels, until a dose of Ewok growing powder caused it to reach a larger size. Frightened by its sudden change in size, the ra-lugg fled into the forest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
