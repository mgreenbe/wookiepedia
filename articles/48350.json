Around the year 700 BBY, Fird served Alsakan as its legislative delegate in the Senate of the Galactic Republic. During this time, a proposal for the creation of an Outer Expansion Zone of Republic colonization was introduced to the Senate for review and a vote. The effort was supported by several of the galaxy's megacorporations, which were displeased with the Republic's slow pace of expansion into the Inner Rim territories north of the capital planet Coruscant and the Perlemian Trade Route."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the hearings on the Matter of Creating an Outer Expansion Zone, Senator Fird addressed the Republic Congress, weighing the benefits and drawbacks of continuing to allow only the central government to commission colonies. The initiative to create the Zone was eventually approved, and the Senate delegated the task of administering the new colonies to the Expansionist Oligarchy\u2014a consortium of megacorporations who had been advocating for the creation of the region. The experiment ultimately failed, however, as the Oligarchy began to exploit the resources and native peoples in the Outer Expansion Zone. The resulting scandals and uprisings forced the Senate to step in and relieve the Expansionist Oligarchy of control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Fird was a Human with dark brown hair, green eyes, black decorative markings on his face, and facial hair around his jawbone, mouth, and chin.
