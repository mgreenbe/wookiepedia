The battalion fought the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and his allies outside a Nevarro cantina before the stormtroopers forced them to retreat inside. Gideon ordered an incinerator trooper to burn them out, but \"the Child\" used the Force to send the flames back. Djarin and the others escaped into the sewers and, while they were pursued, eventually defeated Gideon and his forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gideon's battalion first appeared in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" and was identified as a battalion in the descriptive audio of \"Chapter 8: Redemption.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
