Disguised as a stammering miner, he would claim that he was forced to land on the world and make some repairs to his hauler. As he was waiting for spare parts, he rested himself in a local cantina where he met Kirry, a Human female who seemed specially interested in his company. He also got in trouble when a brute called Kerlo tried to rob him. Due to the incident with Kerlo, he was invited to a duel with the world's ruler, Shoto Eyefire. While he was armed with shaped charges, the Jedi was forced to draw his lightsaber to defeat Eyefire and his guards. Destroying the arena with the charges and blasting Eyefire in the kneecaps, the Jedi was successful in liberating the world from the tyrant's reign of oppression. Returning to his ship, the Jedi appeared dressed in traditional robes and no longer had the stammer of his miner guise. The woman who he had befriended, Kirry, asked him what his real name was; he swore that he would tell her the next time he saw her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Pinky\" is not really the character's name, but is what Kerlo calls him while mocking him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
