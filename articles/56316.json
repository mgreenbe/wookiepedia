At age 3, he was sent with his mother to hide on the moon of Nierport VII, where Tura worked at a refueling station. Xanatos told his son everything about the Jedi Order, his former Master Qui-Gon Jinn, and how much they \"misunderstood\" the Force. While he hoped that Omega would be Force-sensitive, he soon realized this was not the case. Nevertheless, upon his death, he left his fortune from the Offworld Mining Corporation to Omega."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a young man, Omega left his home to attend the All Science Research Academy on Yerphonia sponsored by Senator Sano Sauro.

There, Obi-Wan discovered that Omega planned to dominate the galactic bacta market through the mining of titanite on Haariden."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to Galactic City, Kenobi delved into research on Omega and discovered, with the help of Jedi Temple archivist Jocasta Nu, that Granta was a native of Nierport Seven\u2014a small moon less than a day's journey from Coruscant. With a penchant for collecting Sith artifacts, but possessing no Force sensitivity at all, Omega was extremely wealthy, though Kenobi could not determine the vast sources of his wealth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Omega later captured Anakin in an attempt to impress the galaxy's hidden Sith Lord, the boy managed to escape and, along with his Master, stopped Omega from pursuing his titanite venture by literally chasing him off planet when Haariden's great volcano erupted. While the Jedi were caught in the disaster, they managed to blast themselves free and catch up with Omega in a final confrontation, pinning him between themselves and a great tidal wave. Even so, the ever-elusive Omega again escaped Kenobi and Skywalker's grasp, eluding capture to slip offworld."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Revelation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 BBY, Omega appeared on the world of Mawan disguised as a crime-lord named Striker (so named because of the projectile pistols his gang used for their first raid on its populace). Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Yaddle were assigned to the planet to negotiate peace between the warring factions there (not knowing that it was Omega who was the orchestrator of everything going on there; indeed, he was reputed to have the most extensive weapons cache of all the crimelords). Omega once again captured Skywalker, and this time was not averse to killing him, his Jedi Masters (Kenobi, Yaddle, Yoda), and all of Mawan with a bioweapon, to further impress the Sith Lord. Though Skywalker escaped and Mawan was protected, Omega succeeded in killing Master Yaddle, who had been protecting Anakin at the time. Omega prepared to escape Mawan from the heart of its capital city Naatan, and Obi-Wan Kenobi tried to stop him. It was during his escape that Omega revealed to Kenobi that he was the son of Xanatos and grandson of Crion. Kenobi was utterly astonished by this news, but realized that it all made sense. Omega obviously inherited his father's fortune from Offworld Mining Corporation, and his father's hatred of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Attacking the Senate"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next few months, Omega worked with the scientist Jenna Zan Arbor. Together they planned to use the neuro-drug known as the Zone of Self-Containment to control thousands of innocent people. In these months, Kenobi and Skywalker encountered Zan Arbor, and were led through a string of puzzles on worlds such as Romin and Falleen that led them to finding Omega on Coruscant. Here they discovered that Omega planned to assassinate Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Though the assassination was foiled, and Palpatine was protected by the Jedi Padawan Ferus Olin, a number of innocent lives were taken (including Senatorial aide Tyro Caladian, who had learned of Palpatine's true identity, but was unable to inform anyone before he was killed). After a battle with Obi-Wan on his speeder bike, Omega managed to escape the Jedi yet again."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Omega's last stand"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Omega was finally granted an audience with the Sith on Korriban and took Zan Arbor with him. He met with the Sith Lord in a tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords, and moments later, encountered the Jedi. He shot and killed Darra Thel-Tanis with his KYD-21 blaster pistol when she tried to protect fellow Padawans Ferus Olin and Tru Veld. After that, he fled and was followed by Obi-Wan. Omega manned an E-web against Kenobi. His weapon overheated and exploded. Omega was thrown against a wall. He made another attempt to attack Kenobi, but was too weak, and Obi-Wan was forced to kill Omega with his lightsaber. Omega's last words were \"I know who he is.
