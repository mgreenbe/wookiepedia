He built a mine in the northern continent and later a nearby city, Bartyn's Landing, that he populated with Shanghaied slaves from Chagri, Dac, Iskalon and Naboo.

By then, the Sailor's Union was still a powerful entity, with the local offices being controlled by shipping manager Kurline. Several non-affiliated workers complained that the Union was threatening them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "C. 29 BBY, Little Mon Cal suffered the outbreak of a fungal plague.
