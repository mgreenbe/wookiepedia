There was a clear distinction between them and the Nalroni who lived in the rural areas of Celanon. Nearly all Celanites were merchants, and wielded total control of the planet. Their wealth was distributed among the rural Nalroni, ensuring that they were popular. Complaints about their excesses by rural Nalroni were countered by being appreciative of the luxuries and amenities that the money brought them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
