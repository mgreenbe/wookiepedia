It had two long lateral wings that folded out during flight operations, and folded up for landing. The shuttle's cockpit was located in a tabular, elongated module connected to the rest of the fuselage by a \"neck\" and equipped with a transparisteel viewport. With its swing-wing design and beak-like head, the Mu-class superficially looked like a bird, especially with its landing gear extended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to their sublight drives, Mu-class vessels were equipped with a hyperdrive and a navigation computer, which allowed them to jump to lightspeed and travel through hyperspace. The shuttle required a crew of two, a pilot and a co-pilot/navigator, but its cockpit was roomy enough to accommodate two additional individuals. Though not properly equipped for combat, the Mu-class still had a mining laser mounted on the top of the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mu-class shuttles saw use during the reign of the Galactic Empire, an authoritarian government that replaced the Galactic Republic at the end of the Clone Wars.
