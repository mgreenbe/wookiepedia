One tactic, the \"Mercevian Nagua\" method, involved entering a building while it was still open, hiding, and then performing the robbery at night when it was closed. The Dagger, also known as the Mercevian Nagua maneuver, employed a similar tactic but was used in space. It involved infiltrating a saboteur aboard a target vessel to disable the hyperdrive. The saboteur would arrange for the ship to exit hyperspace at a pre-arranged location. A variation involved placing multiple infiltrators on the ship to seize the bridge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
