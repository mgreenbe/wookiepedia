The Resolute then entered the system, where it and the other ships battled. Bane ordered his ship out of the battle zone and to jump to hyperspace. While leaving, one of the engines was destroyed by the opposing cruiser. His ship crippled, Bane ordered all memory systems erased, the self-destruct system started, all of the ship's controls transferred to Bane's wrist-com and the bridge to be defended. Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, and Captain Rex boarded the frigate to recover a holocron, stolen by Bane. Battle ensued in the ship's gun deck. Fuel cells were scattered and a battle droid accidentally shot one, triggering a fire that subsequently detonated the fuel supply. Rex, Skywalker, Tano and Denal sought to flee the doomed vessel aboard a Neimoidian shuttle; however, Denal and Koho were killed by Bane. The Duros donned Denal's armor and boarded the shuttle, seconds before his frigate exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
