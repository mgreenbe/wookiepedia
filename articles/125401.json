It was a brownish-yellow color in nature, and when used in a lightsaber, the beam produced was incredibly potent and dealt greater damage. The Jedi Nemo had such a crystal; also the Sith Lord Marka Ragnos had one in his possession."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
