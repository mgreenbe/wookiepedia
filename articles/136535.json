While it did have a limited round capacity compared to standard blasters, its usefulness in aquatic environments was unmatched. It used the ambient water as coolant, which meant repeated use in a standard atmosphere would quickly cause the weapon to overheat and explode. Additionally, the bolts fired in air were substantially less powerful, and the range of the weapon was halved."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
