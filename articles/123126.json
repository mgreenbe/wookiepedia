In the supplement, the players role-play as a group of Republic agents and they can pursue a number of different methods for learning the location of Commander Scherp. If they chose to use intimidation, then after they have made three intimidation attempts, the agents are attacked by six Sernpidal Enforcers. The Enforcers can also call for reinforcements if necessary. To portray the Enforcers, the supplement advises the players to use the police officer statistics provided on page 69 of the sourcebook Threats of the Galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
