He was noted collector of rare artwork, and possessed a flatsculp called \"Stars and Moons\" by a Chandrilan artist. Around 1 BBY, Ammar lost the flatscup to the Sullustan gambler Cunbus Locb; Locb desired to own the piece, and launched an intricate confidence scheme to acquire it which resulted in the Sullustan winning it by cheating during a high-stakes round of sabacc. Ammar realized he had been cheated, and ordered a manhunt for Locb as the gambler escaped. Locb did not survive, and his starship, the XS-800 light freighter Distant Wind, was impounded. Ammar ordered the ship searched for \"Stars and Moons,\" but it was hidden in an extremely well hidden smuggling compartment and remained undiscovered. Ammar eventually ordered the ship to be sold at auction, but offered a substantial reward for the recovery of the flatsculp. During the Galactic Civil War, Ammar was critical of Moff Abran Balfour's hands-off approach to running the neighboring Parmic sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ammar also enjoyed smoking cigarras. In 6 ABY, Ammar placed a winning bid on the lungs of the shockboxer Lobar Aybock, dealing with Reussi Torel Vorne who ran an organ-harvesting operation on Reuss VIII. Vorne would rig shockboxing fights against the Barabel Tull Raine, where the loser would be killed and their body stripped of organs due to a clause in the fight contract that gave Vorne the rights to the loser's corpse. Ammar attended the fight between Raine and Aybock in the Dool Arena in The Broken Tusk, sitting at Vorne's personal table eating Kubindi mudbug and drinking Grada. Due to the intervention of a New Republic Intelligence Service team commanded by Colonel Bren Derlin, Aybock managed to defeat Tull Raine and Vorne's illegal organ donation trade was exposed. At the end of the fight, Raine was knocked out of the shockboxing wedge, landing on Vorne's table. Ammar was sent sprawling and spluttered on his cigarra."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
