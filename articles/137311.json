After the casino purchased exclusive rights to the use of Conical Six, one of the South Conical Mountains in the space station, Sura was stationed at the bottom of the mountain to sell climbing supplies. She offered various climbing equipment for rent including magnetic boots for 15 and repulsor packs for 45. Whilst Sura was stationed at the mountain she remained near the base at a fence built to enclose the Conicals and wore a shirt emblazoned with her employers logo. On one occasion she sent one of her employees, a boy named Jek Bannon, to climb the mountain so that he could capture several images of the peak for promotional use by the casino."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the same day that Surra sent Bannon up the mountain she was told to expect a group of spacers who had been hired by the casino to clear out a vynock infestation on Conical Six. When they arrived she greeted them and offered to rent them her equipment, giving them details on the mountain and mentioning that she had already sent Bannon up the mountain. The climbers then ascended the mountain where they found Bannon collapsed due to heat exhaustion. The group killed several vynocks before waking the boy, who then called Sura and asked for her to send up a transport to pick up both him and the spacers which she did. Upon their return Sura met the transport at the nearest landing pad and thanked the spacers for rescuing Bannon, paying them in vouchers to exchange at the casino for helping and giving them some extra credits for bringing down Bannon's equipment with him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Sura met the spacers she greeted them in a friendly manner and when they saved Bannon she was extremely relieved and thankful, rewarding them for their actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sura was an athletic, red-skinned, female Twi'lek."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sura first appeared as a character in the adventure module \"Conical Six Summit\", one of several modules included in the Suns of Fortune sourcebook for the Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system.
