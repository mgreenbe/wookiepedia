This was successful to an extent. The resulting weapon was lightweight, compact, and powerful like the E-11, yet was capable of engaging targets at ranges of the A280 and SS-V. While meeting BlasTech's usual standards of reliability, many military evaluators had criticised the weapon as being hard to maintain and repair in the field.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The EKX-10 was 89.2cm long, with the housing for the power cell mounted in the weapon's fixed shoulder stock to give smooth ergonomic lines. The weapon was capable of using 35 or 100 shot power packs. The composite foregrip incorporated attachment points for a wide variety of accessories, and a standard fitting for scopes and optics was mounted above the receiver.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
