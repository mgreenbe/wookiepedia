In 17 BBY, a member of the Rodian Tetsu Clan, named Nok, used the Radion to shuttle his family off of war-torn Rodia. He landed on a jungle planet and hid the ship within a large mountain cave. In 4 BBY the Chattza Rodian, Navik the Red, tracked his Tetsu rivals to the tropical planet and laid siege to their village. Nok ushered his family into the Radion and evacuated the planet. He brought them to the densely populated Corellian Sector on the smugglers' moon, Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
