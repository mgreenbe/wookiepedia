Each of those talismans only allowed to turn into one specific creature by tapping into the energy of its \"ur-spirit\"\u2014the single representative spirit for each species in the spiritual realm. The arcane powers of such artifact were a mystery to both Sith and Jedi scholars, who tried to explain their effects to no avail. The Nightsisters sometimes rode black stallions, which were also capable of shape-changing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Charal, the self-appointed Witch-Queen of Endor, possessed such an enchanted ring, lost on Dathomir under Talzin's rule, which gave her the ability to turn into a raven. Charal was known to use it extensively, as she did during the Ewok\u2013Sanyassan conflict of 3 ABY. On one such occasion, she transformed into a beautiful princess-like young woman in order to capture Cindel Towani. In this case, however, it is possible that her ring was not involved, so either she used traditional illusion, her cloak was Force-imbued, or she transformed through some other means."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Force-based metamorphosis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ones, a family of extremely powerful and immortal entities who lived on the planet Mortis, wielded the ability to assume the appearance of virtually anyone or anything. One of them, the Son, would often turn into a winged gargoyle, but he once used the features of the late Shmi Skywalker Lars when confronting her son, the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. Another member of the Ones, the Daughter, would assume the form of a large, luminous griffin. Similarly, the Force entity known as Abeloth was capable of stealing the physical appearances of beings that she had consumed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sister Ros Lai, the biological daughter of Clan Mother Zalem, was known to use the art of illusion to project an image of herself as a deformed hag known as \"the Rancor\". She began transforming into the Rancor as a youth in order to avoid suspicion while plotting to avenge her dead father. When Lai stood away from her sisters' prying eyes, she would assume her natural form. Around 31 BBY, Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos arrived on Dathomir on a mission from the Jedi Council to stop Zalem from using a Star Temple's Infinity Wave against Coruscant, and witnessed Ros Lai's abilities at metamorphosis firsthand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another Nightsister stranded on planet Shira could use metamorphosis to take the shape of any being between 1.5 to 1.9 meters and 40 to 80 kilograms.
