At the time of the Galactic Civil War, portables were expensive, and some considered them outdated\u2014since droids could be used to achieve the same results. However, portables retained many advantages: they were small enough to fit in a backpack, had a high memory capacity and processing power, and were equipped with several interface ports so the operator would not have to carry various cable adaptors. Additionally, while droids could develop personality quirks or be unavailable for the task, portables remained under full control of their operators.
