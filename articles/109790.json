To fill the open void in the Imperial government, the regional governors were given direct control over their territories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under those circumstances, Quorl Matrin lost his status as a senator, but was made Governor of the planet Stenos, in the Outer Rim Territories. He answered to Grand Moff Bertroff Hissa, a part-Human, part-Sephi hybrid who had risen within the ranks in spite of the Empire's speciesist policies. Matrin and Hissa became close friends, driven by their shared passion for archaeology. Matrin referred to Hissa by his nickname, \"Troff,\" and would often perform impersonations of his superiors, to Hissa's amusement. Even when Matrin was away, he kept contact with his Grand Moff friend, including when he started studying the Stenax species on their homeworld of Stenos. Matrin had promised he would keep Hissa up to date during the expedition, including his difficulty getting the attention of the autochthons. Their relationship, however, met an untimely end when Matrin died only a few months after the disbanding of the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a Rebel hero named Luke Skywalker found the statue of Vol, a ancient Stenax deity, he was betrayed to Matrin.
