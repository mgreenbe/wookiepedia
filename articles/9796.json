Stars were always in motion, moving around the galaxy at speeds measured in kilometers per second. These updates were recalculated and provided by the Space Ministry, which provided these updates for navicomputers for a nominal fee from ministry offices or via download at a spaceport. To aid the Space Ministry, route and sensor data from starships' navicomputers were routinely uploaded and collected for analysis by the ministry's astrogation bureau."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
