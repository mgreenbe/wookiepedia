During the battle, the Orthavan sustained heavy fire from two Victory-class Star Destroyers and the captain was injured; however, the presence of a hostile Interdictor-class Star Destroyer prevented any retreat to hyperspace. The starfighters of Rogue Squadron attempted to help out the beleaguered cruiser, but the captain turned down the offer. Bel Iblis subsequently utilized a squadron of A-wing starfighters to distract the Imperial forces long enough for the Orthavan to close in on the Imperial Interdictor and force it to break off, thus allowing the Republic units to retreat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
