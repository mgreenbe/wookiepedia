T-44 power-shunts were commonly utilized in the droid manufacturing industry, but were also used as weapons against other beings. A set of T-44 power-shunts were sufficiently powerful enough to obliterate an entire airspeeder and a large portion of the area around it. The bomb could also be equipped with a rare protein based triggering mechanism that could target a specific individual's DNA and detonate when said individual was in close proximity to the power-shunt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, during the Separatist Crisis, a set of T-44 power-shunts were placed in the airspeeder of Aks Moe\u2014a Gran Senator and member of the Senate Loyalist Committee\u2014during a state visit to the banking world Aargau.
