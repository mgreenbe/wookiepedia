During the Battle of Kelrodo-Ai in the Western Reaches Operation of the Reconquest of the Rim, Dibs served under Dagger Flight. After complications arose regarding the entry path to a shaft leading to the Citadel of Axes' hypermatter reactor, Dibs, alongside Rocket, were assigned to hold off any Separatist fighters while Captain Shea Hublin, Amp, and Starks slowly infiltrated the shaft and destroyed the reactor. Consequentially, he, Rocket, Dublin, Amp, and Starks were the only pilots to survive the operation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
