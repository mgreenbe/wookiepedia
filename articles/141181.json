That ship was the Grasp, and she went solo as soon as she could afford it. She became a freelance mercenary who was known to work for Jabba the Hutt as an enforcer. She was ordered by Jabba to recover a gravity-well projector controlled by the Ugors, some time after the Battle of Yavin. The Alliance and the Squibs were after the same projector, hoping to use the device to pull the Elusive out of hyperspace before it could deliver Alliance datapacks to the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teehl could not accurately be called ruthless, because she actually cared about every person she betrayed and killed.
