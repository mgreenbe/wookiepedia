Although they began operations by preying on hyperlane traffic, Jauxson and his bandits eventually set up operations on the planet Clak'dor VII, the homeworld of the Bith. The group set up headquarters in the mountains near the city of Buerhoz, raiding that city and two others every few weeks and protecting themselves from the harsh atmosphere with breath masks and enviro-suits. When a band of spacers confronted the pirates in a skirmish, Jauxson's pirate gang was defeated, resulting in the deposition of Jauxston."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
