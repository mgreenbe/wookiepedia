Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, the Blarina merchant Ohn Gos operated in the town, and when the Blarina scavenger Naka Iit found the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron lost in the deserts he agreed to take the pilot to Blowback Town in his speeder so he might arrange transport offworld with Gos. En route, the pair were attacked by the criminal Strus clan, but Dameron was able to escape them and earn Iit's gratitude, causing the Blarina to promise to intercede with Gos in Blowback and ensure Dameron found passage offworld. The pilot successfully left the planet soon after."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blowback Town was first mentioned in the novelization of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was written by Alan Dean Foster and released in conjunction with the movie in 2015.
