Like the Repulsor-In, it was a frequently encountered obstacle on a swoopchasing course. Regulated to a height of four meters, the Fence had an embedded repulsor field generator that pushed back against approaching swoops. This forced the swoopchaser to increase the throttle in an effort to clear the barrier. Once over the barrier, the repulsor field stopped affecting the swoop, resulting in the vehicle accelerating away from the obstacle at tremendous speeds. The obstacle could be augmented with ion flare pits and repulsor buoy traps to increase the difficulty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
