Jowres and his sister Mia went outside to check the situation but were attacked by the crazed animals. Both were wounded by the animals and developed a severe infection. His worried father sent an urgent call for help and soon a medic arrived at the Zaprin Estate. The medic first tried to help Mia, but the treatment didn't work. So the medic single-handedly killed several of the sick creatures that surrounded the house. From blood samples extracted from the creatures' bodies, the medic was able to create an anti-toxin. After an injection with the new medicine, Jowres and Mia recovered from the infection within a week."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jowres Zaprin was a non-player character (NPC) in Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies who could be found in a remote building in the Nabooian Gallo Mountains south-east of the Lake Retreat.
