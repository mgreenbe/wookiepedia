When the Togorians realized that they and the mosgoths had a common enemy, they started to camp near mosgoth nests for mutual protection. Eventually, Togorians domesticated the mosgoths, and started using them as mounts. This was the event which led to the formation of a Togorian civilization of settled females and nomadic male hunters riding mosgoths to the hunt. Even after making contact with galactic society, both male and female Togorians preferred to walk or ride mosgoths rather than use motorized vehicles. Togorians bonded strongly with their mosgoth mounts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mosgoths were easily tamed, and strong enough to carry a Togorian male on their back in flight.
