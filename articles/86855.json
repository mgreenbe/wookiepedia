She had originally piqued Anakin's interest when she mischievously stole his cherished river stone, which he later retrieved from her. Marit then invited the undercover \"transfer student\" to engage in a friendly on-campus swoop-bike competition, so that the group could test him and his abilities for possible induction as a mercenary comrade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a group mission on Ieria, Gillam and the rest of the band pretended to let Skywalker join the squad, though Marit thought he was really being inducted. Gillam, against Marit's objections, then attempted to murder Skywalker, but Anakin single-handedly defeated all six mercenaries. Marit convinced Tulah, Hurana, and Ze that Gillam had betrayed them and was using them for revenge, not justice. The squad was taken to Coruscant by Anakin, Siri Tachi, Ferus Olin and Obi-Wan Kenobi for questioning, to sort out the lies, betrayals, and criminal activity that had occurred within the group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On one mission, before she had met Anakin, Marit accidentally killed the leader of Tierell while the group was battling a security force.
