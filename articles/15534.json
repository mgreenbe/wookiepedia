For an alien aesthetic, Bear McCreary incorporated synthesizers and manipulated samples. Since Batuu was also a part of the wider Star Wars galaxy, McCreary also made use of symphonic techniques and colors used by John Williams throughout the main saga to \"subtly root the player's experience in the broader mythology of the franchise.\" For \"Tara's Theme,\" Bear McCreary emphasized exotic instruments such as the fujara, Renaissance German H\u00fcmmelchen bagpipes, frame drums, and dumbek."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
