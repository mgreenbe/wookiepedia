The officer was a young, untested Imperial officer who had been commissioned in the aftermath of the Battle of Endor. The boy attempted to force Jom to surrender but Jom tried to talk the officer into abandoning his post. Instead, the officer tried to shoot Jom with his blaster; prompting Barell to shove him into a footlocker trunk. Jom then took control of the turbolaser and used it to damage the Imperial financier Arsin Crassus's yacht the Golden Harp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
