Having made up her mind, she makes them promise not to tell anyone, and stows away in one of the beasts luggage boxes. As the Jindas leave, X and O find it a good opportunity to kidnap Latara, if they follow the caravan, but Chief Chirpa mentions to another Ewok that they most likely will not see them again for they have a tendency to get lost between performances."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time in the caravan's journey, Latara makes herself known to Bondo, the leader of the Tribe, who assures her he will take care of her, but warns her that the entertainment business will have work too, but she still wants to join them anyway.

Excited to escape, she awaits to be lifted, and she is a little, before a not in the ropes gets the pulley system stuck. To stall, Bondo suggests she play a song on her flute, to which she agrees. During the song, the Ewoks attempt to untangle the ropes, but one of them falls with the rope wrapped around him, and pulls all of the others down, in the ruckus all of their costumes come off and the Duloks are angry to see Ewoks at their show. They chase the Ewoks, but Wicket takes the magic seed Logray gave them, and throws it into the swampy grounds the Duloks are running on.
