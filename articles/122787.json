A being placed inside of the box would not be able to see or hear anything. Around 47 BBY, it was used on the planet of Apsolon by the Absolutes to torture prisoners. When the Absolutes were removed from power, all but one of the devices were destroyed, with the last one being placed in a museum. Six years later, in a bid to return to power, the Absolutes stole the device, captured the twins Eritha and Alani, and placed them inside while demanding that Supreme Governor Roan resign. Soon after, the Jedi Tahl was captured and held in the sensory deprivation containment device for several days, which, combined with the injection of a paralytic drug, led to her death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
