So Syayna pretended to kill Skywalker by shooting him with a stun bolt. Prepredenko informed Vader of Skywalker's \"execution\" and was immediately arrested and tortured by Vader's stormtroopers. With his last breaths, he apologized to his daughter before passing away. His death, illegally filmed and broadcast live by 3DVO, drove the Jazbinans to rise up against the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
