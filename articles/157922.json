Rin argued that living organisms had to exhibit organization into a unique morphological structure, had to respond to stimuli in their environment, had to metabolize fuel to provide energy, had to reproduce themselves, and had to adapt to changes in the environment (evolution). Rin recounted his universal definition of life in his book Catalog of Intelligent Life in the Galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
