Years before the war began, he helped design a command signal that would shut down the Trade Federation's droid army to prevent anyone from ever using their droids against them.

At the behest of the Trade Federation, he served as one of the engineers who constructed a signal override apparatus that would shut down the conglomerate's droid army in case enemies ever attempted to turn the droids against their masters. Years later, Dellso joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems along with his people and participated in the Clone Wars against the Galactic Republic. The war ended when the Separatist Droid Army was shut down by the same signal that Dellso had helped design, which spread through the Separatist fleet via the HoloNet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Determined to continue the fight against the Galactic Empire, the Republic's post-war successor state, the fugitive Dellso holed up inside a former Separatist mining facility on the planet Mustafar\u2014the same fortress where the Sith Lord Darth Vader had slaughtered the Separatist Council at the end of the war. Possessing stolen dataplans for an experimental Imperial starfighter, Dellso needed protection while he planned his next move. He reactivated a hidden droid factory near the mining facility and began producing new battle droids that he intended to use as his own private army. Intimately familiar with the parameters of the droid deactivation device he had helped design, Dellso managed to countermand the shut-down signal. He also built prototypes of a new battle droid in the hopes of resurrecting the Separatist army."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Failed droid rebellion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime between 17 BBY and 12 BBY, the Empire became aware of the threat that Dellso posed, and his location on Mustafar was discovered by Darth Vader. Seeking to end the rebellion before it could develop into a full-fledged war, Vader dispatched the elite 501st Legion of stormtroopers to eliminate Dellso and destroy his droid army. In space over Mustafar, Dellso's fleet confronted the Imperials, and his droid forces began boarding the 501st's Star Destroyer. However, the 501st repelled the boarders, destroyed a number of droid starfighters, crippled a Providence-class carrier/destroyer, and stole a Belbullab-24 strike bomber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 501st then landed on the planet and stormed the mining facility, where Dellso's army fought to fend off the stormtroopers and keep his rebellion alive, while the Imperials were determined to prevent the Clone Wars from reoccurring. After the 501st destroyed his prototype battle droid schematics, Dellso personally entered the fray, accompanied by other armed Geonosians and battle droids. Dellso rained fire down upon the Imperials with a Bulldog RLR, but the 501st ultimately overwhelmed his forces and killed the fugitive Geonosian by blasting him. The Empire then bombarded Mustafar from space, destroying both the mining facility and Dellso's factory\u2014and with it the last stubborn remains of the droid army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many of the 501st Legion's early missions remained classified for decades until some of its members' datapad journals emerged.
