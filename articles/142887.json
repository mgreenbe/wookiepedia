The Galactic Empire sent an ambassador to the world, and the Contessa's family refused Imperial presence, believing they would not return. By five years later, however, the Empire had killed the members of the ruling family, aside from the Contessa, and enslaved the world's subjects, who had initially greeted the Empire as their liberator. Following the Empire's loss to the Rebel Alliance at the Battle of Endor, the Contessa, who had become a rebel pilot, returned to her homeworld to stand for the presidency."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Contessa's homeworld was first mentioned in the novel Lost Stars, written by Claudia Gray and published in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
