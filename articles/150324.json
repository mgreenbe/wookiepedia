It was considered very primitive; to the untrained ear, it sounded like shrieking and hollering. It also included many grunts, growls and honking noises used as punctuations. However, it was really a complex language, and people from other species found it very difficult to learn. Properly speaking in Tusken required a good amount of phlegm. Protocol droids could be properly equipped with a Tusken language pack for fluency."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tusken language had no written form, relying instead only in oral tradition.
