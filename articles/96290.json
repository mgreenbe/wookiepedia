The capital city of Harnaidan, one of the largest on Muunilinst, featured towering buildings in this style. Most Neo-Classical buildings were rectangular, with an external colonnade along the sides and a pitched roof. Thanks to its architecture, the city itself was described as a masterpiece of design and art, and some thought of Harnaidan as the antithesis of Coruscant, Denon and other such overgrown ecumenopoleis. The city of Pilaan also contained similar constructions that rose hundred of stories above the ground and were made of marble. Some of the edifices even had precious gems incrusted in their columns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
