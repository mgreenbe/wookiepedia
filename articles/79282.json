The mine was buried to a depth of half a meter as part of creating an effective defensive perimeter. It utilized two sensor suites: a gravity-sensitive sensor which detected the magnetic disturbances of passing vehicles, and a thermal sensor which detected body heat. An intruder detected within five meters of the mine would cause it to detonate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once set, the LX-4 could not be disarmed except by detonation, which was considered a major drawback of its use.
