Luke Skywalker managed to convince Sunber to let him and Princess Leia Organa go, and the Rebel ships were able to escape through hyperspace and scatter throughout the galaxy. Much of the fleet was deemed lost, possibly for good. Despite the destruction of much of the Rebel fleet, their escape resulted in an overall strategic failure for the Empire as even though Vader's plan of defeating the Rebel Alliance in one fell swoop managed to destroy several major capital ships, and leading to the eventual loss of Rebel One, the Alliance Fleet rebuilt with aid from allies such as the Mon Calamari and eventually go on to defeat the Imperial Navy at the Battle of Endor over three years later in 4 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Essential Atlas places the disaster at Deepspace Besh in grid square P-13, in the Sepan sector of the Expansion Region."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
