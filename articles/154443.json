He participated in the search for Wraith Squadron pilot Ton Phanan when his TIE Fighter crashed on the planet. This Raptor questioned the stormtrooper guarding the crash site for more information; and deeming the information inadequate, the Raptor and his partner mounted their speeder bikes to conduct a search of their own. Just as they were about leave, they were shot to death by Garik Loran; another Wraith who was also searching for Phanan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
