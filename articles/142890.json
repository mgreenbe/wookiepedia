The messages indicate that the engineers of the project are in an Imperial facility on Coruscant\u2014and that is where the heroes must go. Traveling to Imperial Center, the heroes sneak past the world's defenses and take their first steps on the capital planet of the Galactic Empire. Under the watchful eye of the Empire, the heroes pinpoint the location of the project's architects and travel to a massive skyscraper still under construction.\nMoving up through the skyscraper, the heroes soon come face to face with the engineers of the Sarlacc Project. Unfortunately, they are all being watched by several members of the Inquisitorius, who fight the heroes to the death. When their defeat seems imminent, the Inquisitors detonate explosives at the base of the skyscraper, which begins to collapse. The heroes must fight their way back out of the collapsing building and make their way to safety.\nHowever, the heroes finally learn the details of the Sarlacc Project. The Empire is constructing a massive new starship 12 kilometers long\u2014many times larger than a Star Destroyer, and an early prototype (though not the final version) of the Super Star Destroyer. The new vessel will serve as the flagship of the Imperial fleet, and the Sarlacc Project nears completion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
