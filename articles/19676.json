Following the Battle of Asylum and the formation of the Anti-Zakuul Alliance, a resistance cell from local Bothans and reconstituted Sith Empire personnel was created on the planet, possessing significant resources and a base of operations. However, before the Alliance could deliver weapons to them, the Star Fortress vaporized the entire cell from orbit. This prompted Theron Shan and the Alliance Commander to take action against Star Fortresses, eventually destroying several of them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bothawui Star Fortress appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire in hologram during the mission \"Battle for the Stars\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
