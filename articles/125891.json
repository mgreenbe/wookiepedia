When Maul approached the Vigo with the premise that he wished to join the crime syndicate, Sinya asserted her skepticism that Maul was \"nothing special.\" Even as he decimated the room single-handedly, Sinya still mocked him, calling him a common assassin. Sinya noticed, only at the end, as Maul quickly overpowered her, and only then did she express fear and doubt about who (or what) Maul was. The Sith beheaded her without a second glance, rendering her unable to defend her employer as Maul impaled him through the eye.
