While working on the The Carol Burnett Show, he designed a \"curtain dress\" (complete with a curtain rod across the shoulders) that Carol Burnett wore in the \"Went with the Wind\" parody. Mackie also designed the garish ensemble worn by Cher at the March 1986 Academy Awards: black stretch pants, a bejeweled loincloth, knee-high boots, a black chain-link top, and a huge feathered Mohawk headdress that was one and a half times taller than her head. Introduced by Jane Fonda with the words, \"Wait'll you see what's gonna come out here,\" Cher was appearing as a presenter after what many considered an Oscar snub (Cher was not nominated for her performance in Mask). \"As you can see,\" said Cher, \"I did receive my Academy booklet on how to dress like a serious actress.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mackie is often called the sultan of sequins, or the rajah of rhinestones, known for his sparkling and imaginative costume designs. He has won seven Emmy Awards for his designs, and was thrice nominated for an Academy Award. He attended Pasadena City College and Chouinard Art Institute.
