The donuts, which contained shredded Ishi Tib-cracked coconut, were made fresh every morning in the internal oil frier of a Crisp-E-O donut droid owned by the Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster, who also owned the diner and considered the donuts delicious. The droid stored the recipe for the donuts on a database of over 2400 donut recipes, and made them in an Adarian style. The donuts cost 1.7, and were available at Dex's at some point prior to its destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's reign."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iced donuts with with shredded Ishi Tib-cracked coconut were first mentioned in the 2009 Hyperspace exclusive article, \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written by Gregory Walker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
