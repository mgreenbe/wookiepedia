This form of force ability was used by the Aing-Tii, a mysterious species living on a planet in the Kathol Rift. This technique allowed the wielder to use the Force as represented by many shades of a rainbow and possibly correlates to the Unifying Force theory in which it manipulates facets of the Aperion and Anima not directly or indirectly present in the Living Force; since the Force usually flows and ebbs either in the direction of the light side or dark side of the force exclusively. It is possibly accessible through being in balance within and around the Force as it relates to the Power of the Cosmos only present in those who do not stray too far into the dark side or light side as referenced by the ancient Kwa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Referenced as \"Many Shades of the Force\" as a talent available to members of the Aing-Tii tradition in the Jedi Academy Training Manual, a supplement for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game, that was released on May 19, 2009."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
