During a flight over a planet, Calson crowded the formation, clipping the wing of Gorjaye's fighter with his own craft. The two ships subsequently crash-landed in the Wilds, an area of heavy jungle and swamps inhabited by insect swarms and vicious predators. Before Calson could unstrap himself from his stricken fighter, Gorjaye\u2014who had quickly freed herself from her own stricken fighter\u2014manually opened his cockpit and dragged him out. Calson angrily told Gorjaye that he could take care of himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gorjaye gave Calson a verbal dressing down for his actions that had led to the crash, telling him that he had to follow her orders to survive. Calson disagreed, refusing to follow the orders of a woman. Indignant, but aware that Calson was her responsibility as he was her subordinate, Gorjaye used a directional transponder and a datapad map to locate a settlement seventeen kilometers northwest from their current position and suggested that they head out immediately."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calson, however, had other ideas. During his descent, he had spotted something in the Wilds and planned to investigate. When Gorjaye ordered him to follow her, Calson relieved himself of her command. Taking his survival gear bag, he used his blaster to begin clearing a path through the jungle. Shortly after leaving Gorjaye, Calson was ambushed by a corvaj, a predator native to the Wilds, and was killed.

His overconfidence in his own abilities led directly to the crash-landing in the Wilds, and eventually to his own death. A chauvinist, Calson refused to take orders from women such as Gorjaye, even though she was his superior officer.
