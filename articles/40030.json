Around 4 ABY, the New Republic's Barma Battle Group launched an attack on the 204th at the planet Pandem Nai. Members of Draige's squadron pursued the New Republic pilot and Imperial defector Yrica Quell during the battle, in which Draige perished. Having taken many losses, the fighter wing fled the Pandem Nai system. After taking command of the 204th, Major Soran Keize suggested replacing the late pilot with another named Arron, but ultimately chose to transfer and promote the pilot Palal Seedia to fill Draige's role as Arron had also died by that time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Draige was mentioned in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, the second volume of the Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron trilogy which was written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
