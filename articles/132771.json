He enlists the aid of General Ulric Tagge as well as his younger sister Sister Domina Tagge to help him in the endeavor. Domina is a member of the Order of the Sacred Circle who have thus far remained neutral in the Galactic Civil War, but that will soon change and each side in the conflict will send a single envoy to Monastery to present his case. Vader is to represent the Galactic Empire and Domina ensures that the Rebels would send Luke Skywalker as their representative. However, Leia and Han travel to the system in the Millennium Falcon and orbit Monastery and monitor Luke's activities through R2-D2 who accompanied Luke on the mission. While Luke thinks he may be in over his head on this diplomatic mission, Domina reassures him even though her true intentions are revenge for Luke's involvement in the apparent death of Orman Tagge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader discovers that it was \"Luke\" Skywalker who destroyed the Death Star.
