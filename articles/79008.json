TaggeCo felt that this \"nod\" to the prospective buyers would help persuade the Republic to throw their support to the project. An enhanced sensor globe sat in the upermost portion of the helmet. The \"fingers\" located at the tips of the blast nozzles were of little use in manipulating objects, but, when spinning rapidly as they had been designed to do, could cut through solid durasteel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Design"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orman Tagge began sketching out plans for L8-L9 almost immediately after the blockade and invasion of Naboo, as an army for the Republic to use against the droid forces of the Trade Federation.

Scouts from the House of Tagge reported that the back-water planet of Rattatak and its barbaric arena death matches would be excellent training grounds.

During the battle between the gladiators, L8-L9 identified Asajj as the greatest threat, and attacked her.

However, Tagge continued to work on his idea of an automated trooper, and with the rise of the Galactic Empire and help from General Rom Mohc, TaggeCo began work on a new droid trooper project.
