It almost entirely consisted of an aggregation of former Imperial military units and bases that had been located in the territory that became the Alignment. However, in an effort to bolster its military force and reduce internal tension, nonhumans were allowed to serve in the Patrol.

However, with the return of Emperor Palpatine in 10-11 ABY, the Patrol participated in his series of renewed campaigns against the New Republic. Following the death of Palpatine, and death of the Alignment's leader Ardus Kaine, in 12 ABY the Alignment (along with its military forces) was absorbed into the Imperial Remnant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Patrol's engineering divisions worked with Kuat Drive Yards and Sienar Fleet Systems to design the Enforcer-class picket cruiser.
