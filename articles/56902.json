Infections of the parasite in happabores could be treated with Happy-Bore Medicated Dewormer, a product produced by Galacti-Stok which contained Trestibinexocycline 5-Gamma, thlank oil, greel-root acid and forage products. Use of the dewormer on greater spit-crawlers was suggested in the instructions for the product.
