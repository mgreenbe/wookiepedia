Isard followed her father, Armand Isard, into Imperial Intelligence at a young age, blossoming into a model field agent. After the Alliance to Restore the Republic stole coordinates of the location of the Death Star's construction site, Ysanne was sent on a mission to the planet Darkknell. While the mission was a failure, she survived but the prospect of losing considerable face back on Imperial Center infuriated Isard. She instead found a way to pin the blame on her father. Backed up by members of the Emperor's Royal Guards, she accused her father of treason; the Emperor had him executed within the hour, and she took her father's position as Director of Imperial Intelligence. Isard was exceptionally close to Palpatine, so much so that she was given the second Executor-class Star Dreadnought constructed, the Lusankya. Buried underneath the surface of her homeworld of Coruscant, the Lusankya became a prison and brainwashing facility, and Isard used it to torture the secrets out of many enemies of the Empire, as well as convert selected prisoners into sleeper agents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor, Isard became an advisor to Grand Vizier Sate Pestage, all the while engineering his downfall. In the same day, Isard had Pestage and the Imperial Ruling Council assassinated, leaving her Empress in all but name. Isard commanded a sizable force at the height of her power, though the fact she held Coruscant made her a target for the New Republic. Knowing Coruscant would inevitably fall to the New Republic, she had the Krytos virus developed, so that they would inherit a sick world and hopefully fragment. Isard would eventually make contact with Grand Admiral Thrawn, who, was within the Unknown Regions maintaining his shadow empire. After blasting off Coruscant in the Lusankya, Ysanne Isard supported a political coup of Thyferra, and became a warlord. Rogue Squadron followed her to Thyferra, though, and managed to defeat her forces and capture the planet. Isard was presumed dead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She had, in fact, survived, and remained in hiding during the Thrawn campaign, biding her time and contemplating past mistakes. Sometime during her time in hiding, she was contacted by the reborn Palpatine, and pledged to steal back her Lusankya and present it to him. When her clone allied herself with warlord Delak Krennel and reemerged in the Ciutric Hegemony, Isard provided Rogue Squadron with the location of the Lusankya prisoners, among them Rebel Alliance General Jan Dodonna, to discreetly obtain their aid in eliminating her clone. She betrayed the New Republic, though, and attempted to steal the Lusankya from New Republic control at the Bilbringi shipyards. However, a New Republic Intelligence agent, Iella Wessiri, was waiting for her and shot her dead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ysanne Isard was born into a wealthy and influential family on the planet Coruscant in approximately 30 BBY, during the waning days of the Galactic Republic. Her father, Armand Isard, was the Director of the Senate Bureau of Intelligence, becoming the Director of Imperial Intelligence when the Republic was reformed into the first Galactic Empire in 19 BBY. The Isards flourished under Palpatine's rule, possessing far more power and prestige than during the time of the Republic. Ysanne was born with heterochromia iridium, possessing one red and one blue eye, though her features were said to be otherwise attractive. She was raised on Coruscant and grew up in the Emperor's Court; as a young child, she idolized her father, boasting of his power to anyone that would listen. Armand Isard saw fit to allow his young daughter to accompany him to work, and had no qualms about her being in the presence of dangerous individuals like High Inquisitor Antinnis Tremayne; others did, however, and often questioned the presence of a child in high-security areas. During the Great Jedi Purge, Ysanne went with her father to Imperial facilities on Coruscant often, though she displayed little awareness of his work: aiding Palpatine's Dark Jedi in hunting down Jedi fugitives. She was also known to attend Imperial party receptions with her father, rarely leaving his side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Any na\u00efvet\u00e9 present in Ysanne Isard was gone by the time she reached adolescence, when the coldness and ambition she inherited from her father began to manifest itself. Armand began training his daughter from a very young age as a field operative, hoping for her to follow in his footsteps and gain a position in Imperial Intelligence. Ysanne was incredibly ambitious, and, after flourishing and growing into an expert field agent, she began to plot her ascension behind his back. She did not take advantage of her father's position, using her own talents\u2014augmented by her vigor and ruthlessness when dealing with enemies of the Empire\u2014to rise above her peers. She built up a plethora of contacts and alliances within Imperial Intelligence, who were able to help her in acquiring information that her rank did not allow her; despite the most stringent of security procedures, she managed to find out about the Death Star project at least a year before it was officially announced. From a young age, Ysanne developed a close personal devotion to the Emperor, and found his power and charisma attractive; she eventually came to love him. By the time she was in her twenties, Isard had become one of the best field agents among Imperial Intelligence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isard had a multitude of fellow agents who acted as her back-up on assignments; although she was a capable and cunning operative, Ysanne lacked physical strength, which these men provided in abundance. In addition, she also personally led a brute squad composed of former stormtrooper NCOs\u2014men who had been chosen for their physique rather than their intelligence. She along with the rest of her squad specialized in \"dagger and fist\" missions. The male members of her squad were also widely rumored to be her lovers in addition to her muscle. Although these rumors were unsubstantiated, it was known that Isard had little time for a conventional social life due to being completely dedicated to the structure of the New Order. Isard saw agents such as Jahan Cross to be cheaper than hired guns, such as the bounty hunter, Boba Fett. In 3 BBY, Ysanne ran into Cross outside the office of Armand. She revealed to him that his mission to assassinate Adan Dooku wasn't done because the Count was an enemy of the Empire, but rather done at the request of power hungry factions in Serenno's government."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 0 BBY, Ysanne was one of the foremost field agents of her time, and Armand was proud to have her as his daughter. He nevertheless felt threatened by her ambition, especially due to her and her brute squad's departure from his own policy of subtle and civilized ruthlessness. Fearing that she would attempt to overthrow him as director, the elder Isard decided to rid himself of her threat."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Darkknell"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One year before the Battle of Yavin, Ysanne Isard was summoned by her father to meet with him in his office, where he outlined the parameters for her next mission, to the world of Darkknell. Agents of the Alliance to Restore the Republic had managed to steal a set of datacards containing coordinates to the exact location of the Death Star's construction site at Despayre, and a transfer between Alliance agents was due to take place on Darkknell. Isard was tasked with retrieving the datacards, capturing the Rebel agent sent to pick them up, and identifying the traitor who had stolen them, though the datacards were by far the most important part of her mission. Ysanne was not permitted to take the usual full complement of Intelligence forces with her due to the secrecy of the mission, though her father allowed her to take one of her most trusted enforcers\u2014a hulking man named Trabler\u2014to assist her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Acting under the false identity of Darkknell Special Security agent Katya Glasc, Isard passed through Darkknell's customs, heading immediately to the capital city of Xakrea. She knew that the Rebel would be taking refuge among the fringe population of Xakrea, and planned to visit any individual who provided identity-changing services. Knowing that anyone who would provide him with a new identity would sell her his real identity, she had Trabler drive her to each establishment in turn, starting with Arky's Emporium of Forgotten Treasures. Once there, she encountered Hal Horn, a high-ranking Corellian Security Force officer, and enlisted his help in searching for the Rebel. Horn was searching for a criminal, Moranda Savich, who Isard claimed to have caught sight of. She ushered the Corellian out of the building, revealing no details about Savich, and guided him back to her rented landspeeder. En route, they saw Moranda Savich speaking with Trabler; Isard ordered her enforcer to shoot the woman. With Savich dead, Horn was in Isard's debt, though he initially refused to help her in hunting down Rebels. She used the recently reported death of Horn's fellow Corellian Garm Bel Iblis against him, claiming that as the Rebel they were hunting had killed Bel Iblis, it was Horn's duty as a Corellian to help her track him down. She claimed that Bel Iblis was a loyal Imperial, though in truth his assassination had been ordered by Armand Isard because of the Corellian's anti-Imperial tendencies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isard visited various criminal establishments all over Xakrea, trying to force information pertaining to the Rebel Alliance out of them, though none of the meetings proved fruitful. Horn, clearly recognizing Ysanne and her bodyguard as citizens of Imperial Center, became suspicious of them, and secretly sought to find an opportunity to abandon them and return to Corellia. Eventually, in a cantina named the Continuum Void, Isard learned that the subject of one of the holographs of suspected Rebels had had something extremely valuable stolen from him earlier in the day. The Devaronian barman could not identify the thief, though he told them that it was a brown-haired Human female. Knowing that Moranda Savich was a well-known thief, she secretly had Trabler check local police and hospital records to find out if they had recovered Savich; Isard then led Hal Horn back to her safehouse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Horn had outlived his usefulness, and Isard suspected that he had attempted to hide Savich's role in the theft of the datacards, for reasons unknown. After Trabler reported back and informed her that Savich did not show up on any local hospital or police records, she had him travel to the safehouse before they reached it, ready to ambush the CorSec officer. Horn was able to defend himself from Trabler's crude blows, however, and managed to incapacitate him and steal his blaster. He and Isard exchanged several blaster bolts, all of which barely missed their intended targets, before Trabler resurfaced. Horn was again too quick for the man, stabbing him with a hidden vibroblade. Her enforcer killed, Isard had no choice but to listen to Horn, who destroyed a holograph of Moranda Savich\u2014the only conclusive means Isard had of identifying her. Horn confirmed that it had been Savich who had stolen the datacards from the Rebel at the Continuum Void cantina, and offered to help Isard track her down in exchange for his life. Knowing Horn was her only chance at recovering the datacards, Isard agreed to his proposition, on the condition that Horn wear a choke-collar. The irremovable device would cut off the blood flow to the Corellian's neck and kill him at Isard's command, or else whenever she perished. Horn agreed to this, and allowed the field operative to fix the collar to his neck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With few leads to follow, Horn deduced that the Continuum Void was their best bet for locating Moranda Savich, as it stocked Gralish liqueur, a favorite beverage of hers. Once there, however, Savich was nowhere to be seen, and the barman was also missing\u2014Horn theorized that Savich had sent him elsewhere, tying up a loose end which could lead Isard to her. They also learned that she was acting with an accomplice\u2014either a Rebel agent or a fellow criminal. Initially, Ysanne suspected that Seb Arkos, the owner of Arky's Emporium of Forgotten Treasures, was the accomplice, though Horn, who'd had dealings with Arkos previously, told her that the information broker was unlikely to get himself involved with anything as serious as Savich's situation. Isard planned to track down the manager of the cantina and listen to whatever story Savich had spun him; from there, they could backtrack through it and find another lead to the thief and her accomplice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This was, however, a ploy by Savich intended to distract Isard, while the criminal found the highest bidder for the datacards. Midway through their search for the barman's known associates, the two noticed several occurrences of Darkknell defense airspeeders speeding through the city's streets, which they suspected were related to the Rebel agents running amok. Isard decided to abandon their previous strategy and return to the safe-house, where she could tap into local records to find out what the defense airspeeders were up to. Once there, she was able to confirm that the airspeeders were responding to Savich; almost immediately afterwards, Horn received a comlink message from the woman, who told Isard that she would hand over the datacards for one million credits, and nothing less. Savich told them to meet her with the money at a nearby warehouse, where she hoped Isard and local defense forces would have an auction of sorts. Isard, however, hacked into the local files once again, sending the entire Darkknell security force on a non-existent training exercise to the nearest spaceport. They were then interrupted by a woman named Allyse Conroy\u2014actually Savich in disguise\u2014who claimed to be an old friend of Horn's. When Darkknell Defense Agency officer Nyroska arrived, Savich claimed that she was Ysanne Isard, and that Isard and Horn were Rebel agents. With Isard unable to provide proper identification, Nyroska took Savich's word for it, and had all of them transported to his headquarters. Savich managed to escape soon after Ysanne showed them her identification; the datacards had made their way into Mon Mothma's hands, and Isard had failed in her mission."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rise to power"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The prospect of losing considerable face back on Imperial Center infuriated Isard, so she instead found a way to pin the blame on her father. She eventually found her opportunity when she uncovered evidence that her father planned to overthrow the Emperor. Upon her return, Armand told his daughter that she would not be executed for her failure. Rather than express gratitude, however, Ysanne launched a stinging attack against Armand, claiming he knowingly sent her on a suicide mission, that he was a member of the Rebel Alliance, and that he had prevented the assassination of Garm Bel Iblis from succeeding. Backed up by members of the Emperor's Royal Guards, she accused her father of treason; the Emperor had him executed within the hour. It was rumored that Ysanne herself fired the shot that killed him, though this was unverified."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isard almost immediately took the reins of Imperial Intelligence from her father, replacing him as Director. Now that she had finally achieved the power she craved, she put all her effort into pleasing Emperor Palpatine, the only person who mattered. Isard ruled through the careful use of fear, making sure to let her subordinates know that if they failed she would have them severely punished. While this did not engender loyalty, it worked to keep her minions in line. Sometimes, though rarely, Ysanne used rewards for good performances as a way to motivate those under her command. She was rarely able to keep her anger under control, however, and any promotions handed out were frequently rescinded. Officially, her power was circumscribed by the Ubiqtorate, a group of powerful advisors, although she did not argue with it. In actuality, her real purpose was to monitor the behavior of those of the Ubiqtorate members."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isard made many suggestions to the Emperor about how he might rule his Empire more effectively, and he provided her with whatever resources were necessary to achieve her means. One of her suggestions was to build a prison center which could also act as a brainwashing facility. She wanted to be able to capture members of the Rebel Alliance, brainwash them into becoming sleeper agents, and send them back to their superiors, awaiting the right moment to activate them. Palpatine was impressed by her ideas, and awarded her with the second Executor-class Star Dreadnought known to exist. While Darth Vader's flagship Executor was constructed at Fondor, its twin was constructed at Kuat\u2014and was also originally named Executor to conceal the existence of a second ship. For years, both shipyards claimed to have built the famous Executor, but Isard re-christened her Kuati vessel as Lusankya. Although the exact details of how he did it would forever elude Isard, Palpatine secretly had the ship placed deep underneath the cityscape of Coruscant, using his power with the Force to remove it from any witnesses' memories. She also ensured that several members of the Ubiqtorate who attempted to use the Intelligence apparatus for their own ends were \"reassigned\" to the Lusankya. As such, her power steadily increased until she effectively was the entire Imperial security apparatus, suppressing elite intrigues and civic unrest alike. Around six months after the Battle of Yavin, Palpatine confided the location of her new facility to her, at the same time that Vader's Executor became operational. Isard's first prisoner was General Jan Dodonna of the Rebel Alliance, the man responsible for the plan to destroy the Death Star. Dodonna became a leader figure among Isard's prisoners, who were made up largely of his fellow Rebels, but also of ineffectual officers or personal enemies of Isard's. Overall, the Super Star Destroyer took in millions of inmates, and it ultimately served its purpose well; the thought of the shadowy \"Lusankya\" facility struck fear into most Rebels' hearts, with many sleeper agents being successfully deployed among the ranks of the Rebellion. Much of her time was taken up dealing with the Rebel Alliance\u2014Isard took them far more seriously than Palpatine did, but was unable to bend his opinion on the matter. Although Isard was feared by many, ultimately most carried out her orders out of respect, and not simply fear. Isard was also referred to as an admiral by some."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While most of her work was done in secret, Ysanne was occasionally called upon by the Empire to perform more public actions. On at least one occasion, she personally thanked civilians on behalf of the Empire, such as Garik Loran, a child holovid actor who starred in Imperial propaganda films. At some point during her tenure as Director, Isard was responsible for naming a new prison on Coruscant; she named it the Armand Isard Correctional Facility, after her father. Palpatine also had her spy on close confidants to gauge their loyalty at some of the Emperor's elaborate parties, which she regularly attended. At one such event, Isard learned of Mara Jade, one of the Emperor's Hands. As she could not find an ounce of information on Jade, Isard immediately marked her as a potential enemy, and questioned Palpatine about her loyalty. Palpatine had no fears about Mara Jade, though, and told Isard he feared betrayal from her more than Jade. Furious, Isard held an intense personal grudge against Jade, one she made no attempt to hide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during the Galactic Civil War, one of Isard's agents, a man named Vune Willic, was framed for attempting to assassinate Emperor Palpatine at the Galactic Games on Imperial Center. His attempts were foiled, and Isard had him imprisoned, and scheduled his execution. It was an embarrassment to her that high-ranking Imperial officials plotted to kill Palpatine, though she was able to smooth things over in the end by framing him in their place to downplay the threat. Willic was given a dose of truth serum, and Isard got a chance to test out the new YI-5 Surveillance/Interrogation Droid. Vune Willic gave a clean confession for the HoloNet, and Isard had him killed the next day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, some Imperial counterintelligence agents intercepted a transmission from Leia Organa, one of the leaders of the Rebel Alliance, in which Organa called upon Alliance forces to rally in three cities: Bestine on the planet Tatooine, Dearic on the planet Talus and Keren on the planet Naboo. Isard sent a communiqu\u00e9 containing a copy of the recording to senior Imperial naval officers and called for Imperial forces to be assigned to capture the three cities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, Isard was also involved in the development of the Conqueror, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer equipped with a superlaser, much like the one on the Death Star. After the construction of the ship was finished, the Conqueror was stationed in the Mustafar system, where a single test shot was fired with the superlaser at one of the system's uninhabited planetoids, obliterating it completely. Shortly after the test, Isard was present on Mustafar, where she met with the Blackguard, a sect of Dark Jedi with whom the Imperial Intelligence had formed an alliance necessary to the Conqueror project. Isard and a group of Blackguard Elite Minions rode a speeder to a landing site, where supply shuttles from the Conqueror arrived to once a day. When they reached the site and exited the speeder, the shuttle had not arrived yet, so Isard took her time to remind the Blackguard of the utmost importance of the operation. Suddenly, a group of Rebels\u2014members of Renegade Squadron sent to destroy the Conqueror\u2014emerged from their cover, and a firefight ensued. Isard was outgunned, and she commanded the Blackguard to fall back. The Dark Jedi provided suppressive fire, keeping down the Rebels while Isard retreated back to the speeder. The surviving Blackguard then jumped into the speeder, and Isard fled from the site. Isard warned the Conqueror's commander, Admiral Victor Strang, of the impending arrival of the Rebels aboard the Star Destroyer. Nevertheless, the Rebels were able to infiltrate the Conqueror by using the supply shuttle, and they destroyed the superlaser-equipped vessel from within with explosive charges."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, Isard visited the base of Baron Soontir Fel, leader of the 181st Imperial Fighter Group, who had caught her eye at previous functions. Isard had been sent to inform Fel of the impending attack at the Rebels' base on Derra IV, orchestrated by Vader and Mitth'raw'nuruodo. She attempted to seduce Fel, both sexually and with offers of promotions and power. The pilot refused to be captivated by these advances, though Isard simply claimed to have been sent by the Emperor to test his loyalty. As he had passed this test, she presented him with an offer to fly at Derra IV, Fel accepted, though for his rejection Isard had marked him as yet another enemy\u2014something which Fel himself recognized and feared. Isard presumably played a part in the operations at Derra IV, as she was present at the awards ceremonies that followed. Although she was no longer an active field agent, Isard kept herself in good physical condition, often working out in gyms, and undergoing strenuous holographic training exercises. She was known to train against holograms of her enemies, letting out her frustration against them in a less volatile environment."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post-Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Rebel Alliance destroyed the second Death Star, taking with it the Emperor and Darth Vader. The Empire was left in a state of decay, and a huge power vacuum was left by Palpatine's death\u2014one that many, including Isard, sought to fill. Infuriated by the Emperor's death and the celebrations on Imperial Center that followed, Isard deployed her forces and arrested hundreds of thousands of civilians celebrating the Rebellion's victory. Although she successfully managed to suppress the revolt, she also discovered that none of the other surviving Imperial leaders had even reacted to the protests. This led to her deciding that the other Imperial leaders are incapable of leading the New Order, and thus made plans to ensure the downfalls of Grand Vizier Sate Pestage, General Paltr Carvin, and Grand Moff Hissa. After overcoming the initial shock of the death of her idol, Isard saw how things could be used to her advantage. Grand Vizier Sate Pestage had taken the reins of the Empire, though his paranoia and stress made him a weak ruler; Ysanne took advantage of this, acting as a neutral party between Pestage and the Imperial Ruling Council, who sought to claim power for themselves. Pestage was soon eating out of Isard's hand, and she began to maneuver both his and the Council's downfall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after Endor, Isard's agents captured Mara Jade and the Director had her placed in captivity. After conferring with Pestage to learn as much as possible about the woman, Ysanne decided that she was too great a threat to be an ally, and began to have her brainwashed into giving Isard secrets about the Empire that she was not previously aware of. Ysanne Isard could not touch the Force, and did not give it much thought or consideration, so it was unsurprising that she underestimated Mara Jade's abilities with it. The Emperor's Hand used a mind trick to have her interrogator release her and allow her access to a computer terminal. Isard's men detected this immediately, and she personally began to track Jade through the labyrinthine Imperial Palace. She enlisted a tech specialist named Tal Burren to assist her in tracking Jade's movements. They eventually realized Jade was in Isard's personal office, but by the time they arrived, she was gone. The Emperor's Hand had stolen one of Isard's datapads with high level security clearance, and was using it to travel through the building unhindered. Jade had left them many false leads, ordering dozens of shuttles to various docking bays; Isard had men dispatched to each, though she herself went to her personal shuttle Lokvar. Jade ultimately escaped, something which Isard took personally. She made the woman a sworn enemy, and vowed to have her thrown into the bowels of the Lusankya when they next met. Her agents chased Mara Jade to Kintoni, though after that her whereabouts eluded Isard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after becoming Pestage's advisor, Isard discovered Palpatine's personal cloning center deep within the Imperial Palace.

However, Pestage began to notice the New Republic becoming more active, and he and Isard deduced that they were planning something against his Empire. Ysanne advised Pestage to leave bait for the Rebels, suggesting the world of Brentaal IV for such a trap.

Isard, however, was able to keep the furious Fel in check; she had somehow learned of his relationship with Syal Antilles, and goaded him with the possibility of killing his brother-in-law Wedge Antilles, the leader of the New Republic's Rogue Squadron. Fel replied that he would not hesitate to kill Antilles, though, clearly caught off guard by Isard's knowledge of his secret marriage, he began to keep his complaints to himself.

Isard knew that if Pestage fell into the hands of the Ruling Council, he would tell them of her treasonous actions, and she would face prosecution, so she was desperate to have him retrieved and returned to her.

Rather than bring him back alive as agreed, Krennel murdered Pestage, and claimed his holdings, the Ciutric Hegemony, for himself. Isard then had General Paltr Carvin, the acting leader of the cabal, sent to the Lusankya; the Ruling Council was now devoid of leadership, and Isard was Empress all but in name.

The Central Committee of Grand Moffs, led by Grand Moff Bertroff Hissa, proclaimed Trioculus, supposedly the Emperor's son, as the latest Emperor. In an attempt to take Trioculus down, Isard had Zorba Desilijic Tiure released from prison on Kip, hoping he and Trioculus would wipe each other out in a battle for Princess Leia. The New Republic dealt with Trioculus, though Isard had to take measures to deal with the troublesome Church of the Dark Side, whose leader Kadann had proclaimed himself the Emperor. The Church had been formed by Pestage, and they were the only religion citizens were legally allowed to practice. In another attempt to counter them, Isard reinstated galactic freedom of religion, losing the Prophets the support of spiritually-starved citizens. Grand Admiral Afsheen Makati asked for permission from Isard to go after Kadann and kill him; she allowed him, and although he slew Kadann, he himself perished not long after. The survivors involved in the Trioculus affair were rounded up and executed. Several months later, an Imperial Inquisitor named Jerec, supplemented by a band of Dark Jedi, a Super Star Destroyer, and a hoard of financial backers, attempted to usurp her power, though she was able to neutralize the threat he presented.

Isard tracked down Kirtan Loor, an Imperial Intelligence agent operating out of Corellia, and had him brought to her palace on Coruscant. Loor had an eidetic memory, and was adept at many forms of interrogation and torture. After meeting with him to help evaluate and work on his weaknesses, Isard told him his task: the destruction of Rogue Squadron. Loor was a Corellian, as was the squadron leader, Wedge Antilles and one of the members, Corran Horn, who had crossed Loor's path before. Isard also managed to get a spy inside the squadron.

Just days after the battle at Borleias, Dlarit was able to give Isard information on Bror Jace's journey to his homeworld of Thyferra, and with precise hyperspace coordinates, the Director of Imperial Intelligence had an Interdictor cruiser named the Black Asp lie in wait.

Derricote was also having difficulty ensuring the virus was able to be transferred through the air, another of Isard's demands. She told both Derricote and Loor that, should the Rebels arrive on Coruscant before the strain was entirely completed, any and all involved in the project would have to be killed, lest they fall into Rebel hands; this served as an incentive for the two men to work harder. Isard took other measures to \"motivate\" Loor. She released information that he had killed Gil Bastra, former mentor to Rogue Corran Horn, a sworn enemy of Loor's.

Erisi Dlarit was able to give Isard full control of Horn's starfighter, and she had it flown straight into a trap. His squadron believed him dead, while Isard had him transferred to the Lusankya; Tycho Celchu, now the executive officer of Rogue Squadron, was charged with his murder, giving both Isard and Dlarit more freedom to act.

Meanwhile, Isard took up residence in the Lusankya, and began to get to work on Corran Horn. She used flight simulators against his old squadron to try and break him, though initial simulation runs turned up inconclusive, suggesting Horn would be tough to mold into a sleeper agent.

She and Vessery made preparations to travel to Bilbringi\u2014with the Lusankya on her side, and if circumstances went well, Coruscant was ripe for the taking."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the freighter Swift and a set of codes procured by her spies in the New Republic, Isard boarded the Lusankya at the shipyards in Bilbringi, and sent her crew up to the bridge to take control of the ship. She herself traveled to her personal command room, keeping contact with Captain Wintle as she went. His crew were unable to operate the ship from the bridge, as power had been transferred to the auxiliary bridge. They traveled there instead and Isard was just moments away from once again becoming a force to be reckoned with. It turned out, though, that Horn had managed to get a message out of the base, and had told his wife Mirax about the situation, as well as his friend Iella Wessiri. General Airen Cracken, head of New Republic Intelligence and an old foil of Isard, responded by giving his subordinate Iella as well as Mirax and her father Booster Terrik the mission of figuring out exactly what Isard's endgame in the current scenario was, with Booster ultimately figuring out that if her goal was to regain her former power, the logical immediate step would be to re-take control of the Lusankya, which he had figured out the New Republic has not broken up for a mountain of spare parts as had been publicly claimed, but had been repaired to be put back into service. Hurrying to the Bilbringi shipyards using Ultra-Level clearance codes provided by NRI, the trio took command of the Star Dreadnaught before Isard arrived, transferred command to the auxiliary bridge and waited. Iella Wessiri confronted Isard in her private office at blasterpoint, telling her that she had her own people on the auxiliary bridge and that her boarding party would be sealed into an area of the ship and dealt with by manipulating the ships life support systems, taking them out of the equation. Desperate, Isard used the internal communication system to offer each of them twenty-five million Imperial credits to turn the ship over to her people, an annoyed 'Acting Captain' Booster Terrik responded to the offer by asking Iella to just shoot Isard and be done with it. Isard knew the New Republic would never try her in a court, as she knew many secrets about the government hierarchy, and goaded Wessiri, telling the woman to be done with it and kill her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wessiri however had little interest in killing Isard in cold blood nor humoring her attempts at manipulation. Instead she threatened to simply imprison her on her own Super Star Destroyer, locked away in some part of the ship serviced and manned only by droids; an anonymous prisoner who would never again have contact with anyone she could manipulate for the rest of her natural life. Confronted with such a fate, the former Director of Imperial Intelligence panicked. She attempted to kill Wessiri with a holdout blaster. Wessiri was shot in the shoulder, and retaliated by shooting Isard in the stomach. As Isard lay dying, she realized that she had failed the Emperor, and resigned herself to her fate."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the battle at Ciutric, Ackbar was able to outmaneuver Krennel, and the warlord was killed when his flagship was destroyed. Isard's clone attempted to use the same tactic Isard had used to fool Rogue Squadron on Thyferra, pretending to flee in a remote controlled shuttle. The clone had not lived through the Bacta War, so was unaware that the ruse had already been used. Wedge Antilles figured out the clone's location, and he, Gavin Darklighter, Tycho Celchu, and Myn Donos killed the clone and destroyed the shuttle. Horn managed to free the Lusankya prisoners, and Jan Dodonna continued to serve as a military advisor to the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, people regarded Ysanne Isard as no better than the likes of the Emperor and Darth Vader, due to the sheer number of atrocities she committed. It was estimated that several million people were killed on her orders, as well as thousands who spent years aboard her Lusankya facility. She would still haunt Mara Jade in nightmares over a dozen years after their encounter. Isard's Lusankya became part of the New Republic fleet, and Wedge Antilles served as a commander on it for a time. It served for over a decade, fighting in the Battle of Phaeda, until it was destroyed during the Battle of Borleias in the Yuuzhan Vong War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ambiguous statements made by Iella Wessiri during the celebration of the release of the Lusankya prisoners alluded to the possibility that Isard survived Wessiri's shot, and was given a secret military trial and then imprisoned, as Wessiri threatened she would be, in a special section of the Lusankya crewed entirely by droids. This section served as a bio-containment facility devoted to scientific and medical research such as that which would have thwarted Isard's Krytos Virus plot, and included a containment cell designed to vent immediately to space were it ever breached\u2014potentially a perfect holding cell for Isard. These statements eventually became a widespread rumor. Although New Republic officials had strenuously and publicly denied these rumors, the same officials in private also conceded that, whether the rumors were true or not, the \"idea does offer a certain poetic justice.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isard's personality and traits were often compared to her two mismatched eyes. She could be icily cold, heartless and cruel, but was also prone to fiery, temperamental fits of anger. These traits asserted themselves at different times in her actions. Even as a field agent, Isard was ambitious, calculating, and ruthless. She ruled the Empire in power, if not in name, and had a deep desire to control things, a weakness that would help lead to her defeat in the Bacta War. Her entire Lusankya prisoner complex was devoted to the torture of prisoners and then turning them into tools to bring down the Rebellion, though many observed that while she was talented at engineering opponents' downfalls politically, when she had to wield the hammer and deal with them in a more direct fashion, she did so rather clumsily."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the time she entered Imperial Intelligence until the time she died, Isard was possessed of an unyielding lust for power. She conspired against her own father in order to usurp him as Director, and the only person she would never betray and steal power from was the Emperor, who she saw as the man who had brought order to the galaxy. Isard claimed all her actions were done for the benefit and continuing survival of the Empire, though she rarely thought about anything other than herself when making a decision. After the catastrophe at Endor, Ysanne did not show any hint of loyalty to the new rulers of the Empire, but rather, she immediately began planning on how to be rid of them. After the loss of Coruscant, Isard found another equally influential planet to rule, and even after her supposed death she found it difficult being virtually powerless. Even when she did not wield any significant power, Isard always liked to be one step ahead of her enemies; in the aftermath of the Battle of Coruscant, she took comfort knowing the New Republic were searching the galaxy top to bottom for her, while she was actually hidden right under their noses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout her life, Ysanne Isard showed an utter disregard for the lives of others, often killing hundreds to send a message to just one; Isard was ultimately responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of individuals. She had the people of Toprawa, a planet that had aided the Rebels in destroying the initial Death Star, punished for their actions through starvation. Many Toprawans died during these \"rituals,\" whereby Isard had them beg for food and praise the Emperor's memory. In removing the Lusankya from underneath Coruscant's multitude of skyscrapers, she killed thousands upon thousands of people, many of them Imperials themselves. On Thyferra, she massacred the Ashern rebels by the thousands, and would have continued slaughtering the surplus million Vratix, all so that Wedge Antilles would feel rushed to attack her. Isard often had her own people killed, even for simply performing below her expectations. Her harsh methods for punishing traitors included killing all of their families, a punishment utilized by Darth Vader before his death. She often had officers in whom she was not entirely confident perform these executions, as a way of testing their mettle. Particularly during her youth, Isard had a very short temper, and often entered a sort of bloodlust, satisfied only by the mass killing of her enemies. When in a rage, Isard would happily execute even her best officers for even attempting to disagree or argue with her. Additionally, any whiff of insubordination she sensed was duly punished, often by death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isard had considerable pride, and hated to be made look bad in front of her superiors, allies, rivals, or enemies. After her failure on Darkknell, Isard was not able to return to Coruscant and face the music, so she instead fabricated evidence linking her father with the Rebel Alliance, and accused him of sending her on a suicide mission. During the Bacta War, when Isard required as many usable vessels as she could get, it pained her to have to go after people like Teradoc and plead with him for the service of one of her ships. The whole war with Antilles and his people taxed Isard severely, as she envisioned the rest of the galaxy laughing at her and mocking her for being unable to stand up to a company that numbered no more than thirty individuals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout her careers, rumors of a relationship between Isard and Emperor Palpatine continually resurfaced, although, like much of her personal life, actual proof could not be found by New Republic intelligence agents. When queried about her relationship with Palpatine by Corran Horn, she did not deny it, and told him that she found his power and wealth difficult to resist. Isard was under the assumption that Palpatine loved her in return, though the Emperor always had fears of her trying to overthrow him. Horn noted many similarities between Isard and Palpatine, namely, their lust for power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isard was a master of the arts of interrogation and torture, using a variety of methods to get the information she craved. During the interrogation of Vune Willic, she used a YI-5 Surveillance/Interrogation Droid to great effect. The droids were equipped with a variety of torture and interrogation equipment, though Isard always oversaw proceedings herself, she preferred to torture the prisoners personally, forcing any information out of them. Usually, she was able to get a full and clean confession out of subjects within the day; this allowed Imperial Intelligence to use an individual as a public scapegoat for something, while the real conspirators were dealt with behind closed doors. Isard was also known to use several truth serums in her questionings. When she was not looking for specific information or a confession, but when she was looking for information in general from a prisoner, Isard was able to force from most subjects all sorts of personal and private information and memories. She would use this information against the prisoner, goading and taunting them over past mistakes or horrific memories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In her Lusankya facility, Isard subjected prisoners to all sorts of mental trauma, pitting them against allies and loved ones in simulators; she also found a way to keep the prisoners in line, punishing all of a particular group if one stepped out of line. Jan Dodonna, Ysanne's prize prisoner, was dissuaded from ever escaping by the Director of Imperial Intelligence, who told him that should he flee, she would severely punish the Rebels aboard the Lusankya. She also used illegal objects such as choke-collars to control allies whose loyalty she was unsure of."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As well as interrogation, Isard was skilled in a multitude of ground and intelligence skills; she was an adept slicer, blaster combatant, and unarmed combatant. During her escapades on Darkknell, she managed to hack into a planetary government system, and redirect an entire police unit so that they would not get in her way. Isard's talents at a computer terminal were not as great as they might have been, though, and she often had to rely on the talents of her subordinates to accomplish a task relating to slicing. Isard kept herself in peak physical condition at all times, even after she was no longer an active field operative. To ease her anger or frustration at any given time, she went through blaster simulators, worked out in holo-gyms, or practiced unarmed combat with a practice droid. It was a testament to her abilities that she hardly ever missed in the simulator runs. Isard was also a talented linguist, speaking Basic, Huttese, Durese, Mon Calamarian, Geonosian, Rybese, and Twi'leki."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isard was adept at making her subordinates do what she wished. During the Emperor's time, offers of promotions were usually enough to buy one's cooperation, though after Endor, Isard often had to resort to offering people a position in her Empire, sometimes even as Emperor. She was not above using her good looks to seduce people, though this was usually driven by her own agenda. Isard also used personal grudges or life-long hatred between individuals as another means of motivation, hoping it would give her people more focus. Ysanne frequently had people perform extremely unsavory tasks, such as killing a family member, executing families of traitors, or razing undefended planets which had opposed her rule, as a means of testing their loyalty and dedication to the Imperial cause."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ysanne Isard was created by Star Wars author Michael A. Stackpole for the X-Wing novels in 1996, first appearing in X-Wing: Rogue Squadron. As the series progressed, Isard became a more major character, although none of the books featured scenes written from her point of view except for her final scene in Stackpole's last X-Wing novel, Isard's Revenge in 1999. After Isard seemingly died in X-Wing: The Bacta War, she began to appear in Stackpole's Rogue Squadron comics, set several years before the novels. In the comic series, Isard plays a more prominent role, and her thoughts are shown to readers, whereas in the books they remained largely hidden. In the final story arc of the series, it is revealed that Isard had a clone; this clone, as well as the real, surviving Isard, appeared in Isard's Revenge. In 1999 Isard appeared in a collaborative short story written by Stackpole and Timothy Zahn; since then, her only appearance was a cameo in Paul Ens's webstrip, Evasive Action: Prey. Thus, virtually all of Isard's appearances have been in works by Michael A. Stackpole.
