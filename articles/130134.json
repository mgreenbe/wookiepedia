It served as a makeshift prison for those that King Elbo had sought to punish. The guard had eight legs, which acted as prison bars when draped over a prisoner. When King Elbo kidnapped the Ewok Latara, he placed her under the care of this prison guard. However, it was unable to prevent Latara's friend, Wicket W. Warrick, Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, and Teebo from rescuing her. When the squid reached out its tendrils to try to capture one of the interfering Ewoks, it left the way open for Latara to escape, and Teebo was able to drag his friend to safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
