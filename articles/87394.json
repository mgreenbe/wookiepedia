It was colored white with red markings at the time of the Battle of Endor during the Galactic Civil War\u2014a conflict between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire\u2014and was outfitted by Rebel fleet technicians with advanced scanners designed to continuously disrupt target-acquisition signals, making it impossible for missile guidance systems to lock onto the ship. The corvette was valuable as an escort for larger capital ships, as it was equipped with a hangar for small craft such as starfighters, and turbolasers for defensive cover fire. Its modifications were made at the expense of hull strength, however, making it slightly more vulnerable to damage than other contemporary CR90 corvettes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Masanya was acquired by the Rebel Alliance and incorporated into its fleet early in the Galactic Civil War.
