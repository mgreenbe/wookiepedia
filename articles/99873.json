It consisted of several strata that were inhabited by different waves of settlers who settled on Chandrila, which made the building difficult to navigate through. The Old Gather-House was situated near the Senate Plaza and the Eleutherian Plaza, the latter of which housed the Chandrila Senate house that was host to the Galactic Senate of the New Republic. During the Liberation Day celebrations of 5 ABY, the Imperial emissary Grand Admiral Rae Sloane watched the proceedings from a balcony on the building. During the subsequent attack on Chandrila, the building was engulfed by civilians who were attempting to flee the fighting nearby. Sloane fought with the New Republic pilot Norra Wexley during her escape from the building."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
