He was present in the gang's base during the arrival of Lando Calrissian, under the guise of \"Captain Barpotomous Drebble\". The pirate backed up his bosses, Lemo and Sanda as they confronted \"Drebble\" and his Wookiee companion, Chewbacca. After Calrissian was able to kill Koruu using a knife, the gang invited the \"Captain\" to dinner. The skull-faced pirate came with the gang to the restaurant where they discovered \"Drebble's\" true identity. The gang pulled their blasters on Calrissian, but he was able to escape with help from Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
