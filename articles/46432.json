Available for 8000 during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the droids were designed for the sole purpose of putting out fires, carrying a large tank of flame retardant chemicals to allow them to complete that task. Normally mounted on tracked chassis or using repulsorlifts, they were particularly useful aboard starships, where fire would quickly burn up valuable oxygen. Able to respond quickly and operate in conditions an organic being never could, the droids were used on vessels from the size of a light freighters up to that of a Star Destroyer and larger. The number of FD-series droids needed to adequately protect a ship depended on its size with only one for the smallest vessels they were used on, but hundreds for capital ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The FD-series extinguisher droid was first mentioned in Suns of Fortune, a sourcebook released in 2014 for Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
