The weapon was the centerpiece of a trap with which Revan hoped to bring about a conclusive end to the Mandalorian Wars. Overseeing the device's use was Jedi General Meetra Surik who would later come to be known as The Exile. Revan lured the Mandalorians to Malachor V, and a massive fleet battle ensued in orbit. During the fighting, Surik commanded Bao-Dur to activate the secret weapon with a single, silent nod. Moments later, a significant portion of both fleets were suddenly drawn from orbit into a vast gravity vortex that was powerful enough to crush the countless ships into the planet's crust and fracture Malachor V to its very core."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the event, Malachor V was turned into a broken cluster of planetoids that were only tenuously fused together by the gravitational anomalies present in the system. Orbiting the broken remains of the planet was the wreckage of countless Mandalorian and Republic warships. All that remained on the surface of the planet was a desolate graveyard echoing with the deaths of thousands of Jedi, Republic soldiers, and Mandalorians. It was littered with destroyed vessels and the only surviving inhabitants were vicious storm beasts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3951 BBY, the Mass Shadow Generator was used a second and final time. During her campaign against the Sith Triumvirate during the First Jedi Purge, Surik traveled to Malachor V in pursuit of the Sith Lord Darth Traya. At the Trayus Academy, she fought the Sith forces occupying the planet and defeated both Darth Sion and Darth Traya in combat. Soon after, the Mass Shadow Generator was activated by Bao-Dur's remote and the sudden release of the gravity field destroyed what was left of the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Capabilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mass Shadow Generator drew upon the natural mass shadows generated by planetary bodies. At Malachor V, the gravitation anomalies at work within the Malachor system allowed it to unleash catastrophic devastation upon anything within close proximity of the planet. The superweapon was designed to take advantage of the unique gravitational fields present at Malachor V, but it would later be speculated that the weapon could be modified to function within any star system. The Mass Shadow Generator was capable of gravely damaging or destroying any ships or space stations in orbit above the target world, but it also annihilated virtually everything upon the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though a non-canon outcome, G0-T0 destroys the remote and the Mass Shadow Generator is not activated a second time, if the player is devoted to the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Timeline 9: The Mandalorian Wars states that Revan, not Surik, was the one to activate the Generator, this is not necessarily a retcon, as the Timeline series is presented in-universe as history as the Jedi choose to describe it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
