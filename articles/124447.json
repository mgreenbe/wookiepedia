As early as by the Mandalorian Wars, physical shields had been replaced by energetic devices. Some less-developed cultures, however, retained those archaic means of defense. Such civiliations included the Serp, a reptilian species from the planet of Serphidi, who still used kite-shaped shields for their jousting contests. A certain type of shields made from cortosis ore also remained in use concurrently with modern technology due to its property of blocking lightsaber attacks. The beastwarden's shield was a type of shield made of bronze with a serrated edge that was used for defense and as a thrown weapon by Geonosian Petranaki gladiators on the planet Geonosis. Before their extermination by the Mandalorian Crusaders, the Tl\u00f6nians crafted a particular type of shield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
