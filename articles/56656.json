During this time, the planet's Kurdan Desert experienced rainfall, prompting all Kitonaks to migrate to the desert to engage in the celebration to participate in their mating ritual, the Dance of Love. Females of the species were fertilized with young during the ritual, which began a ten year gestation period; Kitonak females would then give birth during the next Great Celebration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
