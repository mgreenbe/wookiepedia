Accompanying his master for years, Half-Moonsing was recommended for the Jedi Trials and returned to Coruscant to undergo the tests. Despite his training however, Half-Moonsing failed the Trials and was not permitted to continue along the Jedi Path. However, Half-Moonsing decided to stay at the Temple, taking up a post in the docking complex, specifically the speeder pool. As of about 115 BBY, Half-Moonsing had become the caretaker of the speeder pool, overseeing all of the Temple's speeder craft and ensuring they were checked out properly. Half-Moonsing was noted for his deep insight and being a helpful part of the Temple staff, remaining in his post until he passed away sometime between 72 and 44 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While it did not make it into the finished edition, Dan Wallace, author of The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, revealed that he believed Half-Moonsing to be a Weequay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
