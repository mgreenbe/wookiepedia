A group led by Lieutenant Varias, including Officers Savas, Hirka, Kener, Mener and several CorSec troopers, was dispatched from Coronet to investigate. The unit discovered an old and fully automated droid factory, presumably built in secret by the Separatists during the Clone Wars. The CorSec ignored that the factory had been reactivated by IG-88 for his project of Droid Revolution. The droid factory was defended by many battle droids but the Corellian government was reluctant to send reinforcement since it would like to avoid drawing the attention of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lieutenant Varias assigned missions to all his officers with the objective to disable the droid factory. Agent Savas was tasked to recruit independent spacers to assist the CorSec in the factory, Sergeant Hirka was ordered to recon the factory, technical officer Kener had to find a way to shut down the facility, and Sergeant Mener was tasked to take the fight to the droids. When Sergeant Hirka and her squad went missing, Lieutenant Varias dispatched a spacer to rescue her. The spacer then worked with Officer Kener to create a security breach in the factory's control system. Eventually, Varias tasked the spacer to access the control override terminal in the depths of the facility. The spacer finally reached the terminal in the command center and effectively shut down the factory. According to Lieutenant Varias, the intervention of the spacers permitted to contain the crisis and avoid a disaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Varias later asked a spacer to assist an associate, Wernell Covington, on the moon Rori."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lieutenant Varias was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
