She was severely under-funded by the time of the Galactic Civil War. Because of this, the vermin outside the city walls became a major health hazard. Circa 1 ABY, she managed to get an individual to deal with the problem. While affiliated with Jabba the Hutt's criminal organizarion, the spacer acted on behalf of the Mayor Mikdanyell Guh'rantt.
