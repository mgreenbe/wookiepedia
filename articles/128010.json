Covered in oily feathers to keep the snow from penetrating to their skin, snowfeathers made nests high within the ice shelves of the frozen planet Ilum. Free of natural predators, largely due to their slightly poisonous meat which was known to cause cramps and uncontrollable bowel movements, the snowfeather was also connected to the Force. Capable of projecting illusions, snowfeathers would make themselves appear larger and more fierce then they actually were to deter attack by other beasts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
