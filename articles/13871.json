During said battle, the Confederacy of Independent Systems used Dantooine as a staging point to launch an attack against the assault ship blockade around the InterGalactic Banking Clan headquarters. However, Jedi Master Mace Windu learned of the Confederate presence on Dantooine, and left with a force of clone troopers to halt the progress of the Separatists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Count Dooku was also hoping to uncover Rakatan artifacts on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle erupted on Dantooine as clones and B2 super battle droids clashed in a vast, open plain. Clones used PLX-1 portable missile launcher to destroy scores of droids, whereas the droids used their own missile launchers to shoot down many gunships and overwhelming numbers to cause many casualties in the clone ranks. However, with Master Windu at their side, the clones slowly gained the upper hand, despite being outnumbered nearly four to one by Confederate super battle droids. However, the battle was suddenly turned upside down with the arrival of a large siege weapon\u2014the seismic tank."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This tank used its seismic driver\u2014used for mining operations in peaceful days\u2014to cut a swath through the clone trooper ranks, either crushing them outright or sending soldiers flying from the shockwave, along with taking out a contingent of their own forces. In the confusion, Windu lost his lightsaber, and was forced to fight a number of droids unarmed. The ability with the Force that he showed in that battle has since become legendary: During the fight, he eluded and obliterated droids by multiple Force moves as the Force push, Force speed, Force punch and Force Wave, a technique so powerful it incapacitated droids within a 50-meter radius, and at one point, Windu disassembled a super battle droid and used its pieces to destroy the other remaining droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Retrieving his lightsaber amid another seismic shockwave, Windu flew towards the seismic tank. Windu cut his way in, disabled the seismic driver, destroyed the tank's droid crew by pushing the crew out the window, and knocked out the controls. Flying clear, Windu watched on as the seismic tank smashed into the ground and exploded. After he landed, a small boy gave him a bottle of water. The battle was won."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Attack on the failed Jedi students"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A taskforce of droids was dispatched during the battle to attack a farm that was run by failed Jedi students.

Afterward, they fled the planet in their airship and decided to fly it to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later assault"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Windu's remaining troops required medical supplies, leading Jedi Padawans Barriss Offee and Ahsoka Tano to take a medical frigate to collect the supplies from a medical station near Ord Cestus.
