It could be used by either striking the enemy at close range, or by throwing it like a javelin.

Because of Gungan's familiarity with the tool, the mounted kaadu riders of the Gungan militia used the weapon in battle, such as during the Battle of Naboo against the Droid Army of the Trade Federation. Its light weight allowed for it to be thrown, and because the electronic components were watertight, they could be used underwater as well as on the land."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
