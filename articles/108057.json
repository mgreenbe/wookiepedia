It aimed to capture Alliance smugglers in order to disrupt Rebel supply lines. Their operation on Tatooine made use of a spy within the Alliance who fed them information on the whereabouts of top smugglers. Using this information, they almost captured Jaxa Lian, but were foiled by a spacer instructed by local Rebel agent Hantor Loftus. Their spy, Lidek Baws was later killed along with a number of their agents in retaliation by the Rebels.
