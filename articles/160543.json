Verzan was located on the outer fringes of the Cerberon system of the Deep Core, orbiting the black hole known as the Cerberon singularity. As a result of the Cerberon singularity's gravitational force, Verzan's orbit meant that it would fall into the black hole thousands of years after the time of the Imperial Era."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Empire controlled the Cerberon system during its reign, with Verzan serving as an Imperial garrison world. In around 5 ABY, following the Imperial defeat at the Battle of Endor, the New Republic launched a campaign to capture the Cerberon system, undertaken by the battle group of General Hera Syndulla. Verzan was the first world to be struck, with the planet falling under fire from the Acclamator-class battleship Lodestar and the proton bombs of Alphabet Squadron. Much of Verzan's surface was obliterated in the bombardment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the destruction of the Imperial presence on Verzan, the entrepreneurial pirate Edineezious Winker rapidly constructed an establishment known as Winker's in the garrison-world's ruins. The New Republic pilot Chass na Chadic, a member of Alphabet Squadron, visited Winker's in order to drink, wishing not to think of the time after her squadron's ongoing mission was over. While there, Chadic gambled with two other patrons, a Kel Dor and a Vurk. Having been stranded on Verzan for some time, the two attempted to scam Chadic of her B-wing starfighter, but Chadic was sober enough to not fall for the trick. The Vurk threw Chadic into the crowd when the pilot attempted to defend herself, but she was rescued by Gruyver, a member of the Children of the Empty Sun cult. After Chadic discovered that her rescuer was a cult member, she punched him in the throat and departed Verzan in her starfighter. The New Republic eventually succeeded in capturing the other worlds of Cerberon, securing the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Galactic Empire occupied the Cerberon system, Verzan served as a garrison world.
