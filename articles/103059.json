He stored the ship in the Crypt, his secret personal hangar on Coruscant. After being infected by the necrotic virus Aorth-6, Palpatine was temporarily taken to the Crypt and secured aboard the ship to recover. The infiltrator was equipped with a stasis chamber and a 2-1B surgical droid, both of which were used to prolong the Emperor's life. However, Trachta was later forced to destroy the latter after Gentis sent in a signal that reprogrammed all droids to target Imperial officers loyal to Palpatine. The Sith Infiltrator was later used to transport Palpatine to the Prism."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
