It was maintained by Qulo Ecls, who owned the venue during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The store was very cluttered, and mostly stocked with items that were needed on Gelgelar such as breath masks, water-proof cloaks and hunting equipment. The clerks at the store love to bargain and the prices were marked up so the negotiations would make the customers think they were getting a bargain. The building was two stories, with the upper level used as a domicile for the Ecls family. Qulo's office was in the back of the lower level, near the landing platforms, so he could get first crack at buying incoming cargos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
