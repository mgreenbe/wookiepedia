When Princess Leia Organa made a visit to Delaya to assist the refugee effort and recruit new members to the Rebel Alliance, Mazi and his group attempted to rob Organa. Han Solo tried to placate the orphans but the standoff was broken when Olin intervened and disarmed Mazi, who was holding Organa at knife-point with a vibroblade.
