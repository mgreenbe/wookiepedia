Cato Neimoidia (often spelled Niemoidia at this stage) was very different in its early incarnations. It was a gas giant surrounded by an artificial ring space station, which was meant to echo the donut-ship design of the Neimoidian Trade Federation battleships and was eventually reused for the planet Ringo Vinda. Always envisioned as an affluent world, its interiors were marked by golden structures and gaudy riches in early paintings. At the same time, the Art Department was developing \"bridge world,\" a planet then named Saleucami. This planet of curving arc-like structures with city skylines suspended on the bottom edge of the bridges was to be home of the Techno Union."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both designs were dropped from the film in the finished shooting script, though Cato Neimoidia was mentioned twice as a place where Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Commander CC-2224 had some rocky history.
