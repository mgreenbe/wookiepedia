Terak and his Marauders used to raid the native Ewoks, searching the planet for the \"power of the stars,\" an elusive entity that would allow them to leave Endor for good. Arriving at Bright Tree village, Terak and his goons found the stranded starcruiser of the Towani, a family of marooned Humans who sought shelter from the Ewoks. The king mistook the starcruiser for the source of the \"power\", and he killed its crew to obtain it. Meanwhile, the two-meter tall Marauders were taking prisoners and setting the huts on fire. At the end of the skirmish, multiple Ewoks had been deprived of their liberty, others had been killed, and three of the four Towani had fallen under the Marauders' blows. The family's youngest member, Cindel Towani, had just returned from a long walk in the woods when the raid began. Having witnessed the death of her whole family, the girl was caught by the Marauders and put in wagon en route to Terak's Keep. With the help of the Ewok warrior Wicket W. Warrick, Cindel Towani managed to get free of the vehicle inconspicuously."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
