As a newly-trained soldier, he was stationed in a Republic outpost on the Rishi Moon at the time of a Separatist attack on the installation. As one of only two survivors, Fives was recruited into the 501st Legion.

Later in the war, Fives served with the 501st during the Battle of Umbara. During the campaign, he played a key role in both the capture of the Umbaran airbase and the destruction of the Separatist supply ship. However, the clones ultimately discovered that their general, the Besalisk Jedi Master Pong Krell, had betrayed the Republic, deceiving his own clone troopers into fighting each other. As a result, Fives participated in their efforts to capture the fallen Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While attempting to take Ringo Vinda from the Separatists, Fives witnessed the death of Tiplar, a Jedi General executed mid-battle by CT-5385 \"Tup.\" A chain of events was set in motion by the preemptive execution of Clone Protocol 66, leading Fives to discover a conspiracy involving inhibitor chips, a plot to destroy the Jedi Order, and\u2014to an extent\u2014Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine's connection to it. After being accused by Palpatine as a failed assassin, Fives sought to warn Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" but was confronted by Clone Commander CC-1010 \"Fox\" and a contingent of Coruscant Guard shock troopers.

CT-6116 \"Kix\" conducted his own investigation which led him to discover Palpatine's conspiracy and forced Dooku to abduct and freeze him within cryo-cycle stasis to prevent the information from being leaked, thus removing him from any further involvement within The Clone Wars and Order 66. When members of the 501st executed Order 66 against Ahsoka Tano, she used Fives' knowledge of the conspiracy to save Rex and remove his inhibitor chip.

The other clones in Domino Squad called Fives by his number, CT-27-5555, although Fives preferred to be called by his nickname. Domino Squad was reckless, and they rarely got along as a team. Their training was overseen by bounty hunters Bric and El-Les, and Jedi Master Shaak Ti. The cadets were given a test and to pass it, all cadets must successfully work as a team without any injuries.

During the test, Fives, along with his squadmates, noticed that they did not have their ascension cables due to tampering in their equipment by a still skeptical Bric. The clones decided to assist one another in free-climbing the turrets along the sides of the Citadel to complete their task. It proved a success and Domino Squad celebrated their victory, finally coming to know one another as brothers and a team.

Following the initial assault from Separatist commando droids, Fives, Echo, Cutup, and Hevy managed to escape the base through the ventilation shaft and emerged onto the moon's surface. Unfortunately, they were encountered by a Rishi eel, which killed Cutup.

In the midst of the chaos, the three clones happened upon a team of lost cadets and escorted them to safety. As General Grievous and Ventress advanced further into the heart of Kamino in the search of genetic samples of the Republic's clone army, the group was found by Captain Rex and Commander Cody at the cadet barracks. After 99 helped them gather weapons from a nearby armory, the group staged a trap for the incoming droids. Together, the troopers, the cadets, and 99 were able to defeat a squad of Grievous's battle droids. However, the battle ended in grief; 99 died trying to retrieve grenades and ammo for his brothers.

They were able to climb the cliff to get inside the Citadel, but clone trooper Charger lost his balance and fell, dying and alerting the Separatists and Warden Osi Sobeck of their presence. Nonetheless, the force made their way through the facility and freed Piell, Captain Wilhuff Tarkin, and multiple captive clone officers.

During a fierce firefight, Fives and Echo tried to reach the shuttle. Echo made it to the ramp but at the same time the ship was hit and exploded. Fives and both teams had no time to search for their comrade and were forced to flee the airfield, thus Echo was presumed killed in action..

The team finally reached the rendezvous point to await Master Koon's extraction team.

Following the establishment of a forward position, Anakin Skywalker was called off-planet. In his place, the venerated Jedi General Pong Krell was assigned as the temporary leader of the 501st. Fives quickly drew issue with Krell's firm and seemingly reckless style of leadership, which often led to the unnecessary endangerment and death of fellow clones. Fives joined Rex in voicing his direct concern with the Besalisk's leadership style, only to be met with a drawn lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a failed attempt at reaching the Umbaran capital city, Fives and the rest of the 501st then held their ground against increasing enemy resistance. Efforts were refocused when Krell received orders to target a critical airbase. Krell ordered a full-frontal assault through a valley. Again, Krell's leadership style led to the death of dozens of soldiers, further enraging Fives. Despite Rex's insistence that he keep a level head for the sake of the rest of the troops, Fives advocated for a plan of action separate from Krell's. As more troops perished in action against advanced Umbaran military technology, Rex sent Fives and Hardcase, against Krell's wishes, to capture enemy aircraft and assist in the battle. Despite a lack of familiarity with the technology, the plan proved to be a success. Fives and Hardcase were able to enter the base undetected, commandeer two enemy starfighters, and secure a victory. While Krell expressed his frustration with the insubordination, he begrudgingly accepted the victory it afforded him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the base captured, Fives continued to voice his frustration with Krell to Rex.

He said that he felt that his actions were justified, and that clones, as people, shouldn't follow orders when they know the orders are wrong.

After a brief encounter with a confused Dogma, the clones out out to catch the former Jedi. What followed was a desperate and deadly attempt at capture during which dozens of clones died.

Later, Fives, along with the rest of the 501st, took part in a military campaign to defeat Separatist forces led by Admiral Trench occupying space station surrounding the world of Ringo Vinda. In the process of battle, a fellow clone and close friend of Fives, Tup, fired upon and killed Jedi General Tiplar. In the chaos, the 501st were forced to retreat. While Tup appeared to be unaware of his actions, he continued to display strange behavior and lash out violently towards Jedi. Both Jedi and clone leadership determined that Tup should be sent to Kamino for further evaluation. However, in the process, Tup was temporarily captured by Separatist forces on his departure from the station.

Fives agreed, primarily to keep an eye on the treatment of his friend. He quickly grew suspicious of the care afforded to Tup, and began to suspect the Kaminoans of possessing an ulterior motive. With the assistance of medical droid AZ1-3, who created a diversion, Fives performed a dangerous level 5 brain scan on Tup. Fearing for Tup's immediate safety, Fives and AZ1-3 removed the tumor from his brain. While the operation appeared to be a success, Shaak Ti and Nala Se discovered his insubordination and reprimanded him for his risky behavior.

In a moment of desperation, Fives lashed out against Kaminoan security and fled into the depths of the facility with his droid friend in tow. Now convinced that there was more to his friend's death than previously appeared, he stole the tumor to conduct further tests of his own. Together with AZ-3, Fives was able to determine that the tumor itself was in fact an artificially designed organic chip inserted into Tup's head. Further investigation revealed that the chip itself was installed during the earliest stages of clone embryo development. Fearing for his own safety, Fives ordered AZI-3 to remove the chip from his own brain. Comparing Fives' and Tup's chips, AZI-3 and Fives discovered that Fives's chip appeared to be healthy and functioning properly while Tup's suffered from some form of decay. Shortly after discovering this, he was discovered by Nala Se and the rest of the Kaminoan security forces. While Nala Se insisted that the chip was designed to curb aggression among clones, Fives argued that the chip itself was reason for suspicion.

Despite Nala Se's insistence that Fives was suffering from paranoia and mental degradation, Palpatine requested to speak to the soldier alone to hear his story in further detail. After Shaak Ti and Nala Se had left, the Chancellor revealed the true purpose of the biochips to Fives as well as his involvement in the plot. He then attacked Fives, who in a moment of self defense was framed as a potential assassin. Now a fugitive from justice, Fives fled into the bowels of Coruscant, looking for potential allies and anyone who might hear him out. Eventually, he arrived at the clone bar, 79's.
