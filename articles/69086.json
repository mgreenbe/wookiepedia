A Human from Concord Dawn, Fett was adopted by Mandalorian warriors following the murder of his parents and the disappearance of his older sister Arla in 58 BBY. Years later, he would go on to lead them through much of the Mandalorian Civil War as Mandalore. After being imprisoned by Jedi, Fett was responsible for destroying the Death Watch, a Mandalorian group who killed Fett's mentor and surrogate father, Jaster Mereel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the conclusion of that conflict, Fett became a bounty hunter, quickly establishing a reputation as being one of the best in the galaxy.

When Master Obi-Wan Kenobi located Jango and Boba on Kamino, Fett fled to join Count Dooku.

Fett's father served as a Journeyman Protector, a civilian lawman on Concord Dawn, having taken over the role when the former Protector, Jaster Mereel, was exiled and joined the Mandalorians.

When the war spilled on to Fett's homeworld, his father granted Jaster Mereel and his men refuge at their homestead. Curious about footprints he found in the field, Fett questioned his father who merely remarked that there were beggars he was feeding and told Fett to get back to his chores. The Death Watch caught up with the True Mandalorians at the homestead and Tor Vizsla captured Fett while he was fixing the family's harvester, using him in an attempt to root Mereel and his men out of hiding. Vizsla savagely beat Fett's father in front of the boy while he demanded the location of the hidden Mandalorians, even going so far as threatening to shoot him in the head right in front of his son. However, Fett's mother intervened, shooting one of the Death Watch in the face with a blaster rifle and in the ensuing chaos, Fett's father ordered his son to run. Fleeing into the nearby crop field, Fett was rescued by Mereel and his soldiers while his parents were murdered and his sister taken by the Death Watch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Death Watch set fire to the fields, Fett led the True Mandalorians to an irrigation tube that allowed them to escape the blaze.They took Fett with them as they fled the homestead, the Death Watch burning the crop fields they took cover in. With his family dead and his home in ruins, Fett joined the Mandalorians as they regrouped in a nearby town in order to stage an ambush on the Death Watch. Believing their enemies dead, Vizsla and his men moved into the town on a celebratory raid, only to come under fire from the Mandalorians, attacking from street alleys and high windows. Using the firefight as a distraction, Fett planted an explosive charge beneath the Death Watch's armored tank, destroying it. He was attacked moments later by the Death Watch soldier responsible for the deaths of his parents and although the rogue Mandalorian slashed him with his gauntlet's vibroblade, Fett was able to snatch up a blaster, shooting and killing his parents' murderer. Having proven himself in Mereel's eyes, after the fighting was over Fett was taken in by the Mand'alor, who raised the boy as he would be his own son.

His first time as a squad commander, the mission promised to be little more than a basic extraction operation. Employed by the Korda Defense Force, the Mandalorians were to recover a team of rookie security personnel pinned down under fire by a group of local hostiles, supposedly poorly armed and with no formal army. Placed in charge of the group humorously referred to as \"Jango's Grunts\", Fett and his team were in charge of providing cover fire and ensuring that the extraction point remained clear of danger. However, the intelligence reports turned out to be inaccurate and the claims of \"minimal resistance\" turned out to be a much heavier force. When Mereel's second-in-command, Montross, refused to retreat and was injured in a grenade strike, it was up to Mereel to save him. At the same time, Fett used Montross' ill-guided attack as a diversion to move on their original objective. But when he reached the site, the expected team of security personnel in need turned out to be a Death Watch ambush. While Fett fought back the Death Watch soldiers, Mereel and Montross came under attack by Vizsla himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was then that Montross, through with taking Mereel's orders, abandoned the seriously injured Mand'alor and left him to die by Vizsla's hand. Though Fett rushed to the aid of the man who'd raised him like a father, he was too late to save him as Vizsla unleashed his tank's cannons on the injured soldier. It was in Fett's arms that Mereel passed away. At the landing zone, Montross urged the Mandalorians to heed Mereel's final orders and pull out, claiming that both Mereel and Fett were dead. However, Fett not only returned to the landing zone at that very moment, but carried with him Jaster Mereel's body. Still Montross continued in his attempts to seize control, implying that Mereel would have wanted him to take over as the new Mand'alor and that the Mandalorians would do best with him in command. But when Fett revealed the truth of Montross' betrayal\u2014that he'd left their beloved leader to die alone on the battlefield\u2014the other Mandalorians denounced Montross at blaster point and proclaimed that they would follow only Fett.

Twenty-two years before the Battle of Geonosis, Fett and his Mandalorians were hired to put down an insurrection on the planet Galidraan. When the fighting was over and the rebels defeated, Fett ordered his men to return to their camp while he met with Galidraan's governor to collect their payment. In addition to their pay, Fett demanded the whereabouts of Tor Vizsla whom the Governor of Galidraan was not only harboring, but funding in his attempts to rebuild the Death Watch. Vizsla revealed himself there in the governor's castle and attacked Fett with a small cadre of Death Watch soldiers, forcing Fett to flee the building through a large window. Unfortunately, Vizsla and the governor had already put a plot into motion, claiming that Mandalorians were murdering \"political activists\", along with women and children\u2014with Vizsla's own forces providing the body count of innocents\u2014and begging the Jedi Council to step in and put a stop to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Jedi ships began to land, Fett desperately tried to warn his second-in-command, Myles, and the other Mandalorians to evacuate the camp, but his helmet's comlink had been damaged in his escape from Vizsla and they only received Fett's warning when he arrived seconds before the Jedi team. Led by Jedi Master Dooku and his Padawan Komari Vosa, the Jedi took the governor at his word and demanded the Mandalorians surrender on suspected murder charges, with Vosa adding that should they resist, they'd be killed. Innocent and indignant, Fett ordered his troops to open fire, specifically on Vosa whom he called a \"loudmouth\". When their blasters were reflected by the Jedi's lightsabers, Fett ordered the use of projectiles and provision of cover via jetpacks. Even utilizing a jetpack, however, Myles was killed by one of the Jedi while Fett could only watch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was then that Fett would carry out the act that would make him both famous and infamous for the rest of his life and career: using no weapon beyond his own hands, feet, and armored body, Fett vengefully killed six Jedi, including the one responsible for Myles' death. His efforts, although impressive, couldn't change the outcome of the battle. Fett's True Mandalorians had fallen victim to the Death Watch's machinations and were wiped out; Fett, the sole Mandalorian survivor of the battle, was subdued by the Jedi and delivered into the custody of the Governor of Galidraan. Stripped of his armor, he was sold into slavery.

Though his slave masters promised him freedom if he helped them fend off the attack, Fett had already broken free of his restraints and with a stolen blaster pistol, killed the slaver before fighting his way off the ship. Once free of the spice freighter, he set his sights on Galidraan, going after his lost armor and his revenge upon the governor. Slipping by all of the governor's security, Fett infiltrated his castle, recovered his armor\u2014restored and repainted by the governor as a trophy\u2014and offered the governor a choice: his life or the location of the Death Watch.\nIntercepting the Death Rattle, Vizsla's personal starship, over Corellia, Fett used a starfighter to cripple the ship's engines while assaulting the bridge, using his jetpack to fly through the viewport. He clashed with Vizsla in a lengthy fight that spanned the halls of the dying ship and even into an escape pod, continuing on after crashing to the surface of Corellia. After tumbling into a river, Vizsla stabbed Fett between the armor plates on his torso with a poisoned blade, taunting him that Jaster Mereel would be disappointed. In response, Fett used the blade on his gauntlet to carve a deep wound across Vizsla's abdomen, drawing a pack of nearby dire-cats that attacked and killed Vizsla but spared Fett due to the poison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 41 BBY, Fett somehow lost his armor in the Meridian sector.

Without a war to fight or his trusted comrades to fight beside, Fett grew distant from the rest of his people and his role as Mand'alor and instead, using his combat skills, weaponry, and mercenary experience, turned to the solitary life of a bounty hunter. He took up residence at Outland Transit Station, a space station in Hutt Space, where, with the help of a Toydarian female associate named Rozatta, he continued his career as a bounty hunter and soldier-for-hire utilizing Jaster Mereel's former ship, now bearing the name Jaster's Legacy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The hunt for Komari Vosa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 32 BBY, Fett was tracking the Muttani criminal Meeko Ghintee.

When Fett surprised Meeko and offered him the chance to be taken in alive, Meeko fled, commanding his borhek to attack Fett. After defeating the creature, Fett pursued Meeko on a lengthy chase through Outland Station's Merchant Row that ended with Fett disabling Meeko's ship and capturing the criminal. Shortly after, Fett met with friend and Outland Station's owner, Rozatta, to collect his fee. While there, \"Roz\"\u2014as she was affectionately known to the bounty hunter\u2014passed along a message she had taken for him. In it, a man calling himself Tyranus offered Fett the chance to participate in an exclusive hunt for former Jedi turned leader of the Bando Gora cult Komari Vosa, with a bounty of five million credits. However, he would not be alone, as Tyranus also extended an invitation to several other bounty hunters, including Montross. Although Roz would warn Fett of the danger and the Bando Gora's ominous reputation, she provided him with a lead on a death stick dealer with possible ties to the cult operating on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fett pursued Jervis Gloom\u2014the low-life dealer Roz had turned him on to\u2014throughout Galactic City's entertainment district, and upon locating him at his warehouse, he captured and forced Gloom to reveal who he was working for and where the death sticks he sold were coming from. This information led to a nerf processing plant in Coruscant's industrial district, owned by Groff Haugg and used as a front for shipping death sticks. Montross would prove himself a step ahead of Fett, as he'd already reached Haugg, interrogated him, and killed him by lowering him into carbonite before Fett could speak with him. Haugg had lied to the disgraced Mandalorian, however, and after a brief skirmish between the two bounty hunters, Montross headed to the Gazzari system while Fett searched Haugg's database and found a transmission from Connus Trell, the Twi'lek Senator from Ryloth. Breaking into the Senator's Coruscant apartment, Fett dangled the corrupt politician from the balcony of his suite until he confessed his criminal contact was a Dug crime lord by the name of Sebolto who was manufacturing the death sticks on Malastare. Fett's investigation was cut short by the arrival of a CSF gunship; demanding that he release Trell, Fett simply replied \"As you wish.\" before dropping the Senator to his death and engaging the police ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a battle with the gunship that ended in its destruction, Fett left Coruscant and contacted Roz aboard his ship. While contemplating the best way to gain access to the Dug crime lord, Roz suggested he make a trip to the asteroid prison Oovo IV where a smuggler by the name of Bendix Fust was serving time. Fust had a substantial bounty posted by Sebolto and, with Roz's advice, Fett decided that bringing Sebolto \"a present\", as he put it, would be a good way to gain an audience with him. Fett made for the Oovo asteroid belt with the intention of breaking the smuggler out of prison, and used Supply ship 1729 as cover to infiltrate the asteroid's shields. Fett worked his way through Desolation Alley, but just as Fett reached Fust's cell, his mission was delayed when a novice bounty hunter managed to capture Fust first. The two met at gunpoint, but decided to work together to escape the locked-down prison, inciting a riot in the process. Though her interference ultimately cost Fett his beloved ship, Jaster's Legacy, they were able to reach the prison's hangar where six prototype Firespray-class starships were located. Stealing one of the patrol craft, Fett piloted the vessel out of the hangar before destroying the hangar and the remaining ships within. En route to Malastare with Fust secured in the cargo hold, the other bounty hunter introduced herself as Zam Wesell. Fett was quick to chastise her reckless behavior, pointing out that she was the reason he'd lost his ship, although she considered the Firespray an improvement over the old AIAT/i transport. Accepting the ship as his own, Fett decided to name it Slave I."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Fett formed a partnership with Wesell and they mutually agreed to split the bounty when they delivered Fust to Sebolto. Heading to Malastare, Sebolto's homeworld, Fett managed to sneak inside the crime lord's palace with the help of Wesell. The Clawdite delivered Fust to Sebolto while Fett went in the back way, trekking his way through the dense jungle outside of Sebolto's palace. Wesell managed to get away from Sebolto and head back down the compound, where she helped Fett call a skiff to cross a chasm separating the compound from the jungle. They then went back up the compound to Sebolto's palace with the pair of them killing anyone who got in their way. When they confronted Sebolto he frantically tried to escape, but fell into the factory's chemical mixing vat, boiling him to death. Fett then fought hordes of Bando Gora as he made his way deeper into Sebolto's death stick factory and later fought Montross as well. Reaching Sebolto's transport ship, Fett discovered Huttese markings, which led Fett straight to Tatooine. Two Hutts, Jabba Desilijic Tiure and Gardulla Besadii the Elder, controlled the desert planet, and one of them had connections to the Bando Gora."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to gain an audience with Jabba, Fett fought a gang of outlaws led by Longo Two-Guns, who had a price on his head that was posted by the Hutt. When Fett came to Jabba to collect his reward, he asked the slimy crime lord about the Bando Gora. However, it turned out that Jabba actually had nothing to do with Vosa or the crime syndicate. Instead, he informed Fett that it was Gardulla, not him, that was allied with the cult. In the meantime, Wesell managed to sneak inside Gardulla's palace but was captured, leaving Fett to fight his way inside by himself. But when he got there, Fett wanted to leave her in her cell for protection, which Wesell mistook for leaving her out of a fair 50-50 share of Vosa's bounty. She called for the guards, who then knocked Fett out and stripped him of his weapons, and then brought him to Gardulla to decide his fate. The Hutt decided to simply kill Fett by feeding the famed bounty hunter to her pet Krayt dragon. As Fett was brought to its pen, he managed to kill the guards that were at his side holding him down. Retrieving his weapons, Fett fought his way through the palace. In the end, Gardulla ended up as nearly being lunch for her own beast, but not before Fett had discovered the information he was searching for\u2014Gardulla\u00b4s relation with the Bando Gora and their activities with the Tatooine\u00b4s Death Stick Trade.

While Fett had personally killed many Jedi on Galidraan, Tyranus considered his former apprentice a more challenging test. In addition to the bounty on Vosa, Tyranus offered Fett a tempting sum of money for an unusual task: Fett was to be a template for an army of clones. Fett agreed, and soon millions of clones were created in his likeness at the cloning facility on Kamino.

He would also become a military consultant and helped to create the flash training regimen used to instruct all of the young clones, including in it the traditional Mandalorian song Vode An as a useful tool to help instill within them with a sense of purpose, modifying it slightly in order to give it meaning for soldiers serving the Republic.

When several super battle droids arrived at the box, drawing Windu's attention from Fett, he took the opportunity to strike with his wrist-mounted flamethrower, unleashing a stream of flames at Windu, who leapt from the box and into the arena, throwing off his burning cloak after landing unharmed. A massive battle broke out between the Jedi and the droid army that poured into the arena, although Fett would remain at Dooku's side; when Jedi Council member Coleman Trebor attempted to assault the skybox and confront Dooku, Fett unloaded several blaster bolts into the Jedi Master, killing him and knocking him off the balcony."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fett used his jetpack to fly down to the arena floor, where he confronted Windu, who had dropped his lightsaber.

Fett killed it with a swift blast to the head, but his jetpack was damaged with the reek's attack. As Windu rushed in, Fett's attempts to blast him proved futile, leading him to attempt to gain space by jetting away.
