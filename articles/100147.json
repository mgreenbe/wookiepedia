Devised by Imperial Moff Kentor Sarne, he used it during the Battle of Kal'Shebbol to wipe records from the computers at his headquarters prior to the New Republic's liberation of the planet. As well as erasing Imperial documents and orders, Omega order five also cleared historical records, personnel files, and hundreds of years worth of navigational data regarding the Kathol sector. As a result, the New Republic had no hard data with which to track the Moff after he fled the planet, and no idea exactly who on the planet they could trust. They were also unaware of the myriad settlements and alien races that lived in the sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
