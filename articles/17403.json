Its data allowed the group to maintain its contacts and remain hidden from galactic powers while using their hidden influence to achieve their goals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was stored at the Cabal's headquarters, the Star Chamber, in the Null Zone when an Imperial Agent managed to board the base whereupon Cipher Nine managed to acquire it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Depending on the player's choices, the fate of the Black Codex can go many different ways. If given to the Minister of Intelligence, Cipher Nine can choose to erase their identity. If given to the Sith, Nine will have a place in the new Sith Intelligence. If the agent let Ardun Kothe escape at the end of chapter 2, Cipher Nine can also give the codex to him and become a double agent for the SIS. Finally, Cipher Nine may also choose to destroy the Black Codex and all its contents to prevent anyone else from using it to their advantage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
