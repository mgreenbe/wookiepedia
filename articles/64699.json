A tender-in-training, he felt the call of the Mother Jungle, the planet-spanning jungle of the Ithorian homeworld Ithor. Along with a friend, he boarded a skimmer and flew out into the jungle, on the pretense of exploring new territory. After reaching a dense part of the jungle, Iggjel left his friend and broke sacred law by exiting the vessel and setting foot on the jungle floor. Iggjel would go on to become one of the Ithorian's first priests."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
