Employed in both the time of the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire, it functioned by deflecting or scattering energy beams. However, ray shields did not allow physical objects through them completely unscathed, imparting a deadly electric shock. As such they could be used in traps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine were once caught in a ray shield trap on the Invisible Hand, set by General Grievous.
