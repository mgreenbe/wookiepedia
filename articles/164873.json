The pirate corvettes, along with Y-wings and Heavy Lifters, attempted a raid at Tinoon Station hoping to steal some containers from the station. Before they arrived, Ace Azzameen who was delivering a probe droid for his sister at the Zephry Asteroid field, arrived at Tinoon Station just before the pirates did. When they did arrive, Tinoon Station's Security launched Planetary Fighters to hold the Pirates off. Ace then intervened and destroyed both corvettes repelling the raid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
