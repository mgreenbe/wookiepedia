Feeling betrayed by his masters over a payment dispute, Glasfir engaged on a three-year campaign of revenge against every Hutt agent on Demesel. Soon, he was one of the most powerful and feared criminals on the planet, and since his former employers had posted a 60,000 credit bounty on his head, Glasfir had little recourse but to stay on Demesel. Within a few months, he had eliminated or frightened away all serious competition, and came to rule Demesel's underworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crime skyrocketed on Demesel, and the local authorities' attempts to subvert his organization failed.
