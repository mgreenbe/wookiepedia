Phase III Dark troopers wore black armor made of the nearly indestructible metal phrik, mined on the moon Gromas 16.

The Phase III Dark Troopers were also made into \"Build-A-Droid\" figures by Hasbro in 2009, which came in pieces in several separate figure 2-packs. Curiously, they appear very distinct from one another; the 1998 figure is accurate to the sprites seen in Dark Forces, while the buildable Dark Trooper seems to have been based off of the render found in \"The NEW essential guide to droids\" (which is the image seen above)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
