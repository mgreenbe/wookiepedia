Daala had recently been deposed from leadership of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances in a Jedi-led coup, and had been imprisoned in the Armand Isard Correctional Facility on the galactic capital planet, Coruscant. Former Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila, meanwhile, had been convicted of murdering Admiral Gilad Pellaeon during the Second Galactic Civil War and sentenced to death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Mandalorian bounty hunter Boba Fett was contacted by Daala to help her, and he arranged a mission to break her free. He hired an impostor of Daala's attorney, Otha Tevarkian, to visit Daala in visitors hall and sneak in an explosive that would cause a distraction and allow her to escape. The plan worked well, and Veila\u2014who was speaking with her own lawyer at the time, Eramuth Bwua'tu, got her lawyer to duck in time to avoid being injured. Despite Bwua'tu's warning glance not to try and flee, Veila decided to try and escape as well. As Daala broke free into the visitors' room, Fett arrived\u2014wearing fake Mandalorian armor\u2014with a small repulsorcraft in tow and began opening fire on the prison's defenses. As Veila attempted to escape a YVH-series battle droid then began firing on her. She collapsed as her stun cuffs hindered movement, but broke free through intercepting a blaster bolt with the stun cuffs. As the YVH battle droid began directing its fire towards Fett, the bounty hunter launched a missile from his jetpack, destroying the battle droid. Daala and the impostor then jumped on the craft, and, led by Fett, headed for the outer yard. However, Veila threw the impostor off and jumped on behind Daala. As they entered the yard, Fett drew the prison defenses' fire, and they escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fett then took Daala to a false Slave I, which flew off as a decoy for the Galactic Alliance to chase. Fett had decided to use a decoy starship and fake armor so that when holorecordings of the escape were examined, it would be determined that it had not actually been Fett who had broken Daala free, but rather someone masquerading as Fett. When Daala noticed that Veila had hitched a ride with them, the former Jedi fled from Fett and Daala and began a new life living in hiding on Coruscant. Fett reassured Daala that the impostor had called in and confirmed that he had gotten away, and the bounty hunter took Daala offworld so that she could begin a quest for vengeance against those who had deposed her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
