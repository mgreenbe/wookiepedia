It was known as a haven for mercenaries and bounty hunters. The inside of the dimly lit cantina was furnished with long tables, guttering candles and a large fireplace. In 22 BBY, the young orphan Boba Fett met a thief named Aia just outside the Bonny Bounty. A Diollan and a Rodian patron remarked that pickpockets such as Aia were not welcome inside the cantina, but in truth the atmosphere of the Bounty catered to a wide variety of clientele."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
