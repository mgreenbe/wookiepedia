The T-65's pilot, Luke Skywalker, intended to use the droid R2-D2 as his astromech for the upcoming battle, but the chief noted that the droid did not look to be in the best of shape. He asked Skywalker whether he wanted a replacement, but the pilot objected, claiming that he and R2-D2 had been \"through a lot together.\" Finishing his maintenance, the chief cleared Skywalker for liftoff.
