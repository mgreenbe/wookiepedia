The Imperial 12th Sector Army was directed by the expert guidance of General Jan Dodonna during the siege, and the Imperial forces eventually pulled away with a win. Imperial Admiral Adar Tallon was also present for the siege. The siege was part of the Sy Myrthian Insurrection, in which Imperial troops attempted to eliminate the remnants of the Confederate army in the Sy Myrth region after the latter's defeat at the end of the Clone Wars by the Empire's predecessor, the Galactic Republic. It took place after consecutive Imperial victories during the Sy Myrthian Insurrection on the worlds of Diado and Metalorn, and was followed by a battle at the world of Trasemene, which also resulted in an Imperial victory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was first mentioned in The Essential Guide to Warfare, an extensive guide dedicated to the conflicts in the galaxy, written by Jason Fry and Paul R.
