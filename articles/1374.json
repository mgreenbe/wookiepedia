There they were amongst the soldiers who guarded the Separatist's personnel database which was kept in a captured warehouse on the island. During the time they were there the smuggler known as Ace broke into the warehouse with help from a inhabitant of Mannett point named Reki. The Smuggler intended to download all the data from the database and use it to locate a Separatist named Skavak who had stolen his ship and a shipment of weapons from Rendia Freight. The Smuggler successfully reached the database after killing a number of the guards in the warehouse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Smuggler was downloading the data 4-SEN's sensor's detected the bodies of the guards he killed and so put the warehouse's alert status on red while informing Gorry. The droid could not however detect any hostiles not realizing that Ace was an intruder. The smuggler asked Gorry when he had last calibrated 4-SEN's sensors and persuaded him they were most likely faulty and so there was no need for an alarm. Gorry agreed and he and 4-SEN moved on allowing the Smuggler to successfully complete his task and escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "4-SEN is a non-playable character in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011.
