He was the cantina's best bouncer and bartender, being able to handle bar-fights due to his large and muscled physique. Ceoloe was often talkative and obsequious with his customers, but would purposefully make revealing comments loudly while talking to alert Waroon Dak, a Corellian infochant, to potential sources of information. Dak paid Ceoloe a finder's fee for these tips as well as for the use of a table near the bar where he plied his trade. The bartender also kept a close eye on the infochant, and would pull him to safety in any bar-fight or if his clients caused him trouble."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ceoloe first appeared in 2013 in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
