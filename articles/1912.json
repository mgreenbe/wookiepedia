The army served in the northern quadrant of the galaxy along with the subsequent Sector Armies up to the 12th. At the start of the war, the Grand Army was organized into ten Systems Armies, with each being split into two Sector Armies and drawn from a specific area of the galaxy. The Sector Armies were responsible for the defense of their specific areas. As a result, the 7th Sector Army belonged to the same Systems Army as another Sector Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Similar to the Galactic Republic's other Sector Armies, the 7th Sector Army had one of twenty Haven-class medical stations towed to them.
