In 3643 BBY, Nem'ro's rival Voontara Fa'athra sent forces to wage war against him in the streets of Jiguuna, an industrial town on the planet Nal Hutta that Nem'ro controlled. Outraged, Nem'ro placed a bounty on all of Fa'athra's men in Jiguuna and recorded a holographic message advertising the reward and calling for anyone who heard it to eliminate them. Nem'ro then tasked P8-47 to deliver the message to everyone it could and threatened to have the droid destroyed and sent to the scrap heap if it failed in its task. P8-47 traveled to the Poison Pit cantina in Jiguuna in order to deliver the message, although it dismissed some individuals who approached it, claiming it was on an important mission and so too busy to talk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "P8-47 successfully delivered the message to an individual in the Poison Pit who was aligned with the Empire.
