When fired at the hull of a starship, the disk would adhere to to the hull of the ship, creating a powerful magnetic tether. The tether was strong enough that four TIE interceptors armed with grappling mags were capable of rescuing the Millenium Falcon as it free fell through the atmosphere of Pakrik Minor. The cables were capable of being released and reeled back in, for repeated firing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
