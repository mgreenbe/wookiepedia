They eagerly buy it and take it back to the Office of Acquisitions, where it's a struggle to open it. Orka eventually succeeds by using a blaster, only for the chest to be full of thermal detonators. When Orka accidentally causes the grenades to activate and begin counting down, both store owners panic, and Flix tells off his colleague. Flix attempts to defuse the explosives, but increases the speed of the countdown instead, causing him and Orka to take some scant cover near the crate. Eventually, the grenades fail to go off, to Flix and Orka's relief. They bring the chest back to the loading docks, where they dump it into the sea. Synara approaches with another chest, which she offers to Orka and Flix. As the grenades, in the ocean below, finally explode, sending fish and water flying up into the loading dock, Flix and Orka, despite what nearly happened, decide to buy the new chest, with Flix exclaiming about how they love surprises."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
