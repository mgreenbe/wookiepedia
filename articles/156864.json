In 43.5 ABY Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker and his son, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, traveled to the Rift to find the Aing-Tii species, in hopes of learning more about Jedi Knight-turned-Sith Lord Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side of the Force. They were found by Tadar'Ro, who took them to this moon to see if they could pass the challenge of communicating to him through the Force then allow them access to the homeworld of the Aing-Tii.
