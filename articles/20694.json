Their large, elongated head featured multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth, with their mouth flanked on each side by a barb-tipped, tentacle-like appendage that ensnared and poisoned their victims. Living in many of Giaca's groves of enormous toroc trees, they would find food in the groves and surrounding landscape by drawing prey into their mouth. Though the largest brintaks were solitary hunters, younger and smaller brintaks hunted in packs of four to six. Brintaks were social creatures, with pack of up to 20 members living in dens of hollowed-out toroc tress which were often high above ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
