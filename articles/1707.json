It saw action during the battle on the planet Geonosis in the year 22 BBY. The droid fought in the battle between the Separatists and the Jedi strike team in the Petranaki arena, and was still fighting at the point that Count Dooku, the Sith leader of the Separatists, called all of the droids to cease fire on the remaining Jedi, who were surrounded. 5TE and the many other droids in the arena lowered their weapons, but when the Jedi Master Mace Windu refused to surrender to Dooku raised them again to fire. The arrival of the Grand Army of the Republic prevented the droids from executing the Jedi and recommenced the fighting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all B2 super battle droids, 5TE was armed with a dual built-in Laser cannon, had red sensors and grey armor plating, and stood at 1.93 meters tall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "5TE first appeared in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones as one of many computer generated droids in the Geonosis battle scene.
