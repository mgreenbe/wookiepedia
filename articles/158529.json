Shistavanens were naturally isolationist and distrusted outsiders, resulting in cautious relationships with other political bodies. Most Shistavanens remained on their homeworld, though some traveled away from Uvena Prime to seek fortune in the galaxy. Members of the species had a family-centric life, and several generations of extended family were often clustered around a central residence. Shistavanens were keen hunters and fighters, possessing numerous wilderness skills even if they dwelled in cities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Uvena system's ruling powers used Shistavanen isolationist behavior, combined with the species' reputation due to their appearance and frequent aggressiveness, to deter outsiders from involvement in Shistavanen society. While outsiders were generally not welcome on Uvena, powerful individuals such as traders and corporations were tolerated to improve the economy and for the importation of goods and technology, but local trade rules favored Shistavanen traders as much as possible. Under the Empire's control, isolated settlements were often sought out and patrolled by Imperial scouts to ensure no insurrection occurred."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shistavanens commonly used their native language, which consisted of various barks and growls.
