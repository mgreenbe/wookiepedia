He served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Knight during the final years of the Republic Classic era. Surviving the rise of the Galactic Empire and the initial stages of the Great Jedi Purge, Rorr'hn joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic to combat the Sith-controlled regime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Discovered to be Force-sensitive at an early age on his homeworld of Drgi, Rorr'hn was taken to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for training in the ways of the Force. After decades of study and constructing a yellow-bladed lightsaber, Rorr'hn was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council. While his role in the Clone Wars is lost to history, Rorr'hn survived the execution of Contingency Order 66 by the Grand Army of the Republic and went into hiding as the Galactic Empire hunted down and exterminated all surviving Jedi. Joining the fledgling Alliance to Restore the Republic, Rorr'hn offered up his skills as a pilot to aid in the war effort. With the Galactic Civil War in full-swing, Rorr'hn piloted an X-wing against the Imperial war-machine, and wore a yellow flight-gear. He had grey eyes with a large beak-like protrusion under them constituting the bulk of his face, in addition to twin horns atop his head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rorr'hn of Drgi was created by Tom Whalen, a 21-year old fan who entered Star Wars Galaxy's \"Design An Alien\" competition, which was launched in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 3 (1995). Whalen created his artwork of Rorr'hn by using an intricately cut and colored paper collage. Although his was not one of the winning entries, Whalen's artwork was featured alongside the winners of \"Design an Alien\" in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 7 (1996). The piece was showcased in the \"honorable mentions\" of the \"16 and up\" division of the competition. Continuity editor Leland Chee later stated that the published material from \"Design an Alien\" was canon. Although the character of Rorr'hn has not been referenced in any further Star Wars material, the \"Drgi\" part of his name was contextualized as a planet in The Essential Atlas (2009), by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
