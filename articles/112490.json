The base also housed the security personnel and military units assigned to the base, in addition to medical officers, communications specialists, mechanics, cooks, maintenance personnel, and servants.

The best that the defenders could accomplish was to delay the Imperials long enough for the base to be evacuated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sector command bases were equipped with communication equipment that gave them the ability to communicate with Rebel units throughout their sector, as well as other second commands.
