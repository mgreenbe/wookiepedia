In theory, the explosion caused when the door is breached should cause the defenders to flinch and allow the boarding party to surprise them. The trooper knows better: every single time he has been on this kind of mission, the first trooper through the door was the first to be shot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He flashes back to his early adulthood, living on Greater Marianas, a rustic, backwater planet with constant dust storms. His father was a hunter who scratched out a meager living selling hides, and the young man grew sick of the dust storms, the vagrant lifestyle, and his father's constant sermonizing about how freedom was the most important thing in life, and taking freedom away was the lowest act imaginable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day, an Imperial landing party appeared in town and announced that the planet was now under Imperial \"protection.\" The young man's father protested, and a stormtrooper shot him dead. \"Pa had the freedom he was born with; the other guy had a blaster.\" Seeing the end of his old life, the young man appealed to the Imperials to take him with them. The officer in charge said that he would have to demonstrate his loyalty to the Empire first - by executing a random member of the crowd. The young man did. \"To me, it wasn't evil.
