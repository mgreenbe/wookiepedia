In 3 BBY, Phoenix Squadron established Chopper Base on Atollon as its base of operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cell joined the Rebel Alliance in 2 BBY after the Spectres, a group of Phoenix rebels led by Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla, helped to protect Senator Mon Mothma after she spoke out against the Empire. The cell planned to attack Lothal and liberate it from Imperial rule with the help of Massassi Group, but Thrawn discovered Chopper Base and mounted a massive attack against the Rebels.

Phoenix Home was destroyed during an attack by Darth Vader. Following the rescue of Kanan Jarrus, the Phoenix cell was joined by the Spectres, a six-member cell which operated from a modified VCX-100 light freighter known as the Ghost. Some known leaders of the Phoenix cell included Commander Jun Sato, the former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, an unidentified Phoenix leader, and the Ghost captain Hera Syndulla, who became the new Phoenix Leader after the death of her predecessor during the Blockade of Ibaar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Serving the early rebel movement"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "New allies and threats"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Phoenix Squadron was part of a loose network of rebel cells which fought the Galactic Empire several years before the Battle of Yavin.

However, the Phoenix rebels did not abandon their efforts to alleviate the Ibaarians. Hera managed to obtain a prototype Blade Wing starfighter from the Mon Calamari engineer Quarrie.

She had also come to collect EG-86 but Sabine refused to surrender the droid. Following a skirmish with stormtroopers, Sabine, Chopper and EG-86 fled on a stolen shuttle but were pursued by Ketsu's starship Shadow Caster. The two Mandalorians subsequently reconciled after they were cornered by an Imperial light cruiser.

As part of the plan, the crew of the Ghost would steal the vessels. This ruse was done to avoid exposing Alderaan's covert assistance to the Rebellion. The Phoenix rebels encountered a new obstacle when the local Imperial Supply Master Yogar Lyste fastened gravity locks to the corvettes in order to deter thieves. Captain Syndulla traveled on the Ghost to Lothal, where she rendezvoused with Ezra, Kanan, Chopper, Leia, and Ryder Azadi, the former Governor of Lothal and a rebel sympathizer.

The Protectors had a colony in the Concord Dawn system, which was still not controlled by the Empire. However, Rau had aligned the Protectors with the Empire and attacked Hera's mission; seriously wounding Hera and killing at least two Phoenix pilots. In retaliation, Kanan, Hera, and Chopper infiltrated the Protectors' encampment on the third moon of Concord Dawn and destroyed the Protectors' Fang fighters.

One rebel named Lieutenant Dicer was taken by large spider-like creatures called krykna while planting a sensor marker at Chopper Base's northern perimeter.

After recovering the Sith holocron from the Bendu, the two Jedi confronted Maul at Vizsla Keep 09. Maul then made Ezra help him combine the two holocrons in order to see visions of the future.
