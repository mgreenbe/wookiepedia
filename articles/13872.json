When the war came to a close with the Treaty of Coruscant, Republic commanders on Dantooine refused to comply to the conditions set forth in the Treaty. They instead continued the battle, making it one of the first in the Cold War that arose in the aftermath of the Great Galactic War. While Republic military commanders engaged Imperial forces openly, members of the Jedi Order and other agents worked to lure Sith leaders into a trap in Dantooine's Crystal Cave. During the battle the Republic privateer Admiral Zale Barrows and his Free Spacers Fleet defeated the Imperial Third Fleet over the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
