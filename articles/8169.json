The six Null-class ARC troopers took it over on the return from Geonosis, refusing to be put into stasis tubes as no one could command them during the battle. They held it against the Coruscant Security Force until Kal Skirata arrived, and talked them into ending the siege; Skirata was re-enlisted in the Grand Army of the Republic and the Nulls had no disciplinary action taken against them.  The Special Operations Brigade was stationed here, with Jedi Masters Iri Camas and Arligan Zey maintaining offices within."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
