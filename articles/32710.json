Most craft intended for smuggling depended on speed or firepower to avoid capture. The D-type instead relied almost entirely on stealth, carrying no weapons and only managing a low sublight speed due to the baffle shielding drive it was equipped with. Unlike most light freighters, the D-Type was not designed to allow modification of any kind. Instead, if an owner wishes a modified version of the ship, they must commission a customized one from the manufacturer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
