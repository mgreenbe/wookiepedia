After escaping Naboo, the ship carrying Queen Amidala was hit by a Trade Federation battleship and damaged. The astromech droids stored on board were sent out to repair the damage, with R2-B1 being one of the droids destroyed in the attempt. Only R2-D2 survived to restore shield power to the cruiser by bypassing the main power drive, allowing pilot Ric Oli\u00e9 to escape into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
