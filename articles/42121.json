However, its set-up time limited its effectiveness. In consequence, various Imperial crews pre-charged its Class-4T3 power generator for faster assembly, however doing so required careful adjustment of the power flow to prevent an overload. The E-Web also had a scope that enabled improved accuracy for longer-range engagements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An earlier variant of the E-Web in service near the end of the Clone Wars appeared to use a different tripod with two fore legs and one aft leg instead of one fore and two aft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The E-Web was pressed into Republic service late into the Clone Wars and remained in use as the Republic transitioned into the Galactic Empire.
