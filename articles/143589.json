When Tarkin reveals that Letta Turmond, the bomber of the Jedi Temple, has been taken into military custody, Ahsoka protests that she should have remained in Jedi custody. Anakin tells Ahsoka to comfort Barriss, as she is clearly very grief-stricken. Entering the lift with Tarkin, he sighs that in many ways Ahsoka has yet to grow up."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Whilst discussing the importance of moving past one's emotions as a Jedi, Ahsoka is called away to the war room.

Ahsoka asks for privacy when it becomes clear Letta does not want to speak in public, and she then reveals that the idea of bombing of the temple was not hers, but a Jedi's. She explains that many believe the Jedi have become weapons of war rather than peacekeepers, and claims a Jedi agreed with this and bombed the temple to make a statement. Fearing that this Jedi may harm her, she asks Ahsoka for protection. Ahsoka does not make the promise, but presses Letta for more. Just as Letta is about to reveal the Jedi's name, she is Force choked and dies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clones notice the security camera footage, which appears to show Ahsoka choking Letta.

Some time later, Ahsoka notices a key card lying outside of her cell. Believing it to be the work of her master, she uses it to free herself. However, as she makes her way through the corridors, she comes upon wounded clones. She finds her lightsaber and comlink lying next to the clones. At that moment, Commander Fox comes through the door, and quickly slams the emergency alert button, and Ahsoka takes off down the corridors. As Fox is about to give a comlink alert with warning to shoot on sight, Anakin belays the order. He attempts to call out to his Padawan, asking her to return and await judgment. She explains that he is the only one who really believes in her, and thus keeps running."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin tells the clones to capture her but keep her alive. When she is spotted above a statue outside, a chase ensues in which she runs into the industrial areas in an attempt to shake off the clones. Eventually, they surround her, and she loses her shoto while deflecting their stun blasts. She jumps onto a nearby pipe and escapes through the pipe system. Anakin eventually catches up with her at an outlet leading to a vertical shaft. She says that she will not take the punishment for something she did not do. As Rex and Fox come down the tunnel behind Anakin, she asks him to trust her, and jumps out of the pipe onto a passing ship, thus making her escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The episode was named for the 1934 Alfred Hitchcock film The Man Who Knew Too Much."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The episode contains many references to the 1993 film The Fugitive, which stars Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.
