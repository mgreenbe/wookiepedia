It protected the wearer against attacks, and it also warned against incoming fast movements in a short range, using an Infrared Motion Sensor Array. The warning was an audible signal that could be re-directed to sound only in the wearer's blast helmet but, as noticed by user Jatras, locating the attacker would then be harder as the wearer could not use hearing to do so. Other users, such as Heller, changed the warning display so it would not be an intrusive noise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cresh Luck Armor could be bought through Gundark's Gear Datalog.

This technology used infrared motion trackers to detect any fast movement \u2014which was understood as an attack against the wearer. Any object heavier than 10 kilograms moving faster than 1 meter per second within a range of 30 meters triggered the alarm. The default alarm was audible, but it could be configured to sound only inside a blast helmet, to become a visual signal in the wearer's goggles, or to be perceived as a subtle tingle. One user of the armor, Jatras, believed that the audio alarm would either warn the attacker too, or prevent the wearer to pinpoint the attacker's position by hearing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cresh Luck Armor was available for 500 during the Galactic Civil War. It was one of the products in the illegal Gundark's Gear Datalog, where several users \u2014including Jatras and Heller\u2014 posted about the pros and cons of the item. Heller took the warning \"tingler\" of low charge in the power cells of the old DL-44 model of blaster pistol and adapted it to the Cresh Luck Armor, replacing the beeping sound with a less-intrusive tingle; after succeeding at this, Heller wrote about the method on the Datalog."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During that War, a number of bounty hunters used Cresh Luck Armors.

All the specific paragraphs about it were repeated in Gundark's Fantastic Technology: Personal Gear, adding new information on it in the form of a exchange between Jatras and Heller. The role-playing stats say that the Cresh Luck Armor was more effective against energy damage, such as blaster bolts, than against physical damage, such as a punch. Albeit the sources say that it is a modified Riot Armor, the non-modified Riot Armor has yet to appear in canon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
