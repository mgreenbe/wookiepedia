Within the Unknown Regions, military bases and shipyards were constructed to churn out some of the technologically superior weapons and starfighters utilized by the military, with many of the Old Empire's greatest military secrets falling into the hands of its successor state. To avoid treaty restrictions banning the sale of weaponry to the First Order, galactic arms manufacturers BlasTech Industries and Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. spun off a subsidiary known as the Sonn-Blas Corporation, which manufactured much of the First Order's weaponry within First Order space, while Sienar-Jaemus Army Systems and Aratech-Loratus Corporation provided spacecraft and vehicles to the Order."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In violation of New Republic laws regarding capital ships, the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer was developed by Kuat-Entralla Engineering.

Although their dreadnought, the Fulminatrix, was destroyed, the First Order annihilated the base, destroyed the Resistance's entire bombing fleet, and forced them to flee to the Crait system. General Hux then used new hyperspace trackers to confront the Resistance with their massive flagship, the Supremacy.

After defeating Snoke's guard, Rey rejected Ren's offer of ruling the galaxy together, instead trying to take Luke's lightsaber. The lightsaber split in two, but Rey recovered both parts and escaped the Supremacy. Meanwhile, Kylo declared himself new Supreme Leader after Force-choking Hux.

Unlike the inconsistent academy standards of the previous Galactic Empire, training of the new generation of stormtroopers emphasized improvisation and counterinsurgency operations, including guerrilla tactics. With the First Order lacking the numerical superiority of the Galactic Empire, better-equipped and -trained soldiers resulted in higher trooper proficiency than the previous Galactic Empire. Soldiers were often trained on capital ships and underwent vivid simulations to create the most loyal soldiers, which was an extension of the ideas of Commandant Brendol Hux and his Commandant's Cadets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to its stormtroopers and ground tactics like maneuver 0927, the First Order utilized differing vehicles to help their infantry in various environments.
