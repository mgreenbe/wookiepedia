One of the Ministry's workers was the Human Davu Golec. A friend of New Mandalorian Duchess Satine Kryze, Golec provided her with a holographic testimony that had been delivered to the Ministry during the Duchess's fight to keep the planet Mandalore out of the Clone Wars. The testimony was from New Mandalorian Deputy Minister Jerec, who claimed that his government was capable of rooting out the Death Watch terrorists that plagued the world without the need for Republic intervention. The testimony had been doctored by someone within the Republic government and made to sound as if Jerec was, in fact, begging for Republic aid. After being provided with the true recording, Kryze delivered it to the Galactic Senate and prevented a military occupation of the Mandalorian homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
