Lead by Dooku's former apprentice, Asajj Ventress, the Nightsisters fought back. During the battle, Luce obtained two blasters from BX-series droid commandos, and the Nightsisters numbers were reinforced by the undead Nightsisters resurrected by the magick of Old Daka."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Droids fought back by launching the Defoliator Deployment Tank to burn the witches out, forcing Luce and others to flee the cover of the trees, yet Luce, aided by other Nightsisters, climbed upon an Armored Assault Tank, as Ventress took another for herself to use. The undead cutting a path right to Grievous, Luce and the rest of the clan engaged in a ferocious firefight with the droids, as Ventress fought Grievous. Seeing Ventress injured, Luce rushed in to help her, while the Undead swarmed Grievous, forcing him to cut them down one by one. However, as Luce was getting Ventress away from the battle, she was shot in the back by a B1-series battle droid, which Ventress swiftly destroyed with the force. Ventress held Luce in her arms, as Luce got out that doom was upon them, and to run in order to save herself. Luce then died, and Ventress fled. The battle was lost not long after, with Ventress and Talzin being the only survivors of what became a massacre."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
