They had quad wings and large eyes, and were capable of growing to over three meters (nine foot ten inches) in length. The sentient Wookiees of Kashyyyk believed seeing a can-cell brought the viewer good luck and based the design of their Raddaugh Gnasp fluttercraft on the odd-looking creatures. Can-cell were attracted to the buzzing sound made by Wookiees' Oevvaor Jet Catamarans and would often congregate at landing pads where the vehicles could be found. Some residents of the planet Batuu raised native can-cell to become pets or for other reasons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The script for Episode III described a scene of Yoda escaping the battlefields of Kashyyyk by riding atop a can-cell, described as \"a large alien flying insect.\"[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also in Revenge of the Sith, a smaller can-cell can be spotted in the Dagobah landing of Yoda in a deleted scene.
