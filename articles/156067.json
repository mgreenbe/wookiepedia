In the aftermath of the galaxy-wide conflict, the clone trooper and his brethren\u2014formerly soldiers in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic\u2014became part of the Imperial Army when Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine declared himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire. Not long afterward the clone went to the cafeteria to eat. As he passed by the table where Clone Force 99 sat, he noticed that Doctor Nala Se's medical aide, the genetically altered clone Omega, was sitting with them.

He was genetically identical to the standard clone troopers, and therefore saw the members of Clone Force 99 as a squad of defective clones due to their genetic anomalies which set them apart from the rest of the clone army.
