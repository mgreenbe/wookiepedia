Following the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire, Master Strayen returned to the ancestral Jedi homeworld Tython with the rest of the Order and helped rebuild during the Cold War, residing at the Temple there. As the Cold War continued to tax Jedi numbers, Master Strayen retired from teaching and worked exclusively as a recruiter. Later on, a rising Jedi Padawan met with Strayen to discuss a matter of concern in which a Force-sensitive Flesh Raider known as Fashk wished to be trained to control his Force ability. They eventually concluded that they had to train him partially, as he was holding a young Twi'lek boy known as Viyo Kobbeth hostage. Strayen later consulted the Jedi Council on this issue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
