The Jedi used the outpost as storage for treasure and artifacts. Among these treasures were dozens of Jedi holocrons and a lightsaber rifle. During the High Republic Era, Jedi Masters Porter Engle, Loden Greatstorm, his Padawan Bell Zettifar, and Indeera Stokes were stationed at this outpost to keep the peace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker visited the outpost with his Padawan Ben Solo and the explorer Lor San Tekka, and encountered Ren and the Knights of Ren, who also wished to claim the artifacts inside the outpost. Ultimately the structure proved to be a source of more Jedi knowledge for Skywalker, as he recovered the holocrons and other relics within, leaving the outpost empty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
