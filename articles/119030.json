She built weapons she believed would be used for peace but were instead used against her family and her people. Wracked with guilt, Wren left Mandalore and was branded a traitor by the Empire and her mother, Ursa Wren, leader of the clan. Wren worked as a bounty hunter alongside her friend Ketsu Onyo before being recruited by Captain Hera Syndulla and the Jedi Kanan Jarrus to join their rebel crew aboard the starship Ghost. Together, the crew fought against the Empire and used Wren's art as a symbol of hope. They became part of a larger rebel movement, with Wren's work continuing to inspire the fledgling rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, while hunting down the rogue Sith Lord and former ruler of Mandalore Maul, Wren discovered the Darksaber on Dathomir. She initially wanted nothing to do with it, but Jarrus and Fenn Rau, a Mandalorian Protector of Concord Dawn who joined the rebellion, convinced her to wield it so she could unite the Mandalorian people and bring them into the rebellion. Wren returned to her family and convinced them of the Empire's treachery, helping to kill Gar Saxon, the Imperial Viceroy of Mandalore, in the process. After aiding her family in the Mandalorian Civil War, Sabine returned to aid the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Empire. Wren and the Ghost Crew eventually returned to Lothal. During this time, Jarrus was killed, but she and the other members of the Lothal resistance group went onto fight to liberate the planet. While they succeeded, it was only after her friend Ezra Bridger disappeared into hyperspace with the Star Destroyer Chimaera.

Her mother Ursa was a member of Death Watch during a time when Mandalore had fallen into chaos after the collapse of the New Mandalorian government, near the end of the Clone Wars. She was raised in part on Mandalore but also considered Clan Wren's ancestral home of Krownest to be her homeworld. Trained from an early age in Mandalorian warrior culture, Wren forged her distinctive armor with her family, and also inherited her Nite Owls helmet from someone whose identity she was reluctant to reveal. Her father, artist Alrich Wren, took Sabine to see the statue of Tarre Vizsla while her younger brother Tristan Wren was only an infant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Clone Wars ended, the Galactic Empire established a presence on Mandalore and opened an Imperial Academy, which Wren attended as a Imperial cadet. As a youth, she believed in the Empire and, even as it put her through some \"rough stuff,\" followed its orders blindly. During her time at the Academy, she studied the tactics of Twi'lek Resistance leader Cham Syndulla and Mandalorian Protector leader Fenn Rau during the Clone Wars. This would eventually put her at odds with the Imperial establishment there, and led to a nightmarish experience."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a young and idealistic Imperial cadet, Sabine built an Arc Pulse Generator that she nicknamed the \"Duchess,\" which reacted with the beskar alloy inside the Mandalorian armor, incinerating the armor and disintegrating their wearers. The weapon was regarded by many Mandalorians as an abomination because it turned their armor against them; Mandalorian armor held a sacrosanct place in Mandalorian culture since it was passed down from generation to generation. As Wren witnessed the Empire subjugating Mandalore, she was wracked with guilt at her own role in helping the Empire build the weapon used to oppress her people."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When she spoke out against the Empire, Sabine's mother, her father, and her brother sided with the Empire and cast her out. Estranged from her family, Sabine Wren escaped the Imperial Academy with the help of her friend, Ketsu Onyo, and deserted the Empire. Sabine's decision to renounce the Empire had serious ramifications for her family. Her father became a hostage of Viceroy Gar Saxon, the Emperor's Hand and the Imperial puppet ruler of Mandalore. Her mother Ursa was forced to prove her clan's loyalty to the Empire while her brother Tristan was forced to serve in Saxon's Imperial Super Commandos so that the family could remain in Saxon's favor. Before fleeing Mandalore, Sabine also destroyed her weapon. However, the Empire was able to use her research to build another arc pulse generator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her escape from Mandalore, Wren received no small amount of help from Wookiees, for which Wren felt she owed them a debt. Wren and Onyo then became bounty hunting partners; the two were like sisters, though Wren was the softer of the two.

She was then noticed and hunted down by stormtrooper TK-626, his captain, and four others. Wren eventually detonated a paint bomb, creating a colorful explosion that left the stormtroopers stunned and splattered in blue paint, but alive, and strode off into the city amid grateful locals, an event that earned her the nickname \"The Artist\" among local stormtroopers.

Subsequently, they commenced the mission and infiltrated the Gozanti, unaware that Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus had set a trap for them. He and several stormtroopers were hiding in the transport compartment, ready to apprehend the rebel boarders. After learning of this deception, Wren and Chopper disabled the ship's artificial gravity systems for two minutes, which temporarily slowed down Kallus and his stormtroopers and allowed for their escape, except Bridger, who was captured by Kallus and taken aboard his Imperial I-class Star Destroyer, Lawbringer.

Using the information, the Ghost traveled to Spice mine K76 and Wren assisted Jarrus and Orrelios in attacking the Wookiees' stormtrooper guards while Bridger freed the prisoners, a skirmish during which Jarrus revealed himself as a Great Jedi Purge survivor. Ultimately, they managed to liberate the Wookiees and escape in a shipping container that was ferried by the Ghost; later, they parted when the Wookiees boarded an Auzituck anti-slaver gunship.

Wren offered her services as a translator and asked Wabo tell her the weapons' location in Bay 7, but deliberately mistranslated this as \"Bay 17\" in order to mislead Tua.

Returning to Lothal, the rebels attempted to sell the rifles to Vizago, but before they could complete the transaction, the two parties were interrupted by the arrival of Kallus, two AT-DP walkers and several stormtroopers. While Vizago fled, Jarrus refused to let the weapons fall into Imperial hands and ordered Wren to destroy them; she, at R2-D2's suggestion, overloaded the disruptors and fired them at the stormtroopers instead.

When he managed to secure the decoder with the assistance of fellow cadet Zare Leonis, Bridger passed the device to Chopper who then gave it to Wren; she, in turn, transmitted the crystal's coordinates to Jarrus and Syndulla, who then intercepted and destroyed the Imperial convoy transporting the crystal. Wren then made arrangements to pass it to Leonis' friend Merei Spanjaf, who needed it to hack into the Imperial data network to find Leonis's sister, Dhara. Afterwards, as requested by Bridger, Wren and Orrelios staged a diversionary attack on the Academy the following day so that he could escape with Jai Kell.

That night, while MaDall was asleep, Wren sneaked away to reconnoiter the location, but a slaver captured and returned her to MaDall. While her master was again asleep, Wren made a painting of the Zygerrian woman, deactivated her collar and saw that her attempts had inspired a rebellion among the slaves.
