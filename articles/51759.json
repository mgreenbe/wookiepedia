During one of the darkest periods of the conflict, Gaffa fought alongside Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and the rest of his division during a space battle against Separatist forces. The Republic lost the battle and the Jedi and clone troopers were forced to flee with Vulture droids in pursuit. After the droid starfighters damaged the ship the Republic survivors were traveling in, a group of battle droids boarded the ship. However, due to the Jedi's skill in combat, the 38th Armored Division was able to quickly convert their broken down A5-RX battle tank into a battle platform which they used to repel the boarders and destroy their pursuers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
