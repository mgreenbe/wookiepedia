Additionally, due to the exceptionally low power requirements to supercharge the crystals, energy packs within the SSB-1 could power the weapon through thousands of firings. Despite this, the alignment of the crystals was very exact - and the pistol could stop firing from damage or being roughly handled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
