The droid visited the cantina known as Old Jho's Pit Stop in the outpost nicknamed Jhothal on Lothal, and demanded that the Ithorian owner Jho pay protection money to the Broken Horn. Jho refused and claimed that the leader of the syndicate, Cikatro Vizago, owed him money; however, the droid either malfunctioned or ignored him and overpowered the old Ithorian. As a IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid, the criminal was manufactured by Holowan Laboratories and stood 2.09 meters tall with a weight of 140 kilograms. The droid was painted green and used a blaster rifle and an electrostaff in combat, the later of which he twirled while fighting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid was first introduced in 2014 in Star Wars Rebels: Head to Head, a tie-in book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in the build up to the launch of the Star Wars Rebels television series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
