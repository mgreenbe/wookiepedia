After the Empire attacked the Son-tuul Pride crime syndicate and confiscated their fortune, the credits were to be transferred to an Imperial vault aboard the Arquitens-class light cruiser. The rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra, under discreet orders from the Sith Lord and Imperial enforcer Darth Vader, led a crew of bounty hunters in a robbery of the Son-tuul Pride's credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the light cruiser flew above Anthan Prime, Aphra created an asteroid field by detonating an asteroid and disabled the cruiser with an ion torpedo. Aphra's team infiltrated the vessel and located the vault where the credits were being held, allowing the bounty hunter Black Krrsantan to tow an asteroid into the cruiser, breaking the vault open to space. The droid BT-1 generated a magnetic field to collect a number of the credits, allowing a majority of them to be lost into space, where they were collected by a satellite and taken to the moon Anthan 13 for Vader's own purposes. The wreckage of the cruiser was taken to the Anthan Prime Orbital Dockyard, where it was analyzed by Inspector Thanoth, Vader's adjutant, who was unaware of the Sith Lord's role in the plot. Thanoth was able to deduce that the loss of the credits had not been an accident."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
