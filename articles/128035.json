Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, he operated out of the Meatlump Hideout in Coronet City. Around 1 ABY, Snugli Explevey, a technology-hating Meatlump, grew distraught over the large number of harvesting machines sprouting throughout the galaxy. To combat what he perceived to be a threat to society, he gave a spacer a film camera to take pictures of harvesters on a number of worlds, namely: Corellia, Dantooine, Dathomir, Endor, Lok, Naboo, Rori, Talus, Tatooine, Yavin 4. Using the information taken from the pictures, the Meatlumps would be able to locate future targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Snugli Explevey was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
