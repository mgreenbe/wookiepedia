Durasteel sheets and conductor pipes wrapped around it, and the entire building, which had at least three levels, leaned to one side.

Security was extremely lax at the inn, and anyone could book a room as long as they had the credits to pay for it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 43 BBY, Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, came to the inn looking for the infamous bounty hunter Ona Nobis.
