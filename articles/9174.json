A Human mechanic named Sparky was assigned the task of fixing the interlink but was unsuccessful. Sparky desperately sought the assistance of a cloaked man who pretended to fix it but did nothing since he was an advance agent of a Yuuzhan Vong fleet. During the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of Artorias, the communications center was left offline, therefore preventing communications between the planet and the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
