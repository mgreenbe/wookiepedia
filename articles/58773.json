It was composed of Humans sympathetic to the cause of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, and helped them fight the Galactic Republic. This group was closely aligned with the Maujasi\nclans from the Maujas Desert, and aided them in fighting the Grand Army of the Republic. They were located in the capital of Haurgab, Hadde."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because Hadde was seen as a Republic-friendly city during the Clone Wars, it was an immense advantage to the group because the Clone troopers located at the base in Hadde would not expect an attack from within friendly territory. The rebels used this to their advantage, launching a missile strike at Hadde Base which killed many clone troopers. However, the Republic forces managed to track the trajectory of the missiles to a house currently occupied by the group and the resulting raid killed and captured those responsible. This raid was the end for the group of rebels, though the Republic would later withdraw from Haurgab."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This group used Huntmaster missiles and also had in their possession a missile launcher, rifles and mortars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
