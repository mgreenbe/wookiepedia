According to Bren Kingal, he was also murderer who went on killing sprees. However, this may have been yet another of Kingal's countless lies, in order to encourage a spacer to seek out and kill Thanamiroc. Ultimately, Thanamiroc, who was posing as a bounty hunter, was killed the spacer. The spacer brought back proof of his death in the form of an AT-ST pilot helmet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trone Thanamiroc was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the appearance of Trone Thanamiroc changed each time a player performed this quest. The quest dialogue given by Bren Kingal indicated that Thanamiroc was a male, but no mention was made of his species. However, Kingal described Thanamiroc as a master of disguise who could masquerade himself as almost anything, or anyone. This in-universe explanation would seem to explain the otherwise random behavior of Star Wars Galaxies character generator. For this particular quest, Thanamiroc would spawn under the bounty hunter spawn template, allowing him to appear like a Rodian male wearing Mandalorian armor, or even as an IG assassin droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
