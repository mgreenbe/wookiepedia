At one point, the siblings bought the cantina of Mos Eisley, Tatooine, which they turned into a spice den. Eventually, they sold the den to a Wookiee named Chalmun, who turned it into a bar again. Soon after the sale, the brothers vanished, perhaps out of fear that Chalmun would discover the many corpses they had buried in the basement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
