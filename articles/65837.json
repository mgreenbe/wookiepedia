In 0 ABY, about seven months after an Imperial defeat in the Yavin system, the ISO journeyed to the Mid Rim for a series of performances, as firmly-established New Order supporters had wiped away all previous impediments.

However, in 15 BBY, the orchestra began playing exclusively in the Core Worlds after Mid Rim worlds could not, or simply refused, to pay the large sponsorship fees that the ISO charged for booking.

As a result, many obstacles preventing the ISO from touring the region had largely been removed. Via the Imperial HoloVision news outlet, the Imperial Symphony Orchestra announced its first series of performances outside the Core Worlds in fifteen years. The Mid Rim tour was expected to feature many of the Emperor's favorite Neoclassical pieces, including works from the Harbin-re opera, some of Nabicci Futana's waltzes and ganther dances, and marches dating to the Clone Wars of nineteen years earlier.
