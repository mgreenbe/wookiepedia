It later found its way into the Jedi Archives, where the Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Yoda proceeded to jot down their notes on the subject. Mace also speculated upon reading about Ziost that the Sith that Obi-Wan had defeated on Naboo might have originated from the planet and dispatched a Jedi (possibly Quinlan Vos) to investigate, and was intrigued at Sorzus Syn's account about the Sith Purebloods possibly diluting their own line to extinction due to crossbreeding. It was eventually acquired by Palpatine shortly after the creation of his Galactic Empire after accessing the Jedi Archives at the then-recently destroyed Jedi Temple on Coruscant and included it among the Book of Sith, and implemented some of his own notes on various parts, including the revelation that the Sith holocrons Windu alluded to were in fact forgeries as a means of misinformation planted by the Sith. Luke Skywalker, upon discovering the Book of Sith in 24 ABY on Wayland and reading through it, later jotted down some of his own notes, specifically his confirming Syn's claim about a rush of wind and a discharge of electric energy at Sith power locations from a similar experience at the Temple of the Blueleaf Cluster on Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
