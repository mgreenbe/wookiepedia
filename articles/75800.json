This maneuver, along with several other deceptions enacted by Sadow, resulted in a victory for the Dark Lord in the battle of Khar Delba.

Yet, unbeknownst to the rest of the Sith Empire, that fortress was a mere decoy, with Sadow's actual base and defenses on the far side of Khar Shian. That same year, Naga Sadow, who by that time was viceroy of Khar Shian, used the moon as a staging point for an attack on the planet Ziost that was intended to free hyperspace explorers Gav and Jori Daragon, who had recently stumbled upon the Empire while fleeing creditors on Koros Major. The attack, which was meant to appear as a Galactic Republic assault, was a success. The Daragons were then promptly split up, with Gav Daragon being taken to Khar Shian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gav Daragon was kept in a Sadow's secret fortress on Khar Shian from then on, and Naga Sadow mentored and taught him to realize his latent Force-sensitivity. Sadow showed Daragon techniques of the dark side of the Force, and Daragon eventually became Sadow's Sith apprentice. One day, Sadow received word that his rival, Sith Lord Ludo Kressh, had gone to Ziost to protect the Daragons' starship, Starbreaker 12. Sadow ordered his Massassi underlings to go to Ziost and attack Kressh's defenders, while Sadow took leave from Khar Shian shortly thereafter. The attack was soon carried out, and Sadow's Massassi warriors stole the Starbreaker 12 and brought it to the decoy fortress on Ziost. However, Kressh discovered that Sadow was behind the attack and gathered his allies to attack his rival. In the ensuing battle, Kressh's newfound force bombarded Naga Sadow's citadel on Khar Delba from orbit. Little did Kressh know, however, that Sadow's real fleet was at Khar Shian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sadow put up little resistance from Khar Delba, drawing Kressh into a false sense of security and tricking him into believing that victory was inevitable. Then, Sadow sprung his trap. He called in his secret fleet from Khar Shian, which struck at Kressh's flank. This move, coupled with Sadow's replacing of Kressh's crews with double agents that subsequently killed Kressh's allies, ensured Kressh's defeat. Finding himself with no hope for victory, Kressh fled. With nothing standing in his way, Naga Sadow began preparations for an invasion of the Galactic Republic, gathering the remainder of his fleet from all corners of the Sith Empire. Sadow based his increasing militarization around Khar Delba and Khar Shian. Eventually, Sadow's fleet was completed, and his invasion force gathered at the staging point near Khar Shian. From there, Sadow launched the galaxy-spanning Great Hyperspace War. However, Sadow and the Sith were eventually defeated by the forces of the Republic. After the end of the war, Khar Shian was largely stripped of its Sith treasures by Republic scouts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 4 ABY, Khar Shian had become the site of a major Galactic Empire shipyard, in the midst of the Galactic Civil War with the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Khar Shian was solely inhabited by Naga Sadow and his Sith subordinates, many of whom were Massassi warriors.
