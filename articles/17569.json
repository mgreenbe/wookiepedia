The ornate black traveling gown was woven with enough Karlini silk to protect the wearer, as well as anyone standing behind her, from blaster bolts. The dress had web-like black designs layered over gold-colored fabric, and the skirt had the symbol of the Royal House of Naboo in gold as a repeated pattern around the hem. The royal gown and headdress were worn by Amidala's handmaiden Sab\u00e9 when she acted as the Queen's decoy during the Invasion of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The costume was created for the 1999 prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, where it was worn by Keira Knightley as Sab\u00e9.
