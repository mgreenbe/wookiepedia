The Lomabuan's homeworld was covered almost entirely by salt water oceans, apart from several long archipelagoes that breached the ocean's surface, tracing arcs where the planet's tectonic plates collided. Along the coastlines of those islands, which were covered in jungles and swamps, the Lomabuans established settlements. The species shared their homeworld with colonies of tiny creatures\u2014each no larger than a grain of sand\u2014that lived on the edge of the tidal zone and devoured anything with which they came into contact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located in the Mid Rim's Aida sector, the region of space surrounding the Lomabuan's homeworld was explored by the Galactic Republic between 20,000 BBY and 15,000 BBY.

By 3 ABY, the Lomabuans were considered seditious by the Empire; the Lomabuan cities were ruined and the entire population forcibly depopulated from Lomabu III. That year, their homeworld was used as the location of a penal colony for Wookiees by the Imperial governor of the Aida sector, Io Desnand. The Wookiees were freed by the bounty hunter Chenlambec, who, while on Lomabu III, wondered whether the Lomabuans were enslaved somewhere or were all dead and speculated that within decades, the oceans would have eroded all trace of the Lomabuan civilization."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kathy Tyers created the Lomabuans for her short story The Prize Pelt: The Tale of Bossk, which was published in Bantam Spectra's Tales of the Bounty Hunters anthology in 1996.
