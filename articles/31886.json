Cryptology had the responsibility for attempting to decipher Imperial codes. Although equipped with the best communications droids and computers the Alliance could procure, Cryptology only managed a success rate of fifteen percent of civil codes, and five percent of military ciphers. Their primary assignment was cracking the scandocs encoded by Imperial Intelligence, which had proven resistant to every effort tried by Cryptology. Through the efforts of Alliance Special Forces, Cryptology acquired a scandoc decoding computer through which they hoped to gain a better understanding of how the scandoc coding procedure worked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
