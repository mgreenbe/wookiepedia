Some way or another, he managed to anger Sonnos, a Hutt crime lord, while visiting his personal residence. Deggar hoped to escape from the Hutt's wrath by hitching a ride on the space barge Lost Lady, bound for Nar Shaddaa, but was intercepted by the spy droid NEK-01 in mid-flight. A fierce fight took place, and NEK-01 managed to plant a homing beacon aboard the ship. A group of bounty hunters soon arrived, and began firing at the Lost Lady. Deggar and a group of mercenaries then worked out a deal; Deggar would provide the mercenaries with information on Sotto's dealings, provided that the mercenaries safely get him off of Nal Hutta. After destroying the homing beacon and evading the bounty hunters, Deggar Feps, along with everyone else aboard the Lost Lady, made it safely to the nearby moon of Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
