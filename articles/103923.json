The pauldron designated either a rank or an area of expertise. Occasionally, during times of internal struggle within the Galactic Empire, the colors and markings on pauldrons were used to signify allegiance to specific leaders or factions.[source?] For clones, while they were indeed used to show rank, pauldrons could also be customizations to their armor. Over the period of the Clone Wars, the pauldron design changed frequently. Recruited ARC-troopers wore two, such as Fives. Some protruded more than others; shape and size also varied."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Designations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sandtrooper pauldrons designated the following:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Field Trooper pauldrons designated the following:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial Marines and Imperial shock trooper pauldrons designated the following:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some regular stormtrooper units from around 1.5 years ABY had pauldrons that designated the following:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phase I Clone trooper pauldrons designated the following:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phase II Clone Trooper Pauldrons:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senate Commandos also wore pauldrons, but they had a different look.
