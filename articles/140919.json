She piloted a Jedi Vector during the effort to save the Hetzal system during the Great Hyperspace Disaster. Teaming up with fellow Jedi Nib Assek and Mikkel Sutmani in their Vectors and Republic volunteers Joss and Pikka Adren in a Longbeam, the group attempted to destroy an anomaly hurtling towards the Fruited Moon of Hetzal Prime. However, Assek's Padawan, Burryaga Agaburry, stopped them before they could fire, as the young Wookiee had sensed lifeforms in distress inside the anomaly. Te'Ami subsequently transmitted the information through the Force to Avar Kriss, the Jedi Master coordinating the rescue operation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Te'Ami was later killed in a skirmish against the Nihil during the fortieth Emergence of debris from the disaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Living during the High Republic Era, Te'Ami was a female Force-sensitive Duros recruited into the Jedi Order. She claimed a kyber crystal during a visit to the planet Ilum, subsequently constructing her own lightsaber. Eventually, Te'Ami attained the rank of Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 232 BBY, Te'Ami attended a conclave on the new space station Starlight Beacon, and afterwards was one of the dignitaries shown on an extensive tour of the station by administrator Shai Tennem. She subsequently traveled on the cruiser Third Horizon, which was diverted while en route to answer a distress signal from the Hetzal system. Te'Ami participated in the combined Jedi and Galactic Republic effort to save the Hetzal system from large amounts of hyperspace anomalies that threatened it. Piloting a Jedi Vector, Te'Ami joined forces with fellow Jedi Mikkel Sutmani and Nib Assek, flying their own Vectors, as well as a Republic Longbeam flown by volunteers Joss and Pikka Adren, who had been contractors working on the Starlight Beacon and passengers on the Third Horizon. Assek was accompanied by her Padawan, Burryaga Agaburry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The four ships were assigned an important task to deal with an anomaly hurtling towards the main landmass of Hetzal Prime's Fruited Moon, which threatened to potentially destroy the moon and kill its population of four billion. Leading the ships, Te'Ami was given control of the Longbeam's weapons systems before connecting with the other Jedi through the Force. While doing so, she sensed the distant presence of Jedi Master Avar Kriss, who was coordinating the entire operation and keeping the hundred Jedi involved connected with each other. Te'Ami activated her Vector's armaments by telekinetically moving her lightsaber to the activation pad, not wanting to take her hands off of the controls. As Te'Ami was preparing to fire, she and Assek sensed a burst of fear and panic which they presumed was coming from Padawan Burryaga. Assuming he was having a hard time controlling his emotions, the older Jedi decided to let the young Wookiee out of the process of targeting their fire so they would be certain to hit the fast-moving anomaly, and Te'Ami gently released Burryaga from the connection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Te'Ami, Assek and Sutmani refocused their connection, and, agreeing they were running out of time, the Duros was about to fire when Burryaga suddenly interrupted, shouting in Shyriiwook over the Jedi's communications channel. Her concentration and training prevented her from firing despite being startled, and Te'Ami, after realizing that Burryaga had intervened, told him they had to fire. However, Assek translated for her Padawan that they could not fire on the anomaly because the emotions Burryaga had been emitting earlier were not actually his, and he had discerned that the anomaly was starship debris with living people still aboard. Te'Ami's shock at the discovery was sensed by Kriss, aboard the Third Horizon on Hetzal Prime. Kriss, concentrating, realized what her fellow Jedi was passing along, and threw her awareness out over the system to discover a total of ten anomalies with lifeforms inside. She immediately alerted Admiral Pevel Kronara and his crew to the discovery, informing them that their rescue operation had just become more complicated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Te'Ami was a female Duros with green skin and red eyes. She was normally in control of her emotions, allowing her to avoid firing her Vector's weapons when she was startled by Burryaga. She believed that the universal nature of the Force meant that there was light inside of everyone, regardless of appearance, and this philosophy meant she felt no need to upgrade her lightsaber hilt to make it look more beautiful. Te'Ami was also compassionate, letting Burryaga out of the task of foreseeing where the Jedi would need to target their weapons when it looked like he was having trouble concentrating, and becoming horrified upon learning there were people inside the anomaly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Te'Ami was skilled in several Force powers.

Although the lightsaber's hilt had become tarnished and scratched over its years of use, Te'Ami felt no need to significantly refurbish it, as the weapon was still in good working order. She had, however, soldered on a piece that had broken off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the rescue operation in the Hetzal system, Te'Ami flew a Vector starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Te'Ami appeared in the novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi, by Charles Soule.
