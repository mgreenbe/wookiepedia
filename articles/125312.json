Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu along with Clone Commander CC-2224 and CC-6454 their clone trooper detachments, managed to board the station, but were ambushed by battle droid forces of Gorgol the Handy, station chief mechanic. Gorgol had sealed himself inside his security bunker. The Republic frontal assault of the bunker using All Terrain Recon Transport was repulsed with the defense turrets, which killed Sergeant Swift and his squadron. In order to lure Gorgol out, Republic forces simulated a retreat, leaving behind a sole sniper. After receiving confirmation of Republic's departure from his battle droid scouts, Gorgol left his bunker, only to be confronted by the two Jedi Masters. When he prepared to activate defense turrets once again, a sniper shot destroyed his remote detonator, allowing the Jedi to take the Geonosian into custody and secure the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
