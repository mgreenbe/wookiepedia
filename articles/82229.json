This area was extremely hard to navigate using hyperspace and forced the Regime to use Pathfinder navigators from the Navigators' Guild. The Regime often clashed with other small nations that rose up in the Unknown Regions and was frequently at odds with the Chiss Ascendancy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, their economy began to decline and the Regime began piracy to keep it alive. This lead them to raid the nearby Chiss systems of Pesfavri and Schesa for months. This brought them into conflict with Junior Commander Thrawn. Thrawn eventually figured out that the pirate ships were in fact Lioaoin and state-sanctioned, despite the Regime officially denying it. Thrawn then hired Qilori and traveled to the Lioaoin heartworld with the Pathfinder to begin the Lioaoin pirate campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To the horror of Qilori, the Junior Commander sent out a transmission, confirming that he had found the pirates and ordering the second Chiss ship to flee. This caused four Lioaoin corsairs to attack the freighter. However, Thrawn had called in the Chiss warship under the command of Mid Captain Ar'alani who quickly destroyed the ships and ended the threat of piracy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Nikardun Conquests"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several years later during the Clone Wars, a new threat emerged in the Uknown Regions. A powerful empire called the Nikardun Destiny ruled by General Yiv the Benevolent subjugated many of the smaller fractured nations. Secretly, they allied with the Lioaoin Regime to defeat the Ascendency. During this time, the Vigilant Nightdragon man-of-war arrived in the Lioaoin Heartworld after being nearly trapped at Urch. The ambassador onboard the Chiss ship, Boadil'par'gasoi demanded an explanation of what happened. To this the Regime replied they had nothing to do with this. At this time, a Nikardun Battle Dreadnought was at the planet, but did not make any threatening moves. The Diplomatic office invited the ship to dock with their ambassador at one of the several drydocks above the planet. Now the Chiss realized that this was yet another trap to capture Thrawn. Thrawn mentioned his name in the message saying that they were leaving. This caused seven of the nine fighters tailing them to suddenly veer into attack patterns, only to stop suddenly. This confirmed that the Lioaoi were working with the Nikardum to hunt down Thrawn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
