Once Luke, Obi-Wan, and the two droids R2-D2 and C-3PO are safely in Obi-Wan Kenobi's hut, R2 plays a recorded message for Kenobi from the Princess Leia Organa asking him to bring the little droid and the critical information contained within its memory to Alderaan. Initially Luke refuses to accompany Obi-Wan on his journey because of his obligations at home, but upon learning that his home has been destroyed and his uncle Owen and aunt Beru have been killed by Imperial stormtroopers, he agrees to go along. They hire Han Solo and Chewbacca to pilot them to Alderaan aboard the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is the first comic-book appearance for Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. The lightsaber makes its comic debut in this issue, although it is spelled \"lightsabre,\" and has a pink blade rather than blue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cover art is misleading as at no point in the cantina brawl, in the film or its comics adaptation, does Luke fire a blaster or exhort Ben to fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This issue includes the Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt Docking Bay 94 scene that wasn't finished for the film. (Hutt is spelled \"Hut\" in this issue, as it was in all official Star Wars material before 1983.) Rather than portray Jabba as he appeared in the filmed version of the scene (a large Human wearing furs, as played by Declan Mulholland)\u2014which was never meant to be how Jabba would have looked in the film anyway, had the scene been completed\u2014the likeness of Mosep Binneed, a Nimbanel seen in the background during the Mos Eisley scenes, was used. This likeness of Jabba was also used in Star Wars 28 and Star Wars 37. After Return of the Jedi officially established what Jabba looked like, it was decided to make Mosep an associate of Jabba, and the Nimbanese a species of Hutt servants. The article \"Red Five\" in Star Wars Insider 149 has established that the \"Jabba\" in the Marvel comics is in fact Mosep, who sometimes used Jabba's name in interactions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Similarly, Garindan and the IT-O interrogation droid look different in this issue from the way they do in the film. As editor Roy Thomas would explain in the letters column of issue 7, much of the artwork for the early Marvel issues was based on an unfinished cut of the film with incomplete post-production, so the Marvel artists didn't have access to many final images before their version went to press."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In her message to Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia states that one \"Bail Antillies\" is her father. Bail Antilles was later mentioned in The Phantom Menace.

These \"Reprint\" versions were found in the bagged comic three packs commonly found at department and drug stores in the 1970s and 1980s.
