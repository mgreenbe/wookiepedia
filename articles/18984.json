In the years preceding the conflict, members of the Geonosian race constructed hive spires along with droid factories that illegally produced millions of battle droids in secret beneath the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Clone Wars' inception, the Republic discovered the machinations on Xorrn, which eventually led to various assaults on the planet in hopes of destroying the factories, all of which had failed. At the war's end, the Republic decided that Xorrn's capture was no longer worth further casualties and ordered their sector fleet to initiate an orbital bombardment on the factories. As a result, several Trade Federation core ships, which were retrieving droid shipments, were caught in the bombardment and destroyed, leaving behind a graveyard of starships. However, at least one factory, Foundry Four, survived the bombardment relatively unscathed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bombardment of Xorrn was mentioned in the 2016 Fantasy Flight Games adventure book Friends Like These as part of the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
