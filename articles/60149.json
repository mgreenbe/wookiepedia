He felt that all intruders were trouble so when C-3PO and R2-D2 crash-landed in BTL-B Y-wing starfighter following a battle, he personally confronted them in his chariot, being pulled by four Patitites. He told them to leave immediately while he was in a 'good mood'. C-3PO was happy to leave, but R2 was not intimidated by Hay-Zu. He confronted him, towering over him, willing to take him on. In an attempt to prevent any trouble breaking for the both of them, C-3PO was going to shut R2 off, but accidentally pushed him instead, causing R2 to fall on Hay-Zu, killing him. The Patitites, however, were overjoyed by this new-found freedom and began worshiping C-3PO."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hay-Zu was voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson, who also voices Jabba the Hutt, CS-321, Pirate #1, Gorga the Hutt, Droogan and Marlo the Hutt in the series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
