He lived in a region under the control of the Sith Lord Daiman and four of his older siblings were all killed while serving in Daiman's slave armies. The company Industrial Heuristics later sent representatives to Daiman's holdings to search for teenagers to work aboard an arxeum, and Yuru's father went to Eejor's job in his son's place, to allow Eejor to meet with the Industrial Heuristics representatives. Yuru was subsequently sent to the planet Gazzari, to serve aboard an arxeum that Daiman had acquired from the Quermian Sith Lord Ayanos Bactra. However, the arxeum was destroyed during the Battle of Gazzari, and Yuru and the other children fled the planet with the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt, aboard the mercenary transport Diligence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
