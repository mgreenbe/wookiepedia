This allowed sensitive information to be stored in a safe location and did not require access through a computer. This allowed the user to store the information and then 'forget it' knowing that they could retrieve it at any time through the datasplint. As they could be accessed through the brain, these implants also contained trauma sensors as well as encryption data that would detect signs of torture and would further encrypt the information preventing interrogators from accessing it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
