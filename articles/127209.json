It was used approximately eight months after the Battle of Yavin to transport Jabiimi Loyalist prisoners to Kalist VI, where they were used as slave labor. It remained docked there until it was seized by Luke Skywalker during a Rebel mission to free captured Rebel mathematician Jorin Sol which resulted in the liberation of the slaves. Skywalker and the slaves captured the ship and took off covered by Wedge Antilles and the members of Red Squadron. The ship was immediately dubbed Skywalker, after its captor, in comm transmissions. Skywalker returned Skywalker to the Alliance Fleet with the slaves, Sol, and several members of the infiltration team aboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
