Laytron's forces were in place in the event of a disaster, as the evacuation force for Roshton's troopers. Kinman Doriana provided Lieutenant Laytron's location to Jedi Knight Jafer Torles and Lord Pilester Binalie after Separatist forces tried to take control of Foulahn City and Spaarti Creations, hoping to bring Laytron's forces to bear in a mission to free Roshton. Laytron was a by-the-book officer, and initially refused Torles' request for assistance. When Binalie revealed the existence of a fourth Outlink on the grounds of Spaarti Creations, Laytron decided that there was a good chance of success."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
