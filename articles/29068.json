This type of scope could interface with the wielder's helmet, allowing them to see and lock on to a target from a much farther range. An example of this type of scope would be the scope on the E-11 blaster rifle that could interface with the wielder's helmet, giving him/her an edge on the battlefield. A similar version of this device was also used on Han Solo's DL-44 blaster pistol, allowing him to look through the scope and lock on to a target from a far-away range."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
