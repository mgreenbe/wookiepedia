It was originally forged at least 500 years before the mission to Mandalore. Wren reforged it at least twice: to fit her when she first inherited it, and to further modify it sometime after the liberation of Lothal. Her Nite Owl helmet was painted purple-pink, which matched her armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She painted it in bright colors to suit her, repainting it with new color schemes on various occasions. During her time with the Spectres, in the years prior to the liberation of Lothal, she kept her starbird insignia on the breastplate, changing only the design's colors with each repainting. In the years after the liberation, when she mostly stayed on Lothal, she painted a new design on her breastplate to go with new modifications she had made, abandoning the starbird insignia in favor of a Rebel Alliance starbird on her right pauldron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sabine had previously painted a dejarik board design and a number \"5,\" marking her callsign of \"Spectre 5,\" on the pauldron, a detail that had remained through several repaintings. On her left pauldron, she had painted a succession of creatures, including an anooba, a fyrnock and a convor. By the time she left Lothal, sometime after the Battle of Endor, she had a purrgil painted on that pauldron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
