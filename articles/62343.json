He was present aboard the starship Steady Wing, headed for the Starlight Beacon. As he was the same age as Avon Starros, an aspiring inventor and the daughter of Galactic Republic Senator Ghirra Starros, Avon's minder Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh was asked to bring her along onboard the Steady Wing from Port Haileap by Jedi Master Douglas Sunvale, as Sunvale hoped that Avon would befriend Honesty and hopefully soften the Dalnans' view of the Republic. However, during the journey to the space station's dedication ceremony, bombs went off onboard the cruiser, and while the older Jedi fought to save the ship, Honesty, along with Avon, Rwoh, Padawan Imri Cantaros, and Avon's protocol droid J-6, evacuated in a shuttle. The group was subsequently stranded on the wild jungle moon Wevo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
