Durs was one of six SpecForces soldiers commanded by Sergeant major Jom Barell brought in by a transport to drop from Akiva's atmosphere into the outskirts of the city of Myrra. On Barell's orders, the soldiers each leapt from the transport in order to dive to the planet's surface using parawaings, with Durs and then Barell being the last two to exit the transport. As they descended, an Imperial turbolaser opened fire on the soldiers, obliterating Durs' colleagues Corporal Kason and Stromm in quick succession. Barell then order the survivors to open their parawings, but Durs' comrade Gahee'abee was immediately killed upon doing so. Durs, at this point the closest to the ground, was then also hit by the laser and killed, after which the only other remaining soldier serving under Barell, Polnichk, was broken by the wind. Barell himself managed to reach the ground and went on to take part in claiming a victory for the New Republic. While deploying to Akiva, Durs wore carbon-laced armor and orbital drop masks along with parawings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Durs first appeared in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
