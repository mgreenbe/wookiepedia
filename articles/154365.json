However, he betrayed them en-route by throwing the Child into the maw of a hungry mamacore and attempting to drown Din so he could scavenge his beskar armor. Before they could do so, however, he and his entire crew were killed by Bo-Katan Kryze and her Mandalorians, who proceeded to rescue Din and the Child before blowing up the trawler. The Quarren's brother later ambushed Din and tried to kill him and the Child in revenge, only for him and his associates to be summarily killed as well by Kryze and her Nite Owl companions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The boatman appeared in \"Chapter 11: The Heiress,\" the eleventh episode of Jon Favreau's Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Bryce Dallas Howard and released on November 13, 2020."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
