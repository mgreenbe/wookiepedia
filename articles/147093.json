As the Separatists invade Cartao, Ashel and Gehad planned on stealing the Cranscoc fluid technology and take over one of the factories in order to use equipment and special purposes throughout the war. Since Lord Pilester Binalie attempted to remain neutral throughout the war, Ashel and Gehad held Pilester's son, Corf hostage to ensure cooperation. This was when the Republic forces, led by Jedi Master Jafer Torles, arrived on the planet to put an end to the Separatist occupation. The two Neimoidens were able to escape the factory's destruction during the start of the ensuing battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
