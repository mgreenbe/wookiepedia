Chewbacca was bound by a life debt to Solo, but had been away from his friend to attend the coming-of-age hrrtayyk ceremony of his son Lumpawarrump on Kashyyyk. When he learned that Solo had been captured by the Duskhan League, who were based out of Koornacht, he took Solo's Millennium Falcon to the League's power base of N'zoth and reluctantly took a Wookiee crew with him that included Lumpawarrump. After receiving intelligence on the League from the information broker Formayj at Esau's Ridge on Tholatin that was secretly channeled to them by the New Republic Intelligence agency Alpha Blue, the Wookiees arrived over N'zoth and stormed the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Pride of Yevetha. They rescued Solo, and Lumpawarrump completed his hrrtayyk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
