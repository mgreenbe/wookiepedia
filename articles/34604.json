He lacked his superior's cunning, but made up for it with his cruelty. Even among the Sith, his viciousness was remarkable, particularly when interrogating helpless prisoners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His penchant for extracting information had served him well, as he was often assigned to investigate secret organizations and societies within the Sith that might seek to bring the Empire down. One such organization was the Order of Revan. He and his apprentice Emic Sandor sought out this organization's destruction during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. His methods were effective, and his success at rooting out and executing traitors was largely responsible for his current position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Numerous innocent individuals had suffered at Charnus' hands as well, but he had always managed to keep the collateral damage of his investigations to an acceptable level."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the start of the Galactic War, Charnus joined the Battle of Corellia to aid in the crushing of the Corellian resistance. The Sith utilised a personal dreadnought that was combined of the Centurion-class battlecruiser Tears of Taris; which was present at the bombardment of Taris and so named for it, before finding its way into the Sith Empire and served it for the next 300 years; and parts from the Harrower line of ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
