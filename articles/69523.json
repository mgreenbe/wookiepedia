Jatras owned a suit of Cresh Luck armor, and as the armor had a warning system based on a noise. Jatras disliked the item, because the noise would either warn the attacker as well, or alternatively prevent Jatras from locating the attacker using hearing. Jatras posted about this problem in Gundark's Gear Datalog, and a person named Heller suggested to replace the noise-based warning using the \"tingler\" of a blaster pistol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
