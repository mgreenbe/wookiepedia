The droid was used by the barkeeper Florn to break up bar fights which broke out between Imperial Navy pilots and Imperial Army pilots drinking at the bar. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Lightning was brought out by Florn to break up one such fight, which had been started by Huck Trompo, an Imperial Army pilot who flew in Nashtah Squadron. As the droid rolled out from behind the bar, Tana Chellaine, another member of Nashtah Squadron, noticed the droid coming and warned her Squadron leader Sax Hastur allowing both to cover their ears, along with various other pilots not involved in the brawl. On Florn's orders, Lightning then activated his sonic emitter for five seconds, incapacitating all those still brawling in the bar who had not covered their ears. The barkeeper then pointed out Trompo, who Lightning tried to stun with a prod that extended from his front. Trompo remained conscious but complained to Florn, who demanded the Army and Navy pilots who had been fighting apologize to each other and shake hands. When the pilots did not immediately comply, Lightning sparked his stun prod and frightened them into shaking hands and then cleaning the bar. Florn gave a short speech to the pilots and then told Lighting to return behind the bar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and programming"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lightning seemed to enjoy his work breaking up bar fights, and was cheerful while shocking Trompo.
