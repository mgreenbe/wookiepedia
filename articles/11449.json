Longer than other axes, such as the primitive blades favored by the Gamorreans of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's retinue, the BD-1 had a hollow durasteel shaft to reduce weight, dampeners to reduce residual vibration from the vibrating head, and a quick-release switch that allowed the rapid replacement of the blade. The BD-1 was used by Weequay skiff guards working for Jabba. One was used to prod Luke Skywalker into the mouth of the Great Pit of Carkoon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
