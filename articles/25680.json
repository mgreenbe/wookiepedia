In a typical game of Cheg, two players competed against each other for control of a small puck, using their knuckles to strike and propel the puck across the tabletop and into a goal in order to score points. Players commonly shoulder-charged nearby opponents during the course of the game as part of their over all effort to either gain or keep control of the puck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Across the galaxy, cantinas such as Zerria's Bar on the planet Drall hosted tables on which to play Cheg. The Mandalorians Novoc Vevut and Ghes Orade were veteran Cheg players, and elected to teach the game to Mirta Gev following a meeting with the reigning Mand'alor, Boba Fett, at Zerria's Bar. Gev learned the rules quickly, and played a spirited match against Orade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cheg was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novel Bloodlines, written by author Karen Traviss and published August 29, 2006.
