Despite its name, Passive Operations was anything but. The office was staffed by former mercenaries, elite special forces, and the best operatives culled from Systems Operations and Coordinate. Passive Operations operatives were deployed when combat with the enemy was likely and expected. Mission parameters included liberating captured Alliance assets, assaults against heavily-defended installations, and the rare occasion when a straight assassination was authorized. During the Galactic Civil War, Passive Operations made several attempts on the life of Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Passive Operations operatives commonly authored the SecuriDexs issued by Analysis that detailed potential threats to the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
