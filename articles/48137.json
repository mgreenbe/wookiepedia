The image used for the painting is a piece of concept art created for the game's first expansion, Jump to Lightspeed. The painting was one of nine paintings given out randomly to players of the game for the game's first anniversary of release in the United States and Europe. The painting was later added to the \"rare loot system\" in Hotfix 17.10 on October 7, 2010. The system allowed players to loot rare items from any enemy in the game. The ship depicted seems to combine design aspects of several different ships, including the Kihraxz assault fighter and the M22-T Krayt gunship. The player could use the painting in their house as decoration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
