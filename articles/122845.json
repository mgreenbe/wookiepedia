The droid used on Lothal often operated in groups of three, and was visually similar to the observation droid used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, for they both sported a large, central red photoreceptor as well as an antenna. However, the Imperial Lothal model had an additional built-in blaster with a barrel portruding from the droid's body, from which it was able to rotate around."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, multiple DT-series sentry droids were stationed on an Imperial class four container transport that drifted into a storm on Wynkahthu.
