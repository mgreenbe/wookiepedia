At one point, Okka read Lost Legends of the High Republic for her dissertation research when she was bored during a lecture by the Sava. She expected Aphra to think it was weird, but Aphra told her to stop caring so much what other people thought and kissed her. Eventually, their relationship turned sour. Okka became a professor at the Shadow University, but soon after she published an article in the Shadow University Journal about the Rings of Vaale, an artifact that was supposedly cursed, Okka was expelled by the University for what they called \"insufficient credible academic research.\" Following her expulsion, she completed independent field work with assistance from the droid TA-418, and began to carry her own blaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, Okka was studying the Ruins of Kolkur when mercenaries on behalf of Ronen Tagge, scion of the powerful Tagge family, approached her, demanding that she help them find the rings. Soon after, her former classmate Aphra, graduate student Detta Yao, bounty hunter Black Krrsantan, and the smuggler Just Lucky approached her about the rings as well. In that moment the mercenaries returned, but the crew escaped onto Aphra's ship. Okka was initially hesitant, but eventually chose to help Aphra and her associates when Aphra promised her sole credit of the discovery, hoping that finding the Rings would lead the Shadow University to reinstate her credentials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "En route to Dianth, where the rings were rumored to be located, Okka's droid TA-418 played a hologram message of Tagge, who told her that he still wanted to work with her to find the rings, tempting her with the vast resources at his disposal. As Tagge told her that he would show her no mercy if she refused him, Okka turned off the message and accusingly said that there was a liar aboard the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crew ventured into the city of Vaale, where Okka went off alone and discovered the fabled workshop of The Architects of Vaale. The group ventured underground into the sanctum. As they tried to get past the door that blocked their path, Okka and Lucky doubled back to the murals to look for clues on how to pass. As Yao attempted to open the door, the floor collapsed out from under them, and Okka fell alongside Lucky and Black Krrsantan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eustacia Okka was a green-skinned Mirialan that had darker green spots on the left side of her face.
