It was located in an unusally verdant area of Mataou, and contained an altar-like structure at its heart. At some point during the Imperial blockade of the Anoat sector, the Smuggler visited the Shrine as part of a mystical training under Mentor Xiath. After defeating Imperial troops that occupied the ruins, the Smuggler reached the heart of the Shrine, where voices from the past came to life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
