While on the capital world, Master Potkin discovered that Palpatine, the man who ordered the dissolution of the Order and the new Galactic Emperor, was indeed the Dark Lord of the Sith the Order had been hunting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving Coruscant and going to ground, Master Potkin concocted a scheme to entrap Palpatine's Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. Calling a conclave on the planet Kessel, Master Potkin's meeting would be held in an abandoned spice mine. As her peers showed up under the pretense that they would discuss the future of the Order, it became quite clear to all that Master Potkin was actually manipulating them for her own obsessive purpose. As her target, Darth Vader, stormed the complex and headed to Potkin's planned ambush, the other Jedi ignited their lightsabers in preparation of the surprise attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Numbering eight, Potkin and her allies attacked Vader. Armed with a rare cortosis blade, Potkin was able to deactivate the Sith Lord's crimson-bladed weapon after he cut down Jedi Sia-Lan Wezz.

Caught up in Potkin's plan, all six of the other Jedi present were killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Potkin was an extremely arrogant woman, believing that she and other fellow Jedi would be able to conquer Vader despite the fact that he had already killed more Jedi by himself.
