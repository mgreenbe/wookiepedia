He was fluent in over six million forms of communication, and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many decades of operation. After being destroyed and discarded on the planet Tatooine before 32 BBY, C-3PO was rebuilt; his salvaged nature gave him special qualities that distinguished him from similar droid models. Along with his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history, and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions. C-3PO considered various droids and organics to be friends of his, and was very dedicated to them, as well as to any master that he served."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally activated on Affa in 112 BBY, C-3PO had served as a protocol droid to the emissary of the Manakron system. Nearly eighty years later, he was gutted and discarded on the streets of Mos Espa, a city on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. After being rebuilt by the Human slave Anakin Skywalker, C-3PO served Skywalker and his mother Shmi for over ten years, performing household chores and helping Skywalker earn his freedom by winning a pod race. Skywalker left Tatooine but returned in 22 BBY when his mother passed away, and C-3PO was given to Skywalker, now a Jedi Padawan, by Shmi's stepson Owen Lars. C-3PO, Skywalker, R2-D2, and the Naboo Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala immediately became embroiled in the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems. Skywalker married Amidala and gave C-3PO to her as a wedding gift, and C-3PO faithfully assisted her in her senatorial duties throughout the three-year conflict. The two often entered the front lines of the war, at times fighting alongside Skywalker and R2-D2."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the end of the war, Skywalker became a Sith Lord, Amidala passed away, the Jedi Order was exterminated, and the Republic was reorganized into a Galactic Empire. C-3PO's memory was erased, however R2-D2's memory was not. C-3PO and R2-D2 were assigned to the corvette Tantive IV of Alderaan, where they served Alderaan's viceroy Bail Organa for nineteen years. They were, however, separated from Organa during that time period, and got caught up in a wide variety of misadventures, ruining the gangster Tig Fromm, helping restore the Tammuz-an monarchy, and aiding the merchant Mungo Baobab in reviving his family's fortune, among other exploits. After rejoining the crew of the Tantive IV and serving under Captain Raymus Antilles, they became embroiled in the Galactic Civil War, and in 0 BBY, Leia Organa of the Rebel Alliance entrusted them to bring a copy of the Death Star plans to the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine. After meeting Skywalker's son Luke and the smuggler Han Solo, the droids helped rescue princess Leia from the Empire's Death Star and became directly attached to the three Humans, helping them and their rebellion defeat the Empire and restore freedom to the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Rebellion became a New Republic, C-3PO continued to serve Luke and the now-married Han & Leia Solo, helping them defeat remnants of the Empire. Notably, C-3PO helped the Solos raise their three children, and aided Luke in recruiting trainees for his New Jedi Order. His translation abilities proved crucial during major incidents on Bakura, the starship Teljkon Vagabond, and in the Kathol sector, and in 17 ABY, he and R2-D2 teamed up with a young mechanic named Cole Fardreamer to foil a plan to bomb the galactic capital of Coruscant. When an extra-galactic race of religious zealots known as the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy in 25 ABY, C-3PO participated in the four-year conflict that eventually saw the invaders defeated. The destruction wrought by the invaders, and particularly their harsh treatment of droids, caused C-3PO to deeply question his views on deactivation, immortality, and memory erasure.

Nearly eighty years later, his head and gutted chassis had been discarded in a street of the city of Mos Espa on Tatooine, and were discovered by two Human youths, Anakin Skywalker and Kitster Banai. A poor slave, Skywalker decided to rebuild the 3PO-series protocol droid, and began smuggling C-3PO to his home piece by piece. Due to this hodgepodge reconstruction, C-3PO had more mechanical similarities to the TC-series protocol droid than to his original model. Skywalker's intention was that the reactivated protocol droid would function as a servant to his mother, helping her with chores around the house while he worked at a nearby junk shop. C-3PO's gyro-balance circuitry was several decades old, but Skywalker was able to use scrounged and improvised replacement parts to make the droid functional again. C-3PO boasted sound wiring, as well as a standard protocol droid verbobrain and communicator module, but Skywalker could not afford even the simplest of droid coverings, and as such, left the droid's wiring exposed. C-3PO's salvaged nature imbued special qualities in him that were absent from other protocol droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker sometimes brought C-3PO with him when bartering with nearby Jawa traders, and employed the droid's fluency in over six million forms of communication after discovering a wounded Tusken Raider.

Upon meeting R2-D2, C-3PO was shocked when the candid astromech droid commented that he was \"naked\". Despite the exchange, the two droids fast developed a friendship of sorts, working together to help Skywalker make final adjustments to his podracer in time to race it in the Boonta Eve Classic race.

Skywalker won the race, which, thanks to a deal that Jinn had struck with Watto, earned the boy his freedom from slavery and secured Jinn the hyperdrive generator he needed to leave the planet. As Skywalker prepared to depart Tatooine, he said his goodbyes to C-3PO, apologizing for not having completed the droid's construction, and expressing his wishes that Shmi wouldn't sell him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon afterwards, Grand Master Yoda of the Jedi Order dispatched a Jedi recruit to Tatooine to program stories into C-3PO's memory.

Lars married Shmi and freed her from her bonds; Shmi brought C-3PO with her, and the droid served the Lars family at their home for another five years. In 22 BBY, shortly after Shmi was kidnapped by a group of Tusken Raiders, C-3PO was working on a moisture vaporator on the property when Skywalker, now a Jedi Padawan, arrived with Amidala, now a senator of the Galactic Republic. He initially didn't recognize Skywalker until the latter finished his name for him when introducing himself. Greeting his Maker, C-3PO discovered that Skywalker had come in search of his mother, and brought the two guests into the homestead's courtyard, where they were met by Owen and Cliegg Lars, as well as Owen's girlfriend Beru Whitesun. Learning of his mother's peril, Skywalker took Owen's speeder bike to find her, and soon returned with her corpse, having recovered it from a Tusken village. C-3PO was present when he arrived, and later attended a funeral for Shmi on the farm's property. When R2-D2, who had been waiting aboard Amidala's nearby yacht, interrupted the funeral with an urgent message for the Padawan, C-3PO translated the astromech's binary beeps and whistles. After viewing the holocomm message, Skywalker and Amidala prepared to depart Tatooine for Geonosis to rescue Skywalker's Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Owen gave C-3PO to Skywalker as a parting gift."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Entering the Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Battle of Geonosis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Landing the senator's yacht inside an exhaust vent on Geonosis, Skywalker and Amidala set out, leaving the droids behind.

His head landed on a conveyor belt which carried the heads of B1-Series battle droids, and his body wandered onto a separate belt which carried the battle droids' bodies.

Fighting in the name of the Separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems, the battle droids attacked the Jedi; the battle droid head grafted to C-3PO's body found itself unable to properly fight, while C-3PO's head was very unnerved by its autonomous body, and began apologizing to any Jedi that the body fired its E-5 blaster rifle at. However, both incarnations soon suffered a mix-up of programming: C-3PO's body fired several shots from his rifle until a bolt deflected by a Human Jedi separated it from its battle droid head; the protocol droid's head began screaming insults at the Jedi Knights that its battle droid body fired laser blasts at.

C-3PO afterwards then commented to R2-D2 about the events he had endured as being \"the most peculiar dream.\" The Republic Army soon won the battle, launching a galactic war between the Republic and the Confederacy.

Early in the war, C-3PO was on the galactic capital of Coruscant, and along with the senator and R2-D2, witnessed Skywalker depart the planet in a starfighter on his way to lay siege to Muunilinst.

Yoda set out into the planet's blizzard alone, causing some worry on Amidala's part. Although C-3PO assured her that it was safer to remain at the ship, the senator set out into the blizzard, and ordered the two droids to follow her. After being ambushed by three cloaked Separatist Chameleon droids, Amidala destroyed all three by using her cloak and C-3PO as decoys to attract blaster fire.

After being told by the Padawan that he looked different, C-3PO removed his cloak and revealed his new plating. Skywalker was promptly commed and summoned by Obi-Wan Kenobi, and was subsequently granted the title of Jedi Knight.

With the senator focused on the mission, C-3PO set the hyperspace course and filed away several messages that had arrived from Rodian Senator Onaconda Farr via the HoloNet. When the ship exited hyperspace, the two found themselves caught in a trap, as Dooku had arranged for them to arrive immediately adjacent to the crippled Malevolence, which was incapable of hyperspace travel after being battered by Skywalker's fleet.

C-3PO calmly acquiesced when the scammers claimed that they were commandeering the skiff for \"government business\", but before the droid could disengage the ship's autopilot, Binks mistakenly caused the entire platform to flip upside-down. The Gungan quickly righted the platform, but the confusion caused C-3PO to forget to turn the autopilot off, which ultimately caused Faytonni and Med-Beq to be taken directly to the Senate Commandos that they had been fleeing from.

Still stuck to the magnetic hoist, C-3PO lamented what he believed to be the Gungan's death, before Binks climbed back onto the platform and released the droid from his magnetism.

As C-3PO is not a relaxed character, Daniels cannot perform the voice in a relaxed manner. He also cites difficulties involved with wearing the suit as obstacles that he had to overcome while shooting the Original trilogy.

Daniels later praised Thorsland's writing of C-3PO and wrote an introduction for one of the series' trade paperbacks. When writing 2003's The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force, the finale of the nineteen-book series The New Jedi Order, author James Luceno found himself drawn to C-3PO, among other characters, as the droid had been forced to rethink many truths he had long accepted throughout the series."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Impact on popular culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a principal character in a wildly popular film saga, C-3PO has become a cultural icon of sorts, having been referred to as one of the most iconic characters in all of popular science fiction.
