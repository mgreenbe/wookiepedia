The mineral was highly sought after prior to the Clone Wars, although was phased out in favour of the safer trenomite. Sometime during the Clone Wars, the Neimoidian Lok Durd attempted to make a bioweapon using damotite for the Confederacy of Independent Systems with the help of an imprisoned Bant'ena Fhernan. On a mission to the planet Lanteeb, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, managed to prevent the weapon from being widely used, though not before it was used on the Chandrilan capital, Hanna City."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
