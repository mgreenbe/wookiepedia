It enhanced the bearer's visual and spatial perception even in the dark or behind walls. \"Seeing\" with the Force was a useful skill for as Obi-Wan Kenobi said, \"Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.\" Trained users could see well beyond their natural ability and were able to counter Force persuasion and Force blinding powers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Miraluka relied on this power constantly to compensate for their physical blindness. They could not perceive colors but could distinguish organics (even dead) and their alignment from the surrounding environment by their characteristic aura. Most objects, including doors and walls, appeared translucent, allowing the Miraluka to see through them. The Miraluka were the most skilled experts of the technique. Thanks to it, their reflexes were strengthened enormously."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While this was a Miralukan attribute, it could be taught to other species; for instance, Visas Marr taught Meetra Surik to use it. Kreia also utilized the Miraluka version of Force sight to such an extent that her eyes atrophied due to disuse. Another known user was Rahm Kota, who used it after his sight was lost in a duel with Galen Marek, who also gained this ability later on. Darth Bane briefly used this power as a member of the Gloom Walkers unit after being blinded by a flash canister. Jaesa Willsaam was especially skilled in this ability as well, able to sense individual personality traits such as vengeance, hatred, and envy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable Users"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
