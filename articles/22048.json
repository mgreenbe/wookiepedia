At one point, CF-8011 asked their comrade RS-318 why they were stationed on Batuu, and after learning that it's full of lowlives and smugglers commented it wasn't any wonder their stuff repeatedly gets stolen, and also wondered why General Armitage Hux seemed more antsy than usual. At another point, CF-8011 overheard Supreme Leader Kylo Ren mention that he sensed something, and asked their comrade AD-2508 what he meant by that, only for the latter to make a sarcastic retort at the Supreme Leader's expense."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
