They were between two to three meters in length, and basked on river banks waiting for larger prey such as rodents or wild pigs. The serpents preferred to attack by luring their prey into rivers where they had the advantage, then constricted around them and bit them. They could kill prey up to the size of a Human."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
