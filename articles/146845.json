However, it was a trap, just like Jaina Solo's Team Purella's mission, and Tiu's fellow teammembers, Tahiri Veila and Doran Sarkin-Tainer, had to flee. Tainer had the idea to disguise Tiu as being dead, so that he and Tahiri could escape. Tiu then stayed in Sal-Solo's estate and did recon work. She was later retrieved by Mara Jade Skywalker and did more recon work with her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
