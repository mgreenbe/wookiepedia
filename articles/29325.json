Heavily armed with dozens of laser cannons and crewed by many battle droids, several Conqueror-class dreadnaughts were used by the Confederacy when it invaded the planet Terra Sool. At least thirty-six dreadnaughts were deployed in Terra Sool's cloudy atmosphere, fighting against the local militia and a Galactic Republic detachment sent to aid Terra Sool. Although the Conqueror-class dreadnaughts easily destroyed many of Terra Sool's militia fighters, the platforms were no match for Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, who led the Republic task force. Using their powers of the Force and their mastery of starfighter combat, Kenobi and Skywalker hijacked and destroyed several Conqueror-class dreadnaughts during the battle, eventually defeating the Confederates and freeing Terra Sool."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Conqueror-class atmospheric dreadnaught was an extremely expensive and large repulsorlift aerial attack platform used in the Confederacy of Independent Systems' droid army during the Clone Wars against the Galactic Republic. Nearly impenetrable battleships, the dreadnaughts were roughly cylindrical in shape, sporting a flat top that served as both a landing pad and a troop transport area. The Conqueror dreadnaughts had a series of halls and rooms in their interior, including a cockpit on the perimeter of the vessel that housed a large control board that operated the entire aerial platform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Conqueror platforms were heavily armed, equipped with dozens of laser cannon batteries\u2014including five single-barrel cannons on the dreadnaughts' top side, as well as a number of dual-barrel laser batteries that lined the dreadnaughts' upper ringed perimeter. During their service in the Confederacy's army, the dreadnaughts carried a complement of at least twenty-four B1-Series battle droids and B2 super battle droids, and were piloted by a pair of OOM pilot battle droids; however, the platforms could also be piloted by single Human."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY\u2014five months after the Battle of Geonosis and the outbreak of the Clone Wars\u2014the Confederacy invaded the planet Terra Sool. The Confederacy dispatched a fleet of at least thirty-six Conqueror-class atmospheric dreadnaughts to crush the planet's opposition and raze Terra Sool's surface. When the Conqueror dreadnaught fleet entered Terra Sool's cloudy atmosphere\u2014along with a number of Confederate Vulture droid starfighters\u2014it was engaged by starfighters of Terra Sool's local militia and a detachment of the Grand Army of the Republic that had been sent to Terra Sool to assist in the planet's defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Conqueror platforms easily dispatched dozens of the militia starfighters, but the dreadnaughts were outmatched by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, who were in command of the Republic task force aboard their Delta-7 starfighters. During the battle, the Jedi first encountered a single Conqueror-class dreadnaught while fighting off Vulture starfighters over Terra Sool, and Kenobi\u2014deciding to commandeer the Confederate ship\u2014landed his starfighter on the dreadnaught's roof, fending off the B1 and B2 battle droids stationed there. Making his way inside the Conqueror platform, Kenobi managed to fight his way to the cockpit and take control of the dreadnaught."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, informed the Padawan\u2014who was still fighting off droid starfighters\u2014that it was picking up more droid communications coming from farther away in the atmosphere. Following the Confederate communications to their source, Skywalker found the rest of the Conqueror dreadnaught fleet fighting the Terra Sool militia over a small farming town. Skywalker joined the battle, but his fighter was damaged during the engagement, forcing him to crash-land on a dreadnaught's top side. Stranded on the enemy craft, Skywalker fought the battle droids aboard that battleship while Kenobi piloted his captured Conqueror dreadnaught toward the main Confederate fleet. Using the weapons aboard his hijacked vessel, Kenobi destroyed another dreadnaught that was aiming at the one Skywalker was aboard, while the Padawan cleared the remaining battle droids from that aerial platform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi began to engage the other Confederate dreadnaughts and contacted Skywalker, informing his apprentice that the Confederate fleet had launched two waves of missiles to raze Terra Sool's surface. Seeing the oncoming missiles, Skywalker used his mastery of the Force and his lightsaber skills to dispatch the missiles, including grabbing another Conqueror dreadnaught with the Force and moving the vessel in the way of a wave of missiles, destroying both the Conqueror dreadnaught and the missiles simultaneously. Skywalker and Kenobi continued to fight against the Confederacy and eventually defeated the fleet of Conqueror-class dreadnaughts by the end of the Terra Sool day, freeing the planet from the invasion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Conqueror-class atmospheric dreadnaughts first appeared as unnamed Separatists war machines in Skywalkers, a forty-page comic in Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures Volume 2, published by Dark Horse Comics and released September 7, 2004.
