The company had a monopoly on the legal spice trade in the Core, and produced, bought, imported and sold the commodity. Spices that were popular additives in Human cuisine were grown throughout the galaxy on Gwain Spices agricombines and were then repackaged for consumption in the Core Worlds. The corporation catered to both the prepared foods industry and the consumer market. Although Gwain dealt in spice, it was not involved in the illegal spice trade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the company operated under license and the fees were paid directly to the Galactic Empire's COMPNOR and Intelligence budgets.
