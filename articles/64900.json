While the rest of the Regulators turned on their former employers, Ilosov refused to betray his client for credits and left the mercenary group, siding with the business man Shalim Avesta, who had agreed to have Makeb join the Galactic Republic if the Republic would aid them. Ilosov was with Avesta in his office at the Avesta Plantation when one of the Republic's greatest hero's arrived, having been sent by Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh to aid Avesta in retaking his homeworld. As Avesta greeted the hero and introduced Ilosov, a groundquake struck the area, one of several which had occurred since the Hutt invasion began. After Ilosov gave a status report on the effects of the quake, Avesta asked that the hero find his niece Lemda Avesta, who had been looking into the groundquakes to try and find a connection to the Hutts. Ilosov explained that Regulator forces had just pushed back forces that had been sent to find Lemda, and then stayed with Shalim after the hero left to protect him from any Hutt forces who discovered their rebellion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ilosov was skilled enough to work for the Interstellar Regulators, but refused to betray Makeb for credits like the rest of the mercenary group.
