Through several interviews with Zuckuss, she discovered that the Gand had a severe case of schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder. At the end of her diagnosis, she remarked that Zuckuss was dangerous to himself and others. Karastee's analysis gave little hope that Zuckuss would be released from the facility\u2014at least willingly. Karastee's report was eventually compiled in a guide to the alien species of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
