The being made a home within the waters that flooded the remains of a derelict Venator-class Star Destroyer, one of many such vessels left for scrap on the planet. Around the year 19 BBY, members of the rogue clone commando squad Clone Force 99 entered the wrecked cruiser, searching for a medical bay within the ship. One of their number, the hulking Wrecker, briefly wrestled with the dianoga when he found himself dangling from a cable over the being's watery home. Blasterfire from the other clones, however, drove the dianoga off and ended the encounter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point before the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a female dianoga named Omi was captured by Vodrans, who handed her to members of the Empire en route to their new Death Star battle station. She was dumped into the Death Star's garbage masher 3263827, where she would feed on the organic materials that occasionally fell in. During the rescue of Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker first realized something was alive in the garbage compactor, but shortly after his realization, Omi dragged Skywalker underwater. Han Solo and Organa were unable to locate him, but the dianoga released him just before the walls began to close."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Experienced chefs could make grilled dianoga into a tasty breakfast dish, but overcooking it would activate the blood parasites in the fatty tissue, destroying the flavor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
