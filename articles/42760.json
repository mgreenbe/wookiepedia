As such, he participated in the Galactic Civil War, in which the Empire fought the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a resistance movement that sought to overthrow Palpatine and restore democracy to the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Khurgee served as the model for the male officer appearing on the propaganda poster titled \"COMPNOR Recruitment,\" which incited citizens to join the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order (or COMPNOR for short), an agency responsible for the propagation of the Empire's underlying ideology. While it hinted that the captain might have enjoyed a privileged relationship with COMPNOR officials, as cronyism was the norm at the time, it also started unfounded rumors that Khurgee and the artist, Dasita Lyros, were lovers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Khurgee held the rank of captain, and he was stationed aboard the Death Star, the Empire's brand new sphere-shaped deep space mobile battle station. One day, the Death Star's tractor beams captured a Corellian freighter entering the area of space containing the remains of the planet Alderaan, which had just been destroyed by the battle station. When the captured craft, the Millennium Falcon, was deposited in Docking Bay 327, Captain Khurgee led the initial inspection in person, searching the premises and checking the ship's log. Because there did not seem to be anyone on board, and because the log recorded that the crew abandoned ship immediately after takeoff, the captain concluded the Falcon might have been merely a decoy. Khurgee then reported his observations and conclusions to Darth Vader, the Emperor's black-armored enforcer, who nevertheless ordered him to send a scanning crew aboard to perform a more thorough search."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on duty aboard the Death Star, Edmos wore a gray Imperial officer's uniform made of gaberwool, including a cap with an identity disk.
