In the years leading up to 14 BBY, Teller and his rebel comrades amassed various resources including proscribed armaments, former Separatist droid starfighters, warships, and communications jammers with the help of the Imperial Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit, a rival of Moff Tarkin. Despite the odds stacked against them, Teller hoped to inspire a rebellion against the Empire. Teller also reserved a special animus for Tarkin, the architect of the Antar Atrocity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Teller's attack on Sentinel Base, Knotts helped to negotiate a deal between a lieutenant in the Crymorah syndicate and the Sugi smuggler Faazah for a supply of custom fuel cells, which were shipped to the planet Murkhana shortly before Tarkin and Vader's visit to investigate a Separatist communications cache. This enabled Teller and his followers to hijack and steal Tarkin's stealth corvette Carrion Spike.

He hired a Koorivar captain and two Sy Myrthians to crew the freighter Reticent, which was carrying a cargo of Sephi flyers. Three years earlier, Knotts had loaned them credits to buy the Reticent. He sent them on a delivery run from Taris to Thustra and then Obroa-skai. Unknown to the hapless crew, they were to serve as decoy.

Knotts helped to steer the hidden carrier-destroyer from its place of concealment near Lantillies. The insurgents traveled to a remote star system near the Gulf of Tatooine where they intended to ambush an Imperial convoy ferrying supplies along a chain of space stations that led to Geonosis, the site of the secret Death Star project."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since Vice-Admiral Rancit had diverted considerable Imperial forces in response to Teller's insurgency, Knotts was confident that their insurgents would destroy the convoy. Unaware that Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader had discovered Rancit's treachery, Knotts and Teller believed that Rancit's credibility would be affected by their raid on the Imperial convoy. Knotts remarked that Rancit would be unhappy at being denied his expected promotion and would come hunting them down.

Knotts then asked how far they would set the Empire back by destroying the convoy. Artoz responded that the Empire had been working on the hyperdrive components for three years before he was sent to Desolation Station. He believed that the attack would push the Imperials back by four years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teller speculated that the Empire was working on a weapons platform above Geonosis and asked if they needed to know more than that.
