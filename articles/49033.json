In 8 ABY, Moff Kentor Sarne initiated Omega order five, which flash-cleared the computers in his headquarters during the Battle of Kal'Shebbol. As a result, the New Republic lost vast amounts of data including maps of the Kathol sector, and all of Sarne's documents and files."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
