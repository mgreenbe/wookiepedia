In about 12 ABY he was mind-tricked by the renegade Jedi Dal Konur into selling him his ship while on Bilbringi. Afterward, Lar-Quain could not remember who he had sold it to and, while he believed that he had been paid for it, he could not remember where he had put the money. However, he did remember that the new owner had moved it to a new hangar and he told this to a group of spacers that were trying to find Konur."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
