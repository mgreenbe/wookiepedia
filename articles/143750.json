But then he ran into a tree and found himself babysitting the Wookiees, D'Koetaa, D'Lylaa, and Wyhyatt. When Graf was trying to remember their names, he found himself in the middle of the Boonta Eve Classic between a young Anakin Skywalker and Sebulba. He then fell and found himself at the mercy of the bounty hunter assassin droid IG-88. But then he was on a speeder with Azool Phantelle and wrapped up by carnivorous plants from Opop Hibbedit. He was then jumping over obstacles with Barriss Offee and escaping a wampa with Reebak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tarinna was pulling all the stories that Graf had ever told from his head. When he finished pulling the stories from Graf's head he praised himself as he prepared to \"consume\" the stories. Worried about what to do, the Kowakian monkey-lizard Noni ran over to CR-8R \"Crater\" who was broken down after he was stunned by the Tarinna. Thinking quickly, she grabbed the broken librarian droids and used their wires to jump start Crater and BB-00 \"Boo\" (who was also broken down.) Crater and Boo both came back online and ready to handle the Tarinna."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Tarinna continued to pull stories from Graf's head, Crater shouted from the bottom of the bookcase that he will give the Tarinna hundreds of stories and activated his holoprojector. Hundreds of holographic cards appeared with the stories that Graf and Crater told each other while on their adventures through Wild Space. The Tarinna let go of Graf and turned to Crater, looking to get his stories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He launched at Crater but in doing so, knocked Graf off the bookcase and down to the floor as Boo caught him. In order to save Crater, they pushed the bookcase onto the Tarinna as Crater got out of the way. They all agreed that it was best to leave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on the Star Herald, Crater asked how Graf felt. Graf told him that he felt happy about what they did. But Crater didn't, he still believed that the Graf family is a mystery to him even though he had served with them for many years. Even though Graf lost most of his stories he said that it didn't matter, much to the surprise of everyone else. But he believed that he just made a new story with his friends and there will be many more to come."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
