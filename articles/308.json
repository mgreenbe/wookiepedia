The droid was a part of Viceroy Nute Gunray's occupation force, installed following the Federation's successful invasion of Naboo. When the planet's native Gungans attempted to strike against the Federation's forces, 1138 was a part of OOM-9's task force dispatched to meet them at the Great Grass Plains. The Gungans were routed, but before 1138 could prove instrumental in the capture of one of their leaders, Jar Jar Binks, the droid was deactivated, along with all other B1s on the field when the Federation's Droid Control Ship was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "1138 was a B1-Series battle droid in the service of Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray's Droid Army. In 32 BBY, Gunray utilized a fleet under his command to blockade the world of Naboo, in a protest against the Galactic Senate's new taxation of trade routes. Soon enough, Gunray had his army invade the planet, and overwhelm the government, allowing the Neimoidian to seize control of Naboo. 1138 was a part of the occupation force installed under the command of OOM-9."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly afterward, a resistance to Gunray's control of the planet surfaced, as a large force of Naboo's native Gungan army under the command of Bombad General Jar Jar Binks and General Tobler Ceel massed at the Great Grass Plains. OOM-9 led an opposing force, of which 1138 was a part, to meet the Gungan army, and engaged the natives in the Battle of Grassy Plains."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gungans were eventually routed, and forced to retreat. As they were doing so, 1138 joined 3B3-888 in capturing Binks and Captain Roos Tarpals. As 1138 held Binks at blasterpoint, however, the Federation's Droid Control Ship that was orbiting Naboo and relaying orders to the battle droids was destroyed by Anakin Skywalker. As a result, 1138, and all other battle droids on the planet were deactivated immediately. The droid's head then fell off, before Binks pushed its limp body to the ground. Naboo's leader, Queen Amidala was then able to capture Gunray, and reclaim possession of her planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata, 1138 had white plating, black photoreceptors, and, like every other B1 battle droid, was 1.91 meters tall. 1138 was equipped with an E-5 blaster rifle, which it wielded during the Battle of Grassy Plains. When deactivated 1138's head fell off of its own accord, a feature not shared by most of its fellow B1 battle droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "1138 was created for George Lucas' 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, and was featured as both an animatronic model and a computer generated character.
