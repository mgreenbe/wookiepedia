They were led by the Tempest Runner, Kassav Milliko, and his three Storms: Dellex, Gravhan, and Wet Bub. The Tempest consisted of about one thousand members and were considered to be the most thrill-seeking of the other Tempests. Milliko considered them to be the most warrior-like of the Nihil and believed they were more powerful than the other Tempests put together. The Tempest was composed of hundreds of ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tempest was destroyed in 232 BBY during the Battle of Kur when the Eye of the Nihil, Marchion Ro, had sabotaged the Path engines of the Tempest's ships. The rest of the Tempest, including the Runner and his lieutenants, were killed when Governor Mural Veen and her soldiers from Eriadu stormed the New Elite. Ro used the Tempest's destruction as a symbol of martyrdom that aided him in assuming control over the entirety of the Nihil."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
