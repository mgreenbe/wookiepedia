It contained a relic that served as an immense power source. The relic was guarded by a heavy number of traps throughout the Sith temple, activated by pressure plates in the floor as well as touching the relic itself. Eventually, the temple was buried and a Jedi temple was constructed atop it in an effort to seal the temple's dark power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the temple was long buried, residents of the trading outpost nearby were aware of rumors and legends about it, and in 34 ABY,[source?] the outpost's residents fled when the temple was unearthed by Mika Grey, who was attempting to retrieve the relic inside before the First Order could find it. Grey was trapped inside the temple by one of its traps, until being discovered and released by Colossus residents Kazuda Xiono, Eila, Kel and CB-23 a few days later. The temple was then destroyed when Xiono accidentally activated a Sith glyph that caused it to collapse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
