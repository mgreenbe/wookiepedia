It was part of the Sy Myrthian Insurrection, when Imperial forces attempted to drive the remnants of the Condeferate army out of the area around the planet Sy Myrth and the Kreetan Narrows region after the Confederate's defeat during the Clone Wars at the hands of the Galactic Republic that preceeded the Empire. The Imperial 12th Sector Army, under the command of Admiral Adar Tallon and General Jan Dodonna, defeated the forces of the Separatist holdouts at Diado. Following the battle, the Imperial forces proceeded to emerge victorious on the world of Metalorn as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was first mentioned in 2012's The Essential Guide to Warfare, an extensive guide dedicated to the conflicts in the galaxy, written by Jason Fry and Paul R.
