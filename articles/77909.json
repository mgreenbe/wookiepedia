Bearing a terrible facial scar from the accident, Krash kept to himself in cantinas throughout Taleucema where he attempted to drink himself to death, using spice to numb the pain. It was in a cantina that Krash was approached by the Veiled Sorority to lead a kill team of four other, mixed race agents. Dedicated to the Sorority and shaking his addictions and shame, Krash carried a heavy blaster pistol and shock gloves. Well paid and given reasonable accommodations in Taeucema, Krash's men were equally loyal beings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
