The freighters The Tone and Uhuru had already assembled, along with the corvette group Hyko, and were preparing to leave for the Death Star I, when the Rebel force showed up. All ships were subsequently destroyed by Y-wings from Red Squadron and Gold Squadron and X-wings from Blue Squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, several communications satellites were stolen from Orron III's Imperial base by the bulk freighter Phoenix. These would later prove instrumental in gaining knowledge of the Death Star project. Keyan Farlander, flying a Y-wing in Red Squadron as Red Two, made a mistake which resulted in the loss of two wingmen, and his briefing officer Commander Lagrane suspended him from operations pending an official inquest regarding the incident. He was eventually returned to active duty with a warning and a compulsory visit to the flight simulators for some brushing up."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
