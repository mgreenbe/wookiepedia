Jedi help is requested on the planet Vorzyd 4. Vorzyd 4 was the most powerful planet in its system and Vorzyd 5 had to borrow much from Vorzyd 4 in order to survive. Vorzyd 5 recently built casinos and were making enough money to pay off their debt. Vorzyd 4 claims that sabotage on their planet is the fault of Vorzyd 5 and their ambitions to become the planetary power in the system. Jocasta Nu tells Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan that all the Vorzydiaks on Voryzd 4 work and children go to school and gain a day of work each year until they work full-time at age 17. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan soon make their way to Vorzyd 4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once on the planet, the Jedi are met at their landing pad by a Vorzydiak guide who would take them to Chairman Port who called for the Jedi assistance. They find out that the Vorzyd adults do nothing but work and try to improve work, and fun and games are frowned upon. Buildings and clothing are designed with function in mind and not with aesthetics. The Jedi are brought to Multycorp, and are immediately taken up a Turbolift to the twenty-fourth floor where accounting is done. Chairman Port greets the Jedi and tells them that he has deported everyone from Vorzyd 5, but the attacks continue. No one has been hurt in the attacks, but productivity has been hurt. During the first meeting with the chairman, another attack begins. The computers in the building were showing erroneous information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan worked to try to fix the computers while Qui-Gon and Chairman Port tried to calm all the workers down. The interruption of work was causing physical and mental problems to the workers. Then, all of a sudden the attack stops and everything resumes back to normal. Soon a sound is heard throughout the building signaling the end of the workday. All the laborers and Jedi soon get on shuttles that take them away from the workspace and towards the homespace. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are taken to Chairman Port's house where they meet his wife, Bryn, and expect to meet their son Grath, but are told he is working and will be home afterwards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They also discover that the youth of the planet, specifically a gang called the Freelies, do not like this and are sabotaging the factories in hope of social change.
