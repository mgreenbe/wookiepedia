Once the temple had been built by workers under the Wookiee Chewbacca, Jinn's Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, arrived on Alaris Prime and traveled from Chewbacca's camp to Shoran's camp to gather the holocron. After the holocron was placed in the temple, it slowly generated nova crystals for Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle for Alaris Prime, where the Wookiees drove the illegitimate Trade Federation presence from the moon, studies of the holocron revealed the details of the ancient grove, which was situated near a Wookiee base.
