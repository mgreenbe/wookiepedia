In 19 BBY, during the height of the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Jaccoba and his father, Tarkov, went on a hunt for the four-legged herbivorous grantaloupe, which would elevate Jaccoba to adulthood. During their hunt, Jaccoba threw a spear that missed his grantaloupe target but hit a large piece of shrubbery, creating a loud metallic echo. Tarkov scrutinized the shubbery, trying to figure out why a plant would be making a metallic sound, and discovered that the \"plant\" was actually a Separatist landing craft.
