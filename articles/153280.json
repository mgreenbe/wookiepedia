To do so, they lowered the shielding around the deployment hatch. A Mon Cal piloting a Krakana underwater fighter went kamikaze and rammed the open deployment hatch, destroying the swimmer. The head of the swimmer broke off and landed on the sea floor. Though the scientist and Lord Azard survived, the lieutenant was slumped over the controls, and if he didn't die on impact, he was killed later when Vul Isen broke the glass window of the cockpit, flooding it and drowning the lieutenant if he survived the impact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lieutenant respected the two Sith that he piloted the swimmer for.
