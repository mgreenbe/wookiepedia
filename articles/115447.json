Cutting a striking figure in the spacelanes with a broad half-moon hull, the Limulus had a distinctive tapering spar that extended aft between the engines, providing stabilization in atmosphere and housing the ship's sensors. Carrying little in the way of armor or shields, the Limulus instead relied on the immense thrust provided by its L1011.a fusial thrust ion engines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the ships were once common, especially in the core regions, the Limulus became a rare sight after the Clone Wars, with many being destroyed during the Great Jedi Purge due to their common use by Jedi Ambassadors and Jedi Sentinels. Those that survived the purge are often cobbled together with spare parts, and are in lackluster condition - though function well due to the hardiness of the design."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Older models required a hyperdrive ring for interstellar travel, but newer Limulus' contained an unassisted class 2 hyperdrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
