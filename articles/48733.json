When he found out that Solo, a Human whom he had long ago sworn a life debt to, had been kidnapped, he immediately halted the ceremony and prepared to depart the planet in Solo's starship, the Millennium Falcon. Although he intended to go alone, his cousins Jowdrrl, Dryanta, and Shoran insisted on accompanying him, asserting that his entire family was responsible for the life debt and that it would be too dangerous a mission to go on alone. Lumpawarrump was eager to complete his hrrtayyk at his father's side and joined the strike team immediately prior to their departure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The team went first to Esau's Ridge on Tholatin and obtained valuable information on the Duskhan League and the Koornacht Cluster in which they lived, information that was secretly channeled to them by the clandestine New Republic Intelligence agency Alpha Blue. They afterward proceeded directly to the Koornacht Cluster and were able to rescue Solo with the aid of the Fallanassi adept Enara. Shoran was killed, and Lumpawarrump completed his Hrrtayyk. They then brought Solo and Shoran's corpse to the Intrepid, a starship of the New Republic Fifth Battle Group, where the former was put in a bacta tank and the latter taken to a morgue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
