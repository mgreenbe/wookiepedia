Flight jackets were manufactured with special materials that allowed them to withstand high temperatures, though they had their limits. Poe Dameron, an ace pilot for the Resistance wore a Resistance fighter jacket, a specialized type of flight jacket. After he escaped with the First Order stormtrooper Finn in a stolen Special Forces TIE fighter, Finn claimed the jacket when the fighter crashed and he could find only the jacket, but not Dameron, whom he assumed killed in the crash. He used the jacket for shade and later took to wearing it. When the two met up again, Finn tried to return it, but Dameron told him to keep it, as he felt it suited him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
