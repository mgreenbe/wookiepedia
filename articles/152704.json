The crime leader Jabba the Hutt sent his two favorite smugglers, Han Solo and Chewbacca to Gamorr to pick up more guards. Their primary point of contact was this farmer, and they required a translator to negotiate. When the smugglers landed, Solo made the mistake of assuming the farmer was male, and insulted her. She was about to kill him when TC-72 apologized on behalf of the uncouth smuggler. After more negotiations, the two smugglers departed with the guards and a package of snoruuks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a typical Gamorrean sow, she tended the farm.
