It never rained and there weren't any oceans, though there were several extremely large salt flats. It would become hot during the midday hours, making it dangerous for unprotected Humans. At night the temperature was cold, and protective clothing was required. There was only one city, located near the spaceport. It was built largely underground to escape the extremes of temperature. This world was assumed by the galaxy to be populated entirely by droids of a thousand different varieties. Many of the droids were of Imperial manufacture, but some were of unknown design."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
