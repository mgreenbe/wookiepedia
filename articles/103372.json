This dart was a favorite among bounty hunters who wanted to capture rather than kill their targets. The toxin found on this dart affected the nervous system, causing grogginess or paralysis. The bounty hunter Mira was known to use this type of weapon towards the end of the Dark Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
