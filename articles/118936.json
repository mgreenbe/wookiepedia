Selected as a Padawan by a Jedi Master, Morn succumbed to the dark side of the Force during his training and stole his master's Force-imbued helmet before fleeing Coruscant and the long arm of the Jedi High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Discovering a small planet inhabited by a primitive society, Morn established himself as the species' ruler after subduing those who might oppose him and conquering the native tribes. As absolute ruler, Morn collected a hefty tax and ordered his people to raid the ships of wayward travelers and bring him the spoils. Unable to find a worthy apprentice, Morn descended into self-obsession and viewed himself as much more than a mere Dark Jedi. Aspiring to rebuild the Sith Empire, he continued to search for an apprentice to no avail. While Morn's physical body died and was entombed within a massive crypt by his followers, Morn was able to transcend death and retain his identity as a wraith, taking the form of a bas-relief on the walls of his tomb waiting for wayward visitors to unearth him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Millennia passed before a Force-sensitive stumbled upon the fallen Jedi's resting place. Drawing the group deeper into the tomb and feeding off their Force-sensitive member's power, Morn hoped to trick the Forceful individual into donning the ancient helm of his former master. Leading the group to the helm, the Forceful individual refused the advances of the spirit and destroyed the helmet, destroying Morn's connection to the world of the living and casting him forever into the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
