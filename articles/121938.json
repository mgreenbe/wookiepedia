Before the Battle of Scarif, General Sotorus Ramda asked Lieutenant Berretic, his aide, to send a request up through the oversector until it was acknowledged. Ramda made it clear, however, not to send the request to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, as Tarkin was very close to Emperor Palpatine and that they always needed to demonstrate their best towards Palpatine, and so ordered Berretic to instead send the request to one of the sector admirals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
