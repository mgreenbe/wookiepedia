They tried to dissuade the Jedi Order from intervening, and refused to cooperate with the Jedi taskforce led by Sarrissa Jeng. The Jedi did not wait for the Commune's diplomatic efforts, and began negotiations themselves. After the negotiations were cut short by blaster fire, several hostages and all of the hijackers ended up dead. Loset blamed the Jedi and their \"lightsaber diplomacy\" for the standoff's violent end, expressing the opinion that the Gotals could have handled the standoff better themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
