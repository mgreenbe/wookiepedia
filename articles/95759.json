Skywalker, who was requested by Vedo and Jool, Screeger reminded Skywalker that he owed him for telling him that Sith scientist Vul Isen, whom Skywalker was hunting, was on Daluuj. However, only one of Isen's former labs was there, and Skywalker refused to pay him as Isen himself wasn't present before moving in to see Vedo, reminding him that they were invited. Screeger wasn't bothered, and decided to let Skywalker pass, before correcting that only he was invited and causing a door to fall from the ceiling, cutting off Cade from his companions and disappearing into the ground. Several security droids then attacked him, as Vedo wanted to test his skills, but he easily dispatched them with his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
