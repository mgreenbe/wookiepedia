It had a prior maintenance problem with its rear hip, which was ultimately aggravated during the Pacification of Salline when it took a missile to the location approximately 800 meters from the government building and forced it to remain behind and act as an elevated gun platform, providing 180 degree coverage fire via sweeping its neck."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
