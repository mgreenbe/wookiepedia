The H'Lokk Consortium infected the droids with a virus that instructed them to sabotage the settlers' colonization efforts. The virus was flawed, however, and began to delete the non-violent programing in the droids. The droids infected went on a killing spree, in which the settlers lost 40% of their people. However, within a week the droids were disposed of, halting H'Lokk's plans. The revolt started Bakuran distrust of them and lawful requirement of visiting droids to wear restraining bolts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
