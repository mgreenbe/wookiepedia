Usually fired through the arm or hand, it could blast a large radius vaporizing anyone who got too close to it. Even those who escaped direct contact with the blast would be pushed asunder by the power's backlash."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using Force Destruction was a very exhausting power requiring a great deal of focus and concentration and could only be used a few times without requiring the user to rest. Jerec was the most famous person to have used this ability, applying it against Kyle Katarn in the Valley of the Jedi. Boc Aseca was also known to have used this Force power. A variant identical to this power and used by Jedi more often than Sith is the ability known as Force Burst, where the user would unleash a telekinetic blast by releasing the stored up Force energy in their body."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Practitioners"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Darth Vader appears to wield a power similar to Force Destruction in Splinter of the Mind's Eye, the ability is actually called \"kinetite.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Similarly, Vader seems to be able to wield a similar power in Soulcalibur IV, though it is under the names \"Force Cannon\" and \"Force Eruption\".
