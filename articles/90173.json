One Boss who did not use militiagungs was Boss Gallo, who refused to take part in the fighting until his city, Otoh Sancture, was destroyed by half-wild Bursas. Gallo would later find out the bursas were sent by Boss Rogoe, the warlord manipulating the war, who feared that Gallo would be too powerful a force should he enter the war. Gallo then built an army of militiagungs with the help of Captain Marsune, a reformed rogue, and proceeded to resolve the issues causing the Gungan tribes to go to war with each other. Eventually Gallo had a large enough army to invade Spearhead, Rogoe's base, and defeat the tyrant. The battle ended the war and resulted in the formation of the Gungan Grand Army and the building of Otoh Gunga which was built on Spearhead's ruins."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Invasion of Naboo"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Swamp Battles"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three millennia later, Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation.

The droid army reached the city with ease and killed all of the Gungans there, including the militiagungs defending the city, except for Boss Ganne, whom Maul used a mind trick on to lead them to the Rellias Straits, the entrance to Otoh Gunga.

The army started the battle with their fambaa shield generators, which prevented the battle droids from successfully attacking the Gungans for a short time, but the droid forces eventually got past the shields and began to kill the militiagungs. The militiagungs continued to fight the battle droids, but began losing the battle and suffered even more casualties when the shield generators were taken out, allowing the heavy machinery of the Federation to fire upon the Gungans. General Ceel eventually had to order a retreat into the swamps. However the Trade Federation droids began rounding up the militiagungs who hadn't escaped in time, including Jar-Jar Binks, Roos Tarpals and General Ceel.

The reinforcements raised the morale of the Republic soldiers and turned the tide of the battle briefly. However, Tamson used the Confederacy's trident ships to create whirlpools to confuse the Republic soldiers. The Separatists seized the opportunity and killed and captured many Gungans. Many of these captives were kept in prison camps until the arrest of Prince Lee-Char. The prince's execution nearly took place, but Nossor Ri betrayed Separatists and intervened, saving the Prince.

Rish Loo, a Gungan minister, secretly allied himself with the Confederacy and manipulated Lyonie, the Boss of the Gungan capital, Otoh Gunga, into preparing for war against the Naboo people. Boss Lyonie had a hypnotic necklace planted on him by Loo. The Separatists were planning an invasion of Naboo and were going to use the deceived Gungans into fighting with them. Senator Jar Jar Binks, concerned by Lyonie's rallying of the militiagungs, invited Anakin Skywalker and Amidala, then a Senator, to resolve the problem. Skywalker immediately noticed Lyonie was acting strangely and discovered the necklace controlling him. The necklace was crushed and Lyonie returned to his senses. He went to confront Rish Loo, whom upon being discovered stabbed Lyonie and fled, with Skywalker in pursuit. With Boss Lyonie injured, Binks]impersonated him and spoke to the gathered militiagungs, talking them down from war. General Grievous then landed a Confederacy invasion force, and held a private meeting with Jar Jar (who he thought was Lyonie) to find out why the invasion was cancelled. Amidala contacted General Tarpals during this time and suggested deactivating the droid army. Grievous then worked out that Binks was not Lyonie and emerged from the meeting, enraged at discovering his army was deactivated. The militiagungs ordered him to surrender, but Grievous simply attacked the militiagungs with his lightsabers. Several militiagungs were killed before Tarpals attacked Grievous with an electropole. Grievous managed to stab the experienced militiagung, who in his last moments stabbed Grievous with his spear, giving the militiagungs a chance to capture Grievous. Grievous was held in captivity until Count Dooku revealed he had captured Skywalker and was willing to trade for Grievous.
