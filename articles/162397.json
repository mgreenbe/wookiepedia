The droid's blaster arms were enlarged and a higher-yield blaster was used, which meant that they required more energy to operate. Due to this, the W-series rarely used their shield generators, which could be very energy-consuming. This was also their weakness: they were vulnerable to blasterfire like any other battle droid without their shields. Despite this setback, however, the W-series was nonetheless an efficient unit on the battlefield with their enlarged, rapid-fire blasters. They were most notably deployed at the Battle of Geonosis. They were succeeded later on in the Clone Wars by the Q-series droideka."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
