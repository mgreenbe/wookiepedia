Ven was operating an E-Web heavy repeating blaster, but was wounded when an artillery round hit him. Clone Commander Levet replaced him on the turret after he fell unconscious. His fellow clone troopers gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and other field medical procedures to keep him alive until the medical teams were able to arrive. Etain was able to determine that he was alive even though his brothers could not find a pulse. Ven was then taken to medical care."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ven was a clone trooper introduced in the 2007 novel Republic Commando: True Colors, written by Karen Traviss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
