Storm cannons consisted of a twin blaster cannon attached to a mobile ground vehicle. While ideally attached to a tank-like vehicle, Storm cannons were in reality most often attached to civilian vehicles like farming vehicles rather than military ones. A perpetual problem was that the energy source of the cannon was a powerplant that was so big that it often cause problems in relation to the vehicle the gun was attached to. While storm guns were supposed to have a crew of four, they most typically had just two: a driver and a gunner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
