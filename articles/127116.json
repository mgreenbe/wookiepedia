At the Colossus, racers had to fly through all of a course's sky rings in order to have completed a race, and the first through all of the rings was the victor. Similar technology called \"Eyes\" were also used in a Gauntlet race on Corellia, and in the Dragonfire Circuit on Coruscant. The fourth stage of the Platform Classic, in which racers glided down from the edge of the atmosphere, began with a ring designed to shut racers' engines off, and ended with a ring that would switch them back on."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
