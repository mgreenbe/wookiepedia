Formed under the intense heat and pressure of the lava world, the end product resembled the heart of the tanray, hence its name. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, surveyor Jo Kelsev gave a spacer one of these crystals as a reward for activating all the markers he had placed in regions across Mustafar. This particular tanray heart crystal was mounted on a black colored base, so that it could be displayed as a trophy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
