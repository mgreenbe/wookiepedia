They dug a number of tunnels and nests throughout the rocky plains and marshes of Bogano, working in large packs. They were preyed upon by both the bog rats and splox, with the latter often luring boglings out of the burrows to be attacked by bog rats, allowing the splox to enter the burrow and eat the bogling's eggs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boglings reproduced by laying eggs, which they hatched in underground nests."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While their bodies were generally furry, boglings had bare feet and legs which they evolved to run on, allowing them to navigate Bogano's rocky and marsh-like terrain, as well as to quickly jump, change direction and escape predators. The fur on the rest of their body compensated for heat loss though the feet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bogling behavior centered around defense against the many predators on Bogano. Some were even found dead fighting against an Oggdo, desperately trying to defend its family. Boglings spent around one-third of their lives digging a tunnel network beneath Bogano's surface, to connect their nests and as a defense against predators. They collaborated in large packs called \"heckles,\" with each bogling able to dig up to five meters a day."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boglings first appeared in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, developed by Respawn Entertainment.
