The cruiser was sent to capture up one of two Ton-Falk-class escort carriers Prowler that was disabled by two TIE Defenders. The cruiser would come under attack from two pairs of Corellian corvettes, Sharky and Spear followed by X-wings and A-wings. The attack was thwarted by the TIE Defenders and the cruiser boarded and captured the carrier. Both ships would then jump to Hyperspace as the Rebel frigate Egale arrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
