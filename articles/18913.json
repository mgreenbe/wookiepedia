Bolstyngars used a pair of auditory clusters to help them locate their prey, but these hypertympanic clusters also gave the bolstyngar the ability to hear virtually every sound the jungle made. Thus, the average bolstyngar was continually bombarded by sound, and it often preyed on those creatures that annoyed them the most."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
