The power typically required extended concentration by the user, normally lasting an hour or more. It was not completely unheard of for a user to spend as many as 20 hours focusing with this power to remove the most potent of poisons. The power was limited to only removing the present and future effects of the poisons in one's system; past damage was not healed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
