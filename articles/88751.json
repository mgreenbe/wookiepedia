She was also a secret security officer at the palace. In 4 ABY, she attempted to arrest Mara Jade, disguised as a dancer named Arica, when Jade tried to grab a blaster from one of the palace guards.

The attack was repulsed successfully by Wedge Antilles' group. Karrde discovered her treachery and wanted to eliminate her immediately. However, Booster Terrik managed, with difficulty and at great expense, to persuade Karrde to leave her alive long enough to use her to feed misinformation to Isard and ultimately set the stage for the Battle of Thyferra.
