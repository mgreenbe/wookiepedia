In 19 BBY, General Grievous, Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies, assigned him to the planet Nelvaan, where he became the leader of the local separatist facility, accompanied by four other Skakoan combat engineers and an army of B1-Series battle droids and B2 super battle droids. In order to keep the base powered, he constructed a siphon generator, which absorbed the warmth from the planet while reducing the planet to a wintry state. He then moved his troops against Rokrul, a local village populated by the native humanoid species, the Nelvaanians. The Skakoan ordered the droid army to empty the village of every adult male, leaving only the women and children."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Skakoans began experimenting on the captured Nelvaanians immediately. The purpose of their experimentations was to study the effectiveness of hybrid droid-organic technology, and also to convert the captive Nelvaanians into cyborg mutant super-soldiers. Inspired by his own success as a cyborg, General Grievous planned to replace the battle droids with the mutant Nelvaanians. After being individually transformed into enormous mutant cyborgs, the Nelvaanians were fitted with control collars. Grievous, impatient for his new soldiers, ordered the specimens to be delivered to him as soon as the last Nelvaanian was transformed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Nelvaan"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Head scientist performed the last procedure himself watching as the Nelvaanian began to transform. However, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker had penetrated the laboratory and defeated the droid perimeter guards. The main Techno Union scientist was shocked when he realized that a Jedi had entered his laboratory, and ordered his henchman to unleash the specimens under remote control. His underlings objected, saying that they weren't battle-ready yet, but the Head scientist ignored them, ordering the cyborg warriors to attack against Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Head scientist watched as the mutant Nelvaanians attacked the Jedi, who tried in vain to convince them that he was not their enemy. However, the last specimen Harvos, whose control collar had not yet been fitted to him, was able to break out from his transformation chamber and show Skywalker that the control collars were the reason for the hostility of Nelvaanians. The Head scientist could only watch helplessly as Harvos and Skywalker freed all of the mutants from their collars. The specimens then started to rampage through the base, destroying battle droids and freeing their comrades, while Skywalker headed to destroy the siphon generator. Upon realizing that he himself was in mortal danger, the Head scientist fled to the exit of the base. He and his fellow Skakoans ran up the stairs that led outside, as the furious horde of Nelvaanians followed just behind them."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Unsuccessful escape and death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Skakoans managed to reach their Hardcell-class interstellar transport\n, which was located near the exit on the surface. However, Anakin Skywalker, who had just destroyed the siphon generator at the cost of his prosthetic arm, climbed towards the ship. The Skakoan underlings attempted to defend themselves, but the enraged Jedi Knight used the Force to disarm two of the engineers, whom he then hurled into the horde of Nelvaanians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The remaining scientists attempted to retreat, but were stopped when Skywalker destroyed the ramp to the ship. As a result of the destruction of the siphon generator, a geyser burst from the ground, killing the last of the Skakoans, except for the main scientist. While Skywalker had his back turned, the Skakoan pulled out a blaster pistol and aimed it at the Jedi Knight. Turning quickly, Skywalker spotted him and in his rage, used the Force to crush the pressure suit of the helpless Skakoan. This caused an explosive decompression, which killed the Head scientist instantly."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "After death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The death of the main Techno Union scientist and the destruction of the facility put an end to Grievous's plans for new elite soldiers.
