Knowing that trying to force the Queen to give up Nire and/or arresting her for treason would result in Naboo openly turning against the Empire in spite of it being his homeworld, Palpatine resorted to alternate means to get rid of the Rebel general: Instead of having her arrested for treason, Palpatine assigned an unidentified Imperial spacer to help him manipulate the Queen without any blame falling on the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "First, the spacer had to create, with the help of a mercenary leader named Vurrha Jantsk, a datadisk that implicated the Rebel Alliance in an alleged plot against the Queen.

They subsequently had to go talk to the Queen, who was not yet convinced of the Rebel Alliance's guilt.

The adventurer agreed to fly to Kashyyyk and investigate the whereabouts of the Wookiees. The Queen had chosen the right being: not only did the adventurer find Drrlirm in the Kashyyykian jungles and escort him to Kachirho, but tracked the other two Wookiees to the Imperial prison on Dathomir where they had been brought and helped them escape from the planet and through the Imperial blockade. As a token of her appreciation for his help, Kylantha presented the adventurer with an old, rehauled ARC-170 starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, the Queen invited the Ewok Chief Chirpa and his tribe to come to Naboo during their Festival of Love."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic commotion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mikdanyell Guh'rantt, the mayor of Mos Eisley on Tatooine, once contacted Kylantha and several regional governors across the galaxy about the increasing commotion that plagued his city.
