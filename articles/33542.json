Some time around the Battle of Hoth, a pivotal conflict in the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and Alliance to Restore the Republic, this probe droid was damaged and stranded, still in its transport pod, near the Saila Na system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Battle of Hospital in 3 ABY, the droid became a target of Aeron Azzameen after she learned of its existence and a mission to capture the droid by slicing communications systems. She wished to capture the damaged droid to utilize its sensors and components against her family's conflict between their company and their rivals, Viraxo Industries. To retrieve the droid, she sent her brother Ace and family droid MK-09 in the family's YT-2000 light freighter Otana. The pirate transport Pelican also intended to scavenge the droid; accompanied by several R-41 Starchaser fighters, this transport reached the damaged probe droid first. Before they were able to leave, however, the Otana destroyed the entire group and Ace took the probe for himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After retrieving the probe droid, the Otana made its way to the civilian checkpoint orbital platform Tinoon Station, cargo in tow. Fearing detection, Ace planned to illegally pass through the checkpoint and escape the system. The arrival of a pirate force consisting of Marauder-class corvettes and Y-wing starfighters provided ample distraction, but Ace challenged the incoming force. After a victorious skirmish between the pirates, the Otana, and the Golan II Space Defense SpaceGun Tinoon Station, the Otana and its probe droid pod payload were allowed to pass without inspection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
