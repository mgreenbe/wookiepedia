The members of the Imperial Army's Stormtrooper Corps served on the frontline as elite shock troops, and their loyalty to the Empire was absolute as a result of their training. The stormtrooper armor that they wore consisted of white plastoid plates over a black body glove, and their standard weapon was the E-11 blaster rifle. In addition to the standard trooper, various specialized units such as scout troopers and snowtroopers comprised the ranks of the Stormtrooper Corps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stormtroopers served the Empire since its inception at the end of the Clone Wars when the Sith Lord Darth Sidious declared himself Galactic Emperor. The Galactic Republic was supplanted by the Empire, and the clone troopers who formed the backbone of the Grand Army of the Republic became the first generation of Imperial stormtroopers. During the early years of the Imperial Era, the cloning operation on Kamino was shut down as the Empire turned to conscription and recruitment in order to fill the stormtrooper ranks. The remaining clones were retired from service due to their rapid aging, their legacy inherited by natural-born humans who were also trained to render total allegiance to the Emperor and his New Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bucketheads were spread throughout the galaxy during the Emperor's reign, from the Imperial capital of Coruscant in the Core Worlds, to occupied planets such as Lothal and Tatooine in the Outer Rim Territories. They fought many battles against the forces of the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War, including the Battle of Scarif, the Battle of Hoth, and the Battle of Endor. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Princess Leia Organa was captured by stormtroopers who served under Darth Vader, the Emperor's Sith apprentice. However, Organa was rescued by Luke Skywalker and Han Solo who, disguised as stormtroopers, infiltrated the first Death Star.

After losing the Battle of Jakku, the Empire signed the Imperial Instruments of Surrender and the Galactic Concordance, and its stormtrooper forces were consequently demobilized as part of the New Republic's terms for peace. Despite this, a number of Imperial remnants continued to make use of stormtroopers as soldiers or mercenaries in the Outer Rim, including Moff Gideon's faction as well as the remnants on Morak.

Under the leadership of the Jedi Knights, clone troopers fought the droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems across the galaxy. Though they were loyal to the Jedi as well as the Republic, the clones were secretly programmed to obey Order 66, a military directive authorizing the complete liquidation of the Jedi Order. With the exception of a handful of survivors, including Jedi Generals Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, most of the Jedi were killed by their own troops at the command of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith who controlled the Galactic Senate through his public persona of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Soldiers of the Empire"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Ending the clone trooper program"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone troopers enforced Emperor Palpatine's reign during the early days of the Imperial Era, having become the first generation of Imperial stormtroopers.

Although Palpatine had supported the of the Kaminoan government's clone trooper program during his final years as Supreme Chancellor, his priorities shifted away from the expensive cloning production after becoming the Galactic Emperor. The Prime Minister of Kamino, Lama Su, maintained that the clone troopers possessed unrivaled combat skills and discipline. In addition, Lama Su believed that his clones were critical to the security of the fledgling Empire. Despite this, Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin was confident that the Empire would be better served by a force of non-clone conscripts, which he saw as a cost-effective way to enforce order in the galaxy. In addition, the clones' accelerated aging process was further incentive for the Empire to decommission its clone units in favor of natural-born humans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Tarkin supported conscription over cloning, clone troopers were initially retained by the Imperial Army that replaced the Grand Army of the Republic, but rumors spread throughout the ranks that the cloning facilities on Kamino had been shut down. By the later Imperial Era, it was rumored the Stormtrooper Corps had been established within the Imperial Army by a group of former clone commandos.

Like other servants of the Imperial regime, stormtroopers referred to Vader by the title of lord. As learned by the Free Ryloth Movement, the loyalty the stormtroopers had towards the Sith Lord bordered on worship. Though Vader enjoyed a rapport with his stormtroopers, Vader was still willing to execute the troops under his command as he did with many other Imperials. During Rae Sloane's time as a junior officer, a joke spread throughout the ranks that Vader only kept stormtroopers on the bridge of his starships to drag out the bodies of those he executed. However, the joke lost all humor quickly, as Vader's wrath became all too real for many Imperial personnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, stormtroopers came to represent the face of the Empire, but the soldiers were opposed by a growing rebellion that sought to restore democratic rule to the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Scarif was the first major rebel victory of the Galactic Civil War, between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Following the Rebel victory at Scarif, Vader commanded a battalion of stormtroopers, who served him loyally, to capture Princess Leia Organa's Alderaanian corvette Tantive IV over Tatooine. Additionally, Stormtroopers were also used to arrest dissidents on numerous worlds including Akiva and Zeitooine, while they were also deployed to other conflicts the Empire found itself in; stormtroopers and Imperial machines quickly put down a long-lasting uprising on Koshaga, and fought on the frontlines of the Mandalorian Civil War, and combated members of the Grysk Hegemony during the Empire's conflict against them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For service in the Galactic Civil War, stormtroopers saw action against the Rebellion forces during engagements like the Battle of Garel, the Battle of Atollon, the Battle of Hoth, the Mid Rim Retreat, and the Battle of Endor. During the fighting at Endor in 4 ABY, stormtroopers fought on the ground of the forest moon against Rebels and Ewoks, while others were stationed aboard the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station before it was destroyed. In the immediate aftermath of the battle, Rebel General Han Solo led an assault against a surviving Endor outpost staffed by stormtroopers, while stormtroopers on Imperial capital world of Coruscant fought in the planet's civil war that began directly after the death of Palpatine at Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though disorganized in the wake of the Rebel victory at Endor, Imperial loyalists rallied around high-ranking officials such as Grand Admiral Rae Sloane and Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax.

During the Iron Blockade, Joval Rykk was a ten-year veteran of the Stormtrooper Corps, though he felt no loyalty to the Empire. By this time, stormtroopers were taken out of Academy training early. As the war continued, many stormtroopers were captured and sent to the New Republic capital of Chandrila as prisoners of war. On one occasion, the New Republic public relations official Olia Choko personally stopped New Republic soldiers from parading stormtrooper prisoners through the streets of Hanna City.

The terms of the peace treaty included the end of hostilities between the Empire and the New Republic, the dissolution of the Imperial government, and the prohibition of the recruitment and training of stormtroopers. Additionally, the Empire was forced to dismantle its network of Imperial Academies. However, not all of the Empire's remnants adhered to the treaty's conditions. Though some stormtroopers such as Terex and Corlac deserted their posts, the remaining Imperial forces on Jakku continued to fight for several months, refusing to accept the Empire's defeat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the years that followed the civil war's conclusion, all that remained of the former Galactic Empire were mercenaries\u2014\"Remnant Stormtroopers\"\u2014and warlords clinging to the last vestiges of Imperial power in the Outer Rim Territories where the New Republic held little influence. Despite the restrictions that the New Republic imposed on the defeated Empire, stormtroopers retained their battle-worn armor, making them look like an undisciplined mercenary force. Nevertheless, some of these mercenary troopers worked alongside more pristine stormtroopers in remnants of the fallen Empire. In particular, stormtroopers served with Imperial remnants like Moff Gideon's faction or the outpost on Morak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 9 ABY, Gideon's remnant controlled an Imperial base on the planet Nevarro that was staffed by stormtroopers and other Imperials. A mercenary group of stormtroopers also acted as security for an Imperial remnant facility in Nevarro city, where they also served as bodyguards for \"the Client\" and Doctor Pershing. The Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin killed many stormtroopers while rescuing the Force-sensitive foundling Grogu. In the aftermath of the engagement, Djarin's Mandalorian tribe was nearly wiped out by the Imperial remnant, which also occupied the city with its stormtroopers. When Djarin returned to Nevarro with his allies to kill the Client, the Imperial and his personal stormtrooper guard were instead killed when Gideon ordered his personal guard of death troopers to fire into the city's cantina. Gideon was then reinforced by a battalion of stormtroopers from the Imperial base to recapture the Child from Djarin. Though the Mandalorian and his allies were forced into the sewers, they ultimately triumphed over the stormtroopers, though their victory came at the cost of the Ugnaught Kuiil and IG-series assassin droid IG-11, the latter having scarified himself to take out a stormtrooper platoon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though he had lost control of Nevarro, Gideon escaped the planet to lead his remnant from his Class 546 Cruiser, which many stormtroopers and Imperial officers were stationed aboard. They also maintained control of Nevarro's Imperial base until Djarin returned for repairs to his ship, the Razor Crest. The Mandalorian and his allies infiltrated the base to detonate it, fighting past the stormtroopers to escape in time. As he fled with his jetpack to protect Grogu, his allies, Magistrate Greef Karga, former shock trooper Cara Dune, and \"the Mythrol,\" escaped from scout troopers and Outland TIE fighters aboard a Trexler 906 Armored Marauder, taking out all but two of the starfighters until Djarin arrived in the Razor Crest.

Agent Alexsandr Kallus defended the stormtroopers for their allegiance to the Empire, wheras Clone Captain Rex took the opportunity to disparage them as an inferior class of soldier compared to the clone troopers they replaced. Din Djarin also held stormtroopers in low regard, being unimpressed by Migs Mayfeld's military background despite Ranzar Malk's assurance that the Imperial veteran was skilled in marksmanship. Mayfeld, an ex-sniper who participated in Operation: Cinder, retorted that he was not a stormtrooper.

Defying the Galactic Concordance, the First Order recruited and mobilized new stormtroopers. The new stormtroopers were influenced by the ideas of Brendol Hux, a former commandant at the Arkanis Academy. The First Order's stormtroopers were equipped with sleeker armor and powerful weaponry. Among the Order's agents was Terex, who had served as an Imperial stormtrooper. The former Imperial Stormtrooper Commander Ruthford, who had served under Darth Vader during a battle against the Benathy, served as a captain in the First Order.

Imperial cadets were shipped off to Imperial Academies, and subjected to rigorous training programs in order to produce highly trained shock troopers fiercely loyal to the Empire.
