They attended a classified meeting of the Alliance's leadership in a Rebel safe house on the planet Zastiga shortly after the Battle of Hoth, where Admiral Gial Ackbar revealed that the Empire was building a second Death Star above the moon of Endor. Nantz discussed with the others the manpower that would be required to attack the Death Star, and then pointed out that a distraction would be needed in order for the Alliance's forces to gather without drawing Imperial attention. Princess Leia Organa offered to provide such a distraction by leading a decoy mission to the Corva sector. The distraction was a success, allowing the Alliance fleet to gather and eventually destroy the Death Star at the Battle of Endor.
