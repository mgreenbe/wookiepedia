They had intense psychic abilities that they could augment with unique stone columns. These unique near-Humans possessed potent mental abilities which they would use to probe the minds of other beings and see their desires. Once this was done, they developed a relationship with the individual at which point they developed a psychic link with the person. Through this link, they would create illusory environments which were highly desirable to the individual. This was done with only one purpose in mind: to leech the mental life energies of the person to replenish their own. Though they were usually powerful telepaths, some well skilled mind-witches also developed telekinetic powers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Civil War, mind-witches were all but extinct. They were present in many tales around the galaxy, but their existence was thought to be a myth. The last known mind-witch was S'ybll, who tried to seduce Luke Skywalker. However, he was able to break through her illusions and escape. S'ybll died when Luke drew his lightsaber to him and accidentally stabbed her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Essential Reader's Companion contains a dramatis personae for The Life of Luke Skywalker that lists \"S'ybll, mind witch (human female).\" In contrast to this claim that mind-witches were Human, The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia states that mind-witches were a separate humanoid species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
