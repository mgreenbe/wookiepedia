Skywalker wine, mentioned by Lucas at this event, was also added to The Holocron following the event. With the planet's addition to the Holocron, The Essential Atlas Online Companion introduced the D'Nile system. Jason Fry later confirmed from a provided list of systems, which included the D'Nile system, that D'Nile was an established world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
