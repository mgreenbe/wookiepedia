It shared its name with the Core world Brentaal IV. In 14 BBY, the vessel was attached to Rampart Station, an Imperial marshaling depot for supply ships bound for the planet Geonosis, where the Imperial battle station later known as the Death Star was being constructed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That year, a rebel cell created several fake holotransmissions that made it appear as if Rampart Station was under attack from a warship and supporting starfighters. The group then sent the transmissions to the nearby Imperial facility Sentinel Base, in an attempt to draw away the base's ships. As part of the fake distress signal that was received at Sentinel, the likeness of Rampart's Lieutenant Thon reported that the station had lost communication with the Brentaal. Sentinel's commanding officer, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, ultimately deducted the transmissions were fake, and managed to successfully defend his base when the rebels subsequently attacked it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Brentaal was mentioned in the novel Tarkin, which was released in 2014 and written by James Luceno."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
