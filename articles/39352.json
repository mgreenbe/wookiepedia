Donovan himself was captured and imprisoned in the Deflarian bunker. The Deflarians then crashed a ship of the same model than Donovan's to cover the theft of the cargo. CorSec Inspector Cora was tasked by Captain Jark to lead the investigation. Cora hired a spacer who managed to find the location of the bunker. The spacer infiltrated the bunker and found the imprisoned Captain Donovan. The spacer therefore killed Vinros, several Deflarian henchmen and a Deflarian underboss to free Donovan. Captain Jark later discovered that Donovan was betrayed by a CorSec agent, Jori, who sold Donovan's flight schedule to the Deflarians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Donovan was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
