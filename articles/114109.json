RDPO was charged with stockpiling equipment and ensuring safe supply lines for frontline resupply from medical supplies to ammunition. For better efficiency, reinforcements typically accompanied transports which allowed for convoy security."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In events when only resupply is needed or approved, the supplies were normally transported and escorted by privately contract logistical units, or in some cases, units staffed by recovering clone troopers. When resupply runs were especially dangerous, RDPO contracted convicted or accused smugglers to transport the cargo in exchange for amnesty from their crimes. Separatist Alliance forces mercilessly harassed supply lines, making the replenishment of supplies to the front lines dangerous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Department of Naval Procurement was under RDPO, and was responsible for obtaining starships, supplies, and new technology for the Republic Navy under the oversight of the Galactic Senate's Procurement Panel of the Naval Subcommittee. Since the start of the Clone Wars, the Procurement Panel accepted designs and contracts from several corporations including Sienar Fleet Systems, Kuat Drive Yards, Rendili StarDrive, Corellian Engineering Corporation, Subpro Corporation, Incom Corporation, and Cygnus Spaceworks. Several major projects in the prototype stage from the start of the war were the IPV-2C Stealth Corvette, the Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor, the Theta-class T-2c shuttle, the Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter, the Victory project, and Project Supercharger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
