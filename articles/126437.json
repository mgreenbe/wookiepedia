It originated from Skann in the Astal sector, distilled in rock basins by local farmers from that planet's surplus of Dust-Corn and Dry Gene Wheat. Good quality Likker was rare even on its planet of origin, primarily distilled on smaller rural farms; most traders only encountered an inferior quality Likker found in Skann's spacers' bar. Kina Margath acquired a small supply of quality Skannbult Likker for her establishment, where a double measure went for as much as twenty-five credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
