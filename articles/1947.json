Sometime prior to 4 ABY, an 84-U rifle fell into a pit underneath the throne room of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt's palace, located on the planet Tatooine. Later on, Jabba had a poacher and four of the poacher's Yuzzum captives thrown into the pit to be executed by the large, predatory rancor that lived within. However, as the rest of the party was being devoured, one of the Yuzzums, named Wam Lufba, found the 84-U hunting rifle, grabbed it, and fled into the rancor's holding pen. A great marksman, Lufba killed three of Jabba's guards with the blaster rifle. Pote Snitkin, a Skrilling gun-runner in the employment of Jabba, witnessed Lufba using the 84-U to great effect and, impressed by the Yuzzum's abilities, rescued Lufba from the pen. Following his escape from the rancor pit, Lufba became Snitkin's henchman and was given the nickname \"Blam\" for his skill with a blaster; Lufba also continued to carry the 84-U hunting rifle that had saved his life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2005, the 84-U hunting rifle was first mentioned in the winning entry for Wam Lufba, written by Tim Veekhoven under the alias \"Sompeetalay,\" in the StarWars.com Hyperspace contest What's The Story?

However, no source has confirmed the 84-U to be the rifle Lufba is wielding in the film.
