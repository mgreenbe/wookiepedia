Due to information from an loyalist Imperial agent planted aboard the Zeplin, Din as well as the Zeplin were considered high-priority targets, as not only did they have a stolen Missile Boat and were planning to supply it to the Rebel Alliance as part of a defection, but Din also was rumored to have knowledge about the true state of the second Death Star's operative status, which would ruin the Emperor's trap at Endor should it be revealed. As such, Darth Vader in his Imperial-class Star Destroyer Garrett was sent to stop the Zeplin, the Imperial Ace and Emperor's Hand Maarek Stele was deployed with him personally leading Tau Squadron while Assault Gunboats Mu Squadron attacked the vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving at the Zeplin's location, Stele discovered that a MC80a Star Cruiser, the Link was already at the location and the meeting had already started. Stele quickly inspected the Link to discover that stolen Missile Boat was in the Cruiser. Soon a Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transport Z-Eplison 1 carrying officers launched from the Link as it jumped to Hyperspace. Stele destroyed the transport and made short work of the modified TIE Fighters, soon the TIE Interceptors engaged the Assault Gunboats and Stele eliminated them in the process. Stele then launched advanced missiles at the Zeplin's warhead launchers and advanced torpedos until the shields failed allowing the Gunboats to disable the Zeplin. While dealing with the TIE Avengers, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Garrett arrived and launched assault transport Omega 1 to board and capture the Zeplin. As the process was underway Rebel A-wings and B-wings entered the area with the A-wings to attack the transport and the B-wings attacking the Garrett. The Rebel attack was destroyed by the Garrett's own starfighters and Maarek Stele."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zeplin was captured and was to be sent to an Imperial shipyard to be examined by Imperial Intelligence, and Din detained and interrogated by Darth Vader. The interrogation revealed two primary things, first was that Grand Admiral Zaarin was fully aware of Palpatine's plans at Endor, but only intended to confer to his loyal corps with no sympathies to the Rebels, causing Din to defect. The second, and most important issue was that the Link not only escaped with the Missile Boat prototype Sealion, but with knowledge about the true status of the Death Star II. However, it was eventually cornered and captured by pursuing forces, including the Garrett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This battle takes place in the 1994 PC game Star Wars: TIE Fighter as Battle 13 mission 2, \"Capture the turncoat\".
