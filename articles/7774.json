Apatros was mostly a ramshackle town of temporary barracks made of durasteel put together by Outer Rim Oreworks to house the several hundred cortosis miners who worked on the planet. Among the miners, Apatros was commonly referred to as \"the muck-huts\". The domiciles themselves were in poor condition, as the windows, doors, and roofs were perpetually broken and a layer of dust covered the floors. Also, entire families were often forced to live in a single room. The colony and the cortosis mines were connected by a shuttle that went back and forth between the two locations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Apatros was less than a kilometer on each square side, making it possible to walk from any given building to any other structure in less than twenty standard minutes. Although all the buildings in Apatros were identical, navigating the streets was easy, as the barracks were placed in straight rows and columns. This formed a grid of streets between the uniformly spaced buildings. The streets were cleaned just enough by Outer Rim Oreworks to keep conditions sanitary, but were always cluttered with junk. Apatros only had two buildings that were dissimilar to the other structures\u2014a market, and Groshik's cantina, which lay a few hundred meters beyond the edge of the town."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Apatros was established by Outer Rim Oreworks to house the cortosis miners who worked on the planet. In the year 1003 BBY, a resident of Apatros and cortosis miner named Dessel got in a fight in the Apatros streets with three crew members of a Galactic Republic ship over a game of sabacc, killing one of them. With the help of a Neimoidian bartender named Groshik, Dessel was able to escape arrest and join the Sith army in the New Sith Wars against the Republic. After serving with distinction, his Force-sensitivity was discovered, and he eventually became Darth Bane, one of the most important and influential Dark Lords of the Sith in galactic history."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Apatros was mostly inhabited by miners working in the cortosis mines, the majority of which were Humans.
