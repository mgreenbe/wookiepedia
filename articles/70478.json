Using Herdringer's identity, Jenkes corresponded with Bossk and reluctantly allowed the Trandoshan bounty hunter to pursue his bounty. Unknown to Bossk, Jenkes sent a squad of stormtroopers called Squad Five to keep a watch on Bossk.

During the escape, Bossk was forced to leave \"Shifty\" Takkaro behind and the Dug was subsequently apprehended by Squad Five. Later at his office near Lothal Capital City's spaceport, Jenkes received news of the escape and the deaths of the three assassins from the stormtrooper TK-5331.

The third item mentioned that a surveillance droid had witnessed unusual activity in Monad Outpost. When Jenkes pressed the droid about the third item, RA-7 mentioned that a large crowd of civilians had begun congregating near the decommissioned docking bays.

Jenkes had also placed a bet on the Feeorin Warjak to win the fight. Jenkes gave authorization for the freighter to land and made arrangements for the two gladiators to be transported to Monad Outpost in an unmarked Imperial transport.

Unknown to Bossk and Ezra, Jenkes' RA-7 droid was monitoring the Imperial Enforcement DataCore and promptly notified the ISB lieutenant that his personal and military records had been accessed.

On the way to Monad, Bossk and Ezra visited Ferpil Wallaway, the Xexto pawnshop owner who worked for Jenkes and had employed Ezra to sell his tickets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Jenkes decided to kill Ferpil after determining that Bossk's local guide Ezra was connected to the Xexto pawnshop owner. In order to hide his criminal dealings, Jenkes decided to kill Ferpil and ordered his RA-7 droid to summon an unmarked armored speeder. Before leaving, he also tried to cover up his trail by destroying the protocol droid. He then enlisted the services of the two stormtroopers that had had brought the armored speeder; telling them that they were going on a classified mission. Upon arriving at Ferpil's panwshop, he killed the Xexto merchant and took the proceeds from the Gladiator Night tickets in a luggage case.

He claimed that he was determined to find the culprit behind this \"outrage.\" When one of the stormtroopers suggested calling for Imperial reinforcements, Jenkes ruled that out claiming that such a discovery would embarrass the Imperial authorities on Lothal. Instead, he told his subordinates that they could handle it alone and that they would arrest the event's organizers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After entering the box office, Jenkes murdered the Ishi Tib counting the proceeds from the ticket sales. Jenkes justified his murderous action by claiming that the Ishi Tib was reaching for a weapon.

After the stormtroopers had outlived their usefulness, Jenkes had planned to shoot them with his blaster pistol in order to cover his tracks. Before Jenkes could carry out this plan, they were ambushed by Bossk and Ezra who quickly overpowered the stormtroopers with Bossk's mortar gun. Following a short verbal confrontation with Bossk, Jenkes fled into the arena.

Bossk foiled Jenkes' attempt to frame him by using Ezra's stolen comlink to issue a challenge to the arena's competitors: Borbig Drob and Warjak. After soundly defeating the two competitors in bare-handed combat, Bossk revealed that Jenkes was actually the \"Commissioner\" and that he had been planning to steal the spectators' credit chips. In addition, Bossk revealed Jenkes' involvement in the murders of Herdringer, the pawnbroker Wallaway, and the Ishi Tib manning the box officer. Jenkes then attempted to escape the arena but was thwarted by Ezra who fired a slingshot at him.
