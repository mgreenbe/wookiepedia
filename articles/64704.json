Those blue-skinned, omnivorous critters dwelled in the planet's many dense swamps. Because of the environment in which they had evolved, the igitz were well-adapted to both land and water: while their front paws were clawed for treading on land, their hindquarters were finned, allowing it speed when in water. The igitz were a popular pet in most Gungan civilizations. A certain Gungan diplomat of the New Republic owned one. The diplomat often traveled with his pet igitz to the galactic capital of Coruscant, transporting it in a vivarium shaped like a Gungan hydrostatic bubble."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
