It featured twin power packs that doubled the carbine's ammunition capacity. Although it was known to perform adequately, the OK-98 sold poorly, so despite its large production run, the blaster carbine was discontinued by SoroSuub and they were auctioned off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The OK-98 later found new life after plans to continue the weapon were posted by an Outlaw Tech, which stated that the OK-98 could be made to draw power from both packs simultaneously.
