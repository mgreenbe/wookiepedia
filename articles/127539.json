Despite their name, they did not live in the water, but under the shade of trees, where they formed clusters that made them look like vines at first glance. They had long bodies with smooth, green skin, ending in a pointed tail with fins. Their head featured two eyes, a glowing luring apparatus, two nostrils, a mouth containing sharp fangs and a forked tongue, which the creatures occasionally flicked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day, while on a quest to find a soshinyday blobball, Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Jar Jar Binks had to cut across a cluster of slitherfish. The creatures proved hostile, frightening the adventurers' kaadus and ensnaring Binks. Unwilling to slaughter the entire cluster, Amidala shot holes in the tree canopy with her blaster, causing the slitherfish to retreat due to their innate fear of bright lights."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
