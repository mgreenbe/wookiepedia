Alongside his SE4 servant droid assistant, SE-4-17, DD-19 performed much of the maintenance work there. DD-19 earned the nickname \"the slavemaster\" because of his seemingly harsh treatment of other droids, having the authority to apply restraining bolts if a droid became unruly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DD-19 \"Overseer\" labor pool droid was first mentioned as the DD-19 \"Overseer\" Droid in The DarkStryder Campaign, a 1995 supplement for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, where it was depicted in an illustration by Doug Shuler. The 2006 reference book The New Essential Guide to Droids, written by Daniel Wallace, provided the name DD-19 \"Overseer\" labor pool droid, while the 2008 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia used the name DD-19 Overseer. The DD-19 Overseer first appeared in Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 4, a comic written by John Ostrander and pencilled by St\u00e9phane Cr\u00e9ty that was published on March 14, 2012."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
