By the year 4.3 ABY, he was employed by the Star Tours travel agency and performed maintenance on the fans in Tomorrowland Starport's hangar. F-22 possessed a cantankerous attitude, finding various things to complain about, from the factory he used to work at, to how \"kid\" droids were like currently, even down to his \"mother-in-law.\" When he had finished his job for the day, F-22 often went to the Alien Quarter Cantina. He also enjoyed listening to The Rolling Droids and drinking oil on the rocks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "F-22-RGKx was created for Tokyo Disneyland's simulator ride theme park attraction Star Tours, which opened on July 12, 1989."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
