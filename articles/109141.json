Made up of at least three Sith\u2013Imperial attack ships, Quad Victor was stationed aboard the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer War Hammer in early 138 ABY. That year, the War Hammer, under the command of the Sith Lord Darth Azard and Moff Rulf Yage, was sent to the Hutt planet of Da Soocha, which had been harboring a number of Mon Calamari refugees wanted by Krayt's Empire. In retaliation, Darth Azard gave orders\u2014relayed by Yage\u2014for the Imperial forces to deploy viral spores on Da Soocha, which would kill all life on the planet. Escorted by a number of Sith-Imperial starfighters, Quad Victor was dispatched from the War Hammer and proceeded to drop canisters of viral spores into Da Soocha's oceans. With their mission a success and the oceans of Da Soocha sufficiently contaminated, the bomber squadron returned to the War Hammer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quad Victor made its first and only appearance in Star Wars Legends was in Legacy 48, a comic published by Dark Horse Comics on May 26, 2010."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
