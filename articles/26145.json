Cantaros, who was mourning the death of his Master Douglas Sunvale in the attack that had led to him and several others being stranded, bonded quickly with the creature, which he had first encountered while foraging for fruit. However, not long after Cantaros had met Chiri, the handsy was killed by Gwishi, one of the Nihil pirates responsible for the attack. Chiri's death further upset Cantaros, placing him in danger of falling to the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
