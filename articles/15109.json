That year, the Mandalorians undertook Mandalorian Triumph, a campaign to capture the Core World of Duro. One prong of the advance took the Mandalorian forces from their territory to the Gizer system. Once they had conquered Gizer, they moved on to the Nazzri system, which they took during the battle. After Nazzri, the Mandalorians assaulted the Zel system and continued Coreward, eventually taking a number of other worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle in the Nazzri system was mentioned in the 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas, written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
