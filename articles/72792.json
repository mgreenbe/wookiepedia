These saurians stood between 1.8 and 2.2 meters tall and were covered in scale plates. Pointed spikes protruded from different parts of their bodies, including the forearms, the front thighs and the shoulders. They had five fingers on each hand, one of which was an opposable thumb. Their feet ended in three forward-pointing, clawed toes. These beings' visage was completely hairless and featured a wide mouth full of sharp teeth. They also had fleshy appendages on the browridges, and a pair of round forward-facing eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The K'aargs' ancestors on Shira were once an established civilization, as they left ruins of a large city located in a canyon. Millennia later, the K'aargs were of a lower technology level, midway between stone and feudal level. They were a rather primitive society organized in small clans and living in caves. As regards warfare, the K'aargs would only use swords, axes and bows."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When an unidentified Nightsister crashed on Shira, the K'aargs quickly adopted her as goddess, though a bloodthirsty one.

Some K'aargs them eventually left their clans and went to lead a nomadic existence in hopes of freeing themselves from the sorceress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The K'aargs made their first and only appearance in \"Elle\", a roleplaying adventure published in the 109st issue of the French gaming magazine Casus Belli."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
