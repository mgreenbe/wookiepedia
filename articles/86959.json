Mark I Power Guards were the weakest model of Power Guard but were equipped with advanced weapons and armor like later models. Several Mark I Power Guards were left to defend the Power Guard Cybernetics Lab after Sadic moved the program elsewhere, though they were no match for a young Jedi Knight who arrived not long afterward.

The Power Guard system was applied to willing recruits on the moon Nar Shaddaa, but in 3643 BBY, the Sith Lord Sadic seized control of the project and set about using it for his own ends. Instead of using willing volunteers, his forces began abducting refugees and forcing them to undergo the Power Guard process\u2014but their minds were also wiped and programmed, giving Sadic droid-like supersoldiers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a young Jedi Knight began disrupting Sadic's operations, Sadic relocated the Power Guard program to another location, leaving only a handful of Mark I Power Guards along with his subordinate Commander Graul at the original Power Guard Cybernetics Lab.

When the Jedi breached the main chamber, the Knight briefly spoke with Sadic via holocomm, and then Sadic activated the remaining Mark I Power Guards stored in the lab to support Graul. However, the Knight and a companion killed Graul and the Power Guards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Power Guard program came to an end not long afterward, with the Republic destroying all of the program's files."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Mark I Power Guard was a supersoldier augmented with the Power Guard Enhancement System\u2014an array of cybernetic enhancements and adrenal stimulants.
