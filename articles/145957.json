When inflated with air, it grew to the same size as an Adarian's head. The pouch was used by the Adarians to emit the \"long call\" which was a subsonic long range cry that was thought to have originated as either a mating call or distress signal. It could also be used as a short range attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
