As part of their training, the Padawan traveled the galaxy in search of citizens facing difficult situations. After hearing Graf's plight, the Jedi-to-be agreed to deal with the Gungans. Initially, the Padawan accused one of the Gungan inhabitants of trespassing on their client's land. However, the intrepid Force-sensitive soon learned that the family of Gungans had actually lived there for a very long time, and that the land was never put up for sale. The Padawan apologized for inconveniencing the Gungan landowner, and returned to Graf to inform him that he had no right to take the land away from them. Graf was left incredulous by the Padawan's \"sickening\" display of sympathy, and insisted that the land was rightfully his, despite the fact that the Gungans were occupying it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kant Graf had red skin, and yellow-colored eyes. Greedy and unsympathetic, Graf proved willing to evict a family of Gungans from an area of land which he believed was rightfully his, even if it meant using deadly force. Although he ordinarily acted friendly and respectful, Graf was liable to exhibit a more vicious demeanor if he did not get his way.

He was added to the game on August 31, 2004 as part of Publish 10, which revamped the process for becoming a Jedi in the form of newly implemented Padawan Trial quests. Graf was involved in one of the sixteen trial quests that players could complete, which required the player to resolve a land dispute with a Gungan NPC. Players would need to complete eight of these sixteen trial quests successfully in order to qualify as a Jedi Initiate. Because the trial quests were randomly assigned, it was possible for players to not be assigned Graf's quest. It was also possible for players to refuse the quest, or to fail up to three of the trials before being forced to restart the entire process over again. In this case, it was possible for players to fail the quest by wrongfully killing the Gungan landowner, instead of allowing the Gungan to keep the land. However, this article assumes 100% game completion under the light sided character choices. Each of the trial quests had a core moral that needed to be applied. In Graf's quest, the moral was, \"A Jedi must gather all possible information before making a decision.\" With the release of Publish 25's New Game Enhancements on November 15, 2005, the Jedi profession was once again revamped, this time to simply become a starter profession. The Padawan Trial quests were rendered defunct as a result, effectively removing Kant Graf from the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
