Following the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, FN-1824 was assigned to guard Rey, a Force-sensitive scavenger held captive by Kylo Ren aboard Starkiller Base. Using her latent Force abilities, Rey used a Jedi mind trick on FN-1824 to force him into releasing her from captivity. Her first two efforts failed, but she finally succeeded at using the Jedi ability. FN-1824 unlocked Rey's restraints and, on her command, left his F-11D blaster rifle behind before leaving her. The trooper was eventually located in his quarters and questioned. He was confused and had no memory of what had happened."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "FN-1824 appeared in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, in which he was portrayed by Daniel Craig. In both the film's adult and junior novelizations, when Rey's first attempt at a mind trick fails, the guard simply stares at her. Rey succeeds on her second attempt. Additionally, in the novelizations, Rey instructs the guard to return to his quarters and he also promises to speak of the encounter to no one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the filming crew, the character was dubbed FN-007.
