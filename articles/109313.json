The Commerce Guild was able to secure a Quarren majority on the Mon Calamari Council, and even installed the corrupt Senator Tikkes through several terms in office."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Senator Tikkes was exposed as a corrupt official during the Separatist Crisis, and evaded Republic prosecution by fleeing into Separatist space. He pledged his planet's resources to the growing Separatist movement, and was one of the founding members of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. But he no longer represented his people, since a pro-Republic Quarren, Tundra Dowmeia, was elected Senator following his removal. The resulting political conflict sparked a civil war on Dac, and Tikkes's supporters became known as the Quarren Isolation League."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The League sought to purge all Republic presence from their homeworld, and to achieve those goals, revolted against the planetary government. The Quarren Separatists included Quarren mining barons who had prospered from Commerce Guild funding, and they were able to gain Separatist support in return for continued shipments of raw ores to the guilds. Tikkes also signed a treaty with Count Dooku, which resulted in the League obtaining aquatic assault craft supplied by the Trade Federation and the Techno Union, such as the manta droid subfighters, sub-carriers, and mini-subs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the conflict that ensued, the Mon Calamari Knights did their best to defend their cities and the Mon Calamari Council. The Republic, in the form of a clone SCUBA trooper force led by Jedi General Kit Fisto, arrived to participate in the battle. They defeated the Quarren Isolation League at the Battle of Mon Calamari. Despite this, the Quarren continued to support the Separatists.
