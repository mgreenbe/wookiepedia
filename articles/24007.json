Each case officer was usually a retired 23er, stationed at the sector headquarters along with all other case officers assigned to a given sector giving them easy access to the Sector Commander."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The main responsibilities of the case officer were to ensure that the network under their command was not compromised by Imperial infiltration, to ensure all information is gathered is collected and disseminated to the proper authorities, to pass on all information gathered to Operations, and to use the network to hinder the Empire whenever possible. In the event of Imperial infiltration into the network, it is the case officer's responsibility to reorganize the network sufficiently to minimize danger and exposure to the remaining cell operatives. In extreme cases, the case officer was mandated to dismantle the entire network and begin again from scratch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
