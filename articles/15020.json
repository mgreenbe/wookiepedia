This brought them through the Stenos system, where they defeated the Mandalorians, to the Elom system, where they were also victorious. From Elom, they attacked Jaga's Cluster and were soundly defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle is only referenced once in 2009's The Essential Atlas.
