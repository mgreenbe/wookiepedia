Troubleshooters were experts at dealing with and solving crisises, and were called upon to handle anything that threatened the stability of the House. This included kidnappings, blackmail, routing out and dealing with spies, countering terrorism, and even stopping the advances of unwelcome suitors. Troubleshooters were loyal to their House and protected the members and assets from both physical harm and from the effects that scandals would have on the noble's reputations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
