A metropolitan city, New Adasta was constructed atop a rocky crag in the tundra of Ziost, and the city's Central District was in fact located in the cave underneath that crag. The centerpiece of the city was the People's Tower, a large skyscraper similar in design to the Imperial Citadel. During the Invasion of Ziost, the former Sith Emperor Vitiate focused a significant portion of his attention and power to New Adasta as he possessed the population of the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New Adasta was constructed by the Sith sometime between the Great Hyperspace War and the Great Galactic War, during a period of Sith recolonization, when the empire reclaimed many of its holdings lost during the former conflict. Over the years, it grew into a major city, thus replacing the planet's former capital and becoming the primary Sith hub in the border regions of Imperial Space. While the new capital of the Sith Empire was now located on the jungle world of Dromund Kaas, the construction of the city restored much of the planet's former significance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But, aside from being merely a strategic colony on the border, New Adasta was also one of the largest trade hubs in the Empire, merchants from all over flocking to the business districts throughout the town.
