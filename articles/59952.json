These triplets were near-feral subhumanoid beings of the Hassk species. They itched for trouble, but could be kept in line by the larger peacekeepers in Maz Kanata's castle. All three carried weaponry, one of them a battered VT-33d blaster pistol. One of the taller two triplets had a smelly mange skin disease from sleeping in dung heaps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Varmik first appeared in Takodana Castle in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.
