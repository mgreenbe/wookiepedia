The Senate's Ethics Committee could force a Vote of No Confidence against fellow senators following an ethics investigation and censure. In 32 BBY, Chancellor Finis Valorum was voted out of office after his administration was publicly denounced by Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who found Valorum's response to the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo inadequate. The Senate ultimately replaced Valorum with Sheev Palpatine of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
