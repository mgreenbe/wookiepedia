However, these advantages came at a price, as the YU-410 was relatively slow and had very poor maneuverability. As part of cost-cutting, it was equipped with smaller than normal engines that led to a low maximum speed and reduced maneuverability. Like most CEC designs, it was easily repaired and modified."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to its large cargo capacity and low profile, it was a popular model with merchants and mercenaries. The large cargo space was often converted to opulent living quarters, making the YU-410 into a mobile base of operations.
