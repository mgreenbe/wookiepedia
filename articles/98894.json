Nyama was appointed as the council's liaison to the Empire of the Hand, an ally of the council, and in 8 ABY, he attended a strategy session that was held by Grand Admiral Thrawn aboard the Star Destroyer Admonitor to discuss an upcoming attack on the planet Quethold, against the combined forces of the warlord Nuso Esva and the Quesoth species. After some discussion, Thrawn decided to send a Quesoth to make a holocam recording of an art collection that Esva possessed, to aide the Admiral in analyzing Esva's military strategies. Once the footage had been obtained, Thrawn, Nyama and some senior Empire of the Hand figures convened to review the footage. However, during the meeting, Nyama came to the conclusion that Thrawn would not be able to defeat the Quesoth, so the liaison ordered all Stromma aboard the Admonitor to leave the ship and not participate in the attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
