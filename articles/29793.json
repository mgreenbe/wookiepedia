The technology involved overloading the core of a machine or a starship, filling the energy core with a large amount of unneeded fuel from the tanks. Following this, the crew would abandon the ship as it would explode. The Empire used this technology in the TIE Mauler; use of this tactic was highly effective against infantry and surrounding unshielded repulsorcraft. The Consortium used this tactic to destroy surrounding enemy units in a suicide mission or if the vessel was near destruction. This technique was highly effective against starfighters, however it had no effect against larger warships or flying vehicles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption, opposing factions will use this tactic if its only remaining ground forces are capable of this and otherwise incapable of attacking the player if the player's only remaining ground forces, or the forces it's attacking, are flying vehicles such as the Lancet Aerial Artillery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
