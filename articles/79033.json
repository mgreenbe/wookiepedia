The LC \"hunting droid\" made things even worse during its escape by killing three law enforcement officials, a portmaster, and by stealing the governor's shuttle. Being pursued by the Abbaji System Constables, who were looking for it in the Spar sector, LC-Zed took temporary refuge on Sarafur, in the nearby Moddell sector. Having slightly damaged its shuttle in the process, LC-Zed started a hunt for a new hyperdrive motivator and laser cannon energy coils."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
