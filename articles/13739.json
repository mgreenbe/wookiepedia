He was attacked by the shaman Logray, who uses the Sunstar against him but Raygar's Imperial Reconnaissance droids soon overwhelmed the village and the evil doctor retaliated by swiftly stealing the Sunstar, before returning to Admiral Kazz's Star Destroyer in orbit. Back in his lab, Raygar studied the Sunstar and came to the realization that by harnessing its power, he could remove Palpatine and install himself as the Galactic Emperor. But when creating a dangerous cannon with the Sunstar's powers, Raygar discovered that Wicket Wystri Warrick, Princess Kneesaa, Latara and Teebo had come aboard Kazz's Star Destroyer with the help of a pilot droid named PD-28. Raygar planned to test his weapon on the captives\u2014Latara and Teebo, but is thwarted by Wicket. Inadvertently, Raygar fired upon the Emperor's approaching shuttle instead. Palpatine survived, and Admiral Kazz subsequently arrested Raygar, charging him with high treason. The Emperor then oversaw the doctor's punishment personally. With PD-28, the Ewoks return safely to the Forest Moon, where Wicket, Kneesaa, Latara and Teebo say good-bye to the pilot droid as he embarked on a search for his old master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
