At the time of the Separatist Crisis in 23 BBY, Enanrum sculptured an elaborate statue from ice, which was displayed at a gala fundraiser taking place in Jrade Plaza of the planet Coruscant's posh Jrade District. Unfortunately for the statue, Representative Jar Jar Binks of Naboo was invited to the gala. Binks, who was infamous for his clumsiness, managed to accidentally tuck the tablecloth upon which the statue rested into his cummerbund. At the same time, he attempted to catch tumbling canap\u00e9s he had knocked from a nearby waiter, and, as a result, the Gungan Representative pulled down the statue, which shattered to pieces. The incident was reported by HoloNet News, and Enanrum, saddened by the loss of the statue, gave an interview in which the sculptor expressed regret for bringing the statue at the gala in the first place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A successful sculptor, Kime Enanrum became renowned in that line of work.
