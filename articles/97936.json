The two later received a new job from a disguised Doctor Cornelius Evazan, who tasked them with the destruction of the assassin droid 0-0-0.

During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Nokk and Winloss took jobs as hunters, hoping to be noticed by King Prana and overtake Squoxx to become the king's best hunters.

When all the previous hunters were either killed or fatally wounded in attempt to reach the beast, Aphra contacted Winloss, giving them the job. Nokk and Winloss traveled to the distant world, where they reached the opening to the temple.

Over the holoprojector, Aphra warned the hunters, telling them to duck. Nokk leapt at Winloss, knocking them both out of the way of a volley of spears that were shot at them. Winloss noticed the corpse of the hunter Ro Thran, who had been killed by the spears some time earlier. Nokk grabbed the holoprojector, demanding that Aphra explain how she was able to predict the trap. After the hunters dodged several more spears, Aphra told them about the temple, including the idol she had secretly attempted to steal, along with the many traps and the beast that guarded it. Nokk was distracted by one such trap, the Vortex of Fiery Dematerialization, which Aphra warned her to look away from.

Aphra, who was unable to hear or see them as the holoprojector had been closed, informed them that the idol nearby was fake, and that it would activate a tractor beam device. Looking up, the hunters saw Trapper Pehk stuck on the device, who warned them not to trust Aphra. Aphra told them that they were standing in one of the Shadowfang Beast's feeding sites, and Nokk turned around to see the beast heading towards them.

Winloss shot at the creature with his blaster, but the blast only charged up its resonance-absorptive shield, causing it to jump up and swallow Trapper Pehk, retreating into a cave. Winloss ran over to Nokk, checking whether she had been hurt. After learning that she was okay, Winloss turned to the hologram of Aphra, demanding to know the truth. Aphra was reluctant to speak, but Nokk interrupted, having realized that they were not the first hunters Aphra had hired. Aphra explained that as all their competition was dead, they could be the top hunters in their area, a line of thinking that Nokk did not like."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they overcame more traps, Winloss asked what had happened when he had shot at the creature, but Aphra disregarded it, warning them of more spears. Nokk, tired of Aphra's avoidance to tell the truth, caught a spear that flew at her, demanding that she answered Winloss' question. Aphra explained the nature of the Shadowfang Beast, accidentally letting slip that she had personally observed the creature, but warned them of several thermodrones before Nokk could question it. Winloss destroyed the thermodrones, repeating Nokk's question, but Aphra lied, telling them to continue their journey. The hunters came across the lair of the beast, noticing that the real idol had been taken. Aphra told them that several of the other hunters had been attacked at that point, and as she spoke, the creature emerged. Aphra suggested that they run, but Nokk refused, pushing Winloss out of the beast's way and into a cavern where they discovered Squoxx, King Prana's current best hunter and their main rival."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The truth revealed"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Squoxx pleaded with the two hunters, asking that they kill the beast and take him back to King Prana, claiming that they would be rewarded for doing so. Nokk noticed that Squoxx's lekku had been bitten off, and that he would die within an hour. Quietly speaking with Winloss, she suggested that they use Squoxx as bait for the creature, and they tied him up, throwing him back into the beast's lair. However, the Shadowfang Beast did not take the bait, leading Nokk to guess that it was blind and only used its hearing to navigate the caverns. As a distraction, she asked Winloss to loudly run in the opposite direction, distracting the beast so that she could sneak up behind it and subdue it with an electro cudgel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Noticing that the creature's scales had broken from when she hit it with her harpoon, Nokk leapt onto the Shadowfang Beast, hitting the exposed skin with the cudgel.

Attempting to manipulate them into killing the beast while it was subdued, Aphra refused to pay them anything. Angered, Nokk threatened to kill the creature with a crossbow. Aphra taunted Nokk and her ethics, claiming that she could not. Nokk handed the crossbow to Winloss, asking him to do it, but he was also unable to bring himself to do it, throwing the crossbow behind him. Squoxx, who was still lying on the ground, caught it and shot the Shadowfang Beast, killing it at the same time as he died."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the beast dead, Aphra shot her way out of the creature, revealing that she had been inside it the entire time. As she took off the null suit that had let her survive after being eaten, Nokk realized that she had hired hunters to subdue the beast because blasters would cause the its shield discharge to kill her. Aphra escaped the cave with a jetpack, leaving Nokk and Winloss behind. Once Aphra was gone, Nokk suggested dedicating her life to taking revenge, but Winloss revealed that he had stolen the idol from her with the pickpocketing skills he had learned. Nokk attempted to admit her love for Winloss, but was speechless.

In disguise, Evazan requested that they hunt down and destroy the Triple-Zero protocol personality matrix within the assassin droid 0-0-0, claiming it was an enemy of the Rebellion.

Visible on the screen was Doctor Aphra, who Evazan had linked to the droid via proximity bombs, forcing them to stay together after escaping the Imperial wreckage-prison Accresker Jail. Both Nokk and Winloss recognized the archaeologist who had almost gotten them killed, and Nokk was angered at the sight of her. \"Organa\" gave them a new deal, telling them to only incapacitate 0-0-0 but to kill Aphra.

However, when the hunters confronted Aphra, Winloss falsely claimed that she had been pointing a blaster at them, and that shooting her would thus be self-defense. Nokk asked Winloss for their ion-net launcher, to disable Triple-Zero, but Winloss believed he should be the one to use it. They turned around to notice Triple-Zero's fellow assassin droid BT-1, who had been reprogrammed by Posla, about to fire at them.

Wanting the chase to become more exciting, Evazan broadcast a message across Milvayne City, claiming to provide a bounty on either the capture or death of Aphra and Triple-Zero. Nokk and Winloss left in search of their targets once again, taking the deactivated BT-1 with them. Posla, once again revived by the hookspores, pulled Nokk's tranquilizer harpoon out from himself, throwing it aside and resuming his hunt.

Nokk pursued them through the air with a jetpack, firing stun shots in their direction. She threw a harpoon between Triple-Zero and Aphra, separating them. As she leapt at them with another harpoon, she was abruptly thrown to the side, where she seemingly disappeared. Triple-Zero, noticing Beetee on a nearby starship, leapt across to see him, followed by Aphra. However, Beetee was still disabled due to the hunters' ion-net, and had been placed on the craft as a trap.

Captain Okma of the Galactic Empire's Coalition for Progress, from his flagship Enduring Pride, was ordered to pacify the aggression, firing down into the city.

In return, Aphra allowed Triple-Zero to access the memories of his former self.
