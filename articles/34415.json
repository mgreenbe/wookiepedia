Instead of hyperdrives, they used dovin basals to pull a vessel from one location to another. Despite their advanced biotechnology, the Yuuzhan Vong suffered the same hyperspace limitations as hyperdrives. They could be pulled from darkspace by the mass shadows of objects in realspace, and required the use of hyperlanes to travel safely through darkspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
