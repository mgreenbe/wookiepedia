During the Clone Wars, VYRUS was present in the city Tolea Biqua on the planet Genarius, where the Cularin Central Broadcasting reporter Ryk Osentay attempted to interview him. The Ugnaught became irritated and tried to leave, but Osentay blocked his path, so VYRUS kicked the reporter in the shin and then dragged him into a nearby alley, where he proceeded to beat Osentay up. The reporter later aired footage of the Ugnaught's attack on his show, Eye on Cularin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
