Seeking to gain control of the planet's strategic resources, the Separatist Droid Army led by General Whorm Loathsom invaded and captured Christophsis. Responding to an urgent plea from the world's inhabitants, the Galactic Republic and the Jedi High Council dispatched Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker with Admiral Wullf Yularen and a clone trooper contingent from the Grand Army of the Republic to liberate the planet. After managing to break Confederate Admiral Trench's massive blockade around the planet as well as deliver the supplies to Senator Bail Prestor Organa's refugee camp on the surface via an experimental stealth ship, Republic forces attempted to ambush the Confederate droid army from a business center in one of the plazas of the capital city.

Kenobi and Skywalker confronted Sith acolyte Asajj Ventress at the Separatist base, and discovered the presence of an invasion force far greater in strength than they originally believed. Back at the Republic base, Slick was revealed to be the turncoat, but still managed to sabotage the Republic's weapons depot, destroying most of the Republic's supplies before Rex and Cody could apprehend him. Raising the stakes with its full strength, the main body of Confederate troops launched an assault on the Republic forces. After several days, the Republic managed to push the Separatist forces into a retreat, and when Loathsom mounted a second assault his forces' advance was halted by the Republic's heavy cannons, and he and his droids pulled back to their base behind a deflector shield to counter the Republic's artillery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The renewed Separatist blockade of Christophsis drove Yularen and the Republic fleet away from the planet, but Skywalker's newly assigned Jedi Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, was able to land on the planet. Loathsom and the Confederacy mounted yet another assault, this time advancing behind their shield, effectively neutralizing the clones' artillery. While Kenobi, Rex, and the 501st Legion defended the heavy cannons, Skywalker and Tano sabotaged the Confederacy's shield generator. Kenobi faked surrender to Loathsom, buying time for his comrades to complete their mission, and Yularen returned to the system with Jedi Grand Master Yoda and a reinforced fleet to break the Separatist blockade, driving the enemy away from Christophsis.

Skywalker was sent in advance with a fleet of Star Destroyers, while Kenobi and Clone Commander Cody followed behind in Kenobi's flagship the Negotiator, which carried in its secret cargo an experimental stealth ship with cloaking abilities. Trouble beset the Republic forces as the Separatists possessed a much larger army than anticipated; in addition, Sergeant Slick (who was among the clone troops dispatched to Christophsis) had grown disillusioned with the Jedi and the Republic, believing the clones' lives as soldiers to be little more than enslavement, and so was passing vital intelligence to Asajj Ventress in exchange for payment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Republic arrival"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Attack on the blockade"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving in Christophsian space, Skywalker and Yularen engaged the Separatist blockade with three Venator-class Star Destroyers against Kenobi's orders not to. Trench's forces, consisting of at least twenty-three Munificent-class star frigates, at least six Lucrehulk-class Battleships, and Trench's Providence-class Dreadnought Invincible, quickly overpowered the tiny Republic fleet. On board the Resolute, Skywalker and Yularen made contact with Senator Organa on the surface as his position was being overrun by Separatist forces, and they were running low on food, water, and munitions. He and his men were close to being overwhelmed by the army on the surface when the transmission cut off, as one of Skywalker's cruisers was hit by enemy fire. As the two sides exchanged heavy fire, the Invincible advanced on the Resolute unopposed. Yularen ordered the Resolute's forward shields activated just before the Separatist Command ship released a barrage of laser fire at the whole task force. Trench also attacked the Pelta-class frigates, separating them from their escort cruisers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The left supply ship was then hit by the increased fire, being completely torn apart. In response, Skywalker ordered all reactors to be overfired, intending to charge past the Separatist commander, though he was still unaware of his identity. At that point, Kenobi and Cody arrive on board the Negotiator behind Skywalker's ships, staying close to Leesis, Christophsis' moon. Though his tactical droid, TI-99, informed him that the Resolute was not breaking off its attack, Trench held his ships in line and had his bridge crew intensify forward shields. As their ship took more fire, Skywalker and Yularen holographically counselled with Kenobi. At his friends' request, Skywalker decided to regroup behind the moon, ordering the supply ships to break away first, with the Star Destroyers covering their escape. His cruisers managed to maneuver around and have their hulls take most of the enemy fire, protecting the supply ships and the fleet behind them. Knowing his orders were to simply blockade the planet, Trench, in the belief that he had won the first round of the battle, decided against pursuing the retreating fleet and remained in orbit to wait for the Republic's inevitable second attack. To ready his ships for this, he had his command ship's shields recycled and forward cannons reset to a full charge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Republic fleet recuperating and waiting for the next attack, Skywalker took a Nu-class transport to the Negotiator, where he met Kenobi to see the ship the general had brought. After he had shown Skywalker the prototype ship and it's stealth capabilities, Kenobi said the ship was completely undetectable to scanners as far as they could tell, but this was it's first true field test. Skywalker, despite the ship's size, believed he could use it to take out the blockade from behind, Kenobi instead instructed him to use it to run a mercy mission to drop off supplies at Organa's camp. Though he wished to attack and destroy the blockade instead, Skywalker agreed to carry out the mission. Meanwhile, onboard the Resolute, Yularen was researching the markings on the Invincible, having noticed a familiarity with the tactics of the earlier battle. He found that it did indeed belong to Admiral Trench, a foe he had previously faced and presumed to be vaporized in the Battle of Malastare Narrows. Concerned, he requested that Skywalker delay his mission and met with the general aboard the Negotiator, reporting his findings to him while the stealth ship was being loaded. Because he had engaged the admiral previously, Yularen volunteered himself as consort on Skywalker's mission, believing it would be beneficial in the inevitable encounter with Trench's wit. Skywalker accepted and welcomed him to the mission."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Stealth mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With one stealth clone pilot, Clone Commander Blackout and trooper CT-1284, nicknamed \"Spark\"\u2014the last of the stealth ship's crew\u2014 on board, at their stations, and ready for takeoff, the stealth ship powered up and prepared to depart. Skywalker piloted the ship out of the Negotiator's main hangar bay and toward the heavily armored Separatist blockade, activating his craft's cloaking shield just as it came out from behind the moon. Remaining undetected by Trench and the rest of his fleet, Skywalker and Yularen slipped right past an ignorant Munificent-class frigate\u2014close enough to leave Yularen worried about alerting the enemy to their presence. Conferring with his tactical droid aboard the Invincible, Trench found that the Christophsian resistance was crumbling, and the droid offered his estimation that it would be a half rotation more before it was completely over. Intending to add some pressure on those who had been sent to rescue Senator Organa, Trench dispatched his Hyena-class Droid Bombers to attack the Senator's camp on the surface in order to draw his enemies out from behind the moon. The squadron of bombers, accompanied by fighter escort, launched from the Separatist fleet, and their path to the surface inadvertently lead them straight to Skywalker's stealth ship, despite Trench's continued unawareness of the craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The approaching bombers presented Skywalker with a tough decision to make: because he did not know if the Separatists had learned of their presence, he was uncertain if the bombers were targeting the stealth ship or not. The Republic craft itself was armed with proton torpedoes and anti-aircraft cannons, but would have to deactivate the cloaking device to use either\u2014and doing so would allow the Separatists to know of their ship. Yularen noted that an offensive had to be mounted soon, if Skywalker decided to do so. As the diving bombers entered within range, Skywalker elected to chance that the blockade was unaware of the stealth ship and thereby ordered his crew to keep the ship cloaked, power it down, and let it drift. Despite Yularen's contrary to belief, the bombers did not attack the stealth ship, zooming right by and rattling it but otherwise leaving it unscathed. However, Yularen pushed away the comforting revelation that the Separatists were oblivious to their presence and voiced his realization that the bombers were heading to bomb Organa's command center. The bombers did just that, releasing their explosives on the senator's camp in the city. With the Separatists approaching both by air and ground, Organa opened a transmission to Kenobi and told him that without reinforcements, there was not much chance for survival. Kenobi then contacted Skywalker and told him to continue with his mission while he himself engaged Trench's fleet with the remaining ships of the task force. Both Yularen and Skywalker disagreed with this course of action; Yularen stated that Kenobi did not have the proper resources to openly engage Trench and asserted that it was a trap, while Skywalker affirmed that the proposed tactic simply would not be successful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Believing that their ship was in the best position to attack Trench, Skywalker, to the surprise of Yularen, had four of the stealth craft's proton torpedoes prepped, intending to go on the offensive and divert Trench's attention from the Christopsians and back to the Republic fleet. He then cut off Kenobi's transmission before he could continue to order Skywalker to deliver the supplies to the surface. Trench, meanwhile, found the Republic fleet's silence odd and mused to himself about their intentions. He soon found out, as Skywalker brought the stealth ship around to get a clear shot at Trench's ship. After disengaging the ships cloaking shields, Skywalker had his crew fire the four prepped torpedoes at the Invincible's bridge. Trench managed to put up his ship's thermal shield, rendering the attack unsuccessful. When the stealth ship began to re-cloak, Trench fired four missiles at the stealth craft. Skywalker decided to have his pilot launch decoy flares to intercept the missiles, and then re-cloaked the ship. Not to be deterred, Trench ordered a large spread of lasers fired at the ship's last known position, believing he would be able to hit the craft with the sheer number of blasts. In spite of this, Skywalker managed to avoid the laser spread. This did not go unnoticed, as Trench surmised that since no clone pilot would have been able to avoid that many lasers, he must be dealing with a Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deciding to speak with his adversary, Trench patched himself over an open frequency and called out to his unseen enemy. Skywalker picked up the transmission and unhesitatingly accessed it, witnessing Trench goading the Republic forces into attacking him and boasting that he had dealt with cloaked ships before. After he had terminated his transmission, Trench was not surprised with his tactical droid's calculation that the Jedi would not turn back as he requested and theorized that the Jedi would attack again. Meanwhile, Skywalker and Yularen were left puzzled with the revelation of Trench's experience with cloaked ships until Kenobi obtained records of Trench's past battles. Kenobi reported that Trench had indeed faced such technology and had successfully hit them with tracking torpedoes, though nothing as small as the stealth ship. Skywalker correctly theorized that Trench had homed in on the ship's magnetic signature as a means of targeting the cloaked ships. Skywalker requested that Kenobi hold off his attack until Trench had been destroyed before ending the transmission. After completing the necessary preparations, the stealth ship de-cloaked once more and fired four more torpedoes at the Invincible. While the torpedoes hit the Invincible's thermal shields and failed to do any damage, the bridge crew locked onto the stealth ship's magnetic signature and was able to track it. Having to lower his shields in order to fire tracking torpedoes, Trench had his tactical droid do just that and released the four-torpedo volley. With the bait taken, Skywalker began to pilot the stealth ship toward the Invincible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the torpedoes following closely, Skywalker deactivated his ship's cloaking device and diverted all the ships power to her engines. He then steered the ship straight towards the Invincible's bridge. Realizing his error, Trench attempted to raise the thermal shields, but could not because they were still charging. Skywalker piloted the ship across the Invincible's hull, grazing it and leading the tracking torpedoes straight towards the bridge. As the Invincible exploded behind him(though Trench only lost an eye and three arms), Skywalker made for the planet's surface. Giving Skywalker a grudging congratulations, Kenobi engaged the remainder of the blockade with the Negotiator, while the stealth ship continued to the surface to deliver it's supplies. Skywalker and Yularen landed at the refugee camp and unloaded their supplies. Organa thanked the general for the lives he saved, and Yularen expressed his impressed view of Skywalker's unusual tactics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Trench out of the way, the Separatist fleet was in disarray, and Kenobi pushed his fleet of Venator-class Star Destroyers forward to break the enemy blockade, which\u2014in the absence of the Invincible\u2014was now comprised of Munificent-class frigates and Droid Control Ships. Skywalker temporarily returned with Kenobi to pilot their respective Jedi interceptors against the remnants of the blockade. On the ground, Skywalker and Kenobi captured the western district in the capital city of Chaleydonia.

Kenobi, Cody, and Sergeant Slick stationed their men in the south tower, while Skywalker and Rex were based in the parallel north tower. While Separatist battle droids and AATs passed through the plaza below, Kenobi's men set up several blaster cannons, ready to ambush the advancing enemy forces. As the clones kept watch on the droids, however, the column of droids unexpectedly split into two. B1 battle droids took a turbolift up to the level of the south tower where Kenobi's forces were positioned and ambushed them, surrounding and converging on the clones. The backfired ambush made it apparent to Kenobi that their tactic had been compromised. Watching the transpiring events from the north tower and confirming the situation over comlink with Kenobi, Skywalker contacted clone pilot Hawk and ordered an evacuation from the south tower. Skywalker then cut through the window overlooking the plaza with his lightsaber and used the Force to blast a hole through it, enabling his men to fire their blaster rifles' ascension cables across to the south tower. Skywalker, Rex, and the clone troopers crossed the divide and sustained minimal casualties from the battle droids that opened fire on them from the plaza below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex, Skywalker, and their men met up with Kenobi in the south tower and cut off battle droids attempting to assault him from behind, and Kenobi telekinetically threw one of the blaster cannons at the droids, momentarily halting their advance. The Jedi and their respective forces entered a turbolift in order to evacuate from the roof of the tower, while droids pursued them in other lifts. After reaching the roof, the clone troopers provided cover fire so the Jedi could attack the droids at close range. Soon after, however, the tactical droid TJ-55 came to the roof with droid reinforcements. Just then, Hawk's gunship arrived and hovered close to the roof of the tower. Continuing to fire at the droids, the troopers began to back into the craft. Before retreating, trooper Gus charged TJ-55 and broke the droid's head off, taking it into the gunship. Republic forces then left the failed ambush site and returned to the base, where Rex and Cody performed a robolobotomy on the tactical droid's head, managing to access its memory banks. The droid's head confirmed the Separatist forces had known of the Republic's strategy and position, but shut down before revealing anything else."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the clones reported their findings to their generals, Skywalker thought that a breach in security systems had been the source for the Confederacy's acquisition of the plans. Kenobi went as far as to suspect that their was a spy in their midst, thinking that they need to act behind enemy lines to find any relevant intel. Before leaving with Skywalker to investigate, Kenobi told Cody and Rex to keep the mission a secret, and to stay and track down and arrest the spy. As Kenobi and Skywalker left, Cody then saw that someone-Slick, though he did not know it at the time-had left their comlink on in the room and had been listening to the whole conversation. Rex and Cody then spotted Slick in the hallway, but he was too far away for them to identify him. Slick ran, and Rex and Cody tried to chase them down, but they lost him. Because of the spy's path, though, they were able to deduce that he must have gone into the mess hall. After realizing that all the people in the mess hall were clones, they were forced to conclude that the spy was one of their brothers. Cody then tried to contact Kenobi and Skywalker to no avail, as the droids were jamming transmissions. Deciding to continue investigating, they returned to the communications center, where, thanks to R2-D2, they discovered several external communications. They had taken place every few days, in a pattern irregular enough to avoid detection. The wavelengths were ultimately traced to a terminal in the barracks of Sargent Slick. Deducing that one of Slick's men was the spy, they decided to interrogate them in hopes of apprehending the individual."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Revealed deception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the cover of night, Skywalker and Kenobi neared the Confederacy base\u2014where the primary Separatist invasion army was landing and preparing to march on the city\u2014on BARC speeders through the streets of the ruined city. The two Jedi noticed an increasing number of battle droids spying them, but because the droids were not attempting to stop them or engage them, the pair realized that they were heading into a trap, but continued anyway. Upon arriving at the base, Skywalker and Kenobi were greeted by the hooded figure of Asajj Ventress. Upon sight of each other, all three adversaries ignited their lightsabers. Taunting her attackers with the knowledge of the spy, Ventress nimbly climbed to the top of the base's stairs. A lightsaber duel ensued when Skywalker slashed at Ventress, who drove him down to the bottom of the stairs. Kenobi joined the fight and engaged Ventress as well. Ventress fought Skywalker and Kenobi simultaneously with her dual lightsabers and used the Force to telekinetically throw a piece of crystal rubble at the duo.

However, Ventress suddenly activated her own lightsabers into the floor and opened up a hole, causing Skywalker and Kenobi to fall into the room below. Ventress mocked the two before fleeing, and the two Jedi jumped back up into the room above and followed Ventress as she broke a window and hurtled out of it. While Ventress landed on the head of an octuptarra magna tri-droid attached to the side of the building, Skywalker and Kenobi walked onto the balcony and discovered the full scale of the Separatist invasion force: numerous C-9979 landing craft were landing, bringing more and more battle droids to the surface, and many troops had already been deployed from their racks and were marching in formation on the ground far below. Despite the revelation of the enormous invasion force, Skywalker and Kenobi continued the duel and jumped onto the legs of the tri-droid, cutting off two of its legs and breaking its hold on the building. Ventress jumped off the droid's head and briefly engaged Skywalker upon one of the droid's remaining legs.

She then left in her Trident-class assault ship, leaving Loathsom and the droid in command of the attack. Back at the Republic base, meanwhile, Rex and Cody, despite Slick's objections that it would demoralize his men, interrogated his squad; Jester, Gus, Punch, Sketch, and Chopper. All them had clean alibis except Chopper, who admitted that he was making a necklace out of battle droid fingers, against wartime protocol. Wanting to avoid suspicion, Slick put Chopper's authenticity in question. However, while telling Chopper that he did not have to say anything, he accidentally revealed that he knew the Jedi were gone. Chopper then lashed out, questioning why he had turned left, towards the command center, after returning, when everyone else went right, towards the mess hall and barracks. Cody then realized that he had said that the Jedi were gone, something Slick could not have known unless he was the spy. Found out, Slick punched Cody and dashed for the exit.

Slick left his hiding spot, stole Cody's blaster, and pointed the weapon at Cody, at which point the commander revealed that it was empty. Rex re-entered the room, and the officers surrounded Slick. The sergeant stole Rex's blaster, and Cody lost his own blaster while disarming the Separatist agent. Cody knocked Slick down as the latter headed for the exit, and the two engaged in close combat before Rex pulled the clone traitor off Cody. Slick head-butted Rex and employed the \"groin popper\" maneuver to dislocate his leg. As Slick revealed the reasons behind his treason, Cody knocked him out and locked him in handcuffs. Once the Jedi returned to the base, the apprehended Slick accused them of \"enslaving\" the clones before he was taken to lock-up.

Because rescuing Rotta was necessary to gain Jabba's favor, due to ongoing efforts for the Republic to gain access to hyperspace lanes in Hutt-controlled space, Skywalker and Tano's mission would be to rescue the captive Huttlet to gain Jabba's favor, while Kenobi would enter into negotiations with Jabba on his home planet of Tatooine. Based on clone intelligence reports, Skywalker, Tano, and Rex departed to the Wild Space planet of Teth to rescue Rotta from a monastery with the 501st detachment of Torrent Company. However, they were unaware that they were heading straight into a trap set by Count Dooku and his assassin Asajj Ventress, who were intent on claiming the hyperlanes for the Separatist Alliance and had orchestrated Rotta's capture with help from Jabba's own uncle, Ziro the Hutt, in order to manipulate the Jabba into turning against the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Republic High Command used the victory as an example of what Clones and Jedi, when together, could do. The battle had shown that a single Jedi and an armed squad of clone troopers could take out an entire column of battle droids. The Separatist realized this as well and began to research Jedi-proof biological weapons. Examples of this project were the Defoliator and the Blue Shadow Virus. These two weapons would see use as soon as later in the first year of the war. Despite this boost to Republic, the CIS received a propaganda boost as well, in the form of Kenobi's false surrender, which Separatist-controlled media used as a clear sign of Republic duplicity. Nearly no more conditional surrenders were offered by either side throughout the remainder of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic was able to cover up all evidence of Slick's betrayal, and his motivations were kept a secret from all except Republic High Command in order to make sure that the knowledge that clones weren't 100% obedient stayed secret to stop any possible similar sentiments throughout the trooper ranks. While before the Jedi had viewed their leadership of organics to be more noble than the Separatists use of droids, they now realized they would have to deal with the factor of freewill."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Admiral Trench somehow managed to escape the destruction of his flagship, though he was forced to undergo cybernetic reconstruction to replace several limbs and a part of his head.

The series' January 2009 first season episode \"The Hidden Enemy,\" was created as a prequel to the film at series producer George Lucas's request for Christophsis's backstory to be expanded upon. In March 2010, the battle made an appearance once more in The Clone Wars television series, this time in the second season episode \"Cat and Mouse,\" which occurred chronologically before \"The Hidden Enemy,\" and detailed Admiral Trench's blockade of Christophsis.
