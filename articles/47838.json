The fair was previously a time of fertility and harvest, but in an effort to propel itself into the age of modern technology, the planet added elements of an airshow and industrial exhibits to the festivities. Vehicles, including many that were considered obsolete on more advanced worlds, were put on display, along with communications and holo apparatuses. An exhibition game of shock-ball took place, as well as trophies awarded to the best thematic float or exhibit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
