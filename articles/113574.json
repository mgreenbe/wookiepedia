The canyon was a byproduct of centuries of mining on Iol, and was seven kilometers in width and up to one kilometer deep in places. Over time, mining in the canyon opened up a number of natural underground caverns and some miners suspected that ore deposits lay within the caves. However, safety protocols banned miners from exploring the caves. A number of preventative measures were taken by the miners across Relak Canyon to make the region safe, but despite their efforts, accidents and casualties were a common occurrence in the canyon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
