This molecular bond could be deactivated by depressing certain section of the adhesive layer - a trait used in gription panels to great affect. Gription was used in many applications; INS-444 window installation droids used gription panels in order to transport transparisteel windows, and the DLT-20A blaster rifle made use of a magnatomic grip to keep the users hand securely around it's grip."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A secondary repulsorlift based type of gription also seemed to exist, used by\nUT-ATs by the Grand Army of the Republic. This type of gription worked by reversing the effect of their repulsorlift skids, creating a reverse repulsorlift \"gription\" field to hold the vehicles in place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
