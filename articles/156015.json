The officer was captured along with Piell, Captain Wilhuff Tarkin, another officer and the remaining clone troopers and brought to the prison known as The Citadel. The officer, along with his fellow compatriots, were rescued by a strikeforce, led by Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano. The troopers split their ranks; half going with Skywalker and Tano, the other half with Kenobi and Piell. The officer went with the latter. He and the squad arrived at the shuttle only to be ambushed. Skywalker and his forces reunited with the other squad and they tried to take back the shuttle. CT-21-0408 attempted to recapture the shuttle but was killed in the process. The remaining forces retreated to the landscape of Lola Sayu. While they retreated to a new extraction point, a 212th trooper and one of the officer's fellow escapees were killed while climbing down a cliff. By the time the droids had caught up to them, Tano and Piell stayed behind to cover the clones from being killed. The officer witnessed the death of a fellow trooper and officer. By the time the battle was over, Tano caught back up with the group, carrying a deceased Piell. The officer and the remaining group took a small moment of time to honor Piell. The squad reached the extraction point but were soon discovered by Osi Sobeck and his droids. Kenobi knocked out two STAPs, one of which the officer went to investigate. The officer, Tarkin, and one other trooper were the only survivors of Piell's crew. The Wolfpack sent a gunship with Plo Koon, Wolffe and Comet to rescue the survivors including Piell's Crew, Skywalker, Kenobi, Tano, Cody, Rex, and Fives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
