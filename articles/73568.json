However, unknown to Droosh and the other officers, the \"raid\" was simply a cover for Haus to prevent Whiplash freedom fighter Tuden Sal from carrying out his plans. When the maglev train failed to appear, Haus ordered Droosh and his officers to search the tunnel. They found one train car but when the officers approached the train exploded, wounding several officers and throwing Droosh to the ground. Haus, seeing his plan had failed left Droosh in charge of the scene to go find Sal. Droosh however followed Haus and arrived at the maglev train that served as the Whiplash headquarters in time to overhear Haus and Sal arguing over the future of plans for Whiplash. Droosh confronted them, revealing his affiliation with the ISB and his intentions to kill them before reporting them to his ISB superiors. Haus, angered but resigned, moved to surrender. However, Sal shot Droosh with his blaster at the same time Droosh opened fire resulting in each others death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though he appeared to a proficient officer, having achieved the rank of lieutenant, Droosh had little true loyalty to either the Coruscant Police, his fellow officers, or even the Empire.
