Plasma spheres were filled with ionized fluid, of which each Chiss warship had a limited supply. Plasma spheres' ionic energy blasts were used to disable enemy weapons and electronics such as sensors, and were capable of disabling entire starfighters without destroying them. Practically speaking, plasma spheres could disable attackers without having to penetrate nyix-alloy hulls of warships used throughout the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
