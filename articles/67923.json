It was caused by the creation of the entity Spore by Ithorian scientists, who spliced genes from the bafforr tree, vesuvague tree and several other species. Spore had a malevolent, collective mind, and sought to control other beings. For almost one hundred years, the Ithorians sought to neutralize Spore, and finally did so with the help of the Jedi Order. Spore was neutralized and sealed in a tomb on an asteroid in the Ithor system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The advent of the Ithorian Spore crisis was noted on an issue of HoloNet News in 22 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
