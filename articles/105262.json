These benefits came at a significant cost, however, as the systems required careful calibration to the wearer's specific needs and physique."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although physiological enhancement systems were normally tailored to the physiology of an individual, they were capable of being produced for clone troopers of the Galactic Republic's clone army through a standardized template, which helped to reduce the cost.
