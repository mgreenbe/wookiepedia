They could use the Force to make glowing, imperishable letters and abstract paintings. They developed the art of \"spinning\" normally intangible strings of the Force into resilient silk strands. A stranded biologist described self-healing barriers made from these strands as rubbery, resilient, and \"a frozen waterfall.\" The master Mist-Weavers Shareen, Awglk, and Wkk'e used these strands to cocoon themselves and slow the flow of time after finding themselves trapped in an ancient exogorth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
