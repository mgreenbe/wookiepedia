If the player's character, Havet Storm, had a low score for technical skills, they would fail to find the issue in the superlaser code and would not be hired by the IRS. If the player had a medium score for technical skills, they would find the issue in the superlaser code within 20 minutes and be hired. If the player had the maximum score for technical skills, Havet Storm would find the code easy, finding the issue quickly and also recognizing that the issue was due to sabotage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
