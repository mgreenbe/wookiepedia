By the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, CX-425 was stationed at a small Imperial outpost near the recently subjugated Massassi Temple on the jungle moon of Yavin 4. When medics at an independent supply depot were spotted issuing supplies to a known Rebel, CX-425 desired to see the depot destroyed in response to their treachery. In accomplishing this objective, the sergeant employed the services of an Imperial soldier. Although the soldier expressed their belief that destroying an entire medical supply depot for helping one Rebel was \"overkill,\" the dutiful soldier nevertheless carried out the mission. In addition to a thug and two medics, the depot was indeed defended by individuals loyal to the Rebellion, including a sergeant major and an Alliance Recruitment Agent, all of whom were killed by the soldier dispatched by CX-425."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rebel Kliknik Lair"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "CX-425 later learned of the location of a Rebel transmission relay hidden in a lair of klikniks, a species of buglike insectoids native to the jungles of Yavin 4. To take out the transmitter, CX-425 requested that the entire lair be destroyed by the Imperial soldier who had helped him previously. Once again, the soldier expressed at least some measure of hesitation. When asked why an entire lair of innocent creatures needed to be eradicated in order to destroy a single transmitter, the sergeant simply remarked that it would \"save time,\" and that \"bugs were bugs.\" This was apparently enough of an explanation to satisfy the soldier's sensibilities, who then went on to destroy the entire lair, guarded by a group of five thugs. All the thugs were killed, and when the soldier returned to CX-425 to report news of this success, the sergeant simply remarked \"good job,\" and that he had no further duties for the soldier to carry out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a stormtrooper sergeant for the Galactic Empire, CX-425 exhibited a ruthlessly unforgiving demeanor. When a medical supply depot was spotted giving supplies to a single Rebel, CX-425 assumed that everyone at the depot was a Rebel sympathizer, and therefore deserved to die. He also believed that anyone who did not have the stomach to destroy the depot, was not worthy of being called a soldier. CX-425 exhibited a similar ruthless, and uncaring disposition when it came to destroying a hidden Rebel transmission relay. When he learned that the transmitter was hidden in a lair of klikniks, CX-425 requested that the entire lair be destroyed altogether. When asked by the soldier tasked with this responsibility why this was necessary, CX-425 simply remarked that it would save time. He also expressed something of a flippantly xenophobic attitude towards the creatures, claiming that \"bugs were bugs.\" Whenever his missions were dutifully accomplished by the Imperial soldier, CX-425 would express a curt measure of gratitude. For instance, after successfully attacking the suspected Rebel kliknik lair, CX-425 told the soldier \"good job.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a member of the Imperial Stormtrooper Corps, CX-425 wore standard white-colored stormtrooper armor.

If CX-425 was ever included as an NPC, then the character was removed from the game before its existence could be properly verified. According to an archived 2003 Star Wars Galaxies forum thread, a user named AcowebaAbi indicated that CX-425 could be found at an Imperial base on Yavin 4. In another archived 2003 thread, a user named RayBothan presumed a similar possibility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game's directory tree files and source data place CX-425 among the many NPCs who gave players simple kill, delivery, and escort quests. The files contain information for two of these quests, one of which would have required the player to destroy a \"Medical Supply Depot\" and another which would have required the player to destroy an alleged \"Rebel Kliknik Lair.\" Each of these quests would have awarded the player 200 Imperial faction points. At least one emulator project incorporates CX-425 and his quests, however, as emulator projects are not officially licensed, this does not constitute a definitive appearance. Because of the ambiguity surrounding CX-425's actual inclusion to Star Wars Galaxies, this article assumes the gameplay information to be cut, and that only the information contained in the Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to Lightspeed: Prima Official Game Guide is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
