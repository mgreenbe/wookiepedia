It had telescopic arms and legs, and an extendable torso and neck to fit into any size cockpit. It had a 360 degree sensor on the crown of its head, which provided excellent vision in all directions, including straight up. It had additional forward sensors to keep track of the ship's readouts and other sensor displays. It could also pilot the ship directly through a computer link if it was installed. It cost 17,430 credits new.\nIt was specifically designed for versatility and adaptability, and was able to pilot a much wider range of craft than the standard pilot droid. It could also perform extremely aerobatic maneuevers that were almost impossible to most beings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
