The Tionese established a proud ancient civilization within the Tion Cluster in opposition to the Galactic Republic established by both other Human colonists and the Duros in the Core Worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tionese divergence began circa 27,000 BBY, when a Coruscanti \"sleeper ship\" reached the Tion Cluster. The Tionese wasted no time, establishing a new society, including technological advancements like beam tubes and their own version of the hyperdrive. This local hyperdrive variety fused bits of ancient Rakatan technology with fixed-position hyperspace beacons, which allowed travel within a defined area but was dangerous when venturing outside the \"lighthouse\" network. This kept the Tionese isolated from the rest of the galaxy for millennia, though they occasionally encountered the growing Hutt Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From 25,130 BBY to 25,100 BBY, Xim the Despot (the son of a pirate whom in the Cronese Sweeps had carved for himself his own domain: the Kingdom of Cron), attempted to vanquish the rival Hutts and become the master of the entire Si'Klaata Cluster during the Xim Wars. This campaign included the devastation of the once-lush Hutt world of Ko Vari in 25,102 BBY. However, at the Third Battle of Vontor, the Hutts unleashed their newly-found army of Klatooinian, Vodran, and Nikto mercenaries on Xim's War-Robots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Tionese lore, Xim was killed in combat, though he had actually been captured by the Hutts and would die as a slave at the palace of Kossak the Hutt on Varl. However, his treasure ship - the Queen of Ranroon -escaped to the planet Dellalt, where it would remain hidden for millennia. Following the battle, the Treaty of Vontor was signed by the Hutts, Klatooinians, Vodrans, and Nikto. This treaty set the Hutts up as eternal overlords of the three other species and of the Si'Klaata Cluster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following that, Xim's empire collapsed into several feuding states, including the Honorable Union of Desevro & Tion, the Indrexu Confederation, the Jaminere Marches, the Keldrath Alignment, the Kingdom of Cron, and the Thanium Worlds. Later, the Tionese states came into contact with the Galactic Republic and attempted to conquer it by traveling on the Perlemian Trade Route though the Tionese were halted by the establishment of the outpost world of Ossus. During the Tionese War in 24,000 BBY, the Galactic Republic came into conflict with the Honorable Union of Desevro and Tion which resulted in the capitals of both governments - Coruscant and Desevro - being bombed by pressure bombs. However, the Republic won the war by using its agents to stir up trouble in Hutt space, thus worsening the divide between the Hutts and Tionese."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within a century, most of the Tion Cluster had joined the Republic, with the exception of Desevro, which chose to remain independent. As a result, the once proud Tion Cluster became a backwater. However, the planet Lianna became the headquarters of Santhe/Sienar Technologies sometime during the Galactic Republic era. Under the Galactic Empire, the Tion Cluster was divided the into three sectors: Allied Tion sector, the Tion Hegemony, and the Cronese Mandate (the former territory of the Cronese Sweeps)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
