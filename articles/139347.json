She believed that all questions could be answered by the Force and thought that most force-sensitives were better suited by the minimum guidance approach of the Force Adepts than by the more rigid structures of the Jedi. Rather than lecture her students, she would teach them through riddles and questions, hoping that this would lead them to discover their own paths to the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
