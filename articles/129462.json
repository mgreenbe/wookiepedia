Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Zannah used it to sneak up behind and impale the Echani weapons Jedi Master Raskta Lsu. She also used it to cloak her Master Darth Bane and herself while hiding in a secret underground compartment in Caleb's house. This in conjunction with the insanity spell fooled the Jedi into thinking her cousin Darovit was the last surviving Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
