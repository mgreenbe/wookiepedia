The Republic and the Mandalorians clashed there during the latter group's campaign to take control of the Core World of Duro. Called \"Mandalorian Triumph,\" that charge was two-pronged, with one element that began in the Dernatine system of Hutt Space\u2014which they had captured several years earlier\u2014and continued through the Charros system. The Mandalorians were able to conquer the system during the battle. That part of their Coreward advance to Duro was later halted when Republic forces were able to defend the Randon system of the neighboring Mytaranor sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle in the Charros system was mentioned in the 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas, written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
