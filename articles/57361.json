As dealing with most unlawful activities fell under the jurisdiction of the TransGalMeg Industries, Incorporated corporate guards, the responsibilities of the Grig police department revolved around keeping the native Nargans peaceful. One of their main duties involved the confiscation of all weapons, such as knives and axes from the farmers. The majority of the Grig police department were recruited from the village police forces that had existed prior to TransGalMeg taking control of the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
