This strategy was used mostly to wipe targets that were in close proximity, like regular ground troops, or was used to easily deal with large heavy targets. However, the tactic was imprecise, especially if the target was moving."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While orbital bombardment could be used to devastate a planet, like Base Delta Zero, it was more commonly used for military strikes to decimate a target area, and not an entire planet. Base Gamma One was a code in the Imperial Navy for a bombardment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Grievous used this tactic against Darth Maul and the Shadow Collective by bombarding the Black Sun base of Ord Mantell before landing his troops on the planet.

The victory helped grow the navy's reputation, though its bombardment had been fired when there were still ground troops on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orbital bombardment was a common tactic among the Galactic Empire. During the Galactic Civil War, when Agent Kallus found the Ghost crew on the planet Seelos, Admiral Kassius Konstantine proposed to kill all the rebels with an orbital strike. Agent Kallus however preferred to operate a ground attack, using All Terrain Armored Transports. During the Battle of Atollon, Grand Admiral Thrawn deployed an orbital strike against Chopper Base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later during the war both Rebels and Imperials ordered orbital strikes against each other forces on planets like Hoth, Tatooine, Sullust, Endor and Jakku."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This tactic was to be used during the Battle of Hoth by the Imperial Navy. Lord Vader had planned to surprise attack the Rebel Alliance by jumping in to the Hoth system from hyperspace secretly and destroying the base via orbital bombardment, but failed to do so when Admiral Kendal Ozzel jumped too close to the system. This alerted the Rebels, who in return activated their shield generator, causing the anger of Vader, who blamed Ozzel for stupidity and Force choked him upon General Maximilian Veers reporting the blunder. Afterwards he promoted Firmus Piett to the rank of Admiral. Due to the failed attempt of bombing the rebel base, Veers landed AT-ATs, AT-STs and other ground troops to take care of the shield generator from inside it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the death of Emperor Sheev Palpatine, Messenger droids were sent to numerous Imperial officers bearing a hologram of the late Emperor, who commanded them to execute his final command, Operation: Cinder, an orbital bombardment campaign that ordered the purging and destruction of multiple targeted worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Liberation of Kashyyyk, Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck ordered three Imperial-class Star Destroyers to bombard the surface of the planet once he realized the planet's Wookiee rebellion had gotten out of hand."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First Order-Resistance War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the outbreak of the First Order/Resistance War, the First Order launched an attack on the Resistance base on D'Qar.
