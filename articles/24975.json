The colony was harassed, terrorized, and manipulated by Hutts, pirates, companies, and even various governments throughout its existence, but the Chagrians stayed true to their values and refused to fight even when the reconstituted Sith Empire attacked the colony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Founded by 3682 BBY, the Mindor colony was home to the mother and father of Fideltin Rusk, who was born in the colony that year.

In the year 3651 BBY, early during the tense Cold War between the Republic and the Empire, the colony suffered an Imperial attack during an illegal incursion into Republic space.
