Circa 21 BBY, the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 were captured by the crew of the Marauder and taken aboard the ship, where they were forced to participate in a gladiatorial fight. However, during the fight, the Marauder was destroyed by the forces of General Grievous, who ordered his battle droids to use the pirate ship for target practice. This vessel may have been associated with Ohnaka Gang."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
