Following the defeat of the Dark Jedi at the Battle of Corbos, the Jedi banished a number of captives to uncharted space aboard a starship. The captives were known as the Exiles, an assortment of Dark Jedi led by high-ranking Force-sensitives such as Remulus Dreypa, Ajunta Pall, Karness Muur, XoXaan, and Sorzus Syn. With the guidance of the latter, the Exiles' flight into the unknown was not without direction; after years of cataloging rumors and extracting information from refugees, Syn eventually led the Dark Jedi to the planet Korriban. The twelve surviving Exiles made landing at the Valley of Sleeping Kings on the world, and they were greeted by the native Sith people."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The exiled Jedi Knights found a haven on Korriban for practising the dark side of the Force, plotting and waiting to exact their revenge on the Jedi in the meantime.
