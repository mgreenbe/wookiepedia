The message was read by Ezra Bridger, a young Padawan in the crew. During his message, he assured the people of Lothal that, despite what the Empire claimed, he and his crew were not criminals, but rebels who were fighting for the freedom of Lothal. He urged people to look at the oppression that the Empire had brought to their world and to stand up against them, despite the loss and sacrifice it would require."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the message was only intended for the citizens of Lothal, the broadcast reached the ears of prisoners being held by the Galactic Empire. Two of those prisoners were Ezra's parents, Ephraim and Mira Bridger, who had been imprisoned years earlier for broadcasting similar revolutionary messages on Lothal. Though Ezra never identified himself in the message, his parents knew it was him and were inspired by what he said.

During the revolt, dozens of prisoners were able to make their way to freedom, but the Bridgers were separated during the prison break and refused to leave until everyone else made it out.
