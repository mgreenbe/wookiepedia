In all, there were 26 possible fates that could be met by this Padawan, some resulting in his being a hero, some resulting in grave consequences for the future of him and those around him, and some that ultimately seemed neither good nor bad on face, but were merely the result of a troubling conflict such as the Clone Wars.
