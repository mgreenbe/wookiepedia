Through the Omnicannon, the Gravestone was the only starship capable of battling the Eternal Fleet; the Omnicannon fired shots that propagated outward after hitting from its primary target, spreading damage to nearby ships. The Outlander's group's first use of the Omnicannon took out two dozen ships in a single shot. Another omnicannon was also used by the machine god Izax during his fight with the Outlander and a strike team, again used to fight the Eternal Fleet - now under control of the Outlander - but was interrupted by the strike team and Scyva before his demise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
