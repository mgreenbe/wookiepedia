After the death of Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine in the Battle of Endor, Governor Ubrik Adelhard of the Galactic Empire established the Iron Blockade around the Anoat sector to prevent the news from spreading. The blockade prevented Shortpaw's Trade League from sending starships outside of the sector, so the Chadra-Fan hired a young smuggler to probe the Imperial sensor network and find a weak point. With the Smuggler's assistance, Shortpaw located a gap in the blockade near the abandoned Hutt world Mataou, allowing him to send ships through."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, Shortpaw was contacted by the gangster \"Happy\" Dapp, who had formed a plan to raid Imperial intercept facilities and steal the contraband that the blockade had confiscated.

The Purge Troopers learned that Shortpaw had been in contact with Dapp, so the Chadra-Fan and Trade League became the purge's next targets. Shortpaw was forced into hiding, and many of his associates, as well as his grandson Tiquip, were captured and quarantined.

For many years, Shortpaw operated out of the mining planet Burnin Konn in the Anoat sector, where he played the unassuming role of a junk dealer in Longstar Marketplace.

Riley's younger sibling was also in the market during the search, and, unknown to anyone else, they were the one smuggling the crystals. The Imperial officer ordered the smuggler to stand next to Shortpaw during the sweep, referring to the Chadra-Fan as a \"thing.\" However, the Smuggler stunned the officer with a rat-stunner, prompting Shortpaw to question their rational.

Shortpaw then explained that it was the Smuggler's job to probe the Imperial sensor network, and Pali elaborated that the Smuggler was to travel to Mataou, fend off any security droids, and locate Hutt equipment to complete the task.

The Smuggler replied that they had when younger, joking that Mataou was the nicest place they had visited. Shortpaw then responded that the Smuggler would see wonders if they stayed with the Trade League. As Shortpaw finished, Pali noted that a new scanning station had been located, so the Smuggler prepared to return to the Hutt world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the Smuggler reactivated the second scanner and returned to Longstar Marketplace.

After the Smuggler activated the third scanner, Shortpaw excitedly informed them that only one more scan was needed. The Smuggler soon completed the task, and to Shortpaw's delight, the Trade League found a vulnerable point.

The Smuggler asked if the ship and cargo had arrived intact, and Shortpaw affirmed that they had. Shortpaw added that the Smuggler would receive a portion of the profits, before being interjected by the young human, who asked what the profits were from. However, Pali scolded the Smuggler, saying that it was not their business to know. The Smuggler then asked if more ships would be sent through the blockade, and Shortpaw replied that they intended to try.

Dapp explained that he planned to steal contraband from the Empire's four intercept facilities within the sector. To conduct the heist, Dapp intended to scavenge a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle from the wreckage left by the Battle of Hoth, a battle fought between the Empire and Rebel Alliance on the ice planet Hoth The shuttle would be used to land at one of the facilities; once there, the shuttle would be filled with contraband, and then a sensor jammer a nearby planet would be activated, creating an escape route. The process would be repeated on all four locations, guaranteeing a large payout. As Dapp finished detailing the plan, the Smuggler, who was also contacted by Dapp, arrived. Dapp asked Shortpaw if he wanted to be a part of the plan, and against Iria's opinion, he accepted, volunteering the Trade League's assistance in return for a modest cut of the profits and no connection to the crime if problems occurred. Dapp assured Shortpaw that everything would work out fine, and the Chadra-Fan then informed the Smuggler of their role in the plan's groundwork."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortpaw affirmed that the Smuggler had heard of Hoth, and the Chadra-Fan then elaborated, saying that the Battle of Hoth left wreckage scattered across the battleground. Continuing, Shortpaw explained that Dapp's plan required scavenging wreckage to reassemble an Imperial shuttle, although the thought of the cold made his fur bristle. Iria, who had made the run before, offered additional advice to the Smuggler, which Shortpaw suggested they listen to. When the Smuggler asked what Shortpaw would be doing during the runs, the Chadra-Fan simply replied that he would be preparing, also warning the Smuggler that any error would result in all of their deaths.

However, the maps were incomplete, and Shortpaw expressed his disappointment when the Smuggler returned. Iria deduced that the scavengers' maps were pieced together from Imperial transmissions, so the Smuggler suggested stealing data directly from the source. Dapp agreed, noting that Imperial survey teams and Viper probe droids still prowled the battleground. Decided, the Smuggler again left for Hoth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the Smuggler returned from the second trip, Iria discovered that the survey info was stored inside an astromech droid, so the Smuggler then completed another run for the droid.

B9-DT exclaimed that it was not for sale, and Shortpaw apologized to his new friend, recalling that it contained information they needed. Dapp sent the Smuggler back to Hoth, and when the Smuggler returned, the young human brought a sizable collection of parts back to Shortpaw. However, the Chadra-Fan informed the Smuggler that more parts were still necessary, and that another trip was needed for an Imperial codebreaker, a trivalve assembly, and a vortex stabilizer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Smuggler managed to acquire all the parts except the codebreaker, improving the moods of both Shortpaw and Dapp. However, B9-DT discovered that the codebreaker was being sold in an auction on Hoth by Bohento Splinth, the leader of the Wreckers scavenging group and a former associate of Dapp's. Upon hearing Splinth's name, Shortpaw was surprised, and when the Smuggler asked who Splinth was, Dapp merely hinted at their history. The Smuggler returned to Hoth, where they were forced to kill Splinth for the codebreaker. When the human returned, they asked if the shuttle could begin repairs. However, Shortpaw replied that they could, but with added difficulty, as Imperial survey teams were approaching the ship. Telling Dapp to prepare to continue, the Smuggler volunteered to slow down the Imperials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial forces near the shuttle were defeated by the Smuggler, and Shortpaw confessed that despite his doubts in Dapp's team, they had done well. Once Dapp and B9-DT were ready to depart for Hoth and make the repairs, they and the Smuggler left. The three managed to fend off attacking Imperials and scavengers, and the shuttle's flight capability was restored with a safety rating of two percent. Back on Burnin Konn, Shortpaw greeted Dapp and his team. Dapp praised the Smuggler's actions to Shortpaw, and the Chadra-Fan acknowledged that the young human showed more courage and loyalty than most people their age. Dapp told Shortpaw not to embarrass them, and Shortpaw explained that he was simply making a point before departing. Despite Dapp's project making progress, Imperial bodies were amassing, and the Chadra-Fan desired to remove himself from the risk of detection. When the Smuggler asked Shortpaw if they would see each other again, he replied that he hoped so, and that the human had earned a place within the Trade League (as long as debts were paid)."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Purge Troopers"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Weeks later, Dapp and the Smuggler followed through with the heist, and the young human raided the intercept facilities.

The Smuggler transmitted a copy to Riley and Dapp, who were at Carbon Score Cantina on Burnin Konn, and the human went to reunite with them. However, when the Smuggler returned to the cantina they found it had been torched by Imperial Purge Troopers, and Dapp had been killed. Riley, who survived the attack, told her sibling that the Purge Troopers operated under Commander Bragh, and that they had a deadly protocol: anyone who learned of the Emperor's death, as well as everyone they knew, would be targeted, quarantined, and executed.
