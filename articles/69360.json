He had it on hand shortly before Order 66\u2014a contingency order that forced all clone troopers to execute their Jedi superiors\u2014was enacted, drawing it in defense of himself and his Padawan, Cal Kestis. Despite his efforts, Tapal's considerable skill with the weapon was not enough to fend off the concentrated gunfire of numerous clones while simultaneously defending himself and his Padawan, and the lightsaber was damaged when a bolt sundered the weapon in two. Fatally wounded, Tapal gifted Kestis his lightsaber, knowing that Kestis had lost his own. With his last breath, Tapal told Kestis to trust in the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kestis kept his fallen master's saber with him during the five years he spent in hiding on Bracca, until he exposed himself to the Second Sister and Ninth Sister following Prauf's execution, drawing it in a vain attempt to avenge his death. He would continue to use the weapon throughout his adventures with the crew of the Mantis, putting it to good use against the various threats he faced and eventually repairing the damaged half, until it was damaged on Dathomir when a Force vision involving his master resulted in the shattering of the saber's crystal. Keeping the remnants of the weapon with him, Cal would eventually integrate them, along with elements of Cere Junda's lightsaber, into the new lightsaber he constructed on Ilum."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This lightsaber first appeared in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The lightsaber can be used with a blue, green or orange crystal, with the latter two becoming available after the introductory segment on Bracca. More colors become available on New Journey + mode, which also unlocks a non-canon red crystal option. By default and in flashback scenes, the weapon is seen with blue blades, which is therefore its canon color. The lightsaber can be customized with various materials, sleeves, emitters and switches."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a fan poll in 2020, the broken hilt version of the weapon was selected as the next replica saber to be sold at the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge attractions in the Disneyland and Hollywood Studios theme parks. Marketed as Cal Kestis' lightsaber, it is the first saber from a video game to be put on sale at the parks and will be available for purchase in 2021 at Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
