Widely considered a delicacy among Hutts, a broiled feejay was once poisoned by the thug Olag Greck, and served to a Hutt crimelord. When the target of the attempted poisoning failed to die, Greck blamed the feejay on the Indobok Pirates, who were in the Hutt's employ, and had them all sent to work in the crystal mines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
