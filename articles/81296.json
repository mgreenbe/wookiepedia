He stood at a railing looking out over the edge of the city and speaking to a human female when a fathier carrying the Resistance agents Finn and Rose Tico crashed through an archway behind him at high speed and lept over the railing. Pay recoiled in surprise at the sudden appearance of the fathier, which was followed by a herd of riderless fathiers also fleeing the city. Pay had blue, light-sensitive eyes which he shielded with over-sized droptacs. He had white and pink skin and wore the white and black Vestments of the Sacred Circle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Letrun Pay was portrayed by creature and droid performer Dee Tails in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, but prior to its release on December 15, 2017, the character was revealed in an issue of People magazine.
