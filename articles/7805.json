Smothered in black ash as deep as 300 meters, colonizers were able to establish a handful of settlements on the tops of the world's soaring mountains."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aplooine was lost to the Galactic Republic with the rise of the Sith Lords that rose to power with the fall of the New Sith Empire. As the Sith civil war broke out, the worlds of the Grumani sector were cut off from outside contact. As the civil war ended with Lord Kaan's formation of the Brotherhood of Darkness, the world continued under Sith control until the Army of Light defeated Kaan at the Seventh Battle of Ruusan. Following the Golden Age of the Old Republic, Aplooine joined the growing Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, seeking independence once more from the Republic. When the Republic was dissolved and the CIS defeated by the newly founded Galactic Empire, Aplooine was subjugated and forced under Imperial rule. As the Empire fractured during the Galactic Civil War, the Nagai raiders pillaged worlds along the Duros Space Run, including Aplooine. Later the same route was traversed by Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo as his campaigns drew him into the southern side of the galaxy. Aplooine's future involvement in the galaxy's political arena is unknown until it was conquered by Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire in 137 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
