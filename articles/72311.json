He was a friend of Bartol, who considered him funny. Julus was eventually taken by Drengir who had infested the planet, becoming one of four colonists to disappear. After Bartol encountered the Jedi Knight Keeve Trennis while she was searching for a missing Jedi, he suggested that they look for both Trennis' friend and Julus, believing that Trennis would like him.
