It was named by Hera for her ability to evade Imperial sensors. Although an old vessel with a few dogfight battle scars from the Empire, it still performed reliably. The ship had a nose turret gunner station underneath the cockpit section, with a dedicated gunner seat, and a 360-degree dorsal laser cannon turret midships. There were four main cargo holds. The vessel had a crew section at the front half, with the two forward-facing cargo holds making up the forward corners of the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ghost was equipped with both port and starboard docking rings, like a majority of Corellian light freighter designs.

Behind the cockpit was the crew's quarters, consisting of four private rooms. By the engine arrays were the two rear-facing main cargo holds which made up the rear corners of the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ghost had engines which were baffled, energy dampeners, and static jammers to make it hard to detect. These features and over eighty-seven illegal upgrades to the Ghost's stealth systems allowed the freighter to mimic solar fluctuations or cosmic radiation on many sensors. The Ghost had enough forward firepower to destroy an Arquitens-class command cruiser. During the ship's use as part of the early rebellion against the Empire, its captain Hera Syndulla escaped Imperial forces numerous times by activating its hyperdrive without charting a path with the ship's onboard navigation computer, relying on luck to avoid running into asteroids or supernovae.

The Ghost was part of a rebel starship attack formation which tried to break Grand Admiral Thrawn's blockade of the Atollon system. The primary aim of the mission was to facilitate Ezra and Chopper's escape aboard the Gauntlet fighter Nightbrother so that they could call for outside help. This plan worked, but the rebel forces sustained heavy casualties. Later, Hera, Kanan, Zeb, Rex, General Jan Dodonna, AP-5, and other rebels fled Chopper Base aboard the Ghost after the Force-wielding Bendu unleashed a destructive storm. The Ghost and the rebel convoy were able to flee into hyperspace after Ezra and Mandalorian reinforcements led by Sabine destroyed Thrawn's second interdictor vessel.

The Ghost remained airborne, waiting to pick up the infiltration team. When Commander Brom Titus discovered the presence of the rebel infiltrators, the Ghost was involved in a brief dogfight with Titus' light cruiser Marauder, which deployed several TIE Defenders. While Hera led the Imperial fighters on a chase through nearby canyons, Zeb manned the ship's rear cannons.

Mothma assigned the Spectres on a mission to Lothal to gather intelligence on the Empire's new TIE Defender.

This was a signal for a large pod of space-faring purrgil to attack Thrawn's fleet above Lothal.

Afterwards, Hera ordered Rex to bring up every star map along Ezra's last known path, but Chopper activated a pre-recorded hologram of the Padawan.
