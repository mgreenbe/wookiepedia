Cradossk exchanged her cracked egg to Liswarr'arindoo for a bottle of Kowakian rum.

She became famous among the Wookiees as a liberator and was given the name Chainbreaker.

He entered the ship through its airlock and made his way to the bridge. Rutallaroo and other Wookiees on board tried to stop Bossk but were all defeated. Bossk entered the bridge and confronted Chainbreaker, sitting in the dark in a mechno-chair. Bossk soon realized that Chainbreaker was not a Wookiee but in fact a female Trandoshan. She revealed that she and Bossk were clutchmates and when Bossk devoured her egg, he failed to kill his sister. She also told Bossk how she was given to Liswarr'arindoo and raised as a Wookiee named Doshanalawook. Bossk tried to escape the bridge but became trapped. In exchange for his freedom, and a private message to him from Lieutenant Masil Veit, Bossk reluctantly agreed to stop hunting Wookiees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
