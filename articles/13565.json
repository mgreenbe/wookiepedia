Following the sacking of Foerost, new battlefronts opened up across the galaxy because of the advancing Sith Empire. The Sith advanced on Roche and Axxila then invaded and conquered the Allanteen system, including Allanteen Six. At the highest extent of the Sith Empire, Allanteen remained under Imperial control as part of an isolated area of Sith space. It was used as a launching point for the Sith attack on Rhommamool."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Allanteen makes its only appearance in The Essential Atlas.
