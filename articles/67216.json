Having helped uncover corruption in the InterGalactic Banking Clan, Rush Clovis was appointed as the new head of the bank, only to be coerced by Count Dooku into raising interest rates for the Republic, at which point Separatist forces occupied Scipio to cement their position. The Republic responded with an invasion, allowing Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine to strengthen the Republic economically."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the appointment of Senator Rush Clovis as head of the Banking Clan, the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic met on Scipio to preside over Clovis's installation as the the new head of the Banking Clan. The Republic representative, Senator of Naboo Padm\u00e9 Amidala was accompanied by Clone Commander \"Thorn\" and a garrison of the Coruscant Guard's diplomatic service whilst the Confederate representative, Separatist Congress Leader Bec Lawise, was accompanied by several commando droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clovis was then blackmailed by Count Dooku to raise the interest rates on the Republic and not the Separatists. This allowed the Confederacy to take full control of the Banks. Commander Thorn and his garrison then came under attack by Confederate forces. Thorn informed Amidala of this as Hyena-class Droid Bombers destroyed his ships, including a dozen Republic gunships and a Consular-class Armed Cruiser. Separatist HMP droid gunships then deployed B2-series super battle droids and more commando droids, who surrounded and killed Thorn and his men. Amidala informed Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine and the Jedi. Dooku then arrived and had Amidala taken hostage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidala was brought before Dooku, and when she refused to join him, Dooku ordered her to be arrested. Amidala then grabbed a blaster and Lawise refused to arrest her, knowing the Separatist Senate would not authorize her arrest. Dooku then forced Amidala to shoot Lawise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Senate then voted to launch a counter-invasion. Dooku then left the planet and returned to the blockade when the Republic fleet under Jedi General Anakin Skywalker arrived. There, the Confederate forces in space abandoned their units on the planet and jumped to hyperspace. The 501st Legion then went planet-side to fight the Confederate ground forces. After finishing off the last of the Confederate forces, Scipio was secured. General Skywalker then stormed into Clovis' office to rescue Amidala. A blast then hit the office and Clovis and Amidala were then thrown off the side of the ledge. Skywalker grabbed both Amidala and Clovis. However, Skywalker was unable to hold onto both of them leading Clovis to let go of Skywalker, falling to his death. Skywalker was able to pull Amidala up."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, Senator Nix Card informed the Galactic Senate that the Muuns had chosen to cede control of the banks to the Office of the Chancellor.
