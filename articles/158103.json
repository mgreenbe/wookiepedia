The circuitry could be remodulated by removing a blasters barrel; at the end of the barrel, three static pulse adaptors interface between the galven circuitry and the XCiter. Interfacing the adaptor prongs to a computer system or droid brain allows for the circuitry to be remodulated from factory standards to allow for more powerful focusing patterns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The galven circuitry could many times be remodulated to allow for a significant boost in power - equalling that of a medium blasters output, in addition to the blasters current output. However, bypassing factory settings was hazardous to the blaster itself; many times the blaster would melt from the increase of heat and energy. Because of this, a blaster equipped with upgraded galven patterns was much more lethal than an unmodified blaster, at the cost of a much shorter operational life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
