The battle took place because the Mandalorians were advancing through a number of worlds in an attempt to conquer the Core World of Duro. This assault, called Mandalorian Triumph, brought the Mandalorian forces from their territory through the Nazzri system, which they took before launching their attack on the Vena system and winning there as well. Afterward, the Mandalorian forces passed through the Japrael system, where they had taken the planet of Onderon earlier in the war, to rendezvous with forces on Dxun, that planet's moon. The combined army then claimed the Ambria system before continuing Coreward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle in the Vena system was mentioned in the 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas, written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
