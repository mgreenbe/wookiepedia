Its sequel, Crimson Empire II: Council of Blood, was released later in 1998 and 1999. It is primarily acclaimed for the twelve-page final duel between Kir Kanos and Carnor Jax. In late 2008, it was claimed that work on Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost, Crimson Empire's second sequel, would begin; Randy Stradley later debunked this claim.

Time jumps forward several years to his first meeting with the Emperor and Darth Vader during one of their inspections of the guardsmen-to-be. Darth Vader challenges the most talented recruit, Burr Danid, to a duel in the Squall, a terrifying arena suspended over a bottomless pit.
