Upon Princess Fanry's fourteenth birthday, it was planned that she would be crowned as queen by the traditions of her people. After being crowned, it was intended that she sign the Governance Treaty to cede the power of the Pijali monarchy into a constitutional assembly, thus allowing Pijal to join the Galactic Republic. However, Fanry refused to sign the treaty and seized power, not wanting Czerka Corporation to control her world. The coronation was later deemed illegitimate by a Republic judicial ruling, as it was by violence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The coronation of Queen Fanry first appeared in Master & Apprentice, a 2019 canon novel by Claudia Gray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
