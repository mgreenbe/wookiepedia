Following the Mecetti Purge of House Pelagia, Melchi took command of the damaged EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Benevolence and began conducting relief efforts in orbit of Pelagon. Due to his efforts, House Pelagia rewarded Melchi by giving him the medical frigate and encouraging him to operate as a mobile relief ship throughout the sector. Melchi agreed, and began to assist in disaster areas and war zones. The operation was funded by the Great Council. However, the relief work was also a cover for Melchi's alliance with House Pelagia. Due to Melchi being able to move between provinces without suspicion, he also operated as a smuggler and spy, helping to restore prestige and power to House Pelagia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
