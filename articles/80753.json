They arrive, but are shot down by the Sith. Both survive, and with Jedi Wolf Sazen and Shado Vao helping them. Wolf engaging Darth Nihl in a rematch of their former duel on Ossus, Shado fighting Darth Talon. During the battle Antares admits that he loves Marasiah, with Marasiah replying only as, \"I know\". Jariah Syn, having recently found out that Cade was a Jedi, is having doubts about trusting Cade. On the other hand, Deliah Blue is impressed, wondering about how much credits they could make if they had a Jedi on their side. Jariah gets into an argument with Cade, eventually pointing his blaster at him. Cade then leaves the ship, angry. Cade Skywalker looks on the battle, standing still, having flashbacks of his father's death at the Massacre at Ossus. While Cade stands on, a Sith attacks the defenseless Cade, about to kill him. Then Marasiah jumps in the way and kills the Sith, saving Cade's life, but also getting seriously wounded herself in the process. Cade eventually gets up, picks Marasiah's lightsaber up off the ground, breaking his vow to never pick up a lightsaber again, and ignites it.
