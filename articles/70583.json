The Human herder Swilla Corey raised jerbas, working as a ranch hand near the Motesta Oasis, and traded jerba goods at nearby farming communities. Disaster struck when a sandwhirl and a pack of anoobas killed or scattered Corey's entire herd, forcing her to beg in Mos Eisley. There, she recognized the brand of one of her jerbas outside Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, and was informed that the creature belonged to the Pacithhip scout Ketwol. In fact, Ketwol had discovered and taken in several of the animals after they fled towards his ship, Swilla attempted to steal back her property, but the Pacithhip caught her in the act. The two came to an agreement. Swilla was given shelter and allowed to return to the desert with her jerbas, and often returned to visit her new friend."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Products made with jerba hide included jerba leather boots, worn by Leia Organa during her enslavement to Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and jerba-skin rugs such as the one kept by Obi-Wan Kenobi on the floor of his hut in the Dune Sea.
