Used aboard starships, items were placed in the unit and cleaned using a combination of broad-spectrum radiation, ultrasonics, and other methods to neutralize bacteria, viruses, and contagions. Synthtech Medtech Corporation made two containment units; the smaller Irradiator Box and the larger Irradiator Booth. Containment units were portable versions of irradiators. They were most often used by exploratory crews; captains made sure anything brought back from a foreign planet was placed in an irradiation box to protect from potentially dangerous viruses and bacteria."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
