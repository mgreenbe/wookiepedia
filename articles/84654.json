Many of these ships were part of the citizens' fleet, a gargantuan fleet that consisted of 14,000 vessels that fought against the Sith Eternal forces during the Battle of Exegol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The class of Star Cruiser was of Mon Calamari design. The Star Cruiser characteristically was equipped with a hyperdrive which gave it the capability of entering hyperspace at lightspeed, and was equipped with at least eight sublight engines. Two dual engines were located on the port and starboard aft section, while there were four larger engine units at the rear in a square formation. The Star Cruiser could be disabled when struck by powerful Force lightning. Characteristically of other Mon Calamari ship designs, the Star Cruiser had a bulbous hull with differing modules, and uniquely had two angled diagonal canards at the bow of the ship, along with a large dorsal fin near the rear midship and a smaller fin in the ventral section towards the rear. The ship's bridge was located on the forward command section near the bow of the vessel. It also contained a bridge tower at the rear of the vessel. The Star Cruiser was also equipped with laser cannons and two hangars on its hull on the port and starboard sides."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a capital ship, the Star Cruiser had the ability to participate in naval warfare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Cruisers were in service by the time of the war between the First Order, a military junta that succeeded the fallen Old Galactic Empire, and the Resistance, a paramilitary force with roots to the dissolved Rebel Alliance and the defunct New Republic. In 35 ABY, Rebel Alliance and New Republic heroes General Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca were dispatched on the Millennium Falcon to rally the citizens of the galaxy in order to reinforce the Resistance, which had traveled to the ancient Sith redoubt world of Exegol in an attempt to defeat the resurgent Sith Eternal, which had allied itself with the First Order, and save the galaxy from their rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Resistance forces came close to defeat and suffered heavy losses, an enormous citizens' fleet of 14,000 vessels from across the galaxy arrived at Exegol and participated in the Battle of Exegol, including numerous Star Cruisers. Reinforced, the combined galactic force and the Resistance attacked the Final Order, a massive fleet of planet-killing Xyston-class Star Destroyers that numbered above 1,000 ships. As the two Jedi Rey and Ben Solo fought the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious on the surface at the Sith Citadel, Darth Sidious gained Force power from the Force dyad between Rey and Solo, and afterwards unleashed a torrent of powerful Force lightning at the galactic fleet, disabling all the vessels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Rey regained her strength and confronted Sidious once again, the lightning dissipated and the fleet regained its foothold. Darth Sidious was then eventually disintegrated by his own power after Rey deflected his lightning, finally killing him. The remaining forces of the Sith Eternal on Exegol were annihilated, and an uprising against the First Order took place throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Cruiser first appeared in the final installment of the Star Wars saga and the sequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker. The Star Cruiser was created when post-production needed more ships for the citizens' fleet by Lucasfilm Ltd. art designer James Clyne. In his social media post, James Clyne clarifies that the ship is an MC95 Mon Cal variation. The MC95A Star Cruiser and MC95C Star Cruiser were respectively titled \"Mon Calamari Cruiser Variations A\" and \"Mon Calamari Cruiser Variations C,\" corresponding to their names. Identically, the Star Cruiser is titled \"Mon Calamari Cruiser Variations B.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
