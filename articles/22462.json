Although his infamy grew during the Clone Wars in particular, Bane had a high standing amongst other bounty hunters, working with the likes of Aurra Sing years before the onset of the war. He even had a temporary alliance with the Sith Lord Darth Maul. He specialized in fighting Jedi and dueled with some of the most skilled Jedi during the Clone Wars, including Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. His reputation led him to be repeatedly hired by the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, working for him on numerous projects, including infiltrating the Jedi Temple to steal a kyber memory crystal containing a list of Force-sensitive children throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane was later hired by Jabba the Hutt to free Jabba's uncle, the gangster Ziro Desilijic Tiure, out of Republic prison.

Later into the war, Bane was brought in by Count Dooku to participate in the Box, surviving the deadly challenge before being appointed the leader of Dooku's plot to kidnap the Supreme Chancellor.

Eval was highly involved in a Separatist plan to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and was also planning on recruiting Bane for his plan. Not long thereafter, Eval became interested in recruiting Rako Hardeen, a bounty hunter, who was imprisoned for killing Obi-Wan Kenobi, after watching him fight with some of the inmates. Eval had Hardeen brought to his own cell to talk with him and introduced him to Bane, who had a strong dislike of Hardeen and was definitely not in for breaking Hardeen out as well, so Eval had Hardeen brought back to his cell.

Bane's plan was to escape the facility via the mortuary, but the lock of the mortuary doors had been changed and Bane was unable to open them. Hardeen told his comrades to stand guard while he figured it out and secretly used the Force to open the lock. The three quickly climbed into the coffins meant to send the victims of the riot to the cremation center. The clones in the cremation center found out that the people in the coffins were still alive. The trio quickly climbed out of the coffins. One of the clones tried to shoot Bane, who used another clone to shield himself from the blast, before disarming and killing the clone that shot with his own gun. Hardeen disarmed the third clone, but hesitated to kill him. The clone triggered the alarm before Bane executed him. Bane angrily asked Hardeen why he didn't take the shot, and Hardeen claimed that his blaster jammed. The trio made their way to a landing platform, Bane shooting more guards in the process. They stole a police speeder and used it to fly to the docks, where they stole a cargo ship from a Quarren pilot, which they used to escape Coruscant.

Bane then spotted the hat of fellow contestant Bulduga and asked the bounty hunter how he got it. Bulduga responded by drawing his blaster pistol, but Bane was faster and shot Bulduga in the chest, killing him in front of his brother Onca.

When the platforms started to rise too much towards the ceiling the group found themselves between getting crushed by the ceiling and a layer of dioxis below them. Hardeen deduced that the way out of the room wasn't in the ceiling but was somewhere in the floor.

Hardeen discovered a pattern in the way the columns shoved in and out and noticed it led to a hole in the ceiling of the room. He showed his discovery to Bane, who told him to go to the hole.

The ray shield appeared and started to close in on the group. After a while the floor became ray shielded as well, killing Jakoli and forcing the rest on a platform in the center of the room. When Derrown wanted to take the serum, Bane protested, but Hardeen told him to let Derrown take the serum as he was a Parwan and his blood could take the serum. When the ray shield closed in more and more, the platform became smaller and smaller, and Mantu was killed by the shield.

Hardeen then took the sniper rifle and made an attempt as well, successfully hitting the target three times. Although Hardeen completed the task, Eval moved the platform to separate Hardeen from the others. Dooku had noticed that Hardeen had been the cause of success on every test and planned on putting Hardeen in charge of the mission rather than Eval. Eval wanted Hardeen to hit some more targets. Hardeen hit another four, but then the rifle was empty and Eval saw his chance to get rid of him. When he tried drop Hardeen in the flames, Bane used one of his wrist cables to prevent Hardeen from falling. Eval was angry with this, but Bane told him that if he wanted to kill Hardeen he should do it like a man in a fair fight. Dooku agreed and dropped Eval in the room to fight Hardeen face to face. Eval didn't play fair and used his remote control to activate a few traps in the room and sent in some probe droids to kill Hardeen. Nevertheless, Hardeen defeated Eval eventually, and Dooku ordered Hardeen to finish Eval off. Hardeen, being a Jedi in disguise, refused to kill Eval, to Dooku's disappointment.
