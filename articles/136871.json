In 44 ABY, she served aboard the ChaseMaster frigate Winged Dagger under the command of Captain Syndor. Syndor was replaced by Leeha Faal, however, at the orders of High Lord Sarasu Taalon. Later, during their mission to the Maw, Sumar was appointed to attend to Faal's body while Faal Mind Walked beyond shadows. However, while there, Faal was killed, and her body spasmed and her brain activity flatlined.
