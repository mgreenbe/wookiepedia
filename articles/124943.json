Roger notifies Zander of the violent snowstorms on the surface, so Zander tries to lose their pursuers by flying through one. All but Naare cannot see through the weather, and she uses the Force to sense her way through and fires at the StarScavenger. The StarScavenger takes several hits but Rowan uses the Force to fly the ship to safety. With Rowan's guidance, Zander narrowly avoids crashing the StarScavenger into a mountain.

As they traverse through the cave system, Rowan and his siblings are startled by something. Meanwhile, Graballa's henchmen including Baash, Raam, and Yeppau dig the Rancor's Fist out of the snow while Dengar hides behind a rock.

Unfortunately, the crystal was a keystone to a natural-made booby trap and causes a cave-in. Thinking fast, Rowan uses his new lightsaber to help them escape back to the surface.

These Imperials turn out to be Ensign Durpin and Sub-Ensign Plumestriker, two disgraced Imperial officers who had been reassigned to Hoth after the destruction of the Emperor Palpatine Museum on Naboo. While Durpin was happy at being reassigned to a quiet posting, Plumestriker regarded it as a punishment and sought to get back into the Empire's good books.

In the scuffle, though, Plumestriker manages to send a distress signal and the Freemakers know it's a matter of time before Naare and her company arrives.
