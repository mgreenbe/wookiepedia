Around 22 BBY, CT-9/85 served as a naval communications technician on the supercruiser Nexu, under the command of Mon Calamari Admiral Arikakon Baraka. At that time, the Nexu was stationed over Vandor-3 for a clone trooper training program on the planet. Shortly afterward, the Nexu was dispatched to the Outer Rim world Ord Cestus in order to support Jedi Masters Kit Fisto and Obi-Wan Kenobi in their mission to stop the production of JK-13 security droids on the planet's surface. While CT-9/85 remained with the Nexu in orbit, the Republic ground forces ran into trouble and ordered that the Nexu carry out an orbital bombardment on ChikatLik, the capital of Ord Cestus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, CT-9/85 received a signal from one of the ARC troopers accompanying Fisto and Kenobi on priority sequence. When CT-9/85 informed Baraka of the signal, the Mon Calamari went to CT-9/85's station and asked for the data content of the message that was contained in the signal. The message stated that the Nexu should change the coordinates for the orbital bombardment to a location east of the Kibo Lake, on Ord Cestus. After Baraka checked the position, he ordered the Nexu to open fire on the designated location, wiping out the Five Families of Cestus Cybernetics, an organization in league with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
