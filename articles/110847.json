During the Great Hyperspace Disaster, he assisted in the effort to save the Hetzal system from hyperspace debris. On the Rooted Moon of Hetzal Prime, Barocci wound up on a tower farm, assisting a family whose daughter had suffered a seizure due to the stress of the system-wide evacuation order. He was then called to lend his assistance to a widespread effort directed by Jedi Master Avar Kriss to shunt a liquid tibanna tank off of a collision course with one of the Hetzal system's three suns, an R-class star which could wipe out all life in the system if the tibanna collided with it. While the effort was going on, Barocci, exhausted, fell to his death off of the twenty-story-tall tower farm, although he had succeeded in calming the daughter's crisis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rah Barocci first appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
