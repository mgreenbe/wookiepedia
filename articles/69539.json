The factory was originally used to manufacture Hyperdrive engines for TIE Advanced fighters, that could also be mounted onto TIE Defenders. After driving of Zaarin's forces, the Java, which carried a boarding crew, was the first to dock with the facility and capture the factory then jump into Hyperspace.
