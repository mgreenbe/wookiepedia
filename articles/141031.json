Their mandate had two main objectives; to analyse enemy technology and determine how it functioned, and to supply Intelligence with hardware to counter it. Tech was full of brilliant and skilled scientists and technologists who used the branch's generous budget to supply Intelligence agents with superior technology. The administration, drawn from the ranks of the branch, however, were unable to properly decide on research priorities that lay outside their field of expertise.
