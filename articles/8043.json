Trumpet-shaped, violet, and pungent, they were a rare weed from the world's plains. When they died, the petals would fold up and trap the seeds, which were then used as baby rattles. However, after the destruction of Alderaan it took on new significance for the survivors. According to folklore, if a woman found one growing in her lawn, it meant that she would soon have a child. As a result, relatives of newlyweds would plant them in the couple's yard at night following the wedding; it was considered unlucky to get caught planting them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
