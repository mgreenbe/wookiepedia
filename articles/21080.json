The Bryar rifle had the same ability as the pistol: it could fire a 'charge,' one large shot as opposed to the weaker and smaller, although faster, shots.

The Bryar rifle was heavy, and less accurate than other types of blaster rifles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morgan Katarn gave a Bryar rifle to his son, Kyle Katarn, as a parting gift on the eve of his induction to the Imperial Academy, but Morgan sawed it down into a Bryar pistol so that it wouldn't appear quite as old-fashioned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
