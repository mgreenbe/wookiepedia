The strike force was stymied when the technician Tendaar Bel scrambled the Imperial IFF codes, allowing the Soaring Dactillions, flying prototype A-wings, to route the force. All but two of the Rebel pilots were killed in the assault, although the base was spared. The squadron proved that the A-wing featured superb qualities.
