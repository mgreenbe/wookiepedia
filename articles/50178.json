It started with the Millennium Falcon's arrival and landing attempt, before a First Order fleet arrived, sending three TIE fighters after the Falcon, which was able to destroy all of them. Afterwards, the Falcon landed at Risky, and Geoff Keighley exited as a hologram, welcoming everyone, before bringing out Ben Schwartz, in character as a stormtrooper named \"FN-143.\" Shortly after, the pair welcomed director J.J. Abrams out in front of the crowd, who discussed The Rise of Skywalker, and provided a vote for what the players thought the scene would be, between Darth Jar Jar, a Jedi mind trick, the Knights of Ren and a Rey and Kylo power ballad; ultimately, the mind trick had the most votes which turned out to be the correct scene."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The live event showed a small clip from The Rise of Skywalker, in which Rey, Finn and Poe board the Steadfast, ending with Rey using a mind trick to make the stormtroopers allow their entry. Following it, a new vote took place allowing players to select their favorite lightsaber color, but the fleet of Star Destroyers returned, causing the trio to quickly rush back onto the Falcon. As they left, Sheev Palpatine's voice was heard as the players entered slow-motion, stating that it was the \"day of the Sith.\" Immediately after, players were granted access to lightsabers \u2013 of the color they chose in the previous vote. The rest of the game was a team deathmatch using lightsabers only."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the event, Fortnite X Star Wars properly took form, with TIE fighter crash sites scattered around the map, and lightsabers were added to the game for a limited time, along with First Order Blaster Rifles which could be found at the crash sites."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Gameplay"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fortnite X Star Wars brought lightsabers into the world of Fortnite, allowing players to choose between Kylo Ren's, Rey's, Luke Skywalker's and Mace Windu's.
