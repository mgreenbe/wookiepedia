During the Sith\u2013Imperial War, the Galactic Alliance used them to command small squads of special forces, with disastrous results, as the droids were far too willing to sacrifice the life of troops under their command. After that, the LON-29s were used exclusively to lead other droid troops. Under Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, the droids were restricted to civilians, though corporations could still order them on a regular basis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Krayt used several LON-29 battle droid commanders as training droids for his Sith underlings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
