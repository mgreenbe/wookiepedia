One of their team, Karhel, was apprehended by the Sith Empire and was about to give up the information on other agents when a fellow Republic citizen approached Jaysa. She planned to signal an escape, but couldn't do it without a massive distraction. For that end, she asked the Republic citizen to help her start a prison riot to cover the escape by releasing several dangerous criminals. After the prisoners broke out, one of them releasing a Rancor on his own, Jaysa thanked the individual and signaled call-signs Two-Moon and Star-Killer to abort their assignments and return to base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
