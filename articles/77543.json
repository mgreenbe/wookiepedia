Tander was stationed on Nar Shaddaa, under Bureau Chief Rieekan. Out of fear that their agents had been compromised, Tander sent an omega alert to their field agents, but only half responded. Tander argued that the unit should abandon their base, but Rieekan refused to move their base and compromise their current operations.
