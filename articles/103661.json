Herders appointed by the communal organization attended to the large, peaceful flocks of the native shaak species that grazed upon the fertile, idyllic upland meadows in spring and summer, as the shaaks were susceptible to stubling off cliffs near waterfalls or becoming stuck on rocky ledges. In springtime, the meadows became the setting for the Festival of Glad Arrival."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pastoral Collective was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon in the fifty-forth issue of the Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon series of magazines, published by De Agostini around January 13, 2016.
