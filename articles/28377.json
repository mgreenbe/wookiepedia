As a member of the Jedi Order, he built a green lightsaber and earned a seat on the Jedi High Council during the Separatist Crisis after the death of Jedi Master Yarael Poof. In 22 BBY, he was present on the Council when an attempt on Senator Amidala's life was discussed. It was decided that Anakin Skywalker was to accompany Amidala to her home planet of Naboo while Obi-Wan Kenobi investigated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the Council learned of the Separatist force on the planet Geonosis, Trebor joined the Jedi assault team led by Mace Windu and traveled to Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He fought in the Petranaki Arena, igniting his green-bladed lightsaber whilst standing with Jedi Knight Bultar Swan. During the battle, Trebor infiltrated the stands and confronted Count Dooku on a balcony, aiming to kill him and hopefully halt a prospective war before it began. The bounty hunter Jango Fett fired at Trebor, who was able to deflect two shots from Fett's blaster before a third struck him in the shoulder and then a fourth in his chest, knocking him over the balcony railing and sending him falling to his death on the arena floor. After his brief time on the Council ended with his death, Trebor was succeeded by Master Kit Fisto."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A hulking Vurk, Trebor was revered for his meditation skills and brought many difficult disputes to a harmonious end.
