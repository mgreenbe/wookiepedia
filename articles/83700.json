These include role-playing games (RPG), such as the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic franchise; real-time strategy games (RTS), such as Star Wars: Empire at War and its expansion pack; first- and third-person shooters (FPS), such as the Jedi Knight series; and a continued run of flight simulators, such as both the X-Wing series and the Rogue Squadron series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LucasArts kept interests in non\u2013Star Wars titles as well.

While six of the ten games in the first wave were related to Star Wars or Indiana Jones, classic adventure games such as The Dig and Loom were also included. More are expected to follow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In December 2012, Lucasfilm was bought by The Walt Disney Company. This was followed on April 3, 2013 by LucasArts shut down of its development and publishing offices, in order to minimize the company's \"financial risk\". Most of its 200 employees were fired in the process, and development of Star Wars: 1313 and Star Wars: First Assault were stopped. The remaining staff, fewer than ten persons, were to continue LucasArts licensing activities, to coordinate with future partners publishers and developers and, in theory, encompass a broader range of quality Star Wars games. As a direct consequence, Industrial Light & Magic also had to layoff some of its workforce, as it shared them with LucasArts, and the absence of video games and animated series project left the company overstaffed. Two month later, on May 6, it was announced that Disney Interactive and Electronic Arts signed a multi-year, multi-title exclusive contract. While EA would focus on high quality products, Disney Interactive retained the rights to produce games for more \"casual audiances\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars games developed by LucasArts"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars games licensed by LucasArts"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
