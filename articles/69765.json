Saresh attempted to eliminate the term limits so she could serve indefinitely, but her efforts were foiled behind the scenes by the spymaster known as the Shroud. Nonetheless, Jebevel Madon was little more than a puppet ruler for Saresh. In 3630 BBY, the Chancellor sent a message to the Commander after Saresh attempted to seize control of the Alliance, and Madon expressed distaste at Saresh's machinations and private support for the Outlander. Chancellor Madon resigned sometime afterwards and Galena Rans, wife of retired Supreme Commander Rans, was elected as Chancellor in the aftermath of Madon's resignation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the player killed Jace Malcom during the Iokath storyline, a news broadcast in the flashpoint \"A Traitor Among the Chiss\" states that Chancellor Madon resigned, and the Republic had an interim chancellor named Galena Rans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
