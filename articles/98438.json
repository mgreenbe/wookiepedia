Each scout inducted into the Nova Core had at least two years working in the Scout Service, and had visited at least five new planets. Entry requirements were strict; prospective candidates had to be nominated by an existing Nova member, and there was a limit of four beings per sector who could be inducted. Nova Core maintained a Scout \"Hall of Fame\" honoring deceased scouts. Talek Var was the youngest inductee, and also the first to be inducted posthumously. Burt Jaxton was a retired Nova scout, and Ecclesis von der Agar was a decorated but befuddled member."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
