An alien Imperial officer with striking blue skin, red eyes, and an angular face, Thrawn was well known as a brilliant and ruthless strategist. He believed that in order to achieve victory in war, one must know their enemy. As such, he dedicated himself to understanding the philosophy, art, and culture of his opponents, which included the Twi'leks of Ryloth and the warriors of Mandalore. When Governor Arihnda Pryce requested a strong commander capable of defeating the rebels on Lothal, Grand Admiral Thrawn accepted the challenge, intending to dismantle the rebellion one piece at a time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before joining the Imperial Military, Thrawn served with the Defense Fleet of the Chiss Ascendancy. A native of the planet Rentor, located in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, Thrawn left his homeworld and traveled to known space where he encountered the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars. Following the Galactic Republic's reorganization into the Galactic Empire, Thrawn offered his allegiance to Emperor Palpatine, having deemed an alliance with the new regime beneficial to his people. With the help of Cadet Eli Vanto, Thrawn assimilated into galactic society, becoming fluent in Galactic Basic Standard and ultimately graduating from the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant. His career in the Navy was notably successful; after a series of promotions, he received the rank of Grand Admiral from the Emperor himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the height of his career, Grand Admiral Thrawn served as commanding officer of the 7th Fleet, the flagship of which was the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Chimaera. Deployed to the Lothal sector a few years after the start of the Galactic Civil War, Thrawn sought to defeat the rebels led by Captain Hera Syndulla. Following the Battle of Atollon, Thrawn's fleet worked with the First Legion led by the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom Thrawn once knew as the Jedi Skywalker, during a mission that resulted in the rescue of Force-sensitive Chiss girls. Resuming his task to eliminate Syndulla's cell, Thrawn and his forces were confronted by the rebels who intended to liberate Lothal once and for all. During the battle, the purrgil came to the aid of Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger and inflicted much damage to the Seventh Fleet. Thrawn himself was on the bridge of his command ship when the creatures surrounded the Chimaera and pulled it into hyperspace, taking both Thrawn and Bridger into the great unknown. In the years following Thrawn's disappearance, the Emperor and Vader were killed at the Battle of Endor, the Empire was decisively beaten at the Battle of Jakku, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic was reorganized into the New Republic. Thrawn's knowledge of the Unknown Regions proved useful to the Imperials that retreated from the known galaxy, however, as they were able to survive in unexplored space and eventually form the First Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins and service in the Chiss Ascendancy"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mitth'raw'nuruodo, better known as Thrawn, was a Chiss male who hailed from the planet Rentor in the Unknown Regions, a dangerous and uncharted region of the galaxy.

He had a Force-sensitive older sister who was taken from his family to become an Ozyly-esehembo, also known as a sky-walker, when he was three years old. Because the Chiss lacked technology like navigation computers, and due to the dangerous nature of the Chaos, the Ascendancy used these Force-sensitives as navigators to move through the Unknown Regions. This power, known as Third Sight, typically only manifested in young Chiss girls and disappeared by the time they matured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In school, Thrawn was taught the lie that the population of the Chiss homeworld and capital of Csilla of around 4 billion Chiss had entirely moved underground thousands of years prior due to Csilla's slow freezing; in reality, the majority of the population had moved to other planets, with Csilla remaining mostly empty of citizens. He eventually came to attend an academy on Rentor, where he attracted the attention of Mitth'oor'akiord, the Patriarch of the Mitth family commonly known as Thooraki. Thooraki pointed his friend Labaki, who eventually rose to become a general under the name of Ba'kif, to take notice of Vurawn and point Mitth'urf'ianico towards the cadet. After a visit from Thurfian, Vurawn was quickly accepted into the Mitths as a merit adoptive, and gained the new name Mitth'raw'nuru, thus making his core name \"Thrawn.\" He was then transferred to Taharim Academy on Naporar, taking all of his training and briefings for the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet at its complex on that world as well, instead of on Csilla. Thrawn later rose through the ranks to become a well-respected member of the Ascendancy to some of his colleagues.

At one point, when Thrawn was a Junior Commander and served as a pilot aboard a Chiss diplomatic cruiser, the Chiss had been faced with pirates attacking their shipping freighters in the outer reaches of their territory, off Pesfavri and Schesa, for several months. Concurrently, the diplomatic ship was tasked with heading to the planet Bardram Scoft to meet the new Prefect of the Scoftic government, given that their previous Prefect had been assassinated. To reach Bardram Scoft, the ship arrived at Guild Concourse 447, where they hired Pathfinder Qilori of Uandualon to lead them through hyperspace. Thanks to Qilori, the ship arrived at Bardram Scoft several minutes ahead of the captain's schedule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once they arrived at the planet, when Qilori came out of his navigational trance, he and Thrawn were the only ones left on the bridge. When asked where the rest of the crew was, Thrawn explained the ambassador was being prepared and that, in line with Scofti culture, the highest-ranking military officer needed to join them. He also explained that their ambassador would need to learn the protocols of the new Prefect, explaining that the previous holder of the title had been assassinated. Calmly informing Qilori that such actions were not uncommon in Scofti culture, Thrawn noticed a ship out the viewport belonging to another nation. When Qilori guessed it to be a Lioaoin ship, Thrawn explained it resembled the pirate craft that had been attacking Chiss shipping freighters. Though Qilori had heard rumors that the Lioaoin Regime had turned to piracy to save its economy, the Guild's rules about neutrality prevented him from telling Thrawn, and the Junior Commander instead suggested the pirates could be buying starships from a local producer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Qilori confirmed he had traveled to Lioaoin space before, Thrawn asked him if he could travel there from Chiss space or elsewhere, such as from Bardram Scoft. After Thrawn confirmed they were not presently heading into Lioaoin space, learned Qilori's name, and learned that he was mostly based at Concourse 447, the Junior Commander proposed that they could work together again in the future and introduced himself, stating he would specifically seek out the Pathfinder's service. Qilori lied to him by saying the prospect seemed wonderful. Unknown to the Pathfinder, Thrawn had become convinced the pirates were connected to the Lioaoin Regime and that Qilori at least suspected as such, given that such a secret would be hard to keep from the Navigators' Guild."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After meeting Qilori, Thrawn did research into Pathfinders, uncovering a deep secret that they could track each other through hyperspace. Armed with this knowledge, he proposed a response to the pirate attacks to General Ba'kif. During their meeting, Thrawn argued that the pirate and Lioain ships had notable similarities, but he suggested they attack the pirates alone instead of assaulting the Lioaoin Regime. Despite believing he would be able to tell apart enemy and neutral ships, Thrawn nevertheless promised he would take no action if he could not confirm such. Though he feared Thrawn may be overconfident and that such confidence could backfire, Ba'kif understood that continued pirate attacks made the Ascendancy look weak, so he approved the Junior Commander's request for three ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn then hired Qilori and traveled to the Lioaoin heartworld with the Pathfinder. Unknown to Qilori, another Chiss ship arrived as well, which was also guided by a member of the Navigators' Guild. Upon seeing Lioaoin patrol ships, Thrawn was confident their design was similar enough to the pirate craft to confirm his theory, though Qilori did not see the connection. Though their freighter was already too deep in the heartworld's gravity well to escape through hyperspace, Thrawn piloted the ship even further in to get a closer look. Such a path took their freighter closer to two patrol ships stationed at a repair center, but Thrawn believed the ship in the repair center had recently raided the Massoss system. Qilori protested, citing the potential outbreak of danger if the Regime was involved with the pirates, though his comment only served to make Thrawn question if he knew for certain they were. After he denied knowing anything, Qilori again asked to leave, as he knew Pathfinders on the Lioaoin corsairs could track him through hyperspace. Instead, Thrawn decided to remove any doubt among their foes that they were pursuing pirates. To the horror of Qilori, the Junior Commander sent out a transmission, confirming that he had found the pirates and ordering the second Chiss ship to flee."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After revealing the existence of the second craft to Qilori, Thrawn began to pilot their ship away with its thrusters on full. Though Thrawn slipped past a potential trap and ordered Qilori to take them to the Kinoss system, where couriers could take their report to Naporar and Csilla, the Pathfinders aboard the Lioaoin craft could still track Qilori, which was exactly what Thrawn planned for. During their journey, Qilori received visions of the pursuing ships, forcing him to revert to normal space on two occasions to regain his connection to the Force, but the Junior Commander remained silent during these pauses. Shortly after they had arrived in the Kinoss system and begun to follow the other Chiss ship, four Lioaoin corsairs emerged from hyperspace, fulfilling Thrawn's plan. Not believing Qilori's lie that Pathfinders' could not follow each other, he explained the Pathfinders' technique had been a part of the latest pirate attack, so he hoped they would arrive at the heartworld before those Pathfinders could return to their base stations. Because it had been Pathfinders who followed them, Thrawn had tricked the enemy craft into his own trap. The four enemy ships were suddenly confronted by a Chiss heavy cruiser under the command of Thrawn's colleague Irizi'ar'alani \"Ziara,\" a Mid Captain who suggested Thrawn and Qilori continue on their present path in order to have the best possible view of the destruction of the corsairs."}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "The truth of Csilla"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Being assigned his first command\u2014the patrol ship Boco\u2014Thrawn continued to serve in the fleet. Eventually, the Boco was needed to aid a starship liner owned by the Chiss Boadil family, as the craft, which had eight thousand people onboard, was being pulled into the upper atmosphere of a triple-ringed gas giant, having gotten too far into the planet's magnetic bands and radiation for the people onboard to be able to escape on escape pods by the time the thrusters had failed. Despite the major difference in mass, Thrawn's patrol ship activated its tractor beams to try to pull the liner out, creating a smaller wake several hundred meters in front of the liner as the Boco strained and failed to stabilize the Boadil ship. Thrawn sent an emergency message to Ziara, who had become a Senior Captain and the commanding officer of the patrol cruiser Parala. Although the journey through hyperspace took two hours and communication was impossible during the journey, the Parala did arrive, allowing Thrawn to contact Ziara and ask her to join the Boco off the falling ship's bow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although she gave the order to her helm, Ziara informed Thrawn that the combined power of both their ships would not be enough to pull out the liner, and Thrawn updated her on the crisis, informing his colleague that all onboard the doomed ship were gathered in the central cylinder behind currently effective shielding, that no other aid was coming, and that they had little time to act. Once the Parala was parallel to the Boco and had activated its tractor beams, Thrawn ordered his ship to drop its tractor beams and move towards the liner, having the Boco fire upon the craft with its spectrum lasers to take out the liner's portside and starboard wings, lightening the mass. Ziara understood Thrawn's plan as it unfolded, ordering her ship to use emergency power as soon as the starboard wing was shot off. As the suddenly lighter liner finally started to be pulled free from the planet thanks to the Parala's tractor beam, the Boco returned to the side of Ziara's ship, reactivating its tractor beam and thrusters to help. Over the course of fifteen minutes, the liner was pulled out of the atmosphere, the gravity well, and into safety. With all eight thousand people aboard safe, Thrawn contacted Ziara to thank her, and Ziara returned the favor by thanking his quick thinking, although she made sure to warn him that, with the fancy suites of the wings destroyed in the atmosphere, he would soon encounter opposition, as the passengers had likely lost many of their possessions in the rescue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having committed a questionable act that was not in the military's sphere of influence, as it only centered on civilian affairs, Thrawn was summoned to a high-level hearing on the Chiss homeworld and capital of Csilla, which he admitted to Ziara he had never been to as their shuttle approached the icy world. Ziara attempted to ease his worries, noting that he held a political advantage because passengers they had saved included Aristocra from at least five other Nine Ruling Families. Even so, Thrawn admitted he hoped his hearing did not come to be such a political battle before asking if the city they were approaching was the capital of Csaplar, which she confirmed and revealed was previously a center for culture. As their shuttle continued on its path to the southwest spaceport, from which Ziara and Thrawn would take a tunnelcar to the underground fleet headquarters, Thrawn noted his confusion that Csaplar, which he had learned to hold a population of seven million, could not support both the arts and their government, making Ziara promise to herself to tell Thrawn the truth about Csilla when there were less people to overhear them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn's hearing proved to be perfunctory and brief; although the Boadil representative demanded Thrawn be punished and possibly even removed from the fleet, three other representatives, who were at the hearing on behalf of three out of the five families who had members saved by Thrawn's actions, countered that he should instead receive a promotion. Thus, the meeting reached a compromise that ended with Thrawn nearly remaining in the same place as he had been, with the exception of the fact that, possibly due to a political favor between representatives, he lost command of the Boco. The news disappointed Thrawn, although he tried to hide it, and surpirsed Ziara, who apologized for the fleet's decision as they traveled back to Csalpar aboard a tunnel car. She also countered Thrawn's rational that he had cost the Boadil millions, noting that the liner's captain had been responsible for the crisis. Even so, she understood Thrawn had been blamed because the captain was a member of the Ufsa family, which was a political ally of the Boadil. As their discussion continued, Ziara informed her colleague that she had requested he become one of her officers aboard the Parala, which would also give him the convenient passage off Csilla he needed without the Boco. Instead of having Thrawn wait in a hotel, she also elected to show him he still had an ally in her by offering him the chance to spend his time on Csilla at the Irizi family homestead. Although Thrawn was concerned as to whether he could go to her family's homestead, particularly because the Mitth were rivals with the Irizi family, she finally convinced him when she revealed her grandfather had been a passionate art collector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ziara secured the two of them a two-person tube car that went across Csaplar, which she recognized was not meant to be used for someone as low in Chiss hierarchy as Thrawn; still angry at the hearing's outcome and wanting to see how long it would take for Thrawn to realize the contradiction between what he had been told of the capital and the actual city, Ziara rode with Thrawn as he stared out the viewport, and he noticed the lack of Chiss and occupied cars as they traveled. Vocalizing his concern after they had traveled slightly over a third of the way into Csaplar, Thrawn received an apology from Ziara for showing him the truth before she revealed that the entire planet had underwent an exodus thousands of years prior due to freezing, with only several hundred Chiss staying in Csaplar at one time to give the illusion of a thriving capital, while the rest of the sixty to seventy million Chiss who remained on Csilla\u2014a very different number from the supposed eight billion Chiss that official records claimed lived on Csilla\u2014lived underground, which was where she and Thrawn were heading. Thrawn quickly understood the tactical purpose of the deception\u2014as a possible enemy would waste time attacking what was effectively an empty planet\u2014but asked Ziara why she had shared the truth with him; she had revealed it because he thrived on having information. Furthermore, she stated he would be getting a top-level briefing on the subject in the near future. After agreeing to act surpirsed when the truth was stated during that meeting, Thrawn asked Ziara if she had told the Irizi about his stay in their homestead.

Thrawn agreed to do as she asked, but refused to hand it over until the best possible moment, deducing that the longer it stayed in the ISB, the more likely it was that Ghadi would get his hands on it by way of an inside man. Pryce argued that she was unwilling to wait, attempting to bribe Thrawn to give it to Yularen as quickly as possible. The two discussed the politics of military promotions and ship repairs, Pryce offering to use her contacts to both speed up the repairs of the Thunder Wasp and to get Vanto his long-awaited promotion. Thrawn was receptive to Pyrce's offers, placing a high value on Vanto's promotion and his ship's repairs.

The dispute between the humans and the Cyphari Afe clan was hardly Thrawn's top priority during the meeting, however.

Thrawn cautioned Joko against attacking Hollenside again, promising Joko that the situation would be resolved that night if he followed Thrawn's orders. Thrawn resolved to spend the night at the meetinghouse with Vanto, offering Joko stormtroopers for protection and ordering him to evacuate the surrounding area. Joko was hesitant, but followed Thrawn's commands after Thrawn promised once more that he would resolve the situation in a single night.

Vanto revealed that Tanoo had studied organic chemistry, and that his brother had been arrested for possession of spice derived from scarn. Thrawn found what he was looking for in the information about scarn, calling in stormtroopers and a TIE escort led by Lieutenant Gimm to their location. Hoping to stop the perpetrators from escaping before they could be arrested, Thrawn drew his blaster and opened fire, destroying the repulsorlifts of two of the landspeeders. After a short firefight, Thrawn and Vanto managed to stun all of the perpetrators and arrest Tanoo, interrogating him at gunpoint in the speeder he had attempted to escape in. Tanoo admitted that Polcery had designed the scarn smuggling plot and that he had been forced to participate as the chemist. Thrawn was unsatisfied with his answer, however, pointing out to Tanoo that he could have easily changed the formula slightly to make a far less potent and illegal version of scarn that Polcery would never notice. Tanoo, trapped by Thrawn's logic, admitted that Thrawn was too clever for his lie but quickly added that he had done nothing that Thrawn had enough evidence to arrest him for.

Meeting on the bridge of the ship to discuss the mission with Vanto, senior comm officer Lomar, Stormtrooper Commander Ayer, and his First Officer Karyn Faro, Thrawn discussed his belief that Nightswan was behind the theft of the frigate Castilus and V-19 starfighters that had attacked the Sempre but not behind the attack itself. Thrawn also called into question the motivation behind the attack, as Ayer revealed that the Sempre wasn't actually transporting stormtroopers when it was attacked. Ayer refused to divulge more, firmly asserting that the mission of the Sempre was classified and that only he and his troopers would be allowed aboard to combat the threat.

Moving carefully through the ship, Thrawn observed that only a few of the dead had blaster burns while the rest appeared to have been brutally beaten to death. Studying the bloodstains on the walls, Thrawn noted several that appeared to have been written glyphs or attempts at words. Moving deeper into the ship, Thrawn found himself once more blocked by one of Ayer's men who was in charge of guarding the troop quarters. Curious what the Empire was hiding, Thrawn commanded the stormtrooper to stand aside, asserting that seeing the contents of the troop quarters was necessary for him to deliver justice for the murdered soldiers. When the stormtrooper continued to insist that the room's contents were classified, Thrawn raised his voice, shouting in what appeared to be anger for the stormtrooper to step aside. Vanto was surprised by Thrawn's uncharacteristic anger, but once inside the troop quarters, Thrawn explained that it had been a pragmatic choice to appear angry in order to cut the conversation short. Inside the room, Thrawn discovered what the Empire had been trying to hide: the Sempre had been used to transport slaves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on the bridge of the Chimaera, Thrawn met once more with Vanto, Faro, and Lomar to discuss the matter further.

Focusing instead on the slaves, Thrawn asked what species the ship had been transporting, to which Lomar replied that he had used the ship's audio and the size of the restraints to determine that the slaves had been Wookiees. Utilizing Kashyyyk as a starting point and the Sempre's location as an ending point, Thrawn and Vanto managed to pinpoint the location of the Empire's secret slave-processing center as Lansend Twenty-Six, an old Separatist staging area from the Clone Wars. Identifying the blood marking on the wall as a Wookiee clan symbol signifying defiance, Thrawn deduced that there was a saboteur on Lansend Twenty-Six and that rescued Wookiees and freedom fighters would attack there next in an effort to free more of the Empire's slaves.

Contacting Colonel Zenoc of Lansend Twenty-Six next, Thrawn learned that the saboteur had already been captured and requested a holo-map of the station. Using the map to track the positions of the escaped slaves and attackers, Thrawn fired on the station, destroying sections of it to trap the escapees unharmed in section B-5. The threat within the station neutralized, Thrawn turned the Chimaera's attention back to what remained of the attacking frigate and V-19s."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the battle drew to a close, Vanto approached Thrawn, asking him what would happen to the Wookiee slaves.

Thrawn replied that it was entirely possible that they were actually indentured servants, prisoners, or had sold themselves into slavery voluntarily to pay off debts, but admitted that it was unlikely that the Wookiees were anything more or less than innocent captured slaves.

The planet, led by Governor Quesl, had declared independence from the Empire, and the Empire, fearing this might lead to another Confederacy of Independent Systems situation, commanded Thrawn to put down the revolt by any means necessary. Setting course for Botajef immediately, Thrawn turned to Vanto, Faro, and Senior Lieutenant Pyrondi to discuss the matter further. Pyrondi offered her disbelief that Quesl would rebel alone with the knowledge that the full military might of the Chimaera alone could stop their rebellion dead in its tracks, to which Faro replied that she feared that Botajef may just be one of many worlds prepping to declare independence. Thrawn listened to their theories without offering any of his own, and listened intently as Pyrondi described to him the follower nature of the Jefi people. Carefully noting the Jefies' tendency to follow anyone who presented themselves as a capable leader, Thrawn suggested that the best overall strategy may be to overthrow Quesl in favor of a new, non-insurgent leader.

Vanto feared that the mission was a set up by government officials and High Command designed to make Thrawn look bad by either painting him as a war crazed alien who wiped out a planet of innocent followers or as a coward unable to deal with Botajef's substantial planetary defense force and forced to retreat. Thrawn, however, felt confident as always that he would be able to avoid falling into such a trap. Shifting the conversation when Vanto threatened that a mess up could mean being demoted to an ore carrier like Rossi's old assignment, Thrawn once again brought up their investigation into the Empire's secret military project. Sharing his most recent research with Vanto, Thrawn revealed that he had deduced that it was a single large military project with a hyperdrive on a scale the Empire had never before seen. Thrawn admitted that he believed the product to be a foolish waste of resources, believing that it would be wiser for the Empire to pour their resources into a more flexible and mobile navy of capital ships and fighters. Hoping to check out the project for himself, Thrawn revealed to Vanto that he had used the vectors from the Wookiee slave ships and Rossi's doonium transports from Socorro to discover the likely location of the secret project's construction site. Thrawn told Vanto that once the opportunity presented itself, they would investigate it further. Shifting the conversation back to the present issue, Thrawn pulled up a holo of Quesl delivering his declaration of independence from the Empire. Pointing out Quesl's mannerisms, Thrawn noted that he seemed to be daring the Empire to fight back against him and theorized that the capital would be heavily fortified and that the planetary defense force would be deployed to keep the Chimaera at a distance. Closing the holo, Thrawn and Vanto returned to the bridge to discuss strategy further."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving at Botajef, Thrawn discovered that his theory about the planet's defenses had proved correct. The planet was defended from space by two CR90 corvettes as well as five squadrons of V-19s dispatched from the north-polar base and two squadrons from the south-polar base, and the governor's palace was fortified by five ground-based turbolasers. Confident in his ability to handle the situation, Thrawn ordered Starfighter Commander Yve to launch the Chimaera's TIEs to perform flybys past the corvettes and to form a screen between the Chimaera and the V-19s. A moment later, Thrawn received a call from Quesl telling him that he was invading Jefi space and was required to either vacate or be fired upon. Responding calmly as a means of buying himself time, Thrawn informed Quesl that his act of secession was in direct violation of a fictitious Clone Wars-era treaty signed by Botajef at the end of the war. As he spoke, Thrawn watched the TIE flybys, noting the slight twitch in the starboard corvette and the lack of reaction from the portside corvette. Having ascertained all the information he needed, Thrawn proceeded with his plan, ordering Yve's special unit of TIEs to destroy Quesl's turbolaser placements. As Thrawn distracted Quesl with his attack on the turbolasers, he navigated the Chimaera closer, capturing the starboard corvette in the Star Destroyer's tractor beam. As he did, Quesl gasped and stumbled, confirming Thrawn's theory: Quesl and the valuable Jefi art were on the starboard CR90 corvette. This information in hand, Thrawn correctly deduced that the insurrection had been staged to allow Quesl to steal and sell off the Jefies' valuable art collection. Quesl had intended for Thrawn to destroy the palace to cover the theft while Quesl slipped away during the ensuing battle. Thrawn also revealed to Quesl that the flyby had revealed that the starboard corvette had a human crew while the portside corvette had a Jefi crew; he had surmised that Quesl was on the human corvette as it was unlikely that a Jefi crew would aid in the theft of their own art. Thrawn drew the corvette in, promising Quesl he would face trial for his actions before cutting the transmission.

Yularen moved forward to inform the admirals and governors that the Lothal insurgency was being handled by Admiral Konstantine, and that the rebel activity on Batonn's Scrim Island. Yularen explained that Scrim Island's Imperial Garrison had been overrun by insurgents who had taken hostages and seized control of the island's energy shield and ion cannons.

In response, Nightswan revealed that his activism had begun when the Imperial demand for metals had led to him joining a splinter group of the Mining Guild dedicated to helping out the small businesses hurt by the rapidly forming Imperial metal monopoly. He went on to tell Thrawn that the corruption had eventually spread to the splinter group so he had set off on his own and become the mercenary Thrawn had met on the Dromedar. Nightswan closed his speech by telling Thrawn that once he heard rumors of the Imperials' secret military project, he'd joined the insurgents.

Discussing political ideals with Nightswan, Thrawn revealed that he believed that the Empire's tyranny was necessary to keep the galaxy in a state of order rather than chaos. The rebellion, he believed, would bring about a dangerous chaos that could allow the threat in the Unknown Regions to overtake everything.
