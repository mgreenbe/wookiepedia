It took place following the sacking of Foerost as new battlefronts opened up across the galaxy because of the advancing Sith Empire. The Sith first advanced on Roche and conquered the planet. Axxila then fell to the Sith invaders as another battlefront opened. At the highest extent of the Sith Empire, Axxila remained under Imperial control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Axxila makes its only appearance in The Essential Atlas.
