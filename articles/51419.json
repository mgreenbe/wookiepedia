A day after arriving on the planet Batuu in 34 ABY, G4-F2 called into the radio show Droid Station Frequency 3-7-6-4-3-7 on station BSO 401.72 to ask in binary where it could find an oil bath as its joints were aching."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The show's host, B6-24, informed the droid that if it was near Black Spire Outpost then the best place for an oil bath was the Droid Depot. She told G4-F2 that if it told the depot's owner, Mubo, that she had sent it then Mubo would give a twenty percent discount. G4-F2 thanked B6-24 for the advice and ended the call."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "G4-F2 was created for the themed land Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, which opened to guests at Disneyland Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios Park in 2019.
