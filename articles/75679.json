Receiving support and resources from the Galactic Republic, Tarr conceived of the array as a way to predict the Emergences of debris from the destroyed freighter Legacy Run, which had disrupted hyperspace travel across the Outer Rim Territories. Although suffering from overheating during its first activation, the array successfully carried out its intended purpose of calculating future Emergences."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
