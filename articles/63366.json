Vader, who had developed a respect for the governor, had asked Tarkin to hunt him as he had learned of Tarkin's past hunting on Eriadu during their time working together during the Berch Teller campaign. In the second day of the hunt, the group tracked Vader to a copse of thurian trees and surrounded him with flamethrowers before letting loose on the Sith. As they engulfed him with flames, Vader attacked the flamethrowers, resulting in the loss of four hunters. By the time of the ninth day of the hunt, the group had lost eight more hunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the final day of the hunt, Vader killed all the hunters except Tarkin, who lured the Sith into storm ground. As a result, Vader was severely injured by a lightning strike, and Tarkin called in his ship to pick them both up."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
