The tower and temple were located on the banks of the Solleu River, a large river which flowed through the city. The Livet Tower contained an eternal flame, the light intended to remind the Naboo of their mortality and their duty to lead harmonious lives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naboo funeral customs dictated that the ashes of the deceased were to be collected within two days of their death so their life force could return to the planet. Also as part of the funeral custom, their ashes would be cast from the bridge connecting the Livet Tower to the Funeral Temple, and their ashes would be carried over the cliff the river plunged over."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
