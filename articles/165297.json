But now they are about to embark on a diplomatic mission that will prove to be even more hazardous than all-out combat...."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The neutral world of Adumar has decided to pick a side in the war to control the galaxy. Delegates from both the New Republic and the Empire have been invited to Adumar, and each camp will be given a chance to plead its government's case. But there is one small catch: since the Adumari prize military skill above all else, they insist that both delegations be composed exclusively of fighter pilots. For pilot Wedge Antilles and his company, it's an unfamiliar exercise in diplomacy\u2014and one that's filled with unexpected peril. For once they arrive, the X-wing pilots are challenged by Adumar's fierce warriors and attacked by Imperial assassins bent on eliminating all competition. But these challenges pale in comparison to the threat posed by a rogue Republic agent\u2026one who is determined to win Adumar's allegiance once and for all\u2014even if it costs the X-wing pilots their lives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Adumar is an anomaly, settled by anonymous colonists during the early years of the Old Republic and isolated for centuries before being rediscovered. Because the Adumari holds starfighter pilots in the highest regard, Wedge Antilles, the New Republic's best pilot, is dispatched as a diplomat, taking with him Tycho Celchu, Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian, and Wes Janson. They are aided by the native guide and blastsword fighting champion Cheriss ke Hanadi, New Republic diplomat and former Y-wing pilot Tomer Darpen, and the New Republic documentarian Hallis Saper, who wears the head of a 3PO droid as a camera."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wedge assumes that he will somehow hammer out a treaty and bring the planet of Adumar into the New Republic, but it becomes quickly apparent that all is not as it seems. First, the Empire's best pilot, Turr Phennir is also on Adumar, and like Wedge is accompanied by three other pilots. Second, Adumar is not a united planet, and Wedge is only talking to its largest nation, Cartann. Third, the people of Cartan seem to like nothing better than killing others for bragging rights, and Wedge is expected to participate in this. Fourth, Iella Wessiri is on Adumar as a New Republic Intelligence operative and has been so for the past six months, although Adumar was supposedly discovered only a few weeks before. Wedge must somehow make his way through Adumar's bizarre culture while not offending his or their sensibilities, bring Adumar into the New Republic, and maybe try to get the girl as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Red Squadron spends its time learning to fly the native Blade-32 fighters, absorbing Adumari (or at least Cartannese) culture, and contemplating their largest diplomatic problem: the fact that Adumar is not united under a world government, and cannot enter the New Republic. The Empire, on the other hand, would have absolutely no problem simply conquering it and imposing a government. Thus, Wedge is delighted when Cartann's leader, Perator Pekaelic ke Teldan, announces the formation of a world government. Unfortunately, Pekaelic intends to create it via conquest. He also wants the Empire's and New Republic's diplomats to assist in the war effort. Phennir agrees, but Wedge, unwilling to compromise the New Republic's ideals, refuses. Between this and Darpen's willingness to sacrifice Wedge to preserve relations with Cartann, Wedge and his wingmen are forced to run \"the gauntlet\", braving mobs of citizens and pilots eager to kill them for honor, in order to escape with their lives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wedge and his wingmen, as well as Iella, Cheriss and Hallis, flee to the capital of the Yedagon Confederacy, one of the few nations that continue to resist Cartan's domination. There, Wedge is presented with a proposal: to lead the combined might of the \"rebellious\" nations in a military effort to overthrow Cartannese imperialism. Several nations that had previously bowed to Cartann defect to the newly-formed \"Adumari Union\" on the strength of Wedge's reputation, and Wedge ultimately leads an air force only half as strong as Cartann's, but far better led and disciplined. After an indecisive air battle, Red Squadron (with Cheriss's help) are able to reclaim their X-wings and neutralize Phennir and his TIE interceptor; the tide thus turned, Cartann is defeated and joins the Adumari Union. Negotiations with the New Republic begin immediately. The Imperials, bitter over their loss, send a fleet to take Adumar by force, but a combined New Republic and Adumari fleet manages to repel them. With the conflict on Adumar over, Wedge and Iella spend a romantic moment with each other, putting a positive note on their future relationship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
