Starfighters in the Alliance Fleet were used to watch over the meeting; upon the arrival of mercenary force, the starfighters were called into action to defeat the intruders. Fey'lya's ship, the Jade, managed to reach the Alliance's Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Liberty while the Alliance destroyed the mercenary starships. One of the mercenaries escaped his exploding ship and was captured after the battle. He revealed to the Alliance that his employers were the Sullustans, in an effort to cause tension between the two species. However, the mercenary group had actually been hired by the Empire in order to sow distrust within the ranks of the Alliance. Eventually, the mercenary's information allowed the Alliance to track the offending mercenary group and capture their headquarters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
