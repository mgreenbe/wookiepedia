When a Yuuzhan Vong earned the right to be escalated, they would sacrifice a limb, which the shapers would then replace with that of a creature native to Yuuzhan'tar. If the ceremony was successful, then that Yuuzhan Vong was favored by the gods, and allowed to advance. However, if the priests found a flaw or the implant was rejected, the Yuuzhan Vong was then declared a Shamed One, and passed to the lowest levels of society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While it was believed that rejection was because of the gods' anger, in truth it was the incompetence of the shaper who performed the escalation. However, on certain occasions, a shaper would intentionally cause an implant rejection, as was done by a Master Shaper Mezhan Kwaad to her former lover Vua Rapuung."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
