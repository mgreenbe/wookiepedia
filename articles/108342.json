A serious flaw was introduced in Version 4 of the launcher that caused ammunition to detonate, but Version 4 saw the power cycling issues that had been plaguing the launcher fixed. An attempt to mount the launcher alongside Celestial Industries' Powerhouse engine caused a test ship to explode, as interference from the engine played havoc with the launcher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
