One example was that solar towers were used a method of power for Cavik Toth's Trihexalon production factory. The towers produced a beam that could be used to power up the factory's core. The towers could be diverted if one was to damage or destroy the solar towers' control box. The towers would then point at random directions. The beams were powerful enough to severely damage\u2014if not destroy\u2014a starfighter if the fighter flew into the beam."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
