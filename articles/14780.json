Princess Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 were spared when they discovered The Keeper, who faked their deaths and drove the Imperial forces into retreat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after the Battle of Yavin the Alliance to Restore the Republic feared sneak attacks from the Galactic Empire. Feeling communication between Rebel bases was the key to preventing such an attack, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa were sent to the Akuria Rebel Base on Akuria II. Accompanying them were C-3PO and R2-D2, both to communicate with any droids on Akuria II, and so R2-D2 could navigate their scout craft through hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately a malfunction in R2-D2 caused by damage sustained during the Battle of Yavin sent them off course, and they emerged from hyperspace in the Keeper's World system, where they discovered an Imperial fleet consisting of a number of Imperial-class Star Destroyers. They were swiftly detected by a Star Destroyer, and the commander of the vessel ordered the Rebel ship captured."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite malfunctioning earlier, R2-D2's calculations coupled with Luke Skywalker's piloting skills allowed the Rebel scout craft to evade the tractor beams of the Star Destroyers, but not without suffering heavy damage and crash landing on Keeper's World."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first Luke Skywalker's band of Rebels believed that since Keeper's World was uncharted, they might be safe from Imperial pursuit. However, the Imperials soon detected the crashed scout craft, and the Imperial commander took a contingent of Stormtroopers to the planet's surface to capture or destroy the Rebels. This resulted in a running battle across the surface of the planet, with the Rebels seeking to evade the pursuing Stormtroopers. The presence of two droids slowed the Rebel's progress, driving them to hide in a ruined temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A mysterious device teleported the Rebels inside the temple, where they discovered the planet was not as uninhabited as they had previously believed. They met the strange androids Fire, Rain, Wind, and Earth, and their creator, The Keeper, an ancient computer tasked with restoring the war-ravaged world to its former glory before the return of the planet's original inhabitants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Keeper, fearing that the ongoing battle might disrupt her work, sheltered the Rebels while triggering a cataclysmic groundquake. This not only convinced the Imperials that the Rebels had been killed, but it drove them away from the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperials never learned of the Keeper's existence, and thus believed the groundquakes to be natural and the planet unstable. The Imperial commander warned all Imperial units to avoid the planet in the future, for their own safety. Meanwhile on the planet the Keeper repaired the Rebel scout craft, allowing the Rebels to continue on their mission to Akuria II, and leave the Keeper to her own long mission to restore the planet for her creators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
