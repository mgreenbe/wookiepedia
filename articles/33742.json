General Calrissian was informed of this and reached out to Versio and Meeko, asking for their assistance in stopping the Imperials. The pair agreed to help and were taken into Danger Squadron. Danger Squadron's X-wings then jumped into range of Naboo alongside the Restoration, the Mellcrawler II and other assisting starfighters including A-wings, B-wings and Y-wings. The starfighters began engaging the climate disruption arrays, destroying all that were in their path. Danger Squadron then turned their guns onto the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Torment and defended the Y-wings from TIE fighters as they began bombing the large vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the Torment's shields were down, Suurgav gave the Restoration the all-clear to open fire on the Torment. The Restoration's cannons devastated the Torment and its ground forces evacuated and mobilized onto the streets of Theed, Naboo's capital. The Restoration responded by sending its own forces down to defend the city. Shriv, Iden and Del were among them and were sent to bring the palace's defense systems online. They were successful, and an ion blast rendered the Imperial forces defenseless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
