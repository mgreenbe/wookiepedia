After the shields were brought down, Y-Wings were used to destroy the Imperial base. Then GR-75 transports landed near by and dispatched Rebel soldiers who then moved into the area to clean up any heavy resistance. Boba Fett escaped however. Many stormtroopers were taken captive and their base destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
