Its maximum atmospheric speed was 125 kilometers per hour. The ship also had a hyperdrive, although its navigation computer only contained pre-calculated hyperspace jump destinations to a select group of Imperial outposts\u2014in an effort to discourage thieves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its heavy-duty cargo lifter arms featured magnetic clamps on the underside that locked around the cargo. The load could be further secured by localized traction fields, as well as strong cable ties and winches of Steelton make. Energized tensile strength fields radiating through the arms helped the Y-45 withstand buckling under heavy weights."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not unlike Sienar Fleet Systems's Abecederian line of shuttles, the Y-45 could rotate its arms upward in landing mode, to save space in hangar bays and landing fields.

Its design went through several iterations, the last of which was infused with a 1970s design sensibility. James Clyne, Lucasfilm Ltd.'s design supervisor for Solo, described it as a utilitarian, \"Swiss army knife\" of a ship. It was he who added the caged gantry to the bottom, and came up with the arms' stiff movements, which were inspired by an image of Frankenstein's monster. Two of the early inspirations for the transport hauler, were the Recognizer from the 1982 cult film TRON and the United States Army's Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe helicopter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
