Like the Rites of Fire and the Cold Rites conducted by the ancient Sith at other sites along the Circle of Visions, the High Rites were undertaken within an elaborate volcanic cave system and involved the use of the rhak-skuri, an insectoid subspecies of diplura whose pheromones were known to generate nightmare-like hallucinations in certain humanoid species. Unlike the other rites, however, the High Rites were only conducted by the strongest Force users on Upekzar, most of whom lived in a city three kilometers away from the cave system in the shadow of a dormant volcano."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
