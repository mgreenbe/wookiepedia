He spent time jumping hover-sleds and vac-skims as a chlid and wanted to become a pilot. He served as a medical droid assistant at Echo Base on Hoth. While on Hoth, Zowlie often pestered rebel pilot Lieutenant Wes Janson about flying despite never even trying out a flight simulator. After the evacuation of Hoth, Janson recruited him into Commander Wedge Antilles' reformed Red Squadron after the Battle of Hoth. He was killed in an attack on a nearby pirate base, that threatened the safety of the Alliance's rendezvous point, where he was assigned the callsign Red Nine and flew a T-65B X-wing starfighter as Bela Elar's wingman."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zowlie was somewhat inexperienced when he was recruited into the squadron.
