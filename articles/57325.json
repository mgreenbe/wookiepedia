During the Battle of Kothlis, he remotely activated the virus which jammed the whole communication between the Republic forces. The Republic fleet continued their attack against the Confederate battleships and their technicians were able to restore communication by using older crystal bio-anode circuitry which were not affected by the virus. This forced the Confederate forces to withdraw."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
