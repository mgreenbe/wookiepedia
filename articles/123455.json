As a Force-sensitive, Itoklo trained in Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order. In 25 ABY, however, the galaxy was invaded by an extra-galactic warfaring species known as the Yuuzhan Vong. Blazing a path of conquest from the Outer Rim Territories toward the Galactic Core, elements of the Yuuzhan Vong leadership saw a threat in the New Jedi Order and its members, whom the invaders perceived as the galaxy's most powerful warriors.

Following the ultimatum, several Jedi were killed in quick succession, either by the Yuuzhan Vong, Peace Brigade collaborators, or the citizens in the galaxy who took the invaders at their word. Itoklo was one of the early victims of the purge; the Etti Jedi Knight was turned over to the Yuuzhan Vong in accordance with Tsavong Lah's decree and subsequently killed. Kyp Durron, a Jedi Master who proposed that the Yuuzhan Vong should be fought with aggressive techniques, later lambasted Skywalker during a Jedi conclave on the planet Coruscant, blaming Skywalker's defensive approach to warfare as the reason why Itoklo and other Jedi had lost their lives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seyyerin Itoklo trained as a Jedi\u2014individuals who spent their lives in service to others and the Force\u2014in Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order.
