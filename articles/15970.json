He was extremely happy when the starship Tarnta's Fang, and the attached Morrt crashed into the top of his palace's central tower, and ordered his troops to take down any survivors of the crash. Several people managed to survive both the crash and his troops, however, and escaped into the city. To make sure that his vengeance was done, he commanded several stormtroopers to scour the city for any survivors, and called a general quarantine on the planet in an attempt to stop anyone breaking atmosphere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
