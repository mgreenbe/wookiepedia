C-3PO wrote at least fifteen verses for the song which he performed for the Solos in a voice that sounded much like that of popular singer Jukas Alim. The poetic song was meant to convince Organa of the virtues Solo possessed that would make him a worthy husband. Leia and Chewbacca did not like the song."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "An excerpt of the song"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chorus:"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
