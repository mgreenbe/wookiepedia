He and his brother, Yolan Bren, were raised together to rule Solem, however, Yolan realized the evils of the Galactic Empire, the tyrannical governing body of the galaxy, and joined the local resistance movement. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin IV, to earn favor with his Imperial masters, Malvander retaliated against the resistance, now led by Yolan, by launching a scorched earth campaign across Solem. He also hired the infamous Mandalorian bounty hunter, Boba Fett, to capture Yolan alive so Malvander could publicly execute him. Fett was successfully able to capture Yolan after a brief skirmish with the resistance outpost in the capital city of G'ai Solem, and brought the Rebel leader back to Malvander. However, due to the cost of the resistance purges, Malvander wasn't able to pay Fett's full fee. Also because of the purges, Malvander's palace guards were left depleted, allowing large resistance riots to break out around G'ai Solem. The rioters were able to push back the palace guards and scale Malvander's large palace. While this was going on, Fett was threatening Malvander and his aides at blaster point for the rest of his money. As several Rebels broke into Malvander's chambers, Fett decided to steal the Governor's extremely valuable necklace, which would compensate him for the rest of Malvander's shortfall. Fett then left the palace, and the resistance forces were able to capture Malvander and free Yolan. At first the Rebels were going to shoot the Governor, but Yolan decided to instead strip Malvander of his power and force him to live as a peasant, so he could see first-hand the suffering that he had caused on Solem."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Malvander once ruled Solem alongside his brother Yolan Bren, though the latter came to see the evils of the Galactic Empire and joined the local resistance movement.
