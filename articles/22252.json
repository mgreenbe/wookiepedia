Although each member of the squad had their shortcomings, one of their drill instructors, the Siniteen Bric, blamed CT-4040 for the squad's failure. One evening, before their final attempt at the Citadel Challenge training course, CT-4040 met with Bric in the hangar, where Bric berated him, saying that everything was a joke to him and that he couldn't even take his own training seriously. However, CT-4040 only laughed and decided to embrace the nickname \"Cutup\" after Bric used it to refer to him. Despite seemingly not being effected by the conversation, Cutup and his brothers, who each had their own perspectives refreshed in various ways, banded together and were determined to complete the challenge. They progressed very well in the early stages, but eventually, Cutup and his squad learned that they had been sabotaged and did not have their ascension cables, which they needed to scale to the top of the citadel. Although Bric had been the one to sabotage them, the squad used their ingenuity and found a way to complete the challenge nonetheless.

In 22 BBY, as part of their plan to attack the clone troopers' homeworld Kamino, the Confederacy of Independent Systems launched a surprise assault on Rishi Station. As BX-series droid commandos stormed the listening post, Cutup and CT-5555, nicknamed \"Fives,\" CT-1409, known as \"Echo,\" and CT-782 \"Hevy\" were forced to flee through a ventilation shaft. After they escaped the outpost, they emerged onto the surface underneath the station. However, a Rishi eel appeared and attacked Cutup, killing him.
