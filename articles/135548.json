A Force-sensitive offshoot of their species evolved over time, known as the Stennes Shifters. The mainline Stennes joined many others in the galaxy who hunted the Shifters, attempting to drive the Force-imbued species from their joint homeworld. Due to the intrusion of outsiders seeking to wipe out the Shifters, their world had become scarred and damaged. This led the Stennes to become xenophobic; they were quite culturally advanced and sociable within their own system, however."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
