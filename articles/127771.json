It had a prehensile tail and ulnar skin flaps that stiffened when leaping, allowing it to glide. A smooka's diet included berries, nuts, bogwing and jubba bird nestlings, and their eggs. Smookas would also eat leaf-tail pups. The creature would chisel holes in trees with its teeth for nesting purposes, having up to five young per litter. Their teeth were extremely durable and could cut through metal armor and cage bars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Predators include Dagobah pythons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
