He and his government struck an alliance with the Galactic Empire to fund a mining operation on the planet, despite it having a detrimental effect on the quality of its water. In 0 ABY, members of a remnant Partisan cell called the Dreamers broke into Akagarti's residence and held his family hostage. He was brought to the Affadar water purification plant where Iden Versio, secretly a member of Inferno Squad infiltrating the Dreamers, recorded footage of Akagarti admitting the water was unsafe for consumption, with the plant not actually operating. He was left by the Dreamers, locked in a tank of the toxic water."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
