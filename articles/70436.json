She assisted Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker as they investigated the disappearance and death of Jedi Master Tu-Anh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the female Pau'an Jen June served as a police inspector in Pau City, the capital of the planet Utapau. During the war, she and the city's Governor Torul Blom became involved in an arms deal being carried out between the Sugi arms dealer Endente and the Separatists. The Separatists agreed to purchase a large kyber crystal from Endente, with exchange taking place in the plains outside of Pau City where members of the Amani species could provide a secure location."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While negotiations were taking place between the Separatists and Sugi in Pau City, the maverick Jedi Knight Tu-Anh began investigating the deal, without informing either the Jedi Order or the planet's natives what her purpose there was. During Tu-Anh's mission she was killed while spying on a meeting between a Sugi and several IG-100 MagnaGuards, prompting June to contact the Order so they could collect their fallen comrade's body. The Inspector personally greeted Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker when they landed in Pau City, and led them to the morgue where Tu-Anh was being kept while questioning them about why she had been on Utapau. After examining the corpse, the Jedi left June in order to investigate their comrade's death, soon learning about the meeting she had died watching."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi brought back samples of a substance found at the site of the meeting to the Pau City Police Station, where June had the substance analyzed, discovering it was slime from the skin of an Amani. She informed the Jedi that some Amani camped out on Utapau's plains while others lived deep underground, warning them of how dangerous the species could be. The Jedi began speculating about Separatist involvement in the plot, but before they could move any further with their investigation, June told them that Blom wished to meet with them as he wanted them to leave the planet. Despite being ordered to leave, the Jedi remained on Utapau and continued their investigation and discovered evidence of the Sugi involvement, which they brought to June. The Inspector revealed to the Jedi that the police did know of a few arms dealers on the planet and offered police resources in aiding the investigation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After June identified the Amani involved in the arms deal as being from one of the plains tribes, the Jedi made plans to search the plains for more information. Before they left however, a funeral was held for Tu-Anh, with June, Blom, Kenobi and Skywalker attending to watch the cremation. After the Jedi left for the planes and managed to capture the crystal from Endente, three shuttles arrived in Pau City carrying the Separatist General Grievous and his troops, who had been informed by Endente that the venue for the exchange had changed. June and Blom greeted the General, who then executed Endente when the Sugi arrived in the city. The General then set out with his MagnaGuards to catch the Jedi, but the pair managed to make it back to Pau City with the crystal. After losing the Separatists, Skywalker and Kenobi were confronted by the Governor, the Inspector and several other armed Pau'ans, who revealed that they were working with the Separatists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Jedi captured and the crystal secured June and Blom reported to Grievous via hologram and were ordered to have the crystal sent to the cyborg's ship. Once the crystal was on board an escort shuttle, Blom ordered that the Jedi be executed and so the Pau'ans and B1-series battle droids present opened fire. Skywalker and Kenobi made short work of several of their attackers before leaping behind the Pau'ans and grabbing the pair to use as shields. With Skywalker holding June and Kenobi holding Blom, the Governor ordered the droids ceasefire, allowing the Jedi to destroy them. Kenobi and Skywalker then released the Pau'ans and boarded a nearby starship, giving chase to the escort shuttle. Grievous then arrived and executed Blom in front of June for allowing the Jedi to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "June had white skin with red markings and black eyes. When the Jedi arrived to collect Tu-Anh's body she claimed she had informed them of their comrades death out of respect, despite the fact she was involved with those who had killed the Jedi Master. She probed Kenobi and Skywalker to find out how much they knew about Tu-Anh's purpose on Utapau and asked that they be discrete while on Pau City, in case people mistook their presence as an omen of things to come."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jen June was created for several episodes of the sixth season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, making her first appearance in the episode \"A Death on Utapau\" and then appearing again in the subsequent episode \"Crystal Crisis.\" Although the show was canceled before the sixth season aired, the episodes starring June were released as unfinished story reels on StarWars.com in 2014 as part of The Clone Wars Legacy.
