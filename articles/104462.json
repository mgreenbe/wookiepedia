Along with the Corellian Run, it was one of the two routes that made up the border of The Slice. It was founded c. 25,000 BBY, linking the young Galactic Republic with Ossus. The route took its name from the Perlemia system, located in the Core Worlds, which in its early history produced the thousands of scout vessels that charted the route."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Astrography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It began at Coruscant and passed the worlds of Anaxes, Corulag, Brentaal IV, Carida, Nak Shimor, Taanab, Kulthis, Sorjus, Vaynai, Columex, and Estaria. Beyond Estaria and the Tion Cluster the route became known as the Far Perlemian, and passed through Makem Te, Ter Abbes, and terminated just past Quermia. The Perlemian also passed the Roche asteroid field, The Wheel, and the Cron Drift."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Route first connected Coruscant to Ossus, and Coruscanti reunited with the Jedi, the ascetic warriors who left the Core centuries ago and remained but a myth until then. The Route contributed to the growth of the Republic since civilizations and colonies sued for protection from the Tionese and Hutt Space. With the Corellian Run, it formed The Slice region of the Galaxy which was explored and populated easier and faster than other parts. Further expansion of the Route led it up to the Wild Space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The forces of the Republic and of the Tion Hegemony used the route extensively during the Tionese War, where fleets from both powers raced back and forth along the Perlemian, dropping pressure bombs on each other's capitals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cardan-class space stations were present at the crossroads between the Perlemian Trade Route and the Hydian Way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There seem to be two disparate accounts of the blazing of this hyperspace route. The first, and most referenced, points to a very early founding of the Route.

Tion pirate fleets followed the new arrivals back down their so-called Perlemian Trade Route; there, they found rich planets bound in a loose, democratic union - and ill prepared for war.\" The New Essential Chronology indicates the Route was mapped between 25,000 BBY and 24,000 BBY. The Essential Atlas further points out the Perlemian was formed at the time of the formation of the Republic and its Expansionist Period."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic indicates a different history, suggesting that it was founded not long after the end of the Great Sith War, resulting in the decline of worlds like Taris. This information cannot be reconciled with The Essential Atlas and The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons' accounts of the foundation of the Perlemian, so this article assumes that the former account is correct."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
