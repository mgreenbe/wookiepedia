Members of the species would make the green sauce from fresh Endorian herbs to be served at the feasts held after a successful hunt of the creatures known as gurrecks, although the sauce itself contained no gurreck meat. The Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs learned a recipe for making Gurreck Gravy and included it in his cook book, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which he wrote at some point following the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY. In the book he included the gravy as an ingredient in the dish Fried Endorian Tip-Yip, and suggested readers smother the dish in the sauce."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gurreck Gravy was one of the recipes included in the 2019 Star Wars cookbook, Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which was written by Chelsea Monroe-Cassel and Marc Sumerak.
