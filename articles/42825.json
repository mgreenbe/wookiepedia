He lived in a region under the control of the Sith Lord Daiman and after his toddler sister was killed by poisoned water, Eejor's parents delayed reporting her death for a year, to allow them to accumulate enough food rations to bribe a supervisor at a factory that Eejor worked at to give the Ortolan a positive commendation. Eejor was later among a group of children that were sent to the planet Gazzari to serve aboard an arxeum that Daiman had acquired from the Quermian Sith Lord Ayanos Bactra. However, the arxeum was destroyed during the Battle of Gazzari, and Eejor and the other children fled the planet with the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt, aboard the mercenary transport Diligence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
