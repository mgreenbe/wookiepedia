Wicket had done so, but not effectively, as it fell back on the ground. He tried to leave again, but Shodu reminded him that she had asked him to peel berries for a festival.

He found what he thought to be a gem but what was really the egg of a serpent. Shodu's party took place that night, with Shodu and her family sitting at the front of a dance party with music. The wokling Malani brought a birthday cake to Shodu, wishing her a happy birthday. Shodu thanked her.

Shodu and Wicket were brought before the King and Queen, and Umwak presented the gem hanging from Shodu's neck. Shodu slapped his hand away when he tried to take the jewel, and Umwak further declared that the two Ewoks would serve as servants for her. Umwak again tried to take the jewel, and Shodu again refused. Wicket asked her to give it to him but she protested, reminding him that it had been his gift to her.

As Shodu and Wicket walked back to the village, the former asked the latter where he had gotten the present in the first place. Wicket again tried to evade the question, but he eventually gave in, reluctantly telling her all about the temple. He explained that he had only done it to find his mother a fine present, but Shodu told him that the only present that mattered to her was being together with her family. Wicket then asked her to show him how to perform the flip she did against King Gorneesh, and Shodu warned him that she would show it to him up close if he were to once again break the rules; Wicket chuckled weakly."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A comet comes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shodu was later at a ceremony celebrating a number of Ewoks completing their Belts of Honor.

They followed after her, only to be repelled by Shodu, who was angry that they tried to frighten her daughter; she picked up Winda, who shook her fist at the Duloks. The Stranger's real objective was the Sunstar, which he successfully\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014retrieved.

In reality, Shodu was sitting next to Wicket, trying to wake him up from his apparent nightmare. It was then that he came clean to Shodu, professing his taking the woklings to the Hut of Horrors. She then understood why the nightmares had occurred and thanked him for telling the truth. Wicket still wished to go to the overnight trip with the other warriors, but Shodu told him he would be permitted to go on the next one, as he would be busy that day; Wicket was forced to act as the new host of the Tumble Bunny show instead of the regular Tumble bunny trainer."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Caring for Norky"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shodu later took in a young individual named Norky when his parents were away.
