When activated, one end of the tool became highly magnetized, creating an extremely focused and uni-directional magnetic field, which was used to attract large or heavy objects. The tool had multiple power settings, depending on the required amount of force needed to recover a specific object."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many of the Republic's best podracers used magnetic retrievers to recover Steelton control cables that had come loose, using the tool's incredible attractive powers to retrieve the cables from a distance, all at speeds that neared 1,000 kilometers per hour."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
