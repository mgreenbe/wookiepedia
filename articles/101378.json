The planet had an elliptical orbit, passing through the asteroids of the nearby Velser's Ring twice during its year. The planet's black surface was rocked by frequent groundquakes and covered with rivers of lava and erupting volcanoes. Orin's surface temperature was unbearably high and its atmosphere was choked with thick soot and ash that rained down from the sky."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
