He co-owned the Dobo Brothers' Emporium along with his brother, Dendis; although the two established their shops in the same module, each brother held great resentment for the way the other conducted business. Much to the indignation of his brother, Samhan used the shop to run an illicit smuggling operation, selling illegally-modded items such as blasters to such organizations as the Exchange. While Dendis sold only medical supplies and pazaak cards, Samhan offered up a number of weapons, including vibroblades, blasters, and grenades, as well as various kinds of armor and upgrades."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the destruction of Peragus II in 3951 BBY, Dobo was operating part of the Dobo Brothers' Emporium, along with his brother, Dendis. He was also heavily involved in an illegal smuggling ring aboard Citadel Station, in orbit over the planet of Telos IV. Among other things, the operation funneled illegal weapons and weapon components to the Bumani Exchange Corporation, which was the local front for the Exchange, a galaxy-spanning criminal syndicate. Also, Jana Lorso, the head of the local Czerka branch, had Dobo deliver unspecified goods for her. Lieutenant Dol Grenn of the Telos Security Force had long been suspicious of the black market dealings that were occurring on the Station; however, he had no concrete evidence to support it and, thus, to bring Dobo to justice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a former Jedi Knight, Meetra Surik, was retrieving a droid for an Ithorian herd on Citadel Station, a group of thugs attacked her. After the fight, the droid found a modified holdout blaster on one of the thugs, which she then presented to Grenn. The Lieutenant realized this was the evidence he needed to dismantle the black market. Grenn then asked Surik to help him find the person or persons responsible for the operation. After showing the blaster to Dobo, Surik persuaded him to reveal that he was in fact the head of the local smuggling ring. Surik agreed to aid Grenn's cause by providing Dobo with the materials he needed for his next illegal shipment. This allowed the TSF officer to catch Dobo in the act. After a brief battle in which Dobo lobbed a grenade at the group of arresting TSF officers, he surrendered, was arrested, and was placed in a force cage within the TSF headquarters. He swore that one day he would break free and exact his revenge on Surik."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a businessman, as well as a smuggler, Dobo often displayed a high degree of pragmatism. While his brother, Dendis, was an idealist who insisted on doing business in a strictly legitimate fashion, Samhan bore no scruples at all, dealing with anyone who could bring more credits his way. As a result, the two brothers had an antagonistic relationship and would even argue with each other in front of a customer. He was also known to be irritable, argumentative and vindictive; when he was arrested by the TSF, he swore vengeance upon those who had set him up, including the Exile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Samhan Dobo was a character created for Obsidian Entertainment's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords video game. Meetra Surik, the player's character, could have chosen the above course of action or to actually help Dobo with his shipments. If the latter course is chosen, he will reward Surik with credits and access to his \"special reserves.\" Then she could also accompany him to one of the docking bays on Citadel Station, where she would be confronted by a TSF officer. After failing to convince the officer that she was trying to expose Dobo, Surik would be forced to kill the officer. This course of action leads to a dark side shift, however. It is therefore assumed non-canon when compared with the light side option represented in the sections above."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Telos IV, if the player explores the TSF station, Dobo's force cage is found to be empty; he may have been killed or moved to another cell, or escaped during the commotion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
