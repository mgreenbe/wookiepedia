He saw a vision of Republic and Empire posing a mortal threat to Voss, which the interpreters had deemed false. Raklo-Mo stood on a platform called the Step of Harmony and threatened to take a step out of Voss-Ka onto the cliffs below, which led the Three to retraining the interpreters, who this time correctly identified his vision as a threat to Voss culture, not the planet itself. Raklo-Mo recorded the event in the Writings of Raklo-Mo on a carving outside the Shrine of Healing in the Old Paths."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
