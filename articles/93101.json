Morley helped provide the Sith Lord formerly known as Darth Maul with food during his exile in return for the \"leftovers.\" Morley later encountered Maul's brother, Savage Opress, whom the Anacondan tricked into finding Maul without realizing that Opress intended to in fact find and help his brother. When Morley found that Maul had not killed Opress, he retreated from the scene. However, before he could escape, Opress grabbed Morley by the neck and strangled him as punishment for setting him up. He then threw Morley's corpse into a fire out of anger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
