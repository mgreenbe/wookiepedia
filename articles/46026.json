Designed by starship engineer Lira Wessex as a successor to the original Imperial-class Star Destroyer, the Executor, at a monumental 19,000 meters in length, represented the largest traditional warship the galaxy had ever seen by the time of its completion. The Executor bristled with more than 5,000 weapon emplacements, enough firepower to blast any planetary surface to slag in hours, and a military complement capable of annihilating any ground installation. The Executor's presence alone, however, was enough to frighten an entire star system into submission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Construction on the Executor began under complete secrecy in the secluded Scarl system, where Vader raised and trained Galen Marek, his secret dark side apprentice, in a failed plan to overthrow Emperor Palpatine as galactic ruler. By 0 ABY, the Executor was transferred to the Starship Yards of Fondor for the final stages of construction, under the overall direction of Admiral Amise Griff. At Fondor, the Executor became the failed target of internal sabotage by a group of traitorous Imperial admirals, who hoped to destroy Vader's project to prevent their own decline in power. Once completed, the Executor made for Yavin 4, site of the Rebel Alliance base. Vader hoped to crush the Rebellion once and for all with his new weapon, but the Executor failed to stop the Rebel evacuation from Yavin, and Griff died in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For three years after Yavin, under the command of Admiral Kendal Ozzel, the Executor led Vader's Star Destroyer fleet, the Imperial Death Squadron, in the Empire's hunt for the Rebellion's secret headquarters as part of Vader's personal mission to locate his son, Luke Skywalker. In 3 ABY, the Executor led the Imperial victory at the Battle of Hoth, but due to the tactical blundering of Ozzel, Skywalker and the Rebellion leadership escaped, and Vader executed Ozzel for his failure. The Executor's admiralty immediately passed to Captain Firmus Piett, under whom the Executor chased the Millennium Falcon from Hoth to Bespin's Cloud City in continued pursuit of Skywalker. The Executor again failed to capture Skywalker at Bespin, however, and so Vader's search for his son continued."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For a time, with the search for Skywalker on hold, the Executor returned with Vader to Coruscant, where, in 3.5 ABY, tensions between Vader and Prince Xizor of the Black Sun crime syndicate came to a head. In orbit above the Imperial capital, the Executor obliterated Xizor's personal skyhook, killing Vader's nemesis and ending Black Sun's threatening influence on the Empire. Immediately afterward, the Executor was assigned to protect the construction site of the incomplete second Death Star in the remote Endor system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Executor's relatively short life came to a crashing end above the Forest Moon of Endor. During the Battle of Endor, the Executor led a massive Star Destroyer armada in trapping the Rebel Fleet between itself and the Death Star battlestation. However, the Rebels turned the tables on the Empire by attacking the Executor at point-blank range. A concentrated assault on the Executor at the climax of the battle brought down the massive Super Star Destroyer's bridge deflector shields, before a wayward A-wing starfighter, piloted by Arvel Crynyd, crashed into the Executor's command bridge. With navigation failing, the Executor was sucked into the gravity well of the Death Star and collided with the battlestation, disintegrating on impact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Design"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Executor was the first of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought line and the premier flagship of the Imperial Navy. Measuring a colossal 19,000 meters long, the Super Star Destroyer marked a crowning achievement in starship engineering for both the Imperial Navy and Kuat Drive Yards, the warship's designer. Nearly twelve times as long as the 1,600-meter-long Imperial I-class Star Destroyer, the Executor represented the largest traditional starship ever constructed by the Imperial Navy at the time of its completion\u2014only the first Death Star and select Torpedo Spheres were larger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the same recognizable dagger-shaped design of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, the Executor's superstructure resembled an arrowhead from above. A smooth titanium-reinforced alusteel hull surrounded a massive island of habitable volume in the center of the Star Dreadnought, which accommodated the command, control, operation, and habitat decks. In the blackness of space, the Executor's interior lighting enshrouded the warship in a cerulean glow, though the Executor's exterior was in fact a grayish hue, darker than the traditional \"Star Destroyer White\" typical of the Imperial-class line."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rising above the dorsal technoscape of the Executor, supported by a thick axis, stood the 285-meter-wide trapezoidal command tower\u2014a veritable ship unto itself. In a true testament of the Kuat Drive Yards' design philosophy of \"terror styling,\" the command tower was deliberately positioned in prominent view of any vessel bold enough to dare an attack. The command tower housed several key components of the Star Dreadnought, including the dual geodesic KDY ISD-72x deflector shield generator domes\u2014an enlarged version specially developed from those aboard Imperial-class Star Destroyers\u2014which doubled as communications sensor globes; as well as the officers' quarters; briefing rooms; escape pods for the Executor's upper-echelon commanders; and, most importantly, the bridge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In accordance with the Executor's standard command tower module found on many KDY-constructed warship classes, the bridge design mirrored that of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer. A gleaming command walkway, separating twin crewman pits, led to a series of two-meter-tall transparisteel viewports that offered an unobstructed view of space beyond. Although the command tower stood arrogantly exposed above the Executor's superstructure, the ship's shielding system, which matched the power output of a medium star, kept it sufficiently protected from attack, making such Imperial pretentiousness a possibility. The Executor's shielding system was among the most powerful ever conceived for a warship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The underside of the Executor contained the engineering sections; the enormous primary hangar bay, which was large enough to dock an Imperial Star Destroyer and thousands of starfighters; and countless secondary docking bays and staging areas located near the bow of the ship. Thirteen immensely powerful, blood red-glowing KDY Executor-50.x sublight drive engine thrusters propelled the warship forward at a maximum speed of 1,230 G, or forty megalights. The thruster exhaust bells created an energy wash so powerful that an unshielded ship traveling too close to the Executor's wake would be instantly destroyed by the radiation. The Executor was outfitted with a Class 2.0 hyperdrive engine for hyperspace travel."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Armament"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aside from the Star Dreadnought's unprecedented size, the Executor's awesome offensive capabilities set it apart from other warships, bristling with more than 5,000 turbolaser batteries and ion cannons. With 2,000 turbolaser batteries, 2,000 heavy turbolaser batteries, 250 concussion missile batteries, each armed with thirty heavy concussion missiles, 250 heavy ion cannons, 500 laser point-defense cannons, and forty Q7 tractor beam projectors along its city-like surface, the Executor was capable of reducing any planetary surface to slag in a matter of hours. The warship's mere presence in an engagement alone was enough to frighten an enemy force into submission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the incredible mass of the Executor proved an advantage in terms of its firepower and the power of its defensive shields, it likewise proved a disadvantage in keeping the warship supplied\u2014the Executor could hold far more resources than the Empire normally had available to provide. More than 100 times as massive as the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, the Executor nevertheless boasted quite a formidable complement of support vessels and instruments of ground warfare."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Standard practice set the Executor with two wings, or twelve squadrons, of varying TIE Series starfighters, for a total of 144 ships, the fighter equivalent of two Imperial-class Star Destroyers. These two wings primarily comprised TIE/LN starfighters, TIE/sa bombers, and TIE/IN interceptors. By the year 3 ABY, the starfighter fleet expanded to include TIE/D Defenders and TIE/ad starfighters. The Executor also routinely hosted Darth Vader's TIE Advanced x1."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Additionally, the Executor regularly maintained 200 miscellaneous combat and support ships in secondary docking bays, including gunships, such as Gamma-class ATR-6 assault transports for troop deployment; and armed shuttles, such as the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, used to transport senior officers and dignitaries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Likewise, as a standard the Executor carried a massive army that included three prefabricated garrison bases; a full corps of stormtroopers and Army troopers; 38,000 ground troops; and hundreds of assault walkers for planetary warfare, typically including thirty All Terrain Armored Transports, fifty All Terrain Scout Transports, and All Terrain Personal Transports, deployed by Y-85 Titan dropships and other landing craft. A small armada of speeder bikes and landspeeders completed the ground arsenal. In theory, the Executor could hold far more starships and troops, though such resources were never available."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Facilities and accommodations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Vader had the Executor specially equipped with a spherical hyperbaric meditation chamber for his own use within his personal suite. Inside the chamber, which opened by splitting in two, like the gaping maw of some beast, a supermedicated high-pressure gas mix allowed Vader to safely rest free of his breathing mask, aiding his badly damaged lungs in the absorption of oxygen, so that his scarred head and face could feel fresh air. The pod's pressurized atmosphere enabled Vader to relax into a meditative state, providing a sanctuary from the rigors of command. While within the chamber, a series of high-bandwidth communications consoles and a large visual display screen allowed Vader to communicate directly with his commanders on the Executor's bridge. Just beyond the chamber within the suite rested a HoloNet transceiver projection pod with which Vader could immediately communicate with the Emperor directly from throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Executor's onboard facilities included the central Engineering section, which managed the various systems that kept the titanic vessel running. The Star Dreadnought's powerful engines vibrated through the deckplates of Engineering. Ship security was maintained centrally within a large security office, equipped with various control panels and monitoring stations, including a ring of primary panels positioned in the middle of the office. Security cameras provided the office with feeds of various portions of the ship. A central droid pool maintained and serviced the Executor's many droids. The droid pool's facilities could only be accessed by logging into the system's computer network."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Further crew accommodations aboard the Executor included at least one sparsely furnished, nondescript conference/briefing room near the middle of the ship; dining galleys and an officers' mess hall in the command tower; at least one recreational facility in the middle of the ship, populated with games, such as dejarik, programs playing on video screens lining the walls, and dining tables; and an infirmary, with an adjacent reception area, furnished with chairs and couches for waiting patients. The infirmary offered a level of cleanliness surpassing the rest of the ship to meet the needs and desires necessary for the Executor's medical staff to perform its duties well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located in the levels immediately above the command bridge within the central command structure was a series of suites designed for the Executor's admiral. Adjacent to the suites was a special escape pod for the admiral's specific use. Small cabins and personal quarters accommodated the rest of the Executor's crew\u2014higher-ranking officers were typically afforded solitary quarters within the command structure, while lower-ranking personnel shared cabins with a roommate. Another area contained the Executor's troop quarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Executor's brig comprised detention and interrogation cells, which were roughly four paces in length and large enough to hold at least two individuals. The cells had cots to accommodate slumber and ceilings that disappeared into darkness, while the walls had a barren black-gray finish intended to impress upon a captive the hopelessness of the situation. Alternatively, the Super Star Destroyer hosted civilian vessels within its many secondary docking bays, directed by a nearby launch control center. The Executor charged civilians by the day to keep their vessels docked in its storage bays. A cavernous cargo storage area allowed for another 250,000 metric tons of material in addition to the Executor's military complement. Six years' worth of consumables kept the Executor's crew members well supplied."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all Imperial-class and Super-class Star Destroyers, the Executor was constructed with a special throne room set aside for exclusive use by the Emperor. From this throne room, the Emperor could take control of the Empire in whole and contemplate the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Design origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Executor's origins could be traced back to the final days of the Clone Wars. Starship engineer Lira Wessex, daughter of famed Galactic Republic engineer Walex Blissex, designed the Imperator-class Star Destroyer, a massive 1,600-meter-long warship with an intimidation factor as great as its firepower, which saw limited use in Republic task forces. Following the Republic's transition into the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, the Imperator, since renamed the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, became the iconic staple of the Imperial Navy\u2014a terrifying symbol of the Emperor's might. Recognizing the immense size of the Star Destroyer was largely responsible for its ability to intimidate, Wessex began to design a new warship that would dwarf even the enormous Imperial Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire's initial attempt at realizing a larger Star Destroyer class began in the early years of the New Order with the Sarlacc Project, a top-secret initiative to construct a twelve-kilometer-long prototype Super Star Destroyer. However, the Empire's project suffered repeated delays and was eventually sabotaged by insurgent elements loyal to Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan before it could be completed. Still, the destroyed prototype would prove to be the forerunner to an even larger Imperial warship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wessex's efforts to improve upon the design of the original Imperial-class Star Destroyer eventually resulted in the conceptualization of an unprecedented nineteen-kilometer-long Super Star Destroyer, the final product of the Sarlacc Project. This new starship class was designed to be a terror weapon like the galaxy had never seen. With construction authorized by the Emperor, the finished product, the first of a new generation of Super Star Destroyers, would serve as the personal flagship of the Lord Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the term \"Super Star Destroyer\" was by no means an official label. The Imperial Navy initially listed the vessel as a \"Super-class Star Destroyer\" in budget requests to mask the true destructive nature of the warship from the Imperial Senate. The Imperial Navy even went so far as to incorrectly report the size of the new ship to keep oversight committees from discovering its purpose. Such measures would create naming confusion in attempts at officially classifying the Executor in the future."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Manufacturing contract"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Kuat Drive Yards served as the primary manufacturer of the Empire's Star Destroyers, the Executor's manufacturing contract was unexpectedly granted to the Starship Yards of Fondor. The Empire demanded total secrecy for the Executor project, closing off the Fondor system to all nonmilitary traffic. No longer able to meet the needs of their most valuable civilian clients, the Fondor executives were enraged. Still, the massive project took up virtually all of Fondor's resources, and they knew better than to test Vader's anger. They also reasoned that if they met the Empire's expectations, they might very well be able to steal future lucrative military contracts from their Kuat competitors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In reality, the Empire awarding the Executor contract to Fondor opened up the KDY shipyards for a new project. Having lost the Executor job, Kuat executives made sure that all future Super-class Star Destroyers would bear their logo, which only further angered Fondor. In fact, Kuat would be simultaneously constructing a duplicate Super Star Destroyer for the Empire along with Fondor. The Empire provisionally named both ships \"Executor\" to make it seem as if only one ship was being constructed. By attributing all expenses of the sister ship to the true Executor, the Empire kept the existence of the second Super Star Destroyer a secret from the galaxy at large. Under this ruse, both Kuat and Fondor publicly laid claim to having produced the Executor, Darth Vader's flagship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Starkiller's base of operations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Executor first began construction at a top-secret shipyard facility in the secluded Scarl system, located on the restricted Imperial Gandeal-Fondor Hyperlane\u2014which the Empire had secretly forged in accordance with the Executor project\u2014mere parsecs from Fondor. Coupled with the Scarl system's anonymity, the Executor's Scarl labor force at first consisted entirely of droids, which concealed the Super Star Destroyer's construction quite effectively. By 3 BBY, thousands of construction droids continued to labor on the Executor in complete secrecy, and construction had proceeded such that the ship's superstructure was largely completed, and the traditional dagger-shaped hull of a Star Destroyer was recognizable. The command tower had been erected almost in full, with the two shield/sensor globes intact, and the engines were operational. Substantial sections of the hull, including the defined voluminous center, nevertheless remained incomplete, leaving portions of the Executor's interior exposed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, Vader utilized his uncompleted Super Star Destroyer as a training ground and home for a secret dark side apprentice\u2014Galen Marek, who, unknowing of his true name or identity, operated only under the codename \"Starkiller.\" Vader took great steps to keep the existence of the apprentice hidden from the Emperor, as his taking of an underling was paramount to the betrayal of his own master. The Scarl system provided a location away from the Emperor's spies, who perpetually monitored Vader's every move. Aboard the Executor, Vader frequently sparred with the apprentice, training him in lightsaber combat and other telekinetic measures of the Force. The Dark Lord also provided his apprentice with a holodroid named PROXY. Programmed with a variety of highly efficient lightsaber duel programs, the droid was similarly capable of engaging the apprentice in what effectively served as combat training, although PROXY, by definition of Vader's programming, truly intended to kill the apprentice each time. Vader planned to eventually overthrow the Emperor and succeed him as ruler of the galaxy with the apprentice at his side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While living aboard the uncompleted Executor, Vader and his apprentice occupied a concealed level in the underside of the Super Star Destroyer that had long since been removed from the original floor plans and would go unnoticed by the future crew. The level, while sparse, consisted of an inner sanctum for Vader, a meditation chamber, a droid workshop, sleeping quarters large enough for one, and a hangar deck. Vader's inner sanctum was lined with a wide angular viewport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point by 2.5 BBY, Vader dispatched the apprentice on a series of missions designed to test his skills in preparation for deposing the Emperor. To aid the apprentice, Vader secretly assigned the female Imperial pilot Juno Eclipse to the Executor to captain the Rogue Shadow, the apprentice's starship, under the stipulation that anyone learning of her assignment would mean her death. Eclipse had personal quarters on the forty-first deck of the Executor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the apprentice succeeded in his appointed mission, killing three fugitive Jedi, thus proving his readiness, Vader ordered him to return to the Executor, where together they would finalize their plan to take control of the galaxy. Upon the apprentice's return to the Scarl system, however, Vader discovered that the Emperor's spies had followed him to the Executor's hidden location\u2014the Emperor's personal fleet of three Imperial-class Star Destroyers and a dozen smaller vessels exited hyperspace and surrounded the Executor. Aboard the Super Star Destroyer, the apprentice believed the time had come to strike against the Emperor, but Vader instead impaled the apprentice with his lightsaber, his plan to move against the Emperor a failure. Having learned of Vader's treachery of taking on an apprentice of his own, the Emperor, watching via hologram through PROXY, ordered the Dark Lord to kill the apprentice or be killed himself. Vader obeyed by telekinetically throwing the apprentice through one of the Executor's transparisteel viewports, out into space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader in fact rescued the apprentice from certain death soon thereafter, treating his grievous injuries over a period of six months, and once more setting him loose upon the galaxy under the guise that he was to organize an armed rebellion against the Empire. With the Emperor distracted with an alliance of rebel dissidents, the apprentice believed, Vader and he would finally strike. In reality, Vader and the Emperor manipulated the apprentice into bringing together the Emperor's greatest political adversaries in one location where they could be eliminated in one fell swoop. On the planet Corellia in 2 BBY, the apprentice joined with Imperial Senator Bail Organa and former senators Mon Mothma and Garm Bel Iblis to discuss the formation of an official rebellion against the Empire. The Executor interrupted the clandestine meeting, however. With the Super Star Destroyer looming in the upper atmosphere alongside several Imperial-class Star Destroyers, Vader and a squad of stormtroopers seized the three senatorial conspirators, revealing to the apprentice that he had been used all along."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader took the three imprisoned senators to the Horuz system, the construction site of the incomplete first Death Star, where the Emperor could execute his enemies personally. In a final confrontation with Vader and the Emperor, the apprentice died but liberated his allies nevertheless, freeing them to continue their rebellion. Having become the impetus behind the first significant armed resistance movement against Imperial forces in the galaxy by way of the Emperor's machinations, in a sense the apprentice's efforts staged from the Executor marked the advent of the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial admirals' plot to sabotage the Executor project"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Death Star project neared completion in 0 BBY, construction on the Executor had stalled in turn. The planet-destroying battlestation had become the new symbol of Imperial power, and the Death Star was draining much needed resources from the Executor and other projects. Nevertheless, Admiral Conan Antonio Motti promised the Super Star Destroyer line's imminent introduction to active service in authoring the Imperial Navy chapter of the Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide, a tactical manual distributed just prior to the Battle of Yavin. Motti noted the Super Star Destroyer's intended role as the Imperial Navy's primary TIE fighter carrier, troop transport, battleship, and planetary bombardment platform, declaring also the Empire's ultimate vision to have one Super Star Destroyer per sector as a command ship for Imperial forces. The Imperial Handbook included an image of the still-under-construction Executor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yet following the Death Star's sudden destruction at the Battle of Yavin, the Executor became the Empire's top priority. The nearly-completed Super Star Destroyer was hastily towed from the secrecy of the Scarl system to the Starship Yards of Fondor and a living construction crew, who redoubled their efforts to speed up the Executor's stalled progress. Although the Empire had nationalized Fondor around the time of the Battle of Yavin, it still left the Fondor Guild of Starshipwrights, the planet's ancient rulers, in power to oversee the Executor project."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Construction entered the final stages at Fondor under the utmost levels of security. A fleet of Imperial-class Star Destroyers patrolled Fondor, ordered to destroy any unauthorized civilian craft attempting to gain access to the shipyards. The sheer number of bulk freighters delivering materials to the shipyards as a result of the Executor project prompted Fondor to add additional shipping lanes not indicated on standard star charts to accommodate the heavy construction traffic. Admiral Amise Griff supervised the Executor's overall construction at Fondor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the sudden emergence of the Rebellion in the wake of the Battle of Yavin, work slowdowns and sabotage reached critical levels at Fondor's shipyards. Fearing punishment from the Emperor if the Executor was not completed according to schedule, the Fondor system's governor loosened security restrictions on the shipyard's workers and extended more generous benefit packages to non-Human laborers. Although the governor's measures quelled the unrest, the lighter security only left the Executor project vulnerable to external saboteurs\u2014namely, a group of five traitorous Imperial admirals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Vader's return to Coruscant following the Imperial disaster at Yavin, the Emperor ordered him to Fondor to personally oversee the final stages of construction of the Executor. Before reaching Fondor, Vader rendezvoused with the group of Imperial admirals, including Amise Griff, to dictate his decided war policy against the Rebellion. Vader planned to use the Executor to single-handedly destroy the Alliance, thus taking absolute control of the Imperial war effort, much to the admirals' disgust, who viewed the Executor's construction as little more than grandstanding. They loathed the favor Vader courted from the Emperor, and feared that with the completion of the Executor, they would suffer a great loss of influence and stature. Whereas the Death Star had previously eclipsed the Imperial Navy as the Emperor's preferred weapon of terror, the battlestation's destruction at Yavin returned the admirals to their original position of prominence. The Executor, however, threatened to once again steal that dominance away and place it solely in Vader's command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the meeting, Vader telekinetically lifted Griff out of his seat in a Force choke in response to the admiral raising an objection against his outlined course against the Rebellion, as well as to intimidate the other admirals into adherence. Vader and Griff in fact staged the entire scene to make it seem as if Griff truly sympathized with the admirals' concerns, when he was actually in league with Vader. The two planned to use the Executor project to weed out those who sought to undermine Vader in the Emperor's eyes by bringing the project to ruin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Griff anonymously contacted the Alliance High Command on Yavin 4, leaking to them the existence of Vader's secret project at Fondor aimed at the Rebellion's destruction. He explained that he and his fellow Imperial admirals wished to halt Vader's rise in power and therefore had used their influence to keep open a position in the droid maintenance section of the project, which the Alliance could in turn use to their advantage by inserting a spy into that position. Luke Skywalker volunteered for the mission, having droid maintenance experience, and, along with the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, he journeyed to the Fondor Shipyards to collect any information he could on Vader's project. In addition to Skywalker, the Alliance also dispatched a team of agents to destroy the project. Only upon arriving did Skywalker discover that Vader's undertaking was nothing less than the largest starship he had ever seen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker's maintenance duties included moving all along the Executor, often repairing droids in zero gravity. While he kept up the ruse of droid repair, R2-D2 compiled detailed information on the Executor's schematics. During his masquerade, Skywalker befriended Tanith Shire, a woman who had also infiltrated the Executor project in order to steal one of the shipyard's drone barges."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Rebel spy in place, Vader used the Imperial admirals' ambition to sabotage the Executor to lure them to Fondor to meet with the spy\u2014planning to destroy them all at once. After Vader purportedly left the Fondor system to briefly attend to other matters, in actuality remaining on Fondor waiting to strike, Griff and the admirals secretly convened with Skywalker to supply him with explosive weapons necessary to sabotage the Executor. Although Vader's plan to capture the Rebel spy failed when Skywalker sensed the Dark Lord's presence through the Force and escaped the scene, Vader's stormtroopers nevertheless rounded up the traitorous admirals, bringing their scheme to sabotage the Executor project to an end."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Simultaneously, Vader succeeded in uncovering the team of Alliance saboteurs, foiling their sabotage mission as well. Skywalker eventually returned to the Rebel base on Yavin 4\u2014the only member of the Alliance team to survive the failed sabotage mission\u2014with a great deal of information on the Executor stored within R2-D2, his own mission largely a success."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Construction completed"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the interim between the Death Star's destruction and the imminent completion of the Executor, Vader initiated a large-scale, if highly ineffective, blockade of the Yavin system. Vader also reassigned Griff away from Fondor to take command of the blockade as the Executor project neared completion. Vader did not want to crush the Rebel base immediately, using the blockade as a means to keep the Rebel command in place on Yavin 4 until the Executor itself was ready to lead a full-scale planetary assault. He planned to use the Executor as personal retribution for the embarrassment he suffered at Yavin. As the months wore on, however, the blockade situation angered local fleet commanders and even Griff himself, who urged Vader to strike. Consequently, Fondor accelerated the Executor's construction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around two months after the Battle of Yavin, the Executor was transferred to the remote Endor system, the secret construction site of the second Death Star battlestation. Along with a number of Imperial-class Star Destroyers, the Executor patrolled the construction site, where the new Death Star's progress fell short of the Emperor's expectations. Still incensed with Vader over his failure at Yavin, the Emperor relieved Vader of his command of the primary Imperial Fleet and reassigned him to administrative duties at Endor to ensure the Death Star's continuing progress. Vader's reassignment included relinquishing command of his flagship, the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator, to the upstart Colonel Kell Bircher."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Executor played host to the Emperor's eventual arrival at the Endor construction site. The Emperor discovered, much to his disgust, that Vader had appointed Birra Seah, a Kuat Drive Yards systems engineer serving as a liaison to the construction project, as acting Moff in command of the Death Star's construction. However, to save Seah, whom Vader discovered to have a strong connection to the Force, from the Emperor's wrath, he instead surreptitiously placed her in an officer's position aboard the Devastator as his spy to keep tabs on Bircher. From aboard the Executor's bridge in the Endor system, Vader remained in regular contact with Seah as she served on the Devastator. Seah reported to Vader that Bircher captured two Rebels aboard his Star Destroyer, Wedge Antilles and Luke Skywalker, the latter being of intense interest to the Dark Lord. Vader commanded Seah to detain Skywalker and bring the Rebel immediately to him. Eventually, the Executor returned to Fondor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, six months after the Battle of Yavin, the Executor reached completion on schedule. The first Super Star Destroyer ever constructed, the Executor represented the most powerful starship in the Imperial Navy inventory and, for the matter, the largest and most powerful capital ship in the entire galaxy. The Executor, which replaced the Star Destroyer Devastator as Vader's flagship, would become the most famous of all the Empire's Star Destroyers, and held the mantle of Imperial Command Ship. By time of completion, the Executor's official designation was changed from the colloquial Super Star Destroyer to the Executor-class Star Dreadnought. Nevertheless, the term \"Super Star Destroyer\" stuck and many continued to borrow superlatives from the Clone Wars era and simply classify the Executor as a Super-class Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By purely military standards, the completed Executor was somewhat impractical, since a smaller ship could fulfill its mission duties. Instead, the Executor served as physical proof of the unlimited resources and might of the Emperor. Indeed, Wessex's design succeeded where the Imperial-class Star Destroyer had left off\u2014the Executor could conquer an enemy through sheer intimidation without even firing a shot, capable of demoralizing a planetary population merely by appearing in orbit and even subduing an entire star system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Executor project had taken years to complete, and the incredible cost to fund the construction of such a large warship\u2014an estimated 1,143,350,000 credits\u2014had practically bankrupted several star systems. In fact, years later in 12 ABY, Imperial Admiral Gilad Pellaeon once remarked that the Executor alone had practically bankrupted the entire Empire. The Imperial treatment afforded Fondor during the Executor's construction\u2014namely locking out all civilian traffic from the Fondor system and awarding subsequent Super Star Destroyer contracts to their Kuati competitors\u2014would erode support for the Emperor at Fondor and eventually lead to the Empire losing the planet to the Rebellion, reportedly with inside help, in the years following."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Executor's completion paved the way for the introduction of the new warship line.
