After she arrived on Batuu and discovered that Duja had been killed, Amidala visited a cantina in Black Spire Outpost. Not wanting to reveal to the bartender, Janott, her true reason for being on Batuu, Amidala instead told him she was supposed to be meeting a man named \"Kuseph Jovi\" to give him his new starship. When the Senator added that she was not sure why \"Jovi\" had chosen a location like Batuu for the transfer point, Janott unfavorably compared Batuu to New Codia. Amidala agreed before wondering whether New Codia was a star system, a planet or a city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New Codia was mentioned in the 2018 novel Thrawn: Alliances, written by Timothy Zahn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
