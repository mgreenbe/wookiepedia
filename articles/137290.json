His reputation as the First Order's master preceded him by the last days of the Cold War between his regime and the New Republic. During his reign, he remained steadfast in his refusal to designate a planet as the First Order's capital, having chosen to rule his dominion from a mobile command center. An ambitious ruler, Snoke was not content to rule a handful of sectors claimed by the First Order in the Outer Rim Territories, nor was he satisfied by colonizing clusters of worlds beyond the frontier. In his view, ambitions limited in scope would have made the First Order no different than the various nonaligned states that emerged in the wake of the Empire's collapse, or the hermetic kingdoms in the Unknown Regions that had been dismantled or destroyed by the First Order during its secret rise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, it was Snoke's desire to see the First Order reclaim the galaxy that the Empire lost in its war with the Rebel Alliance.

As such, they were both among the few individuals who could contact the Supreme Leader directly, and as rivals they competed for Snoke's approval.

He also continued to pursue his objectives of eliminating the surviving members of the Resistance, as well as hunting and killing Skywalker. Using Hux's hyperspace tracker, Snoke personally oversaw the First Order Navy's assault on the Resistance fleet. At the same time, he used his mastery of the Force to create a Force-bond between his apprentice and Rey, a Force-sensitive Jakku scavenger who sought to learn the Jedi arts under Skywalker.

To his shock, Ren used Rey's lightsaber to bisect Snoke at the waist, killing his master and saving Rey in the process. After defeating Snoke's personal bodyguards, Rey urged Ren to save her allies but the First Order warlord came to believe that the Resistance had to be destroyed along with all reminders of his past in order to usher the galaxy in a new era under his rule.

A Fondorian prisoner explained that his world refused to support the Resistance to no avail. The fact that Fondor had any communication with the Resistance at all was treason in Ren's view. He therefore declared that the First Order would seize control of the shipyards effective immediately, believing that Fondor's actions necessitated extreme measures.

Although Ren allowed General Hux to serve in the new cabinet, he ensured that his former rival would have neither the power nor the autonomy that he once exercised under the previous Supreme Leader. The officer who succeeded in gaining Ren's favor was Allegiant General Enric Pryde, a veteran of the Old Empire whom Snoke designated as commander of the First Order's reserve forces.

After the return of Darth Sidious, Ren focused all of his attention on finding the fallen Emperor whom he regarded as a threat to his power.

Ren confronted the Emperor, whose soul inhabited an imperfect clone of his original form, but Sidious had anticipated Ren's arrival. Aware of the Supreme Leader's ambition to create a new empire, Sidious unveiled his latest creation; the Final Order, a vast armada of Xyston-class Star Destroyers, all of which had the technology to destroy planets.

Ren had dealt summarily with Quinn for inquiring about the Emperor's conditions before giving command of the Sith fleet to the Supreme Leader.
