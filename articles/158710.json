Koensayr evidently continued work on the design for the Rebellion. Shortly before the  Battle of Endor, this Alliance prototype was itself stolen\u2014and christened the Warhog\u2014by Rebel defector Bryce Agoris, a former Infiltrator, and freelance operative Myrgaanti Shi-Iki."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result, the VGK-3 project fell behind schedule and most hope for the nascent New Republic to obtain these fighters had been dashed.
