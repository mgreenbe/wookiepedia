He had disabled the ability to transmit a distress signal in the standard comlink built into the droid, and gave it regularly memory wipes so that it did not retain a personality. When a group of Rebel agents were sent to Cambriel's aid on Spira to smuggle vital supplies off-planet, Cambriel taught the agents to sail his vessel through the use of his droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
