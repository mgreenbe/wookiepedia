He and his friends were lucky enough to survive the thought bomb's effect, which had been the reason for the destruction of the Sith, because they were not force-sensitive. While scavenging treasures and supplies, Derrin and the group were attacked by Darth Bane who returned to the camp. He was killed, along with Rell and Pad, as they stood guard at the Sith camp by a direct lightsaber strike to the body. However, Bane let their comrades Lergan and Hansh live."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
