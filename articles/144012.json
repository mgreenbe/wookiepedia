Doza explains that the planet is a safe haven for the Colossus because it is not on the First Order's scanners. Yeager adds that docking on the planet is what the people want. Kaz questions the idea of settling on an uncharted planet but Doza counters it is equally risky traveling through space. Doza says their supplies are running critical and that it is time to stop running and to think about their future."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Yeager briefs Kaz and the rest of Ace Squadron and their astromech droids about their scouting mission.

Griff thinks it is a fresh water source and that they should check it out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Kaz is walking on the beach with Griff, CB-23 and and R5-G9, he asks Griff why he left the Galactic Empire. Griff explains that Captain Doza was a commanding officer that he respected and gave him the choice to either stay and fight for a corrupt Empire and leave with him and start anew. Kaz now understands that Griff is loyal to Doza because he gave him a choice. Griff adds that the Empire was not worth fighting for and knew when to walk away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaz asks how walking away will solve anything.
