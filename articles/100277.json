Onca's and Bulduga's reputation caught the eye of the Sith Lord Count Dooku and Phindian criminal mastermind Moralo Eval, who invited both brothers to participate in a series of challenges at the Box on the planet Serenno. As Bulduga was killed before the challenges, Onca was forced to participate alone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some unspecified point in their lives, Onca and his brother Bulduga became bounty hunters and formed a legendary duo throughout their careers, becoming famous across the galaxy. In 20 BBY, during the Clone Wars, both brothers were invited along with some other fellow bounty hunters by the Sith Lord Count Dooku and the Phindian criminal mastermind Moralo Eval to participate in a series of challenges at the Box on the planet Serenno. The duo's reputation was the main reason for which they caught Dooku's eye."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately, Bulduga did not live to take part in the competition as he was murdered by the Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane, who fancied Bulduga's hat. Bane asked Bulduga where he got his hat from, and Bulduga responded by drawing out his pistols, recognizing the conversation's tension; however, Bane drew his blaster first and fatally shot Bulduga, taking Bulduga's hat for his own. Onca witnessed this event, but didn't dare challenge Bane due to Bane's superior skills. Onca secretly mourned for his deceased brother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Competing against other bounty hunters in the potentially fatal challenges, the victors would receive the honor of kidnapping Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine of the Galactic Republic. Onca did well in the first challenge like the others, although by Embo's fault he nearly fell to his death and into the Dioxis releasedin the gas room, and made it to the second challenge. Once there, the bounty hunters discovered that the room was full of electrified laser blade columns just when one nearly impaled Onca's head after Rako Hardeen pushed Jakoli to safety, but Onca bent to avoid that fate. In a matter of seconds, however, Onca was cornered by the columns and one got directly to his head, with the laser near his face, threatening to slice it. But as the laser didn't get too far, it returned to its original position. Thinking that he was safe, Onca breathed a sigh of relief, but he was quickly impaled in the back by a laser blade before he could react, killing him and thus becoming the first bounty hunter to die in the challenges."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along his brother Bulduga, Onca was part of a successful legendary bounty hunting team famous over the galaxy. In contrast of his brother, who was a fast-drawing gunslinger, Onca was slower, incapable to overcome the bulk of his Ithorian build to snap off shots as quickly as Bulduga could. This last trait would eventually cost to Onca not only his career, his life also, when he was fatally cornered at the Box on Serenno."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Onca favoured firepower over finesse or flash.
