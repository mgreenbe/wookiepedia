Its six shield generators were complemented by a carbon-nanofilament armor hull. Defensive weaponry included eight quad laser cannons upgraded to be almost as powerful as Clone Wars-era turbolasers and a large number of anti-starfighter cluster bombs, designed to go off in case of the proximity of starfighters. It was thought that even if a TIE Fighter could slip through the defenses of one of these ships, it would need to travel at almost its full velocity to be able to pierce the augmented hull."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship could project a gravity well several hundred planetary diameters.
