In around the year 3643 BBY, he was stationed on the planet Korriban at the Sith Academy built there. While stationed there he issued Imperial Edict 936, an order to eliminate a number of looters who had begun scavenging in the Tomb of Ajunta Pall due to the K'lor'slug infestation there. Rikel sent a number of soldiers under his command to carry out the order, but all were killed. Rikel had fair skin, brown hair and grey eyes, while at the academy he wore a red suit of armor and carried a blaster pistol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rikel was then approached by an Imperial aligned individual, who informed him they had found his edict recorded on a datapad among the remains of his men, and completed the task and eliminated the looters, recovering several artifacts as they did so. The sergeant thanked the individual and, after taking the artifacts from them, rewarded them for their efforts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rikel first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011.
