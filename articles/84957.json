Rebel pilots at that time frequently tested their skills in the unofficial \"pilot proving grounds\", competing to set the best time on a series of courses through a Rebel salvage yard hidden in an asteroid field. Rytin was disparaging of the practice; he posted a time in only a single course and dismissed the proving grounds as appealing to pilots with a death wish. Rytin was killed in action some time prior to 3 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mac Rytin was created for the 1999 LucasArts video game Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance.
