It was particularly effective against droids. He fought alongside Revan in the Mandalorian Wars, and used it effectively. It proved to be of little help, however, when he challenged the Dark Lord to a duel and was killed. Revan later had the opportunity to buy it, at a hefty price, on the planet Tatooine from the Paaerduag merchant Mic'tunan'jus Orgu. When properly modified, even the Star Forge's defense droids stood little chance against this high-quality weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
