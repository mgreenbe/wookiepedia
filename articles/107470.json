As the Ishori were fervent supporters of the Caamasi, Av'muru abandoned his attack to help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Predominance was also important during the battle itself, which began when Imperial infiltrators took over one of its turbolaser clusters and fired eight times into the capital city of Drev'starn.
