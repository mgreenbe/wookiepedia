Pushed by the worker, the repulsorcart dumpster was used to store trash that was picked up from public locations, such as items picked up by a trash punch. Sanitation workers emptied the dumpster into a disintegrator at a city services center at the end of the worker's shift. Birrge, a sanitation worker in Hanna City on the planet Chandrila, used a repulsorcart dumpster on a daily basis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
