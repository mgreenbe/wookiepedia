Ayo and the Red Hand were under the direct command of Darth Sidious and were responsible for the political assassinations during the Clone Wars. In 19 BBY the Jedi Council discovered Red Hand and ordered the Jedi Master Quinlan Vos to infiltrate the organization and find out who was ordering the Red Hand to kill the politicians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For a time, Quinlan was able to dupe Ayo and the Red Hand into believing that he was an outcast from the Jedi Order, and that he wanted to join the Red Hand. But somehow Ayo found out about Quinlan's true mission. The Jedi was then captured and put on \"trial\" by Red Hand, with Ayo acting as the judge. The jury found Vos guilty of cheating and ordered his death. During the execution that followed right after, Quinlan was able to escape due to the fact that the Red Hand forgot to take his lightsaber away from him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ayo then ordered the entire Red Hand to search through the sewers for Vos. During the ongoing search, the entire Red Hand, minus Ayo, were killed by Vos. Ayo then tried to escape, but then took a wrong turn in the sewers and found herself at a giant waterfall. Quinlan then caught up with her and asked Ayo who she worked for. Instead of answering the question, she committed suicide and jumped off of the waterfall. Mas Amedda would later inform Palpatine that the Red Hand organization had been wiped out. Palpatine commented that Ayo and the Red Hand's usefulness had come to an end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
