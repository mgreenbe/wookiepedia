Steel-Eye attempted to recover the salvage, even going so far as to researching marine life in order to bypass the native wildlife, but the shipwreck was still unsalvaged by the time of the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. Steel-Eye's nickname came from the pirate's cybernetic eye. After the pirate's death, Steel-Eye's skull ended up on Slave Island."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
