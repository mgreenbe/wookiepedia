The Fluggrian crime lord Kam Nale also owned one. The blaster pistol had a round, streamlined receiver and a long narrow barrel, and heavily resembled a ELG-3A blaster pistol. The differences were that the ELG-3A pistols did not have a trigger-guard, and the also unlike the ELG-3A this blaster did not have a wooden grip, the receiver was not as smooth near the front of the blaster. The gun fired green blaster bolts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The weapon was notably used by Aldar Beedo, who commonly used the weapon, illegally, on the podracing circuits in order to perform hits. He had attempted to use the blaster while racing on the planet Malastare to kill the Dug pilot Sebulba. When not using the blaster, he kept in a holster on his belt. Kam Nale also owned a model, and attempted to use it during the Boonta Eve Classic of 32 BBY, in an attempt to kill Aldar Beedo. He too failed, however."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
