The clones are then shown continuing their search by traveling throughout the galaxy, occasionally getting into fights. At one point the group comes across assassin droids that managed to capture Artoo, but the clones fail to stop the assassin droids. During this time, clone trooper 1139 expresses to his companion, 1137, his desire to have his own name and not just a number. 1139 thinks up several names for himself and his comrade, but none suit. On the last planet, the team's gunner, Blasty, takes out an OG-9 homing spider droid. The group's commander says he will put in a good word for Blasty, and their pilot adds he may even get a new tank. 1139 becomes infuriated since he has developed a strong dislike for Blasty, since he has always wanted to drive a tank."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
