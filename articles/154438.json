During the invasion of Belsavis, the Sith Empire unintentionally released it by breaching the containment vault, and it began to spread throughout the High Security Section. Gen'Dai were immune to the virus, but it incubated in their tissue, turning them into carriers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
