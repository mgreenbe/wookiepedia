Ultimately bulky, antiquated, and hard to work with when compared to modern conductive composite wafer boards, the circuits were notable for their incredible resistance to the effects of ion weapons, leading some spacers to use the circuits despite their age and difficulty of use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
