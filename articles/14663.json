The leaders of the Republic forces included the Jedi Knights and ace pilots Anakin Skywalker and Huulik, onboard their Jedi starfighters. At some point during the battle, the Jedi found themselves swarmed by Confederate droid fighters, and the energy shields of Huulik's starfighter were depleted, making him vulnerable to the enemy ships' attacks. However, Skywalker flew in between him and the next blast from the droid fighters, saving the life of his fellow Jedi. The battle ultimately resulted in a victory of the Republic. Following their adventures at Sedratis, Skywalker and Huulik came to fight together on several occasions. About two decades after the event, Huulik's niece Taneetch Soonta shared a brief account of the Battle of Sedratis with the son of Skywalker, a trainee Jedi called Luke."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Sedratis was first mentioned in Heir to the Jedi, a 2015 novel written by Kevin Hearne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
