Armored jumpsuits were also capable of withstanding tremendous amounts of heat, being capable of resisting the intense heat of magma pebbles, which were commonly used to attack armored infantry and light vehicles, and left thumb sized divots rather than gaping holes. The jumpsuits were also resilient to slashing attacks as well, being able to shrug off a voxyn's claws, as well as that of razor bugs, but could be punctured by amphistaffs. Armored jumpsuits were used in conjunction with equipment harnesses by the Myrkr strike team, which allowed for an individual to carry an array of equipment ranging from grenades, mines, holoshrouds, blasters, and spare ammunition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
