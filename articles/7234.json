They were triangular in shape, and according to Darth Krayt, faster and more maneuverable than any other fighter of the time. Through the dark side, the pilot and ship would become one, and the fighters carried enough fire power to breach a Star Destroyer. The ships, along with a number of Sith troopers were housed in a secret location in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban, and were part of Darth Krayt's new offensive after his resurrection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Months after Darth Krayt retook the Coruscant throne from the usurper Darth Wyyrlok, a large number of Annhilators were deployed alongside Emperor Krayt's dragon ships during the Sith Imperial assault against the Jedi Hidden Temple of Taivas, tearing through both Imperial and enemy forces, among them the Starrunner. They would also fight over Coruscant, turning the tide in favor of the Sith until Darth Krayt died, in response to which they committed suicide runs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
