While in Imperial service during the early months of the Empire, she was critically damaged by a beam fired by the Heinsnake Cult thanks to a tracer planted onto the ship by a cultist. The commanding officer ordered the remaining crew and troopers to evacuate in drop ships to a nearby moon, and also requested that he get a secure line to Emperor Palpatine as well as their investigating the data to find out what exactly happened.
