At some point, Quelsh took bribe money from smugglers for looking the other way as those smugglers brought illegal goods to Corellia and framed a fellow officer, Kal Braggan, for the crime. The betrayed Braggan was convicted, discharged from CorSec and sent to prison for several years, while Quelsh was awarded the Corellian Medal of Honor for his \"fight\" against corruption within CorSec."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his career, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, before he eventually retired in the city of Tyrena.

Braggan eventually found out that Quelsh had framed him and he found proof that Quelsh had been the one taking money from the smugglers. He wrote his story down in his journal. Circa 1 ABY, Braggan contacted Quelsh to meet with him and revealed the proof he had of Quelsh's crime. However the meeting went badly and Quelsh killed Braggan. Quelsh panicked and left in a hurry, accidentally dropping his Medal of Honor at the crime scene. When he discovered that his medal was missing, he started to search for it and eventually asked CorSec to assist him in the search. Major Walden sent an independent agent to investigate the \"theft\" of the Medal. What Quelsh didn't expect, was that the agent discovered the connection to Braggan's Fist and eventually discovered Kal Braggan's corpse with Quelsh's medal next to it. Through Braggan's journal, the agent found out about Quelsh's crimes. The medal he had earned for his wrongdoings had now been the reason for his downfall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quelsh was eventually arrested by the CorSec and Major Walden promised the agent that Quelsh would have to pay for all of his crimes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wilfred Quelsh was a Non-Player Character (NPC) in Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
