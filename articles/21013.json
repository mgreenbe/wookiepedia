Given to the Jedi Order for training in the ways of the Force, Initiate Chun was enrolled in the academy at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. Befriending fellow Initiate Aalto, Chun and his friend often taunted their peer Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom they called \"Oafy-Wan\" after Kenobi had lost his balance on one occasion, colliding with Chun. He also attempted to impress the attractive Initiate, Siri Tachi, many times, but to no avail; he eventually moved on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 45 BBY and 44 BBY, Chun had secretly learned from Dark Jedi Xanatos, a business partner of Chun's father and fellow Telosian, that his father Vox was the Treasurer of Telos. He bragged about it at one time to Siri Tachi, something the girl would later bring up during a future investigation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As both Chun and Kenobi reached their final years at the academy, both vied for the attention of a Jedi Master who would select them as a Padawan. During an unsupervised sparring session, Chun deliberately started to antagonize Kenobi and both students walked away with minor bruises. Chun, in an attempt to get Kenobi in trouble with academy instructors, went to the Halls of Healing to report an attack by Kenobi and receive treatment for his wounds. Instead of disciplining Kenobi as Chun had hoped, Grand Master Yoda set up a duel between the two Initiates to demonstrate their skills for visiting Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Completing the duel fairly, Master Jinn did not select either of the Initiates, much to Chun's chagrin. By this time, Chun was no longer using one of the Temple's training lightsabers; instead, he wielded a red-bladed weapon available to senior Initiates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the following months, Kenobi had been selected by Master Jinn after all, but the Master-apprentice bond was broken after the disastrous mission to Melida/Daan. There, Padawan Kenobi had forsworn his oath to the Order and joined a militant group called the Young and fought in the Melida/Daan Civil War. Returning to the Temple without his Padawan, Master Jinn could not be bothered by Initiate Chun's attempts to get him to accept him as his next student."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Betraying the Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crestfallen with Master Jinn's constant refusal to take him on as an apprentice, Chun was easy prey to the temptations offered by Xanatos. Corrupted by Xanatos, Chun assisted the Dark Jedi as Xanatos infiltrated the Temple and began wreaking havoc. A pawn of the manipulative former Jedi, Chun stole many artifacts from within the Temple, including the precious Healing Crystals of Fire. He was secretly caught in the act by Jinn and Master Tahl while he was covering up some of the stolen items from the Temple's Lake Level. Jinn tried to follow him, but Tahl's navigation droid 2JTJ accidentally alerted Chun of the Jedi's presence. He was forced to disappear after that. Keeping close to the masters, Chun transmitted recordings of conversations with the Jedi via a transmitter installed secretly in his lightsaber hilt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Xanatos had finally been found out, he kidnapped Initiate Bant Eerin and chained her underwater in the Room of a Thousand Fountains. While Master Jinn attempted to halt Xanatos stealing the Temple's supply of valuable vertex, the Dark Jedi ordered Chun to kill Initiate Eerin immediately. Kenobi chased Chun to the Room of a Thousand Fountains and engaged his opponent in a lightsaber duel. They made their way up the slippery slope of the chamber's central waterfall. As Kenobi struggled to break away from Chun in order to rescue Initiate Eerin, who was chained to the bottom of the room's lake, Chun lost his footing and toppled over the edge of the waterfall. Chun tried his best to hold on, but couldn't hold on for long, though Kenobi apologized for everything and attempted to save his life, which surprised Chun. Chun ignored him, and preferred to die for everything he had done, and saying that he wasn't truly a strong apprentice to begin with. Kenobi didn't want him to die and tried to reach him, but it was far too late for the young Initiate. Chun couldn't hold on and plummeted to the rocks below, breaking his neck."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his death, Chun's father initiated an investigation into his son's death. Employing Senator Sano Sauro as prosecutor, Initiate Kenobi was implicated in the death of his peer. Appearing before the Senate's Inquiry committee, Kenobi was rescued from prosecution by Master Jinn. Entering Chun's recovered lightsaber into evidence, Jinn played the recording of Chun's final words for the committee: the evidence proved Kenobi innocent, although it would be many years before Chun's brother Kad would forgive Kenobi and before Kenobi could forgive himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bruck Chun was described by Obi-Wan Kenobi as cruel and manipulative. Even Yoda and Mace Windu could see Chun's deceptive nature. He also valued his dignity greatly, and was known to hold grudges. This was especially evident when Obi-Wan tripped him in the halls of the Jedi Temple accidentally, and he soon found an enemy in the boy. Chun was also impatient and quick to anger. Yoda appeared to have helped him improve on his faults. Yet he was very eager to become Qui-Gon Jinn's Padawan, just as Kenobi was. Siri Tachi also depicted him as a showoff and a \"bore.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Chun felt his hopes of becoming a Padawan dashed, Xanatos preyed upon his feelings. Turning the Initiate to the dark side, he taught him cunning and let him feed on his hatred for Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his sparring duels with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, respectively, Chun did acrobatic leaps toward his opponents, suggesting that his style may have been Ataru. In fact, he tried to mimic the moves of Siri Tachi's fighting style during training exercises. At age 11, possibly younger, Chun could also see to duel wearing a blindfold, and wore one while fighting Obi-Wan. However, Obi-Wan defeated Chun in this match, greatly angering the boy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After having been converted to the dark side, Chun was believed to have been taught Force stealth by Xanatos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bruck Chun was created by the author Dave Wolverton for the first young readers novel Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force in the Jedi Apprentice series.
