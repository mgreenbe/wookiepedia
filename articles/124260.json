Bozzie Baranta bought one, but ended up putting more money into repairing it as he did actually buying it. It lacked a high top speed compared to other podracers, though this suited the Podrace course on Ord Ibanna, which Bozzie frequented. Its also considered one of the most flashy, elegant and beautiful pod ships among the racers of the tournaments due to its royal-blue, silver and gold colors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Shelba 730 Razor was originally created for use in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, but was ultimately cut before the film's animatic stages.
