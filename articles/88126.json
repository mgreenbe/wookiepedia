Circa 1 ABY, a CorSec agent working for Lieutenant Lon Cope visited the office to discuss with Deel Draav about an assassination attempt he was victim. After Mayor Draav was finally assassinated in a second attempt, the agent returned to the office and investigated the place. The spacer discovered a large sum of credits sent by the criminals of the Chirq Council in order to bribe the mayor. The CorSec thus understood that Deel Draav was assassinated because he refused the money."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mayor's Office appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
