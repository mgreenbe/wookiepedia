Around 3641 BBY, he was sent by Darth Baras to free his sister Darth Ekkage from the Belsavis prison, belonging to the Galactic Republic. Melicoste commandeered a squad of Imperial commandos led by Lieutenant Kaid and set out to track Ekkage's location. After pinning Ekkage's location, he sent a detachment of men to free Ekkage's imprisoned Sith assassins, but they were stopped by the Emperor's Wrath. Meanwhile, Melicoste made it to Cell Block 77-Z within The Tomb, where Ekkage was being kept. He proceeded to free her but instead of showing gratitude, Ekkage effortlessly killed Melicoste for his incompetence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The player has the option of letting him leave for light side points or letting Ekkage kill him for dark side points."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
