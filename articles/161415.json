Vit was captured, and Dathomir was temporarily liberated, although Imperial infiltration on the planet would continue. In 19 ABY, Brakiss infiltrated the Great Canyon Clan and remodelled them into a new Nightsister clan to serve as a recruiting ground for the Shadow Academy, a project which can in many ways be seen as a continuation of Vit's earlier work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
