For many years, she traveled from planet to planet, studying the physiology and behavior of many wild non-sentient creatures and reporting on them in her field journal. Over the course of her journeys, T'enna researched various planets and inhabited moons, including Bespin, Coruscant, Dagobah, Endor, Hoth, Naboo, Tatooine and Yavin 4. Since the once-beautiful world of Alderaan had been destroyed by the Galactic Empire in 0 BBY, the zoologist could not research that planet directly, and she turned to the Holographic Zoo of Extinct Animals. Eventually, Lyrre T'enna's field journal was reworked into a published version, which was written with the collaboration of the Intergalactic Zoological Society."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Written backwards, \"Lyrre T\" is Terryl, first name of Terryl Whitlatch, real-world author of The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide and creature concept artist on Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
