Leading the fleet from the Mon Calamari Star Cruisers Justice and Remember Alderaan, the pair bested the warlord's task force at Togoria and fought their way to the planet Lantillies on the Perlemian Trade Route, where they connected with the forces fielded by the planet Contruum. Having established a hold on the Perlemian, the two admirals headed in different directions; while Burke pressed Coreward to Chazwa, Kalback headed for Corsin, attempting to secure a position on the Hydian Way. This attempt failed, as Kalback's ships were met by warlord Zsinj's Executor-class Star Dreadnought Iron Fist. He fell back to Obroa-skai, where his forces were added to General Luke Skywalker's Rapid Response Task Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Mindor, he commanded the task force's naval elements from the Justice. He was confident in the abilities of Luke Skywalker and accepted the surrender of Lord Shadowspawn during the initial phase of the battle. This turned out to be a ruse, and Kalback met his death on the bridge of the Justice after a rigged shuttle destroyed his ship, taking a console corner to the head during the series of impacts. Skywalker commended the spirit of the deceased Admiral to the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
