Alien scouts decided that the Yinchorri were too underdeveloped to be useful to the Republic, and the planet was deemed too deficient in resources to be useful for a settlement. On the scouts' advisement, the Republic disregarded the world. Around 58 BBY, the Yinchorri joined the galactic community, but most planetary representatives assumed that the species would go unnoticed in the grand scheme of galaxy-wide politics. The Yinchorri officially became members of the Republic in 33 BBY and they were eventually given representation in the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The same year, under the manipulation of Darth Sidious, they launched an offensive, attacking neighboring systems as well as the Jedi Temple.
