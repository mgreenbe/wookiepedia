His uncle Owen and aunt Beru Lars once owned a moisture farm just outside of the Jundland Wastes. Luke knew that his responsibilities to the Alliance prevented him from managing the farm, so he used the Force to guide him towards someone who could benefit from ownership of the property. The Force led him to Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, where he found Throgg sitting at a table in the corner. He offered him the deed to the Lars farm, but Throgg did not trust Luke's intentions. He crumpled the piece of paper up and threw it behind his shoulder, uninterested. Unrelated events forced Luke to leave the cantina, but Throgg later reconsidered the offer and recovered the deed. Despite his gruff nature, Throgg was eternally grateful for the chance to operate a moisture farm once again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In about 1 ABY, the Rodian, Zef Ando, lived on the Lars Estate as a squatter.

Huff wanted to monopolize the moisture farming industry on Tatooine and attempted to institute an alien landowner tax.

The more scrupulous Darklighter brother maintained the deed of ownership but allowed Throgg to continue working as a tenant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
