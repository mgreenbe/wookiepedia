Prone to clumsiness and anxiety, Wilsorr was consistently denied promotion and failed basic training. He eventually joined the Rebel Alliance Corps of Engineers and helped build Echo Base on Hoth, though his clumsiness led to more than a few accidents and his demotion. He eventually found work as a cook and delivering supplies across the base, which made him adept at navigating the tunnels of the complex. He developed an attraction to one of the tauntaun handlers, Jordan Smythe, though could never work up the strength to act on it. When the Galactic Empire located and launched an attack on Hoth in 3 BBY, Wilsorr finally proved his worth by using his knowledge of the tunnels across Echo Base to save the lives of several people as the base was evacuated. Wilsorr risked his life to reenter the crumbling base to save Smythe, and the two managed to reach the ship Bright Hope as it departed and shared a kiss on board."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and Yavin 4"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chase Wilsorr was born on the planet Takodana. By the time of the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Wilsorr wanted to join the fight against the Empire. Chase suffered from low self-esteem and anxiety, though he was inspired by self-help books such as Be Your Best Self by Mirialan author Raysi Anib to leave Takodana and join the Rebel Alliance. Wilsorr was recruited to the rebels at their base on Yavin 4, though he went on to fail basic training six times. In one infamous incident, Wilsorr tripped over his own feet during weapons training and accidentally destroyed three barracks. Although unlucky in his attempts to serve, Wilsorr made friends in Marinna Reynolds and Oriss Khan. While he still tried to complete training, Wilsorr found work in the kitchens at Yavin 4 and was content with the wide menu, where he was allowed to experiment with Reynolds and Khan and recreate dishes from their homeworlds."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hoth"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Working at Echo Base"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although he failed basic training, Wilsorr found work after the Battle of Yavin as part of the Rebel Alliance Corps of Engineers. When the Alliance chose the ice planet Hoth as its new base, the Corps of Engineers was deployed to carve the tunnels and winding complex of Echo Base for use by the Alliance. Under Major Kem Monnon's instruction, Wilsorr and the other engineers use heat-tech to carve the base. While in this position, Wilsorr became familiar with and adept at navigating the small corridors located around the main halls of the facility. The heat-tech the Corps used was slow and costly, so Lieutenant Shara Bey came up with the idea of using A-wing ion cannons instead of the standard heat-tech. Chase was given the ion technology when carving a briefing room, though he was unsure of what setting to use and created a much larger area than planned on accident. After Wilsorr's mistake, Major Monnon finally snapped and sent him to work on setting up the barracks instead. By the time the Alliance forces fully relocated to Hoth in 3 BBY, Chase had found his place working in the kitchens alongside X0-R3 under Lieutenant Harlize Dana. Wilsorr's job on Hoth was different than Yavin 4, however, and he was reduced to a singular menu and mostly peeling and dicing purple tubers with X0-R3. In addition to the kitchen work, Chase also assumed duties as a runner. This job meant he was tasked with delivering items such as caf, datawork, messages, and supplies across Echo Base. Wilsorr used his knowledge of the rarely-used tunnels first built by the Corps to navigate the complex with ease."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although he hadn't managed to join the Rebellion as he had intended, Wilsorr found some happiness in his time spent with a new tauntaun handler at Echo Base, Jordan Smythe. Chase developed feelings for Smythe and was nervous when around him. Chase also grew jealous of his friends Reynolds and Khan, who had moved on to join Rogue Squadron and Rebel Alliance Special Forces, respectively. Chase grew especially jealous of Han Solo, a smuggler who had consistently been assigned critical missions despite never having formally joined the Alliance or gone through any training or preparation. Chase was also annoyed by Solo's constant bickering with General Leia Organa. Hoping to move up, Wilsorr applied for sentry duty three times but was denied the position by Major Bren Derlin. Despite assurances from Dana and Smythe, Chase continued to feel useless and unimportant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chase eventually decided to appeal directly to General Carlist Rieekan about Major Derlin's refusal to give Chase sentry duty at Echo Station 3-T-8. One morning, Wilsorr woke up to find a message from Rieekan, who reinforced Derlin's decision based on Major Monnon's report about his subpar work in the Corps. The only person awake early that morning, Wilsorr was told to keep quiet by rebel Rainn Poras a few bunks down. As Rieekan had ordered, Chase simply returned to work under Dana. That day after 0700, when his shift ended, Chase went on call as a runner. He saved his favorite run, the tauntaun pens, for last. Wilsorr delivered caf and food to handlers Baesoon and Murell, then looked around for Smythe. Smythe, who was with his tauntaun Sunshine, spotted Chase and walked towards him. Chase gave Jordan his caf, which he had kept warm in his own insulated thermos. Smythe complimented Chase's work, which Chase morosely said was nothing important. Jordan tried to cheer him up and told Chase that he was the best runner at Echo Base. Chase told Jordan that he wanted to do something important and scrolled through several messages from Major Derlin before stating that, despite what Derlin said, he could handle a blaster. Jordan laughed and tossed Chase his blaster. Wilsorr fumbled and almost dropped it, though Jordan laughed it off and helped Chase hold it properly. Baesoon yelled at Jordan to stop flirting on duty, who then held Chase's hand and told him that they would have to see each other later. Embarrassed, Chase turned around to leave but bumped into Sunshine on his way out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some day later, Wilsorr was given a new run: the command center. Chase first delivered to communications officer Toryn Farr. He gave her a new holoprojector and blue milk that was sent to her by her sister Samoc. Farr knew Wilsorr's name and graciously accepted her delivery. Next, Chase poured caf for General Rieekan and decided that he would ask him about his message. Rieekan didn't know who Wilsorr was at first sight, though after some pleading from Chase, decided to give him a \"critical mission.\" Chase's excitement was crushed when he found out that Rieekan's task was nothing more than a delivery to Echo Station 5-4. Wilsorr brought the crate to the station outside the base, where Rainn Poras sarcastically thanked him for the delivery and told him to bring a crate of blasters to the hangar to be recharged. As he left, Chase overheard some of the other rebels gossip about him and his mistakes. Instead of bringing the blasters straight to the hangar, Chase visited Jordan at the tauntaun pens. Jordan told Chase not to listen to the others, and that he was perfect the way he was. Chase noted that Jordan wasn't wearing a jacket, and asked him how he wasn't cold. Jordan put his hands on Chase's shoulders and asked him if he was cold, calling him \"Yavin baby.\" Nervous, Chase tripped over his words and blurted out that he was from Takodana, not Yavin, then frantically left the room with the crate. While bringing the crate to the hangar, he walked past Solo and Organa arguing in a hallway. Annoyed by their bickering and angry over his blunders with Jordan, Chase morosely continued on to the hangar."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Hoth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next day, Chase and Lieutenant Dana were in the kitchen when it was announced over the base's central communication system that General Rieekan had initiated the evacuation sequence. Chase had noticed that the command center was tense and that more weapons were being delivered to the sentries but didn't think an evacuation would come so quickly. Chase and Dana left the kitchen and began walking towards the main corridor, but Chase decided that he would bring Dana with him through the lesser-used tunnels to avoid the traffic-heavy corridors. Once they reached the main hangar, Chase saw the chaos as the blast doors were opened and crowds were brought on board the GR-75 transports. In the distant sky, he saw the triangular shape of Imperial Star Destroyers. As Chase walked up the ramp to a transport, he looked around and was distraught that he couldn't see Jordan. Major Derlin then yelled out to see if anyone had seen Doctor Tristan Melthabi. Officer Serenity Meeks told him that a cave-in in one of the tunnels had left the doctor and several other medtechs trapped. Overhearing this, Chase jumped off the transport ramp and told Derlin and Meeks that he knew a way to reach them. Running into the makeshift tunnels he helped build, Chase made it to the medical facility and found Melthabi and three medtechs stranded. Chase directed them to the main hangar. While helping them into the tunnels, Chase realized that others may be trapped because of the cave-in."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chase ran throughout the area behind the cave-in, checking storage rooms, barracks, and the corridor for stragglers. He found three foot soldiers, two communications officers, and a group of refugees from Habassa II. Chase gave them directions, but the lights went out and they panicked. Next, he heard Toryn Farr's voice on the communication system telling them that the last transport, the Bright Hope, would be leaving in ten minutes. Chase decided to lead the group to the main hangar, navigating the tunnels despite being unable to see them. Once back, Meeks thanked Wilsorr for his work, but Chase hurriedly told her that he had to go back. Chase ran through the crumbling complex, eventually making his way to the tauntaun pens. There, he found Jordan trying to calm Sunshine. Chase told Jordan that they had to evacuate and that he wasn't going to leave him, and the two saddled Sunshine and rode her out of the pens. Chase decided to take the main corridors out, knowing that Sunshine was too large to fit in the smaller tunnels. As the trio made their way to the hangar, Chase noticed that a cave-in had happened in the main hall. Chase grabbed Jordan's blaster and pressed every button at random, then threw it directly at the ice. The blaster exploded, shattering the ice and clearing the way to the hangar. The doors to the Bright Hope were closing as they reached the hangar, and Chase yelled out to Meeks to keep it open. Sunshine clambered up the ramp and onto the ship, where many of the personnel were people Wilsorr had saved. The room cheered for Chase and Jordan. After mustering up the courage, Chase turned to Jordan and told him that he needed \"a good kiss,\" echoing something Solo had said to Organa the day before. Jordan pulled Chase closer and the two shared a kiss as the Bright Hope departed Echo Base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chase Wilsorr was a dreamer, however he was extremely shy and had a severe lack of confidence. He was reliant on self-help books such as Be Your Best Self by Mirialan author Raysi Anib to boost his self-esteem. Chase was an anxious and awkward person, tripping over his words when talking to his crush, Jordan Smythe, and being nervous to speak up to officers such as General Rieekan. Wilsorr judged himself harshly when comparing himself to others, even close friends such as Marinna Reynolds and Oriss Khan. Chase wanted to be a hero, but with each mistake he made and lack of promotion he felt unnecessary to the Alliance and to others. Although his insecurity heightened at Echo Base, Chase found comfort with Jordan Smythe and developed feelings for him. Jordan likewise had feelings for Chase, but Chase's anxious nature kicked in whenever the two connected. Despite this, Wilsorr looked forward to seeing Jordan and saved the tauntaun pens for the last of his deliveries so he could spend more time with him. Both Jordan and Lieutenant Harlize Dana did what they could to reassure Chase of his importance, but Chase continued to feel as though he had little value."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Hoth, Chase finally managed to work up confidence and put his skills towards helping as many people escape as he could. Chase used his knowledge of the complex to rescue many trapped rebels and bring them to the Bright Hope, and even as the base started crumbling and time started running out he put his life on the line to go back and find Jordan. Once he and Jordan were aboard the Bright Hope, Chase blurted out that he wanted to kiss him. Although he was nervous after saying it, Jordan reciprocated and Chase realized that he had it in him to be confident."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character who would become Chase Wilsorr first appeared in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back as a background extra who steps between Han Solo and Princess Leia during an argument early in the film. When offered to write a short story for the anthology From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back, author C.B. Lee first thought of that character to be the protagonist of her story, called \"A Good Kiss.\" Lee wanted to tell a story about an unsung hero, and used the character of Chase to write about the importance of pursuing dreams. Lee also wanted to write a character representative of the LGBTQ community, citing Paige Tico and Rose Tico from Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi as examples of how minority representation in Star Wars positively affected her, and wrote the story of Chase Wilsorr with that in mind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
