Growing because of the Corellian Trade Spine and the Hydian Way, it included overflow from the Southern Core and the Trailing Sectors as those regions expanded. The distance from Coruscant caused the area to develop a sense of independence from the Core. As a result, it was a place for brooding rebellion during the Galactic Civil War along with Imperial atrocities and secret experiments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Western Reaches were the site of a major Imperial campaign against Separatist holdouts in 17 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
