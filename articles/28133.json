These stormtroopers were responsible for the defense of littoral zones, the coasts, and the beaches of planets with large maritime zones. Unlike other specialized units of the Imperial Army's Stormtrooper Corps, the Coastal Defense Division's shoretroopers did not require additional training as any trooper could join the unit due to its temporary and cyclical function. The only prerequisite for stormtroopers to join the division was to have the rank of sergeant, and if conflict arose they were required to lead squads of ordinary stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
