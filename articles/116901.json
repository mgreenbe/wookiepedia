He immediately traveled there to find that she had been attacked and kidnapped by the Whiphid bounty hunter, Tulkh. Tulkh had stolen the Murakami orchid and Rojo knew that his sister Hestizo, a member of the Agricultural Corps, was its guardian as the flower was very Force-sensitive. Trace then pursued leads as to where Tulkh may be headed and he found out from a drunken Bothan smuggler, called Gree, that Tulkh had been hired by Darth Scabrous on Odacer-Faustin. Trace immediately left for Odacer-Faustin and discovered that the planet had been overrun by Sith zombie creatures. However, he knew that Hestizo was still alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After quickly dueling Sith Blademaster Shak'Weth, he eventually pin-pointed her location in the library.

The Neti had gone insane and had started burning all of the library's scrolls and holobooks. After being captured by the Neti and seeing his memories of his discovery of the Sith temple beneath the library, Trace was able to escape and go after Hestizo.
