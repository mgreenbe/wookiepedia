Matthews said his favorite track was \"Obi-Wan to the Rescue,\" but also particularly complimented some of the nightclub songs, which he described as in the style of 1940s jazzy and reminiscent of the cantina music in A New Hope. The Soundtrack Geek, an online music reviewer, said he was surprised a relatively unknown composer like Kiner would take the reins from veteran John Williams, and said the music does not live up to Williams' work. \u201cThe music isn't bad by all means, but to me it's not Star Wars. ... If you must have it in your collection because it's Star Wars, then fine, but if you love the music of Star Wars, then go listen to John Williams' excellent scores instead.\" Although he enjoyed certain tracks like \"A Galaxy Divided\" and \"End Credits,\" he said other tracks like \"Obi-Wan To The Rescue\" sounded more like music from video games such as Quake."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
