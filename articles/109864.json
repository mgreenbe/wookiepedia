After the establishment of the Galactic Alliance during the Yuuzhan Vong War decades later, the early designs were eventually upgraded with modern technologies and engineering innovations. The R-28 served as an important intermediate step between the T-65 X-wing and the X-83 TwinTail starfighter, the latter of which shared several of the same parts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Former Old Republic Jedi Master A'Sharad Hett used an R-28 to travel to the Unknown Regions at some point before the start of the Yuuzhan Vong War in 25 ABY, where he was attacked by a Vong advance force and crashed his fighter inside one of the invaders' scout ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the year 137 ABY, the R-28 had become a common craft used in local defense forces and by civilian pilots.
