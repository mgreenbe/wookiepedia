In 1 BBY, the white loth-wolf stalked the Jedi rebel Ezra Bridger while he was infiltrating an Imperial testing facility to steal a TIE/D Defender Elite prototype. After Ezra and his Mandalorian comrade Sabine Wren had crash-landed the starfighter in Lothal's wilderness, the white loth-wolf encountered the two rebels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The white loth-wolf put Sabine to sleep, startling Ezra. At that point, a White Loth-cat appeared on top of the wolf, reassuring Ezra of the latter's peaceful intentions. With an Imperial patrol transport approaching, Ezra told the loth-wolf and loth-cat that he did not like the Empire. The white loth-wolf then gave Ezra and Sabine a ride to the rebel camp where the other Spectres and Ryder Azadi had regrouped. Before leaving, Ezra asked the loth-wolf why he had helped them. The wolf gave him the cryptic message \"Dume\" (a reference to Ezra's Jedi master Kanan Jarrus) before vanishing into the fog. Ezra later related his encounter with the loth-wolf to Kanan.

The white loth-wolf and his companions then led the rebels through a tunnel, which was lined with cave paintings showing people following wolves.

Ezra believed that the cave paintings told the story of Jedi coming from space and following the wolves. When Kanan asked the white loth-wolf why it had help them, the wolf merely said \"Dume\". Through that encounter, Ezra learned that his master Kanan was once called Caleb Dume. Kanan confided with Ezra his belief that the wolves were linked to the Force and that the Empire was doing something \"terrible\" to Lothal.

When the wolf disappeared, Kanan angrily told the wolf that to stay out of his way if he was not there to help. The white loth-wolf then materialized in front of him. When Kanan asked the wolf what he wanted, the creature growled \"Dume\" and was joined by two other loth-wolves.
