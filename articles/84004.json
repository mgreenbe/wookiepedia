In 8.5 ABY, the New Republic launched an offensive against Kuat in hopes of securing Kuat Drive Yards's ship building facilites, vital to the Imperial war effort. After a transmission was sent from the Kuati battlecruiser Event Horizon, infected by a Republic computer virus, to the Republic RZ-1 A-wing interceptors of Surprise Squadron in the Venir system, the squadron jumped to the Kuat system to engage the Kuati Forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surprise Squadron's ion torpedoes soon took down the systems of the Luminous and three Kuati Star Destroyers, and as they attempted to get their systems back online, the same virus caused the Event Horizon and four Star Destroyers to aim their batteries at the Luminous and the rest of the Kuati fleet. When hailed by the Minister of Commerce Ral'Rai Muvunc of the New Republic, who informed them that the New Republic controlled thirty-four percent of the Kuati shares, Kuati officials surrendered to the Republic. That was because they faced an enemy who could disable nine warships including the Luminous from their defense force in a matter of minutes, as well as one that controlled a large part of the company's shares."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Luminous was first mentioned in 2012's The Essential Guide to Warfare, an extensive guide on the conflicts in the galaxy, written by Jason Fry and Paul R.
