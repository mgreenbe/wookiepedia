They were warm-blooded reptiles covered by green feathers. Their anatomy offered them significant ability to disguise and be unseen in the rainforests of their homeworld. Considered fast for their size, duuvhals did not commonly attack creatures that other than natural prey. Duuvhals also had venomous fangs which could kill Humans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though normally found in the wild, duuvhals could be domesticated. Some of the Yashuvhi kept them as pets, even being trained to bite on command. Force Adept and wanderer Valara Saar had a pet Duuvhal named Zeev.
