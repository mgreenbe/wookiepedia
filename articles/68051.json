The games took place in Coronet City on the planet Corellia and moved location around the city throughout each game. Taking place whenever both Ixxis and Su were in Coronet at the same time, players required a personal invite from one of the pair to attend. The game attracted up and coming or experienced gamblers and card sharks and required a 5000 initial stake. Those who failed to put up the initial credits where beaten, robbed and thrown out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ixxis and Su's floating game was first mentioned in Suns of Fortune, a sourcebook released in 2014 for Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
