Additionally, Lucasfilm had been under pressure from various licensees with ideas for products, among them CBS, who suggested a full-length variety special. Amongst this climate, George Lucas became convinced that such a project would sustain interest in the franchise until the release of The Empire Strikes Back in 1980. Publicity director Charles Lippincott told Vanity Fair in 2008, \"We wanted something that was going to make us different in variety shows. We didn't want the same-old, same-old.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Scripting"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gary Smith and Dwight Hemion were brought on as producers. However, the pair had to divide their time with a number of other projects in development, so they themselves hired other producers to assist, such as Ken and Mitzie Welch. Writers Leonard Ripps and Pat Proft\u2014 both of whom had previously worked with Smith-Hemion\u2014met with Lucas for one day, during which the three worked to develop the story, which focused on Chewbacca trying to get home to his family for the Wookiee holiday of Life Day. (One of Lucas's discarded ideas for A New Hope was to begin the film in a Wookiee household; the main body of the film would have been presented as a story told to a Wookiee child by its parents. During this time, he also considered making films outside of the saga, one of which would have centered around Wookiees.) Lucas allowed the crew access to a large collection of his notes on Wookiee culture, which were developed for the original Star Wars film."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Director David Acomba showed Lucas the 1976 Nelvana film A Cosmic Christmas. Lucas liked Nelvana's style of animation, and asked them to work on a segment in the special. Clive A. Smith developed an eleven-minute story concept, which he presented to Lucas in early 1978. Lucas proceeded to work with Smith on streamlining the story, which introduced the character Boba Fett, who was modeled after Joe Johnston's sketches as well as Ben Burtt's VHS costume test. Like Smith-Hemon, Lucas attended a few subsequent production meetings but was busy with The Empire Strikes Back and other projects. In 2014, Star Wars producer Gary Kurtz commented on the situation: \"It did start out to be a lot better [with a different script]. We had half a dozen meetings with the TV company that was making it. In the end, because of work on promoting Star Wars and working on the next film, we realized we had no time. So we just left it to them and just had the occasional meetings with them, provided them with access to props and the actors, and that was it.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ripps and Proft wrote an outline and first draft based on Lucas's notes. Since the show was targeted at a family audience, they tried to avoid writing violence. The script was then given to Bruce Vilanch, who was unsure how to write for characters who do not speak a human language, believing that it would turn out to be \"one long episode of Lassie.\" To offset this, Vilanch came up with many of the variety aspects of the special. (However, it was always intended to feature music of some sort as part of the story.) The character of Saun Dann was also created as a bridge to the audience, based on Lucas's early concept of Lando Calrissian as a trader on Kashyyyk. The final writers to work on the script were Ken and Mitzie Welch, who made major alternations. As Lucas later observed, \"It just kept getting reworked and reworked, moving away into this bizarre land. They were trying to make one kind of thing and I was trying to make another, and it ended up being a weird hybrid between the two. I'm not sure either position would have worked on its own, but by combining them\u2026\" The early story treatment was completed in May 1978, and the teleplay was in its fourth draft by that September. The only known bit of material shot but deleted from the final film was an in-cartoon commercial during the animated segment.

Wookiee actors could be in these suits for only 20 minutes at a time. Ben Burtt created the Wookiee family sounds, of which a full hour were required. For the Malla and Itchy sounds, Burtt recorded at the Olympic Game Farm in Sequim, Washington, where he spent days trying to get the animals to vocalize. Malla's \"voice\" was based on recordings of black bears and Itchy's on grizzly bears. One of these sounds\u2014a recording of a lion eating a cow's head\u2014was later used for the 1979 film Alien. For the sounds of Lumpy, Burtt recorded a baby bear named Tarik at the San Jose Zoo. One of Chewbacca's vocalizations from the Holiday Special was later reused for The Empire Strikes Back, during the scene in which Han Solo is frozen in carbonite. The R2-D2 model built for the special was hollow shelled and operated by remote control. Early in pre-production, the special was considered as the start of a possible TV series. Because of this, the art department created more elaborate designs than would normally be made for a TV special. The sets were constructed on Stage 2 of the Burbank Studios. Department head Brian Bartholomew believed the Wookiee household set (which had been based on drawings by Ralph McQuarrie) to be good enough for an Emmy award, but never asked Lucas to enter it in the running."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Shooting"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Filming began in August 1978 under David Acomba, a friend of Lippincott and fellow USC schoolmate of Lucas's. The special was shot mostly on videotape on a budget of over $1 million. Acomba shot footage for three of the special's sequences\u2014including the cantina sequence and the scene with Jefferson Starship; The cantina sequence took an entire day to film\u2014from 6am one day to 6am the next. The costumed actors withstood heat, claustrophobia, and (for some) low oxygen intake. When Bea Arthur's son Daniel Saks visited the set, he saw \u201ca nurse running around feeding oxygen into the various aliens to make sure they didn't pass out.\" Rick Baker, who had worked on the original Star Wars, again served as creature supervisor for the scene. Although many of the cantina creatures were reused from Star Wars, \"Lion Man\" and \"Baboon Man\" were created for the special. These two wore complicated makeup that took two and a half hours to apply. For Harvey Korman's scenes, he reportedly kept the cast and crew entertained and brought levity to the set. Acomba suggested then-unknown comedian Robin Williams for a role, but the Welches preferred to use established stars. Cher was the original choice to play Mermeia, but the part ultimately went to Diahann Carroll."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to Acomba's inexperience directing television and his difficulties working with Ken and Mitzie Welch, he departed the project partway through production. To make matters worse, much of the budget had been spent and (according to Gary Smith) the production was in danger of being cancelled. As a result of these difficulties, production shut down to find a replacement director. Gary Smith then asked Steve Binder, a former colleague, to step in as director. When Binder began shooting in September, he found himself on a project that was behind schedule and over-budget: \u201cWhen I got called in, they had already started production and shut it down because they had spent all their budget and only shot a fourth of the show. So I came in as a kind of a fireman. I got the script on a Friday, and I started shooting on a Monday. When I saw the script, I saw the first 10 minutes with the Chewbacca family was just in subtitles. I thought, 'Uh-oh, we're gonna be in trouble.'

As with the actors in the cantina sequence, those in Wookiee suits had to take breaks every hour to get oxygen. Lumpy actress Patty Maloney lost a significant amount of weight as a result of her heavy costume and the heat. The ending celebration was filmed at an aircraft hangar. By that point in production, the project had run out of funds. As a result, the crew had to use relatively inexpensive materials to create the Life Day ceremony; Store-bought candles were used as lighting, and red robes and Don Post Studios Chewbacca masks were worn by extras in lieu of full Wookiee costumes. According to Vilanch, Fisher was eager to sing for this scene because \"She was going through her Joni Mitchell period. She very much wanted to show this side of her talent.\u201d After shooting for over a month, the production finally wrapped.

I loved every minute on the set and loved coming to the studio every day. I gave it my all and have never worried about the day-after or pro or con critics' 'opinions.'
