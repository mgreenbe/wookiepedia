It was located on Market Street. Daric LaRone and his other four rogue stormtroopers Taxtro Grave, Saberan Marcross, Korlo Brightwater, and Joak Quiller visited the city of Janusar after deserting the Reprisal to purchase supplies. The corruption came to their attention and they felt obliged to help the people of Janusar. They were successful in liberating the citizenry from their corrupt leaders, and from here on named themselves the Hand of Judgment. After purchasing their remaining supplies they then left Janusar, and Patroller Central was now free of corruption."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
