This religion dictated the structure of Aramandi society, including the four different castes and the selection of leaders. The Eeronon also commanded that every single Aramandi akia (clan) must work for the day when they could leave Aram and colonize their own star systems. The Orma akia had successfully done this by the time of the Galactic Civil War. One of the most basic rules of the Eeronon was that the Armandi were the only intelligent lifeforms in the galaxy. When Humans from the Lant Mining Corporation entered the Aramand Cluster, this belief was shattered. Many Aramandi proclaimed the priests to be liars, forcing the priests to hide on unpopulated planets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
