In the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Hoth, which saw the Alliance forced to evacuate its hidden Echo Base, she was faced with rebuilding her own squadron which had fought at Hoth and was now based aboard the MC80 Star Cruiser Liberty. However, she was also tasked by Mon Mothma with organizing the starfighter defense of the Alliance Fleet's Rendezvous Point Delta-Three, which was threatened with being discovered by pirates operating out of the Vosch Cluster. The Contessa assigned Wedge Antilles, the former Rogue Three, to cobble together a makeshift squadron out of the understrength starfighter complement to neutralize the pirate threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under her direction, Antilles assembled a group of Rogue Squadron veterans, rookies, and troublemakers to crew a reformed Red Squadron.

Furthermore, it became apparent that the Death Star was indeed operational when it destroyed the Liberty, Corona's operational base.
