Left dying on the battlefield, the soldier was approached by Boba Fett, who asked him of the whereabouts of Yolan Bren. The soldier refused to help Fett, until the bounty hunter stomped down on his stub of a leg. In pain, the soldier finally told Fett what he wanted to know. Leaving the soldier to die, Fett turned away, but the Solem's conscience would not allow this. Regretting his treason, the soldier reached for a blaster rifle and tried to shoot Fett in the back. Fett was quicker, however, and disarmed the Solem before killing him with a shot to the head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
