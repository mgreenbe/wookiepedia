Equipped with dozens of tools and appendages for lifting and fabricating, the I-C4a was able to both clear land and build structures at a surprising rate.

The GT-series construction droid was able to interface with the I-C4a combat construction droid, and was often used to replace the vehicle's organic crew. I-C4a units developed fast-talking, obsessive, and often distracted personalities when not in the possession of the Galactic Empire, speaking in a dense mix of engineering jargon and scientific technobabble."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Utilized during the time of the Galactic Empire, the I-C4a combat construction droid was manufactured by Veril Line Systems for the Imperial Corps of Engineers and was available for 750,000 credits.
