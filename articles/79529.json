The acid lake formed over the ruins of Fellwater Labs, a laboratory that was destroyed in the bombardment of the planet, and its waters were a sickly green color. The biological experiment known as Subject Alpha roamed the lake around 3643 BBY, and a group of Republic colonists built a colony within a bunker on the shore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
