In the year 34 ABY, the speeder-modder Si-Cos Tejujuar drove a modified Tri-Vanquish 7 while in the city of Canto Bight on the planet Cantonica. Tejujuar's unarmed speeder was rectangular in shape, using a standard Tri-Vanquish frame, but altered to carry a Kismet-1010 outrigger drive turbine on either side of the vehicle's rear end. He also added a rakish, smoked-glass windshield and repulsorlifts that emitted a resonant, subsonic purr. The repulsor array cowlings were located along the two sides of the speeder and a pair of forward hazard sensors were located at the front of the vehicle. When Tejujuar handed the vehicle over to valets in Canto Bight they made sure to take their time parking it in order to catch they eye of envious visitors to the city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Tri-Vanquish 7 first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017.
