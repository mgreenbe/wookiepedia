While riding with his pirates, Targrim led the group into many skirmishes to plunder ships passing through the Maelstrom.

The moon was located inside the Maelstrom, and Rodin Higron's pirates set up shop there. Furious with Higron's intrusion, Targrim devised a scheme to eliminate the rival gang. Targrim's pirates hijacked the Kuari Princess and sent it on a collision course with Higron's base of operations. Unfortunately for the Riders, a team of Alliance to Restore the Republic agents boarded the ship and thwarted Targrim's plan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
