Her parents were Phirmist spacers, and she was born on their ship. When she was a child, in the early years of the Galactic Empire, her parents' ship was impounded and they were killed, resulting in a lifelong enmity with the Empire that led Nera to eventually join the Rebellion. She shaved her head, after an incident when she was seven years old where her hair got caught on something while she was crawling around the bowels of her parents' ship. She had an unrequited crush on the Rebel starfighter pilot Garven Dreis, due to his personality and professionalism."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
