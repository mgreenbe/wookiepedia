For many of his duties, he wore a simple, traditional kilt rather than vonduun crab armor, which also enabled him to display his striking markings \u2014 a single scar that zig-zagged up his body from one knee to the top of his skull like a seam, around which his other tattoos and markings were evolved. As a member of the Warlord's guard, he was assigned as Viqi Shesh's handler, and he also led searches for Jedi on captured Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one of these hunts, in which Viqi was used as something like a psychological bloodhound, Denua Ku's war party came across the cyborg Irek Ismaren, now known as Lord Nyax, and while the rest of the warriors were butchered, Ku, uncharacteristically for a Yuuzhan Vong, fled to inform the Warmaster. He was given two dozen warriors to locate the Jeedai. When Nyax was attempting to break into the remains of the Jedi Temple, Ku was amazed by the cyborg's raw combat abilities, but in the course of the battle, he found himself flung against the broken structures around him, and impaled through the chest by a rebar spar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He asked Viqi Shesh to tell the Warmaster that he had died well, but Shesh said she would tell them he died whining for \"infidel\" medicines, before fleeing to the Terson family's apartment, where there was an escape ship waiting. Enraged, Ku somehow managed to haul himself off the meter-long metal spear, and climbed the skyscraper in pursuit of Viqi. He told her that he was going to kill her, but she jumped out a window to her death.
