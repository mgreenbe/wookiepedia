He was the last squadron leader to report stand-by status and prepared to attack the Death Star, but pulled up at the last second on General Lando Calrissian's orders when it was revealed that the shield was still up. Green Squadron was ordered to stick close to Sector MV-7 as a massive flotilla of Star Destroyers emerged from the other side of the moon. The Alliance had walked right into a trap, but were determined to go down fighting. Initially, both sides fought with only their starfighters to the rebels' confusion, but this turned to horror when the Death Star proved itself to be fully operational, firing its superlaser on the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Liberty and reducing it to atoms. Following the advice of Calrissian, the remaining Rebel forces moved up alongside the Star Destroyers and fought at point-blank range, hoping the Death Star wouldn't dare shoot into its own fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the shield protecting the Death Star was disabled, several fighters broke off and headed for it to destroy the reactor. To buy them time, Crynyd and his squadron attacked the Imperial flagship, the mighty Super Star Destroyer Executor, with two A-wings knocking out its bridge deflector shields. In response, Admiral Firmus Piett ordered the forward batteries to increase forward firing to prevent any window of opportunity from being exploited. As Crynyd attempted a trench run through the ship's superstructure, his fighter was struck by a laser bolt and spun wildly. Realizing he was doomed, Crynyd managed to wrestle what little control he had over his starfighter and put it on a collision course with the Executor's unshielded bridge tower. Letting out one last cry of defiance, Crynyd's ship crashed through the bridge windows and exploded, killing himself alongside Piett and the entire bridge crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Without its command structure, the Executor lost primary power and plunged into the Death Star's gravity well, colliding with the station and detonating in a massive fireball.
