It had six legs, six laser cannon turrets along the body and a heavy projectile mass-driver cannon on the top of the walker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The All Terrain Tactical Enforcer was a low-built vehicle that featured six articulated legs for propulsion. Its body consisted of two armored halves that were connected by a flexible concertina section, which increased the walker's mobility on the field; it was essentially a mechanical version of the arctic horny whelmer, a hardy animal native to Rothana. Because its legs were low to the ground, the walker had a relatively low top speed, but it also enjoyed greater stability. As its name suggested, the AT-TE was suitable for all terrains; not only was it able to climb sheer surfaces, it could also scale certain metal surfaces due to its magnetized feet. Furthermore, the walker was capable of surviving in the vacuum of realspace as it was able to be pressurized. The AT-TE measured 22.02 meters in length and 9.57 meters in height."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AT-TE's most powerful weapon was a single mass-driver cannon located on the vehicle's dorsal surface, which gave the walker the purpose as a mobile artillery vehicle as well as a tank. Four smaller ball-turret laser cannons were mounted at the front, and two others at the rear. The hexapod's armor could easily deflect small arms fire. The AT-TE could be pierced by tanksmasher rockets, which could result in the destruction of the vehicle's complex propulsion mechanisms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The walker's pilot sat in a forward compartment, while a gunner sat exposed atop the walker to operate the mass-driver cannon. The standard version of the AT-TE carried 20 troops, and some variants carried smaller All Terrain Reconnaissance Transports in their rear hold. Their crews were assisted by an IM-6 medic droid, who attended to any injured clone troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Built by Rothana Heavy Engineering, the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer became the principal battle tank of the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. The B1-series battle droids of the Separatist Droid Army took to calling the AT-TEs \"six legs.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was used in many large scale open battles and was also used in operations smaller in scale, such as charging up a mountain face during the Battle of Teth to rescue Rotta the Huttlet. During the Battle of Devaron, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, knowing that the walkers were pressurized and had magnetized feet, deployed two AT-TEs, ATAT300 and 773, onto bounty hunter Cad Bane's Munificent-class star frigate while it was in the vacuum of space. This strategy was condemned by Admiral Wullf Yularen when Skywalker proposed it, but Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano and Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" understood his logic and commended his thinking. Ultimately, it was successful, though Skywalker and his team were unable to retrieve the Jedi holocron they were sent to retrieve."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AT-TEs continued to be used throughout the war. During the Conquest of Kaller, at least one AT-TE of General Depa Billaba's clone force fought against a battalion of battle droids, but the walker was taken out by fire from Armored Assault Tank Mk Is. A blast from an AT-TE was Clone Commander Cody's chosen method in executing Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi when he received Order 66, since it allowed him to fire on Kenobi in a surprise attack, as Kenobi was not yet aware of the clones' betrayal. However, the blast only succeeded in knocking Kenobi into water, and he later escaped to safety."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Imperial Service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AT-TEs were used on the Seperatist capital of Raxus Secundus by Captain Bragg to disperse protestors after the remaining senator of the Parliament, Avi Singh, refused to let the Empire keep the peace it worked hard to achieve after the deaths of Count Dooku, General Grievous, and the Separatist Council. One AT-TE was later hijacked by Clone Force 99 to rescue Singh and his droid GS-8. Several more AT-TEs were destroyed by the squad as they fled the city."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Improvised home"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fifteen years after the end of the Clone Wars, Captain Rex, along with Commanders Wolffe and Gregor, were living in a modified AT-TE on Seelos. They, along with the Lothal Rebels, later used the tank to evade Imperial forces, which consisted of three All Terrain Armored Transport walkers. The tank's mass driver cannon was able to destroy one AT-AT in the sandstorm before Rex ordered a direct assault on the other two while the Rebels escaped. The mass-driver cannon was not strong enough to penetrate the AT-AT armor, with the exception of the walkers' 'necks'."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AT-TE was able to sustain multiple shots from both AT-ATs before Wolffe rammed it into one of the walkers. The cannon was temporarily knocked out, but Gregor was able to restore power when the rebels returned and hijacked one of the AT-ATs, giving Rex the opening to shoot the last walker in the neck. The AT-TE was destroyed when the AT-AT collapsed on it."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several AT-TEs were later modified by Rebel Alliance mechanics in order to be used as an attack vehicle during the Galactic Civil War. A number were modified with thicker armor and more powerful armament, becoming known as Elite AT-TEs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least one AT-TE was used in the Imperial defense of the Kuat Drive Yards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
