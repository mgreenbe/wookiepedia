It was located in the Nyemari capital city, Anem. The Royal Palace was wired for silent alarms and had a contingent of guards. The palace had three wings laid out on the cardinal points and also had a large shoe closet, with a Dramassian shimmersilk door. In 1 ABY, a team of Rebel Alliance operatives infiltrated the Royal Palace to steal access codes from the ruling Duchess. The codes were for the Nyemari Imperial Military Installation. When they tripped the silent alarm, two of the Rebels hid in the shoe closet while a third acquired an airspeeder in which to escape. The airspeeder burst into the closet to pick up the hidden Rebels; together, they escaped the Royal guards by fleeing through Anem."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nyemari Royal Palace was a building in the Nyemari capital city of Anem.

In that year, a team of Rebel Alliance operatives infiltrated the Palace to steal the Duchess' access codes to the Nyemari Imperial Military Installation. Their mission was to infiltrate the Palace unseen, steal the codes, and get back out; Leia Organa searched the west wing while her companions Han Solo and Luke Skywalker took the north and south wings. After finding the access codes, Organa tripped the silent alarms when Solo bumped into her. Solo and Skywalker hid in the shoe closet while the Wookiee Chewbacca stood watch, posing as one of the Royal guard. After an hour of waiting, Solo and Skywalker were beginning to get worried that they had not heard from Organa when she burst through the wall of the closet in a stolen black airspeeder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She sprayed blaster fire from the laser cannons into the closet, causing chaos and scattering the guards.
