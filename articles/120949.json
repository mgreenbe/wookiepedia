It had a shell that split in two, and would only open when an individual tapped in the correct sequence to a fringe of sensory tissue on the sclipune's side. Deign Lian used one to store a communications villip secretly linked to Tsavong Lah. Another sclipune was in the possession of Yuuzhan Vong executor Nom Anor in 29 ABY; this particular sclipune was used to store keepsakes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
