During the Flesh Raider uprising, the native Flesh Raiders of Tython used toxin mines against the Twi'lek Pilgrims of Kalikori village in an attempt to destroy the settlement's agricultural fields. The natives planted the mines in the soil of the fields, where the gases released by the devices began to destroy the village's crops. The gas was also poisonous to many species, including humans, Twi'leks, Zabraks, Miraluka, and Mirialans; one of the village's scouts fell deathly ill when he attempted to investigate the devices. The poisonous effects were not permanently fatal, however, as the villager began to recover after being rescued from the clouds of gas. Three mines were destroyed by the apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din in a skirmish in the fields when the Padawan defeated the Flesh Raider saboteurs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
