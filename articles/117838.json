They lived in the planetoid's grassy plains (yellow-furred) or high in the trees (greenish white-furred), eating nuts and berries, and hibernating in the cold winter seasons. Among their adaptations, they had sharp, strong incisors for nut-cracking and suction-like foot pads for stability and grasping.
