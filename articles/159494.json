Eventually Seafon Galeel, the current head of the Federation, realized that the elongated conflict, which had become violent at times, did more harm than good to the slave labor force on Varadan, so by 24 BBY, the conflict was ceased, and the mines of Varadan were supplied with an abundance of fresh water, slightly improving the working conditions due to available rationing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
