In 15 BBY, seeking to teach him some responsibility, the family dispatched him to establish a trading post on the planet Biitu, along with his droids, C-3PO and R2-D2. However, shortly after he arrived, the planet was invaded by Imperial forces under the command of the Great Heep and Baobab was taken prisoner. Escaping with the help of the young Biituian Fidge Tadrazan, Baobab and the droids helped to destroy the Great Heep and free the people of Biitu from the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the new trading post on Biitu, the rise of the Galactic Empire had left the Baobab Merchant Fleet facing financial ruin and Baobab determined to save it by establishing a trade route to the planet Roon, source of the valuable Roonstones. Baobab made the journey through the Cloak of the Sith to the Roon system but his quest soon came to the attention of Governor Bisad Koong of Roon's Tawntoom province, who was negotiating to supply Roonstones to the Empire's Admiral Terrinald Screed. During his time on Roon, Baobab encountered Auren Yomm, a resident of the rebellious Umboo province. Yomm aided Baobab in his search for Roonstones and the two soon developed an attraction. When Auren and her doctor father, Nilz, were kidnapped by Koong, who was hoping that Nilz could cure him of the rooze disease, Baobab set off to the Fortress of Tawntoom to rescue them. In so doing, he discovered the source of the Roonstones\u2014in the walls of the volcano beneath the fortress. Baobab escaped with the Yomms, but his fortune appeared lost when Koong destroyed the Roonstones to prevent the Empire stealing them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After securing financial backing, Baobab was able to find an alternate source of Roonstones and established a trade route between Roon and Manda which revived his family's fortunes.

Baobab's father managed the Merchant Fleet and, as heir to the dynasty, the young Baobab was expected to one day take over running the family business. However, Baobab seemed incapable of focusing on the business, instead focusing on his love of travel and adventure. On one journey to Socorro, Baobab met the young Lando Calrissian and the two became friends. From Calrissian, Baobab acquired the nickname \"the Wook,\" a reference to his long, unmanageable beard which Calrissian frequently encouraged him to have styled. After much resistance, Baobab finally agreed and started wearing his beard shorter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The family elders became increasingly concerned about Baobab's attitude in light of the rise of the Galactic Empire and the events following the dissolution of the Trade Federation after the Clone Wars concluded in 19 BBY. The Empire favored pro-Imperial shipping firms and the fiercely independent Baobabs struggled to be awarded contracts. Their position in the industry was shaken as a result. In 15 BBY, the Baobab elders decided to attempt to instill a sense of respectability and hard work in Baobab by sending him to the planet Biitu to establish a trading post and fuel ore mining operation. While staying at the spaceport hotel on Manda, Baobab encountered the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, who had been working at the hotel since they were dropped off on the planet by their former owner, Jann Tosh, on his way to join the Imperial Academy.

While he conducted his search for a suitable location for the mine, he quickly developed a friendship with the native Biituians and resolved to develop his mining operation to provide the inhabitants with a fair share of the profits. Baobab eventually discovered a large source of fuel ore near some old ruins on a crater near the Biituian settlement. However, as he returned to town with a sample for analysis, an Imperial vessel descended above the settlement, causing a large storm which uprooted trees and sucked all water from the nearby river. As the scared natives began to flee, Baobab attempted to get the Biituian child Fidge Tadrazan and his pet Chubb safely to his ship, but was struck by some falling debris and knocked unconscious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The colony was soon pacified by Imperial forces under the command of the giant Abominor droid known as the Great Heep. The Heep constructed the \"moisture eater,\" a tower that drained all moisture from the atmosphere, causing a drought that threatened to kill the natives, and established a droid-run mining operation to extract the fuel ore for the Empire. Baobab, meanwhile, was captured and imprisoned. After the Argo Moon was boarded by the Heep's forces, C-3PO and R2-D2 were also captured and taken to Biitu. R2-D2 was sent to the Heep's droid harem, where the Amominor stored astromech droids before draining their power to recharge himself, while the Heep took C-3PO to see Baobab. Baobab was relieved to see the droid but concerned about Captain Cag's crew, whose fate was unknown to the droid.

Tadrazan and Chubb took refuge in a nearby pipe, leading to the tunnels below but Baobab, thinking quickly, sprayed the contents of C-3PO's lubricant dispenser in the droid's path, causing it to lose grip and roll back into the mine. With the immediate threat eliminated, C-3PO presented Baobab with a canteen of water, before checking the pipe for any sign of Tadrazan.

That night, however, C-3PO returned, along with Tadrazan, who brought Baobab a saw with which to escape from his cell. Tadrazan also informed him that the network of pipes under the mine led back to the village, but Baobab realized that they needed access to a ship if they were to stop the Empire. He therefore planned to steal Screed's ship, but he would need R2-D2's assistance to fly it.

Only the arrival of Tadrazan saved Baobab, when the Biituian started throwing rocks at the Imperials, providing enough of a distraction for Baobab to kick away the weakened bar and escape. The two fled into the nearby pipe, sealing the entrance behind them as the Imperials opened fire. Upon hearing that C-3PO had been captured during the attempted rescue of R2-D2, Baobab set off to find the droids. Tadrazan, meanwhile, returned to the harem to rescue another astromech in case Baobab was unsuccessful.

With his disguise in place, Baobab appeared to be just another droid involved in the fuel ore loading operation and attracted little attention from the Imperial guards. Having successfully reached the ship, Baobab instructed R2-D2 to patch into its computer and attempt to activate its engines and turbolasers.

The Imperial forces moved to shoot down the stolen vessel, but the situation quickly descended into chaos when Tadrazan and Chubb arrived, along with dozens of astromechs from the harem which started to attack the stormtroopers. The commotion attracted the attention of the Great Heep, who attempted to take control of the situation.

The only route to the system at that time was the Death Wind Corridor, a largely unknown route which was tricky to navigate and used predominantly by smugglers. Baobab was not the first in his family to seek the Roonstones, and the quest had been a passion of his father, uncle and grandfather before him. However, Roon was an isolated world and the only files to contain information about the Roon system had, for centuries, been inaccurate and incomplete.

The two finished their deal quickly, with Krox handing a datacard containing the map to Baobab before making his exit as three stormtroopers entered the cantina. Baobab, however, was not so fortunate, and the stormtroopers approached him and C-3PO to take them into custody. Only the quick actions of R2-D2 allowed the group to escape, when the droid manipulated the cantina's jukebox to produce a high-pitch noise that jammed the stormtroopers' audio amplifiers, leaving them momentarily incapacitated.

Following the comets, the Caravel proceeded into the asteroid field on the outskirts of the Cloak of the Sith. Despite R2-D2's best efforts to navigate through the field, the ship was struck by an asteroid, jolting its stabilizers and leaving it drifting towards a radioactive cloud.

Disguised in the merchants clothing, Baobab distracted the guards with the mupple pies while R2-D2, still under the affects of the molecular disruptor, entered the building through a nearby air vent and assisted the Yomms in escaping. When the guards spotted the prisoners emerging from the building, Baobab charged them, knocking them to the floor, where Nilz Yomm incapacitated them with a spray of his newly developed cure for the rooze disease."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group headed to the landing pad, hoping to escape aboard the Caravel. However, they arrived just as Screed, having run out of patience with Koong, was preparing to leave. Upon seeing Baobab's group, the admiral dispatched his stormtroopers to stop their escape. Taking some of the serum, Baobab instructed the Yomms to get the ship ready, while he and the droids approached one of the large turbolasers guarding the landing platform. Baobab had the droids take the controls of the turbolaser and, knowing that the Imperials would not fire while he carried the only means of curing Koong, presented his terms\u2014in exchange for safe passage from Roon and freedom for Umboo, he would provide Koong and Screed with the serum and the source of the Roonstones. The droids fired at the walls of the volcano, revealing the Roonstones below, but Koong never had the chance to accept Mungo's offer\u2014the double-crossing Admiral Screed placed the fortress under Imperial authority and claimed the Roonstones for the Empire. The furious governor hijacked the turbolaser and fired on the cache of crystals, sending the Roonstones falling into the lava below rather than see them fall into Screed's hands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Roonstones caused the lava to freeze, depriving the fortress of its only source of heat and leaving it vulnerable to the harsh climate. The Imperials fled in Screed's shuttle, while Baobab and the droids headed for the Caravel. Gaff attempted to prevent their escape, but R2-D2 charged into the Kobok and, as Gaff attempted to fight the droid, he injected himself with his own stingers and passed out. As Baobab boarded the ship, he paused to throw the serum to Koong, but it was too late to save the governor, who died moments after the Caravel launched. Auren offered her condolences on the loss of the Roonstone treasure as they flew away from the volcano. Baobab, however, informed her that he had found far more than treasure, and the two kissed. The young couple had little time to spend together, however. After returning to the Yomm residence, where Nilz used the serum to cure his wife, Baoabab followed the rainbow comets back to Manda to let his father know he was alright. He left the droids behind to help the people of Umboo recover from the recent attack and promised to return soon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fortune and glory"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Koong was defeated, the loss of the only known source of Roonstones did not improve the Baobab Merchant Fleet's financial situation. Baobab desperately needed to locate another source of Roonstones and approached his old friend Lando Calrissian to acquire funding for another expedition. Calrissian agreed and Baobab soon returned to Roon. Reunited with Auren and his droids, Baobab had time to study the single Roonstone to survive his previous adventures. He noticed some etchings marring the surface of the crystal which C-3PO was able to identify as writing. The droid translated the markings and discovered that the earliest known text of Dha Werda Verda, an epic poem chronicling the conquest of the Zhell by the Taung in an ancient battle on Coruscant, was encoded within the crystal. Baobab sent the droids back to the Baobab Archives on Manda to attempt to further translate the data contained within the crystal. However, C-3PO's pomposity and R2-D2's attitude made them unpopular with the researchers, who \"mistakenly\" sold them to Krellus Barzane, an Arkanian trafficker in used technology. The droids were eventually sold to Senator Wena Havid of Kalarba. Nevertheless, the evidence Baobab had uncovered suggested that the Roonstones had come to Roon from some ancient source and earned him a place in numerous history texts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the following years, Baobab spent much of his time in the Roon system and pursued his relationship with Auren Yomm. His search for another source of Roonstones in the system was ultimately successful and he established an operation on Quilken in the Roon system to process and export shipments of the crystals to Sim'char'ser and other worlds throughout the Outer Rim Territories. He also established a laboratory where his staff could study the Roonstones. The Quilken facility included a resort and the Club Baobab casino for visitors to the system, though Baobab was usually too busy to take advantage of the facilities himself. His shipments to other systems benefited greatly from Baobab formally establishing a three-point trade route between Roon, Manda and Ryloth, the nearby Twi'lek homeworld. The Manda-Roon Merchant Route used automated lightstations throughout the Cloak of the Sith to guide the way from Manda to Roon and eliminating the need to wait for the Rainbow comets to pass through the system. Though the Manda-Roon Merchant Route was still considered a challenge, it was reliable and preferred by most pilots to the Death Wind Corridor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Baobab eventually took ownership of the Baobab Merchant Fleet and the business prospered.

Soon after, Raynor dispatched the bounty hunter Thune to kill Calrissian and his cyborg chief administrative aide Lobot. The pair fled Cloud City aboard Calrissians ship, the Cobra, but were pursued by Thune who had planted a tracking device on the ship. Realizing that they were close to the Roon system, Calrissian decided to head to Quilken and seek Baobab's help against the bounty hunter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving on Quilken, Calrissian met with Baobab and his wife in a bar at the casino, where the gambler explained the situation and Baobab agreed to help his old friend.

Lobot, who had stayed near where the Cobra had landed to watch for Thune's arrival, soon informed them that the bounty hunter had reached the planet and was examining their ship.

The bounty hunter appeared to take the bait and approached the table, her blaster pointed straight at Calrissian. Seeing an opportunity, one of Baobab's security personnel attempted to draw her own blaster, but Thune reacted quickly and shot her dead before grabbing both Calrissian and the inebriated Zeltron as hostages. A second member of security attempted to intervene, but again the bounty hunter was too fast and he too was killed. Incensed at the death of his staff, Baobab warned Thune to surrender as his security would never allowed her to escape Quilken. With Thune's attention momentarily on Baobab, Lobot was able to quickly overpower and disarm her, before Baobab called for more security to take her into custody and attend to his fallen staff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Baobab allowed Calrissian to use his sources to find information on Thune while his staff helped Lobot search the Cobra for the hidden tracking device. Although Thune had been captured, the threat to Calrissian's life remained while Raynor was at large. However, Baobab and Calrissian were able to devise a way to eliminate the threat. They visited the prisoner and injected her with kessum, a type of Roonstone that broke apart too easily to be valuable but which bounced electrical signals off surrounding objects and could be used as a tracking device. They explained that, if Thune were to go after either one of them, the other would know about it and arrange for some mutual acquaintances\u2014former interrogators for Bwahl the Hutt\u2014to go after her. Furthermore, they offered 20,000 credits, one tenth of the bounty on Calrissian, for her to capture Raynor instead.
