When his actions were uncovered after more than a decade, fifteen specimens\u2014twisted and unidentified creatures that had been subjected to Lorrick's gene splicing and viral modifications\u2014were found in the lab, and he was arrested. However, because it was impossible to identify what the creatures originally were, the authorities were unable to prove that he had been experimenting on sentient beings, and thus he was only exiled instead of imprisoned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
