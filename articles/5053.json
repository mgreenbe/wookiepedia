The last monarch was Queen Breha Organa, who perished along with her homeworld when the Galactic Empire destroyed Alderaan with the Death Star in 0 BBY. Although the Alderaanian diaspora managed to regroup, they had yet to reform their monarchy by 5 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The monarch of Alderaan (otherwise referred to as \"the King\" if male, and \"the Queen\" if female) both ruled and governed the planet, with the help of ministers and advisors. In addition, he or she had charge of the royal books, balancing the many accounts and personally overseeing funding of all public works on Alderaan. In some cases, the monarch even assumed a ministerial portfolio. While the monarch worked for harmony on Alderaan, the planet's dealings with the galaxy at large were entrusted to his or her consort (referred to as viceroy if male)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The monarchy on Alderaan already existed a millennium before the rule of the Galactic Empire. In the distant past, belligerence did exist on Alderaan, and princes and princesses who made their claim to the crown sometimes had to fight their way to the throne room. Over time, however, a pacifist culture focused on creativity, love, and life developed on the planet, and the monarch was made the guarantor of that philosophy. Because the monarchs of Alderaan proved loyal compassionate to their people, regardless of their social background, they, in turn, enjoyed the loyalty and love of the Alderaanians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point before the end of the Clone Wars, Breha Organa ascended took the mantle of queen. She witnessed the fall of the democratic Galactic Republic and its replacement by the dictatorial Galactic Empire, and, along with her consort and viceroy Bail Prestor Organa, played a major part in the rise of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. She remained on the throne until her death in 0 BBY, which occurred during the destruction of Alderaan by the Death Star, a mobile, sphere-shaped battle station the size of a Class IV moon. However, Crown Princess Leia Organa, who was on a secret mission to Tatooine, survived the destruction of her homeworld. Viscount Rabael Dir Glorio, 26th in line to the throne and last scion of House Glorio, also survived the cataclysm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Alderaan no longer existed, some surviving Alderaanians like Evaan Verlaine considered Princess Leia Organa to be their new queen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor, the surviving Alderaanians lived together aboard a seven-starship flotilla and planned to build themselves a new home from the remains of the second Death Star. However, they still had not chosen a monarch, and were ruled by Regent Administator Eglyn Valmor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the conflict between the First Order and the Resistance, Leia Organa was still considered the last princess of Alderaan. However, that status commanded little authority, since almost nobody took the concept of hereditary nobility seriously any longer, and Organa never wore any symbol of royalty unless tradition demanded it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Succession"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A monarch of Alderaan was meant to be succeeded by his or her eldest child.

During her reign, Queen Breha was properly heralded and referred to as \"Her Majesty Breha Organa\" or \"Her Majesty Queen Breha\", and addressed as \"Your Majesty\". Her viceroy and consort Bail Organa was addressed simply as \"Viceroy\". Their heiress Princess Leia was variously addressed as \"Your Highness\", \"Princess Leia (Organa) of Alderaan\", \"Princess Leia\", or just \"Princess\".

In fact, they favored relatively simple designs with muted colors. Queen Breha notably owned a blue-and-bronze slash-sleeved dress that mirrored her planet's oceans and valleys. Her state wardrobe also included a dress of bronze silk, which she wore with her hair piled high atop her head in braids woven through with strings of beads, a green dress with wide skirts, and a deep red silk robe. In informal contexts, she wore simple velvet robes and let her hair down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A viceroy's apparel of office included a long coat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Simple white outfits also played a significant role in the monarchy.
