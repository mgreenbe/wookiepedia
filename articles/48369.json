However, with the assistance of Fire's station manager, Zhang Jincheng, the enigmatic tenebrae was stolen by the Jade Rats, a group of thieves who have been stealing from Fire in the past few months, and later sold to the Blue Dragon, the most powerful pirate gang in the system. Intent on reclaiming their property, the Knights' pursuit of the enigmatic tenebrae brought their elite red apricot squad to Fire, where the squad attacked the Jade Rats and took a tracking device leading to the Blue Dragon in the nearby Lake asteroid field.

Shaped like a spindle with two sharp ends and a plump center, Fire's appearance was like that of a human eye. The space city's center was hollow, leaving space for the famous city core, Irregular, a round silver sphere that was the epitome of the Heaven system's technological and insutrial brilliance. Within Irregular were thirty two hypermatter reactors that provided a nearly inexhaustible power source for the space city, lending the latter its name as a nightless city, shining a spark of light against the deep darkness of space. Irregular also contained the gravitational field that covered the whole of the city, providing a suitable gravitational environment for people to take up residence aboard the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 82 BBY, towards the end of the High Republic Era, Fire was plagued by the Jade Rats, a group of thieves.
