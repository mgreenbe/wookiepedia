In about 19 BBY Haplif of the Agbui, a servant of the Grysk Jixtus, orchestrated a civil war that devastated much of the planet. A group of two hundred refugees, led by the Magys, escaped their planet, which was subsequently taken over and mined for nyix by the Agbui."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike many of the worlds of the Chaos populated by sentient species, Sunrise never had a long-range communications triad. Haplif and his team orchestrated the civil war on Sunrise in under six months. After the war, city lights that had shone brightly on the night side of the planet shone no longer, and the clouds had turned gray and black from the smoke and fire of the war. All of the pre-war government computers on Sunrise were destroyed in the war, leaving refugees who fled the planet without access to records of other civilizations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because Sunrise never had a comm triad, Haplif could not inform Jixtus of the fleeing refugees. Jixtus had instructed Haplif to leave no witnesses, so Haplif contacted the Nikardun Destiny to have them hunt down the refugees. This angered Jixtus, who told Haplif to make no direct communication with the Nikardun. Haplif contacted the Nikardun with the refugees' vector, and lied by saying the refugees were seeking to raise an army against General Yiv. Thus, Haplif inadvertently led the Nikardun to occupy the Rapacc system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In about 18 BBY, Sunrise was the site of two skirmishes between the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet and forces aligned with the Grysk Hegemony. The first of the two was during a reconnaissance mission in which Senior Captain Thrawn and Caregiver Thalias hoped to prove to the Magys that hope remained for her people. The second skirmish occurred two weeks later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
