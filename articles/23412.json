At one point he shoved the pirate Patchwork Fiddich's cheek against the muzzle of a blaster, peeling skin from flesh and scarring him in a ritual known as the Burning. Every day the captain told Mabin that she had no stomach for slaughter, but a good eye for treasure, even long after she had risen to the rank of mate. She eventually killed him as he was talking with a blade between the ribs, spilling his insides across the deck. Following his demise, Mabin donned Carabba's black cap and took over as leader of the Blazing Claw. By 10 BBY, she wrote about him in the book that would become known as the Smuggler's Guide, admitting he had been right about her eye for treasure, but misjudged her capacity for slaughter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carabba was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide, which was written by Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
