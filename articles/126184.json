In 16 ABY, while searching for information about his mother, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker saw an advertisement for the book in a courtesy cab operated by the Galactic Archives, a small shop in Trader's Plaza, Talos spaceport, on the planet Atzerri, which took customers to the merchant's central distribution hub. Other volumes advertised included the H'kig book of laws, Principles of Power, and a publication that purported to teach the secrets of forming group minds like the Bilar species; the shop promised a discount for the purchase of three or more books. Skywalker discounted the advertised volumes as probable frauds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith book of offerings and rituals is mentioned in Shield of Lies, a novel written by Michael P.
