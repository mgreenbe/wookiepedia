The bark of this tree could be used as sustenance or as light armor. The nutritional value of Perosa \"steaks\", as they were called, was minuscule, but they were juicy and tender if roasted over a fire. Ewoks and Yuzzums also used the sap of the Perosa tree as a strong adhesive for use in constructing their homes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
