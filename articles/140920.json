Possessing a blue blade, the lightsaber was powered by a kyber crystal Te'Ami had claimed on Ilum. The saber had a cerakote hilt with a copper crosspiece, and over years of use, the copper became heavily tarnished and the hilt was heavily scratched and gouged. By the Great Hyperspace Disaster, there was a large blob of solder near the lightsaber's business end where Te'Ami had had to reattach a component that had fallen off. All of the damage made the weapon appear to be what Te'Ami considered the ugliest-looking lightsaber in the Jedi Order. However, she felt no need to refresh her weapon like some Jedi did, as the lightsaber still worked perfectly well and she felt its appearance reflected a truth of the Force: that everyone was made of light on the inside, no matter what they looked like. Te'Ami used the lightsaber to unlock the weapons systems of the Jedi Vector she piloted, as the starship had been designed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Te'Ami's lightsaber appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi, by Charles Soule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
