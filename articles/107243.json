Some generators were capable of generating enough energy to power an entire colony. Other models were far smaller and used to power vehicles, such as the Moll K-19 power generator which powered Joben T-85 speeder bikes. The generators were easy to detect with scanners while active. Power droids, which acted as ambulatory batteries, were equipped with a small, internal power generator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
