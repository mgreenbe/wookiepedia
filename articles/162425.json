Soon afterward, Imperial sandtroopers boarded the sandcrawler in search of the stolen plans of the Death Star battlestation, which were stored in R2-D2.

I662 had a blue paint scheme and two rows of ten treaded wheels on its base. The droid had binocular fine-focus vision, which helped it spot circuitry damage.

The model was used for WED-15-I662 as well as the droid WED-15-77 and another Treadwell during the filming of the movie. Barry's sketch indicated that the model stood between four feet and four feet, six inches tall. Barry's notes showed that the prop had one functioning arm and housed a radio controller in its treadwell base to allow for off-screen crew members to control it.
