Stars in this class were hot and had uniquely nitrogen-heavy compositions. R-class stars were extremely volatile when introduced to a significant amount of supercooled liquid tibanna, and doing so could create a chemical chain reaction inducing the star to nearly double in size and emit destructive radiation that would be lethal to any nearby lifeforms. Such a reaction nearly occurred to an R-class star in the Hetzal system during the Great Hyperspace Disaster, but was prevented by a significant Jedi effort."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
