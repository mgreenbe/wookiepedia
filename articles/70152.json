The Antarian Rangers also operated chapter houses on Antar 4. The houses were supervized by the Council of First Knowledge, and were used as Jedi academies. After the formation of the Galactic Empire, most Jedi chapter houses in the Core Worlds were destroyed by COMPNOR fanatics. However, the chapter house located on Rhinnal was spared, and continued to serve as a medical treatment facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
