The ship's hyperdrive system monitored the warp, which had to remain stable throughout the ship's passage through hyperspace. It was known that flying through a nebula or other gaseous area while traveling in hyperspace created enough friction to alter or even destroy the continuum warp, which could violently force a reversion to realspace that often caused damage or destruction to the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
