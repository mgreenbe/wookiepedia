A criminal heist of the vertex treasury was attempted in the closing moments of the plaza ceremony\u2014as the treasury was being escorted under Senate Guard to its designated Core Bank vault repository\u2014by members of the Slam gang, in collusion with galactic criminals Granta Omega and Jenna Zan Arbor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The heist served as a diversion to the plaza of all Senate Security personnel from Omega and Zan Arbor's true target of assassination\u2014Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who was presiding over a full-Senate debate in the Galactic Senate Building on whether to bar the Jedi Order from further action on behalf of the Senate. Omega and Zan Arbor were the masterminds also of the debate itself, for it was the result of a petition that originated with Omega's early sponsor, Eeropha Senator Sano Sauro (his power-hungry eyes set now on the Republic Chancery), and brought to fruition by Jedi-shamed Nuralee Senator Bog Divinian and Jedi-deposed Romin dictator Roy Teda.
