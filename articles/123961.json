They used trickery to look like collections of wispy, yellow-white light, but were actually green amphibians. Tall and slender, with spongy bodies, they used leathery tendrils to entrap and drain the life out of their prey. They could also use the Force to affect their targets' thoughts and emotional state; for example, by convincing their prey that they were there to help. Grey Gabaki and Black Gabaki mushrooms grew from shaoryn droppings. Spicers protected shaoryn hunting grounds with holoprojectors that displayed \"terrifying images.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
