This wrist-rocket was designed to explode in a blast of nerve gas on impact. The gas lingered in the immediate area for some time, generally killing the target if the rocket's impact did not. The bounty hunter Mira was known to use this type of weapon towards the end of the Dark Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
