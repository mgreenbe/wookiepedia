In 20 BBY, he was hired to assassinate Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and seemingly succeeded in the Coruscant Underworld. Unbeknownst to Hardeen, he had in fact been hired by the Jedi Order, who faked Kenobi's death as part of a plan to send him undercover disguised as his own killer to investigate a plot against Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. After the supposed assassination, Hardeen was celebrating at Trueping's cantina when he was contacted by his mysterious employers, and was subsequently taken captive by Kenobi and Mace Windu. Kenobi, disguised as Hardeen via a facial transformation program and a vocal emulator, subsequently infiltrated a Separatist plot to abduct the Chancellor at the Festival of Light on Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rako Hardeen was a human male from the planet Concord Dawn who, by the year 20 BBY, was working as a bounty hunter. He had acquired enough of a reputation as a marksman that he was occasionally known by the epithet \"Marksman of Concord Dawn.\" Hardeen found himself a pawn in a complex plot to foil a kidnapping attempt on Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine organized by Moralo Eval and Count Dooku. He was hired by an anonymous client, who were truly members of the Jedi Council, to murder Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi by shooting at him from the top of a building on Coruscant, while Kenobi was attempting to return to the Jedi Temple with Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano. After shooting Kenobi in the chest as he had agreed, Hardeen was pursued by Skywalker. The bounty hunter managed to escape using smoke bombs and a speeder bike."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While celebrating his high-profile kill at Trueping's cantina, he was summoned into the back room to meet his employer and receive payment. There, he was met by Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2013his supposed victim, now physically altered to look like him. Hardeen was apprehended by the two Jedi, and his identity assumed by Kenobi in order to plant himself in a Republic prison. Hardeen's reputation for having killed a Jedi was essential to the plan, as Kenobi used it to gain the trust of other prisoners and attract the attention of Moralo Eval, from whom Kenobi was to acquire intel that would help the Jedi prevent the kidnapping attempt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inspector Tan Divo was building a case on Hardeen.

He had prominent stubble and a large, dark red tattoo on his face. As a bounty hunter, he was willing to take jobs that involved killing Jedi, and celebrated after he believed he had successfully killed one. However, he was not happy when the Jedi arrested him after discovering he had not actually killed Kenobi, although his would-be victim pointed out he had certainly intended to kill a Jedi.
