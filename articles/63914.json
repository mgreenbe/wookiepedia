Scouting new hyperspace routes was an incredibly dangerous task for an explorer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In many parts of the galaxy, hyperlanes required periodic re-entry into realspace to manually maneuver the ship towards the next hyper-point. Pirate raids were common in these spots. The Galactic Empire and other governments often sought to lessen this threat by constructing deep-space platforms at hyper-points. Mine fields and probe droids were also deployed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Major routes"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
