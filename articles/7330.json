The astromech droid, claiming to have the abilities needed to pilot a Bri'ahlian Sky-sled, failed miserably at his task of transportation, resulting in a beheaded C-3PO. Attempting to right matters, R2-D2 triggers an avalanche, incurring the wrath of the local fauna. Below the two droids, a small group of Bri'ahl activists gathered around a fire. Openly talking of their loathing for Naboo Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Bri'ahl President Vuul, the group forms a plan to disguise themselves as clone troopers to infiltrate the palace and assassinate the two. As soon as the plan was finished, the activists are momentarily dispatched by two falling droids, batted away by a huge beast. C-3PO and R2-D2 continue to wreak havoc as they mistakenly come across the group of disguised activists. Reaching across to shake hands with the commander, C-3PO's malfunctioning hand crashes into the visor, starting a false attack alarm. Thinking that the enemy is among them, the troopers quickly destroy each other. Wandering away from the carnage, the two droids finally obtain directions to the palace. As Gregar Typho explains to Amidala that the bodies of activists have been found, the droids stagger into the room. Unaware of their actions, Amidala scolds them for not remaining in palace grounds. Remarking that \"at least you came back in one piece\", Amidala's expression turns to one of amusement as C-3PO's head falls off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
