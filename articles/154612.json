At some point, the clone navigation officer was assigned to the Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute. In 22 BBY, the officer was deployed with a Republic fleet of three Venator-class Star Destroyers\u2014under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker; his Padawan, Commander Ahsoka Tano; and Admiral Wullf Yularen, the Resolute's deck officer\u2014to eliminate the Confederate blockade surrounding the planet Ryloth. Tano, in her first command position, led a squadron of starfighters to attack the blockade. However, the arrival of Confederate reinforcements caused the Republic's offensive to backfire. Confederate Vulture droids began suicide attacks on the Republic Star Destroyers, and Yularen was severely injured. Returning to the fleet, Tano's unit was almost completely eradicated. The cruisers Resolute and Defender were damaged and forced to retreat, while the cruiser Redeemer fell apart under heavy fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After taking a count of the losses and treating the wounded, Skywalker devised a plan to pilot the damaged Defender alone and ram it into the lead Confederate ship, eliminating the blockade's commander and leaving battle droids in control of the blockade.

After Tano presented a plan to angle the hull of the Resolute toward the blockade\u2014allowing starfighters to be launched, and drawing the Confederate frigates in with a classic Marg Sabl maneuver\u2014the officer was doubtful of the Jedi's plan, believing that more time and planning was needed to perform a successful attack. However, a revived Yularen supported Tano, and the Padawan was able to secure the defeat of the blockade, allowing Republic reinforcements to land on Ryloth and liberate the planet from Confederate rule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The naval officer was uncertain of Ahsoka Tano's abilities and accidentally revealed his doubts while planning a counterattack with Captain Rex and Tano, although he apologized.
