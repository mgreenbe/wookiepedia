It was meant to be a sequel of sort to Star Wars: Super Bombad Racing and was set for release in 2002. The project, the Lead Programmer of which was Todd Daggert, was canceled on May 1, 2001. As shown on the few available screenshots of the game, Hermes was to use the same \"cartoon\" design as Super Bombad Racing. Also based on the same screenshots, the game was to feature the planet Tatooine, a character that looked like a white-haired Han Solo, a YT-1300 light freighter, and a Mace Windu-lookalike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
