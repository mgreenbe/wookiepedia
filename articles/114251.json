In 21 BBY, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano decided to breach this law in order to meet the Separatist official Mina Bonteri, who was interested in finding a diplomatic solution to the Clone Wars. Following the bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid, the Republic abandoned a peace initiative with the Separatists. Tano's master, the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, later reprimanded her for breaking this law."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
