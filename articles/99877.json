It was awarded to those members who had achieved the rank of Mentor and still continued to work in the smuggling world. Members of the Old Guard were generally in some form of retirement but continued to support the Black Bha'lir in some form, such as a Master Smuggler. Only three percent of the Black Bha'lir's membership achieved the rank of Old Guard, and only members of the Old Guard were considered for election to the Tribunal of the Black Bha'lir Society."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
