Due to the airless nature of their homeworld, the Proteans communicated with each other via chemical and tactile signals exchanged when in direct contact. In addition, they had evolved a skin lined with tympanic nerves that were most likely used to sense vibrations along the ground of Nathas I. A notably unusual feature of the Proteans, given their airless natural environment, was their ability to funnel air through their bodies and modulate it, creating tonal variations in what was a form of wordless \"songs.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The seemingly-primitive Proteans themselves were not aware of the purpose for which they had evolved their shape-changing ability, and the species did not maintain written records.
