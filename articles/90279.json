New arrivals on Milvayne stayed at the processing center, such as the war refugee Vulaada Klam and her parents. However, Klam's father had a speeder crash on his record and her mother had a misplaced stamp on her papers. When the family in the tent next to them, who were displeased with the smell of Klam's pet qaberworm Gurtyl, reported these to the Milvayne Authority, Milvayne's law enforcement agency, Klam and her parents were thrown into Milvayne's underworld. Klam briefly mentioned her time at the processing center to the rogue archaeologist Chelli Aphra at some point between 0 ABY and 3 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Milvayne processing center was mentioned in the comic Doctor Aphra 27, written by Si Spurrier and published by Marvel Comics on December 12, 2018."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
