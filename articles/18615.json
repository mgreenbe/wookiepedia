Originally code-named Alpha, he was an unaltered clone of the famed Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. Boba emulated his father and genetic donor by wearing a customized suit of Mandalorian armor. His personal starship was the Slave I, a Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft that once belonged to Jango. Trained in combat and martial skills from a young age, Fett was one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy during the reign of Emperor Palpatine. He became a legend over the course of his career, which included contracts for both the Empire and the extensive criminal underworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boba was created on the planet Kamino as a result of an arrangement between the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus and Jango Fett, a Mandalorian foundling who served as the template of the Grand Army of the Republic. Unlike the clone troopers grown from Jango's DNA, Jango regarded Boba as his son. During the last days of the Separatist Crisis, Boba and Jango retreated to Geonosis where the latter was killed in battle by Jedi Master Mace Windu. Orphaned by Jango's death, Boba sought vengeance by attempting to assassinate Windu, although his plan proved unsuccessful.

He tried to prevent Solo's rescue by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, only to fall into the Great Pit of Carkoon when Solo accidentally slammed a pole into Fett's jetpack. Although Fett survived his ordeal with the man-eating sarlacc, his armor was sold to Cobb Vanth by Jawa scavengers. He eventually regained it by confronting Din Djarin, the Mandalorian who took Fett's armor from Vanth.

The army, however, was part of a Sith plot to overthrow the Republic and destroy the Jedi Order. Prior to the creation process, Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett was recruited by the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus. Jango was to be the genetic template for the clone army. Jango agreed to become the genetic template for a considerable payment, as well as one request: the creation of a clone who did not have the same genetic modifications, such as behavioral conditioning and growth acceleration. The Kaminoan scientists agreed and created a boy codenamed \"Alpha\" in 32 BBY shortly after the Battle of Naboo. Although he was born a clone, Alpha regarded Jango as his father, who likewise viewed the boy as his son.

When Kenobi arrived on Kamino, the Kaminoans revealed the clone army to him, and Kenobi requested to meet Jango. Taun We, an aide to Prime Minister Lama Su, brought the Jedi Knight to the Fetts' quarters, where Boba greeted them.

Together, Boba and the bounty hunters crafted a plan to assassinate the Jedi Master aboard the Republic vessel Endurance. Boba posed as a young clone trooper cadet, with the nickname Lucky, using the fact that he was genetically identical to the other young clones to his advantage; no one onboard Endurance was aware of his true identity. Once aboard the Endurance, Boba and the other clones were greeted by Windu and Anakin Skywalker, before being put through tactical training.

Sing instructed Boba via comlink to sabotage the Endurance's reactor core, thereby killing everyone on the ship, but Boba was reluctant to kill everyone. His only goal was to kill Windu. Nonetheless, Boba did as instructed, sneaking away from his fellow clones once again, before being caught by a clone trooper who called for security.

The pod was intercepted by Slave I, led by Sing and Bossk, which revealed Boba as the traitor who destroyed the Endurance. Boba was given the choice to either stay with the clone cadets or leave with the bounty hunters, and Boba somewhat reluctantly chose to leave with the bounty hunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After leaving the escape pod, Boba and the other bounty hunters, including Castas, made their way to the nearby planet Vanqor, where the Endurance had crashed after the explosion. Once there, they killed several clone troopers and captured Admiral Kilian, the ship's commanding officer, as well as Clone Commander Ponds and another officer. Hoping to set another trap for Windu, Boba rigged his father's old helmet as an explosive on the ship's bridge, which would be detonated if Windu came looking for any survivors. The Jedi Master, with Skywalker, arrived shortly thereafter. The helmet exploded just after Windu noticed it, and remembered that Jango had a son\u2014deducing that Boba was the one attempting to kill him.

As they entered the ship, they encountered R2-D2, Skywalker's personal astromech droid, who attempted to slow their advance by throwing debris at them and closing doors in their path.

R2-D2 was able to escape in the other starfighter, however, and survived a brief firefight with Slave I before jumping to hyperspace for Coruscant, where he successfully found help at the Jedi Temple and was able to bring a team of Jedi and clones to rescue Windu and Skywalker.

Sing executed Ponds on her own, jettisoning him into space, and Boba's relationship with her and the other bounty hunters began to deteriorate. Boba objected to the treatment of the other prisoners as well, going so far as to show compassion by providing them with water.

The bounty hunters created a diversion and attempted to escape, but Boba was captured while Sing fled on a speeder. Koon interrogated Boba, who refused to disclose the location of the hostages despite his reservations about their treatment. Ohnaka was able to convince Boba to tell the Jedi, however, by saying that Jango would have wanted his son to do the honorable thing.

To do so, Obi-Wan Kenobi faked his death and disguised himself as Rako Hardeen, the suspect in the attempt on his life, and entered the same prison where Boba was being held. Kenobi teamed with Moralo Eval, a suspect in the suspected kidnapping plot, and bounty hunter Cad Bane to escape the prison in the hopes it would lead him towards the heart of the conspiracy. As part of the escape attempt, Bane paid and encouraged Boba to confront \"Hardeen,\" and Boba claimed that Hardeen had cheated him out of a bounty. Boba and Kenobi briefly fought one another, before Bossk intervened and started a riot to defend Boba. Bane's plan was successful, and Kenobi eventually went on to help stop the plot against Chancellor Palpatine. After Bane's recapture, Boba called him out for having been recaptured so quickly after Boba's distraction. Bane then asked to tell him the story, to which Boba replied that he hoped it would end with Bane repaying him the money he promised for creating the earlier distraction. After asking further about their cut of the deal, Bane revealed that 'Hardeen' had not actually killed Kenobi, before going into the story of what transpired from Bane's perspective.

During the struggle against the raiders, Boba inadvertently knocked the chest over, revealing its contents: a young woman named Pluma Sodi, who had been kidnapped so she could be married to Otua Blank against her will. The leader of the raiders, Krismo Sodi, was her brother, who had been trying to save his sister. Ventress and Boba, who managed to remain on the tram, argued about the situation after Pluma pleaded with the former Sith acolyte, who felt sympathy for the girl; Ventress had also been forcibly taken from her home.

On the DVD commentary for Return of the Jedi, Lucas stated that if he had known Boba would be a popular character, he would have made the character's death in Return of the Jedi more exciting. Lucas contemplated adding a scene in Return of the Jedi where Boba climbed out of the sarlacc pit, especially in light of the character's story in Attack of the Clones, but ultimately decided against it because he thought that the audience would believe that Fett would appear later in the film if this scene had been seen. However, on July 16, 2014, Star Wars author and historian Jonathan W. Rinzler stated in a Reddit AMA that Lucas has said that Boba also survived the sarlacc in the new canon. This was officially confirmed when Fett appeared in \"Chapter 14: The Tragedy\" of The Mandalorian Season Two."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Lucas opted against adding Boba's escape, and the ambiguity surrounding the character's fate in sources such as the official Databank on StarWars.com, the Star Wars Legends continuity, previously known as the Expanded Universe, saw Boba escape from the sarlacc. He went on to appear in dozens of Expanded Universe stories set after Return of the Jedi. His last chronological Legends appearance was in Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse, set 40 years after Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Planned storylines"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Gary Kurtz, during the early development of the original trilogy, when Lucas envisioned the whole story of Star Wars in four trilogies and twelve films, he conceived Fett as the main antagonist of Return of the Jedi, because Darth Sidious was originally planned to be introduced in Star Wars: Episode IX. However, after Lucas decided to not make a third trilogy, Fett's role in Jedi was changed to a relatively minor role."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the development of the prequel trilogy, at one point Lucas considered depicting Anakin Skywalker and Fett as stepbrothers, possibly referencing their alliance in The Empire Strikes Back, but discounted it as \"too hokey.\" In continuing to develop the character in the prequel films, Lucas closed some avenues for expanding the character's story while opening others. Also, for a time, Lucas considered including Fett in the story of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Fett was meant to participate during the Great Jedi Purge as the killer of Mace Windu instead of Darth Sidious, via shooting him with his blaster while he was escaping from some stormtroopers, ending his vendetta against him due to the death of Jango once and for all. Eventually, Lucas decided to not add Fett to the story, saying that he would be \"too young\" (he would have been 16 years at that point) and that he was not necessary to be involved in Anakin's fall. The concept, however, was loosely reworked later in some episodes of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Ironically, George Lucas originally placed off-limits the possibility to use Fett in the show when writer Henry Gilroy was writing the show bible, but by the time of the next meeting, Lucas changed his mind and Fett was allowed to be used in the series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the cancellation of The Clone Wars TV series, Boba Fett was set to make an appearance during a four-episode arc starring him and Cad Bane. The two were going to team up for a \"rescue mission\" on Tatooine where Tusken Raiders had kidnapped a child. It would emphasize Boba's and Cad's relation to one another as Cad had known Jango. During this arc, Boba would don his green armor for the first time. In a clip revealed during the Animated Origins and Unexpected Fates panel at Celebration Orlando in 2017, Cad Bane and other Bounty Hunters had ended an insurrection by Fett.

Star Wars Helmet Collection 2 states that Fett always picked his targets according to his personal code of honor. In Age of Rebellion - Boba Fett 1, Stallo assumes Fett hunts \"bad men,\" criminals, and murderers. However, Fett denies this and reveals he simply hunts bounties, implying he has no moral code. Fett then points his blaster rifle at Stallo, intending to collect a bounty on him. Star Wars: The Galactic Explorer's Guide later stated that Fett had no code except for the conditions for bringing in a target and how many credits the bounty was worth.
