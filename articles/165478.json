Designed for deployment just at the edge of the atmosphere of planets with heavy space traffic, the XQ2 Platform helped alleviate take off and landing traffic jams by regulating the flow of ships into and out of a star system. Many Core Worlds had dozens of similar space platforms in low orbit, using them as cargo transit facilities and travel waypoints to keep traffic flowing smoothly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Space platforms such as the XQ2 had relatively small crews and very few permanent residents; most of the people aboard a platform were there only temporarily. Some interstellar passenger lines used XQ2 Platforms as staging areas for their journeys, allowing passengers to take shuttles up to the platform before boarding larger liners that could not enter a planet's atmosphere with ease. An XQ2 Platform was quite modular and could be adapted to suit passengers as well as large amounts of cargo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The XQ2 was released to great demand shortly after the Galactic Civil War started, less than five years after the release of the XQ1.
