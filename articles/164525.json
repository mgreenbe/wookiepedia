Founded in July 2000, the company's goal was to develop a format that made it easy to begin playing traditional miniature games by eliminating the need for cumbersome charts and source books.

Since Topps holds the Star Wars product license and WizKids/NECA holds the PocketModel trademark, it is unlikely that either company will be producing any further Star Wars PocketModel trading card games.
