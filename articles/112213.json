During the war he held the role of Warden of the Cloud City Security Tower, the Wing Guards' base of operations and detention center on Bespin. In 3 ABY, Imperial forces lead by the Sith Lord Darth Vader arrived on Cloud City, where they made a deal with the Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian that the city could remain free and neutral if it aided the Empire in capturing a group of Rebels who were headed for Bespin. The Rebels were successfully captured after arriving, but after Vader changed the deal he and the Baron Administrator had made, Calrissian changed his mind and turned against the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calrissian secretly contacted his Chief administrative aide Lobot, sending him the message \"Code Force Seven\", which signalled the aide to gather a group of a dozen Wing guardsmen including Tameron, Corman Jeihn, Pedar Solardo, Gir Endac, Bialar Selis, and Helder Spinoza. The guardsmen proceeded to ambush an Imperial unit led by Lieutenant Sheckil, who were traveling with Calrissian and transporting three of the captured Rebels to Vader's personal shuttle. The Imperials were taken captive by the Wing guard and escorted to the Security Tower, while the prisoners, Princess Leia Organa, Chewbacca, and C-3PO, were freed and left with Calrissian to escape. The Rebels and Calrissian managed to successfully escape Cloud City, which was left under Imperial control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Razell Tameron had dark skin and black hair.

A manga adaptation of Episode V was released in 1999 by Dark Horse Comics which included Tameron's scene in its fourth issue. The comic depicts eight of the twelve guards involved in the ambush, but it is not clear if Tameron is one of those shown. The character was later named and given some backstory in 2014 along with a number of other Wing Guards in the Rogues Gallery feature of Star Wars Insider 148. The article was written by Tim Veekhoven, Kevin Beentjes and Sander de Lange, who later said in a Facebook post that they had wanted to give some Wing guards specializations, including Tameron's role as warden. In the Facebook post they also stated that all of the Wing Guards in the article who had not previously been established as corrupt were not corrupt, and most were \"good guys\" who opposed the corruption."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
