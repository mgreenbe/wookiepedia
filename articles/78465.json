It was abandoned after the Clone Wars and by the time of the Galactic Civil War, it had become the home of a colony of Kubaza beetles. In 1.5 ABY, the assassin droid HK-47 tricked a group of spacers into setting up several amplification markers within the cavern so that he could transfer his artificial intelligence from the Hammerhead-class cruiser he was trapped in to the dormant Neimoidian droid factory on the planet, in an attempt to reactivate it and subjugate the \"meatbags\" on Mustafar. The droid's plans were eventually halted by these same spacers when they destroyed the droid's new frame after a fierce battle within a lava crater."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kubaza beetle cavern appeared in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
