Sifo-Dyas, who was sent without the knowledge of the Jedi Council, traveled with Valorum's aide Silman to resolve a dispute within the Pyke Syndicate, one that threatened to spark a crime war beneath the streets of Coruscant. However, before Sifo-Dyas could negotiate, the Jedi Council requested that he travel to Felucia to resolve a tribal dispute. As he and Silman were leaving, intending to return, the Pykes\u2014at the behest of the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus\u2014shot Sifo-Dyas' ship down, as the Sith wanted to hide Sifo-Dyas' involvement in the creation of the Grand Army of the Republic. The Jedi Master was killed but Silman survived as a prisoner of the Syndicate, where he remained until being discovered by the Jedi during the Clone Wars. Dooku subsequently posed as a Jedi and staged Sifo-Dyas' death on Felucia to conceal what had transpired."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
