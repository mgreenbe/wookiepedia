The purpose of the operation was to turn child conscripts\u2014thousands of whom were abducted from outlying systems\u2014into new stormtroopers for the First Order army. It also included data on the construction of over a hundred vessels within the Unknown Regions for the First Order Navy, including blueprints on the Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought. In an attempt to kill the spirit of rebellion, the Order also targeted the children of leaders from old conflicts, therefore making a leader's child into that leader's enemy. The daughter of Lando Calrissian, who had been a general in the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War, was taken. By 35 ABY, Calrissian still did not know what had happened to her and speculated that she may have been turned into a stormtrooper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rumors of Project Resurrection eventually reached the Resistance. One of their operatives, Shriv Suurgav, was sent to investigate. The operation was eventually uncovered in the Jinata system by Suurgav's old friend, Del Meeko. After killing Meeko, Gideon Hask was asked by Gleb\u2014the Aqualish protectorate of Vardos and a member of Jinata Security\u2014if the project would continue as planned. Hask stated that it would not be the case, as their operation may have been compromised. Gleb assured Hask that the Pillio operation would be relocated while her men tripled their efforts on Athulla. After Iden Versio's death aboard the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Retribution, Suurgav returned to the Resistance with Zay Versio, to inform General Leia Organa about the First Order's rearmament program."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
