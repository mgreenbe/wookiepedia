The ship deployed its interdiction field, trapping the flight. The Rebel fighters then destroyed eleven TIE/IN interceptors and turned their attention to the Interdictor. Gray Leader Leia Organa ordered her wingman to target their proton torpedoes on her transponder as she flew at the ship. She jettisoned the transponder next to the Interdictor, and the torpedoes impacted its gravity well projectors, disrupting them and allowing the Rebels to escape into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Interdictor and the Star Destroyer Devastator followed the Rebels to their rendezvous point, but the Rebels had prepared a trap: a fusion generator pulled from Organa's damaged X-wing was targeted by proton torpedoes.
