One of Zaarin's commanders, Namuura Din attempted to defect to the Rebel Alliance and warn them that their planned assault at Endor was a trap, and gave them a Missile Boat prototype called Sealion. But the defection was thwarted by Darth Vader and the prototype was recovered. Zaarin would then proceed to To-phalion Base to steal the Vorknkx Project testbed, which was guarded by loyalist Grand Admiral Thrawn. Zaarin was ultimately killed there, largely due to the efforts of TIE pilot ace Maarek Stele. After the campaign, Stele was awarded the Medal of Victory medal for saving the Emperor's life and ending the Zaarin insurrection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Campaign"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Surprise attack"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Capture the turncoat"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Track down rebels"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Missile Boat trouble"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Return to Vorknkx"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Corvette attack"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Zaarin takes the bait"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The trap is sprung"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stele's participation in the pursuit earned him the Medal of Victory, but prevented him from participating in the Battle of Endor.
