The Sith Lord's request was approved by Sidious, who speculated that Vader would perhaps be able to resurrect his deceased wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, by using the dark side energies there. Believing that it could prove useful for Vader's quest, the Sith Master also told his apprentice to take the ancient mask that once belonged to the Sith sculptor Darth Momin, who went against the Sith's legacy of destruction and instead preferred to create artworks that would evoke pain and fear in viewers.

Taking off the mask immediately when he came to himself, Vader found an alternate host for Momin by attacking a nearby Mustafarian patrol, capturing a Northern Mustafarian named Sssp, and forcing the captive to wear the mask."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Designs of Lord Momin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader and the possessed Mustafarian soon returned to the Sith cave, as Momin suggested that his design for the fortress would finally allow him to create the \"masterpiece\" that he had always wished to build, and that it would also be the key to unlocking the locus's dark power capable of resurrecting Vader's wife and breaking the boundary between life and death.

The cave was first mentioned in The Art of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, published on December 16, 2016, the same day as the film itself. It made its first appearance in the comic book Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 5, written by Charles Soule with art by Giuseppe Camuncoli, and released by Marvel Comics on September 6, 2017. The final story arc of the Star Wars: Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith comic-book series, Fortress Vader, further explored the creation of Vader's castle. The 2019 reference book Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition later identified the cave as a Sith shrine. Additionally, LEGO's Darth Vader's castle set features an ancient Sith shrine with a Sith holocron beneath the castle, as a reference to the Sith cave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Doug Chiang, co-production designer for Rogue One, the idea of a Sith cave beneath Darth Vader's castle originated from a piece of Ralph McQuarrie concept art of Emperor Palpatine's throne room created for the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. Chiang found the image of the throne on a lava lake inside a cave compelling and decided that the castle would be built on the foundation of an ancient structure. He intended to give the castle's final design an element of purpose, which was to draw energy from the lava lake much like a dam. Furthermore, Chiang thought that the castle could have a more ancient part below it, in the form of a natural cave where Vader went to meditate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the 2019 Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary's timeline establishes that Darth Vader took up residence in \"a newly constructed castle\" on Mustafar twelve years before the first Death Star was readied, \"Darth Vader,\" a 2020 entry in the Star Wars Encyclopedia series of reference booklets, states that the castle was built about five years before the completion of the Death Star.
