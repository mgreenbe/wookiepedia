He was somehow obtained by the Galactic Circus and toured with them on a number of worlds, including Tatooine. Sssiii had only limited intelligence, corresponding to that of a 10-year-old Human, and was unable to speak to its companions; Sssiii communicated instead by striking the ground with his tail. During circus performances, Sssiii provided entertainment by playing chess against the spectators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sssiii appears as a non-player character in the roleplaying adventure Le facteur X, published in Casus Belli.
