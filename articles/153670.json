Following the Battle in the Phindar system, Knotts sent the Koorivar captain and his ship as decoys to the Obroa-skai system to throw the Galactic Empire off Teller's scent.

As a Koorivar, he was stigmatized by the Galactic Empire because his species supported the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Koorivar captain had two Sy Myrthian crew including a navigator. Around 17 BBY,[source?] he and his crew acquired the YT-1000 freighter Reticent from a ship dealer on Lantillies using money loaned by the information broker Knotts, a former Republic Intelligence operative who had joined Berch Teller's rebel cell. The Koorivar captain and his crew worked as freelancers and itinerant merchants for Knotts for the next three years."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Teller's insurgency"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, the captain and his crew were caught up in Teller's insurgent campaign against the Empire. Seeking revenge against Moff Wilhuff Tarkin for his role in the Antar Atrocity, Teller and his followers had stolen Tarkin's corvette Carrion Spike and used it to attack Imperial installations throughout the galaxy. Following the ordeal above Phindar, the Koorivar Cala, a follower of Teller, discovered that the Empire was tracking them using a paralight tracker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teller had the Carrion Spike's hyperdrive computer transmit coordinates showing that the Carrion Spike was traveling to the Obroa-skai system. However, Teller arranged for Knotts to send a decoy ship. The information broker dispatched the Koorivar captain to travel from the Outer Rim world of Taris to the planet Thustra to pick up replacement parts for a fleet of Sephi flyers that were sold in bulk at the end of the Clone Wars to an Obroa-skai emergency medevac center. Unaware of Knott's connections to Teller's insurgents, the Koorivar captain accept the job. He and his crew's plan was to then travel to Taanab to buy foodstuffs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving in the Obroa-skai system, the Reticent and her crew were caught up in a massive hyperspace accident. Believing that the insurgents were traveling to Obroa-skai, Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader deployed three interdictor vessels. However, one of the interdictors, an Immobilizer 418 cruiser's gravity well projector malfunctioned, causing an accident that killed 1,100 aboard the luxury liner Stellar Vista.

The magnetic cuffs monitored his life signs. Darth Vader initially tortured the captain using the dark side of the Force but Tarkin told him to give the captain a chance to speak. The captain said that he was nothing more that a merchant who had traveled to Obroa-skai on business. Vader retorted that it was the business of conspiracy and sabotage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Koorivar responded that he was only to here to buy and sell and asserted that not all Koorivar were Separatists. When Tarkin probed his remark, the captain replied that the Empire demanded retribution for the war and that it lumped the innocent with the guilty. Tarkin then quizzed the captain on whether he believed the Separatists were wrong to secede from the Galactic Republic. The captain responded that he moved around to keep from having to decide who was right and wrong. Tarkin remarked that the captain was a being without a homeworld and that the Koorivar species was once without a planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the merchant insisted he was telling the truth, Vader countered that he was lying and demanded that he confess to swearing allegiance to the Separatist Alliance and that his current allies were the ones seeking retribution.

When questioned, the Koorivar confirmed that there had been no physical interaction with mnotts and that the supplies were available groundside on Thustra. The captain said that he tried to ignore Teller's propaganda holovids, leading Tarkin to remark that he was clueless. Vader then suggested torturing the Koorivar captain since he suspected that the captain was hiding something.

However, the Sy Myrthian navigator suffered heart failure from the harsh interrogation and torture.

While most of his species supported the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Koorivar captain was disinterested in politics and was more concerned with making a living as an itinerant merchant. He had no home and traveled the galaxy on his starship Reticent. The Koorivar captain was terrified when interrogated by Lord Vader and Tarkin but maintained his story that he was a simple itinerant merchant who had no interest in politics.
