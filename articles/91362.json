Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic of the Galactic Republic's Special Weapons Group personally organized a group of Republic Intelligence direct action operatives, ferried by the smuggler Has Obitt's ship Good Tidings, to infiltrate a laboratory complex controlled by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Their objective was to capture three Morseerian scientists to be used in an important prisoner exchange on Vallt, which would also have the effect of eliminating a biological warfare threat against the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic. The mission ran into unexpected resistance when spaceport customs agents opened fire, but the Republic operatives were able to withdraw with the captured scientists nonetheless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
