Illegal races were commonly held in Coruscant garbage pits. Racers would put on wings and try to fly to the bottom of the pit, grab a scale off giant worms that lived at the bottom of the pit, and fly back to the top of the pit and the other side without getting hit by the cannons. Anakin Skywalker participated in one of these races while being chased by a Blood Carver named Ke Daiv. Obi-Wan Kenobi then followed him into the races to help."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
