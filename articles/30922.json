It was an inner circle of senior Great Council members that the Prime Minister could call on to bypass the Senate on crucial issues such as internal security, finance and foreign policy. Despite its name the council was actually comprised of 35 members. Time in office was limited to two years, after which one had to take a two-year break before being able to return. The system was designed to avoid prolonged concentration of power while keeping the Council of Ten in experienced hands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
