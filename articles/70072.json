At the end of the Clone Wars, the 501st Legion of the Grand Army of the Republic, led by Darth Vader, stormed the Temple and executed its occupants, damaging the Temple in the process. The Temple's pyre was laid waste with the walls and floor pocked with blaster bolts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Temple would stand in silence for several more decades, slowly crumbling from disuse and lack of care. When Sith Lords Darth Sidious and Vader were slain in the Battle of Endor, the Galactic Empire lost balance and was eventually driven from Coruscant by the New Republic. During the Yuuzhan Vong War Coruscant was devastated by terraforming, causing the Temple to crumble and reveal parts of the foundation. When the Galactic Alliance reclaimed the world, Chief of State Cal Omas, ordered the Reconstruction Authority to rebuild the ancient edifice as a gift for the great sacrifices made by the reformed Order against the Yuuzhan Vong. While the structure was rebuilt using blueprints of the old building, it is unknown if the pyre room was reconstructed or replaced as the funeral of Mara Skywalker was held in the Morning Court."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pyre room of the Jedi Temple was built out of a tan stone common in the Temple's architecture. Located high within one of the Temple's five spires, the circular chamber was bare except for a central stone bed upon which wood could be laid. The Council member leading the ceremony would say a few words about the deceased and would then light a fire in the wood upon which the body was lain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
