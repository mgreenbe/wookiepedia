They were simian in physique, with heads that resembled goats. A traditional greeting among Gotiard males involved rubbing and slapping each other's chests. This practice was not expected to be replicated by outsiders, although in their interaction with the wider galaxy, some non-Gotiards imitated the practice in order to fit in with the beings. These attempts provided much amusement for the Gotiards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gotiards were created by Bill Olmesdahl for the Star Wars Gamemaster Screen, a 1992 West End Games product for the second edition of the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
