Although security was high during the contests, a number of combatants managed to escape the arena, taking advantage of a diversion created by sabotage. A group of the escapees subsequently committed terrible crimes, using their newly acquired battle armors. Eventually most of them were rounded up by the Galactic Empire, who destroyed most of their JX4 armors. The incident lead to Min-Dal canceling their JX4 armor program. Some, however, managed to evade the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the escaped criminals, Morana Fal, evaded the Empire and had no less than two of the rare armors in her possession - one was her own and the other one used to belong to a fallen fellow escapee.
