Other buildings housed immense libraries, where sorcerers and philosophers studied side-by-side. The peace came to an end when Bavmorda rose to power by tapping into the dark side of the Force. In her conquests, Bavmorda froze Tir Alseen in stasis, sealing it off from outsiders and forcing its inhabitants into a state of suspended animation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Willow Ufgood and Fin Raziel defeated Bavmorda, Tir Asleen was freed from its captivity, and its people were once again allowed to roam its streets.
