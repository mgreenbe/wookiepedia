Not long after the rise of the Galactic Empire, Six's hangar was visited by a renegade group of clone commandos and their companion, a young enhanced clone known as Omega. Recognizing the outlaws' wanted ship, Six contacted the bounty hunter Fennec Shand and informed her of the girl's location. Shand, however, was ultimately unsuccessful in capturing her bounty, and the Sullustan failed to prevent the clones from leaving Pantora. Six expected punishment from the bounty hunter, but to his surprise she instead paid him a modest amount of credits for his work and instructed him to contact her in the event the runaways resurfaced."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Raspar Six was portrayed by actor and comedian Taran Killam."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
