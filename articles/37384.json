Martinique Desler was one of the founders of the company, and developed the Explorer landspeeder that many later Desler models were derived from while working for Czerka Corporation. During the days of the Galactic Republic it produced vehicles for hostile backwater planets. But after the Yuuzhan Vong War it rose from relative obscurity by securing contracts to produce air vehicles to replace those lost during the terraforming of Coruscant. By the time Darth Krayt took over the control over the Empire, the company has risen significantly in both power and prominence, catering the wealthy elite on Core Worlds such as Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
