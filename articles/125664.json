They could also be used to replace the string-guard cables linking the repulsorlift generator to the engines of a cloud car, resulting in greater power, speed and acceleration. If fitting a larger power dispersion unit to a small vehicle such as a speeder bike, silver foils were used to create a bridge between the unit and the bike's engine. It helped the engine to adjust to the increase power flow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
