Remoh, though skeptical of the tale's veracity, followed, believing that even some hope was better than none. After a long journey, they found the storyteller, broken down and inactive, in a cave. After they reactivated him, the droid told them a tale of a hero who led the fight against a dark oppressor and brought hope to the galaxy. When Vindar discovered the cave, Otalp told Remoh to hide and was killed by the Vindar, who also shot C-3PO. In the droid's wreckage, Remoh found a lightsaber, and determined to use it to bring freedom to his people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The names of Otalp and his brother Remoh are ananyms of Plato and Homer respectively.
