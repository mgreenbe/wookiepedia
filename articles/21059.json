The most unpredictable and barbarous members of the Neimoidian Gunnery Battalion were enrolled in the program, often against their will, undergoing extreme genetic enhancements. The resulting Neimoidian brute guards were physically larger, more furious, and unstable combatants. Prone to berserker-like outbursts and incidents of violence towards other guards, they were often kept in stasis and only used in dire situations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
