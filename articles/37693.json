A tough, well-built weapon, the Devastator contained redundant systems that minimized damage and allowed it to continue to fight at 85% combat efficiency even after taking significant damage. Due to its sophistication, the Galactic Republic restricted its sale to only military units, making it a rare sight in the galaxy. Nonetheless, most models ended up in possession of mercenaries and criminals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
