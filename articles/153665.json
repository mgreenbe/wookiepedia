Flying a Banta Four starfighter in the Kessil system, he discovered and attacked Kane Starkiller and his sons Annikin Starkiller and Deak Starkiller on the Fourth Moon of Utapau. The Sith was able to surprise the Jedi and swiftly killed Deak. However, his melee skills were no match for Kane, a Jedi Master, who swiftly struck the knight down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character became the basis for numerous others in later drafts and the films. His appearance seems to be the origin of Darth Vader, though Vader appears as a distinct minor character in the draft. His ambush of Deak closely resembles the Tusken Raider who got a jump on Luke Skywalker in A New Hope. Aspects of the character also resemble Darth Maul on Tatooine in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
