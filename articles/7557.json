The mine's triggers ranged from low-tech pressure triggers that detonated the mine when stepped on, to sophisticated sensor triggers that could tell friend from foe and activate blaster bolts, gas emitters, or flame projectors. The most common land mines had laser triggers for explosive ordnance with anti-personnel shrapnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lightweight and easy to use, anti-personnel mines were deployed at choke points or placed to cover open fields to defend soft approaches to important structures. However, the mines were often indiscriminate and were known to harm civilian populations even after the end of conflict. The anti-personnel mines of the Confederacy of Independent Systems used during the Clone Wars against the Galactic Republic still caused deaths and dismemberments decades after the war reached its end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
