In 31 BBY, Tal-Soten was at the Academy when a group of terrorists attacked the Remembrance Hall. Master Qel-Bertuk issued an order to all Jedi, demanding they return to the Academy; however, Master Kirlocca and his charges do not respond from their location in the Almas Wasteland. Qel-Bertuk then assembled a team of Jedi, led by Tantron Dow, and including his Padawan Alkin Saad, Jedi Trevon Rey, Seeth'tal, and Tal-Soten to located and escort Kirlocca and his students back to the academy. While the team wandered through the wastelands, Tal-Soten received a vision of Master Kirlocca's betrayal of the Order, and all present became convinced of this inevitable occurrence. In fact, the Jedi had been affected by the strong surge in the dark side of the Force that was present in the wastelands, and they all had become deranged. Crashing their shuttle in the wastelands, the crazed rescue team continued on foot on their hunt for Kirlocca."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having lost contact with the academy, Qel-Bertuk sent out another search team to recover the first and Master Kirlocca. The second team discovered the downed shuttle being picked apart by Squib salvagers and stop to search it. Inside they discover Padawan Saad's body and the confused and frantic Duros Master Dow. After calming the crazed Jedi, he directs them down the path Jedi Tal-Soten and the others had gone in search of Kirlocca. Arriving at Kirlocca's abandoned campsite where Tal-Soten and his group had killed a Jedi and injured Padawan Hary'nkel, the Twi'lek girl reveals that Tal-Soten and his group had attacked them and the others had fled further into the wastes. Following the sounds of lightsaber combat, the second search party comes across Jedi Tal-Soten engaged in fighting Kirlocca and his surviving campers. The search party quickly help subdue Rey, Seeth'tal, and Sal-Toten, all of whom were taken back to the academy for evaluation and possibly return to the light side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
