After the meeting, he and Larin Moxla were called in by Major Cha where they were provided with arms and ammunition. Hetchkee approached Moxla just before the battle, noting that she was acting strange. She stated that nothing was wrong; in fact, she had just kissed Shigar Konshi, who had told her he did not share her feelings.
