Although those vaults were owned by a notorious gangster and heavily guarded, Solo and Chewbacca managed to break in, and they stole a hoard of spice stored there. As a result of their successful theft, the smugglers received double payment. Years later, Solo and Chewbacca were sent on a mission to the Forest Moon of Endor as members of the Rebel Alliance. They were part of a strike team tasked with breaking into an Imperial bunker, which Solo likened to his past heist on Gargon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
