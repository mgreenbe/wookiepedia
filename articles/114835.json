Ennix Devian, a personal hitman of the Emperor, concluded that in order for the Empire to restore itself it needed a group that truly believed in the ideals of the Human High Culture, so Devian founded the Kaarenth Dissension. The Kaarenth Dissension was dedicated to \"the sacred Restoration of the True Empire of Palpatine.\" His first move was to seize control of two incompleted Worldcraft but, too expensive to finish, Devian rerouted them to opposite ends of the galaxy: one to the Moddell sector and the other to Spawn Nebula. The Worldcraft on Moddell, which had been deliberately modified by Devian to be modeled after the infamous Death Star superweapons as part of a feint against the Alliance of Free Planets (the successor group of the Rebel Alliance), was destroyed by Rebel agents and Star Tours's passengers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kaarenth Dissension resurfaced following the Battle of Bilbringi and Operation Shadow Hand under the public control of the silver-tongued Meres Ulcane. The Dissension now was dedicated to incite the various alien races of the Outer Rim Territories against the New Republic. A fleet of warships and accompanying repair station was constructed in the Spawn Nebula. Meres Ulcane proved to be a motivational speaker, and managed to stir up a great deal of animosity towards the New Republic. The Dissension successfully launched a strike against a New Republic communications center on the gas giant Galaan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Meres Ulcane was eventually discovered on Betha II, and fled back to the Spawn Nebula. The New Republic tracked him, and engaged the Kaarenth Dissension in a battle that wiped out much of its fleet.

While Devian hired Fett to bring Kir Kanos to the Restored Empire headquarters, Nom Anor hired a team of thieves to attack the class-3 toxic weapons dump on Nyara in order to retrieve a chunk of zinethium. Devian wanted to use this destructive material to destroy the Imperial Palace on Coruscant and eliminate the Republic government. As expected, Kir Kanos refused to join the hard-liners who imprisoned him. Devian later let him escape and sacrificed some stormtroopers to convince Kanos he was really free. Kir Kanos immediately departed to Coruscant to warn the Republic but he was unaware that Devian had embedded the zinethium inside the shuttle, predicting Kanos would travel to the galactic capital. This time, it was Jedi Master Luke Skywalker who prevented the attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Devian later learned that Republic and Imperial diplomats, including Kanos, Mirith Sinn and Feena D'Asta, had planned to meet to discuss a truce between the two factions.
