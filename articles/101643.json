They also possessed small mouths filled with blunted teeth behind their noses and a pair of large, floppy ears, which were sensitive to sound and used to store fat. Ortolans fended off the cold of their icey and snowy habitat by eating their way to a blubbery body. Their articulated digits were able to absorb food and drink as well as play musical instruments.
