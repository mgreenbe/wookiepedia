At some point, he fell in battle, and Lady Corvax attempted to use the Bright Star to bring him back to life but instead turned Mustafar into a hellish wasteland, leaving her husband caught between the real world and what came after. Due to his situation, Lord Corvax had the ability to both suspend time and teleport. At some point during the Imperial Era, he helped Darth Vader in his quest to bring Padm\u00e9 Amidala back to life, though his true intentions were to retrieve the Bright Star from Vader and return it to the native Mustafarians, freeing himself from his curse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dorwin Corvax first appeared in the first chapter of Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series, a three-part virtual reality series created by ILMxLAB.
