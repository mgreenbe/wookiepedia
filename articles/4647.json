While the ship approached Geonosis through the planet's asteroid field to remain hidden for the planetary radars, it was discovered by Vulture droid starfighters. Fortunately, Siri Tachi and Adi Gallia were close to its position. The two Jedi starfighters and the transport ship were pushed to the limit trying to fend off squadrons of droid and Geonosian starfighters, as well as a fleet of Lupus-class missile frigates. Eventually, they succeeded, and the Aken was the first Republic assault ship to land on Geonosian soil."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
