In the year 2 ABY, Denlan served as the captain of the freighter Gamble during a mission to acquire supplies for use in the completion of the new Rebel base, Echo Base, on the planet Hoth. He piloted the starship, which had highly jury-rigged controls, alongside Lieutenant Esrai, under the command of Princess Leia Organa and Commander Vanden Willard, bringing the vessel to the uninhabited Eschaton system were the it was to receive the coordinates at which to meet their suppliers. After receiving the coordinates however, Esrai noted a approaching signal on the ships sensors. The signal was that of an Imperial Light corvette, which fired on the Gamble damaging it and causing the bridge's control console to explode. The explosion tore a hole in Denlan's chest and killed him, which Organa discovered when checking his body shortly after. Whilst on the mission Denlan and the rest of the crew made sure not to wear clothing that would identify them as Rebels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Denlan first appeared in Razor's Edge by Martha Wells, released in 2013 as the first book in the Star Wars: Empire and Rebellion series of novels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
