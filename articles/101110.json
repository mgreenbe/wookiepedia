Ord Ortag served as an Ordnance/Regional Depot outpost for the Galactic Republic during the Pius Dea Era, a period of time that lasted between approximately 12,000 BBY and 11,000 BBY, despite it being located outside the borders of Republic space. When the Republic launched the Thirty-Fourth Pius Dea Crusade against the Hutt species in 11,057 BBY, Republic forces moved from Ord Ortag to the Hollastin system, in the vicinity of Hutt Space. Eventually, Ord Ortag itself became incorporated into that region."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ord Ortag was introduced in the 2012 reference book The Essential Guide to Warfare, authored by Jason Fry and Paul R.
