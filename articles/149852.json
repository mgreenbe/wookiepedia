One day, he was enjoying a gaderffi sparring session outside his home with Sliven. Sliven's tribe caught sight of this however, and assumed that Sliven was under attack. Mistaking them for enemies, he and Cassa were killed by the tribe before Sliven could stop them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Out of pity and in return for the kindness shown to him by them, Sliven adopted a then-three-year-old Tahiri and raised her as a Tusken Raider until she turned nine in 22 ABY, when she was discovered to be Force-sensitive by Luke Skywalker and Tionne Solusar during a trip to Tatooine.
