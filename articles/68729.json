Born to Han and Leia Organa Solo, she inherited her father's mechanical aptitude and her mother's Force sensitivity, resulting in her eventual training at the Jedi Praxeum.

During the war, she also became romantically involved with fellow pilot Jagged Fel. However, the death of her brother Anakin caused Solo to walk dangerously close to the dark side. She was later redeemed with the aid of Kyp Durron. As the war waged on, Solo discovered a way for the reformed Galactic Alliance to use Yuuzhan Vong warships and biots to their advantage, and also personally slew Warmaster Tsavong Lah in the Battle of Ebaq. Solo fought in many of the war's battles, ultimately participating in its conclusion.

Solo would later be paired up with Jagged Fel and Zekk on a mission to hunt down the renegade Dark Jedi Alema Rar. The death of her aunt Mara Jade Skywalker and the dark deeds of her brother only encouraged her to find a way to stop Jacen, who had fallen to the dark side and she began seeking the means to do so through training with her father's ex-arch-enemy, Mandalore Boba Fett.

As such, when Chief of State Natasi Daala exiled her uncle, Luke Skywalker, from the New Jedi Order as the beginning of a bid to take control of the Jedi, Solo created a covert group, Darkmeld, as a means of secretly undermining Daala's efforts. Daala's increasing extremism prompted the Order to lead a coup to remove Daala from power. Following that, Solo joined her uncle in fighting against both an emerging Sith threat and a dark side entity known as Abeloth. When the Sith and Abeloth took control of the government on Coruscant, Solo joined her uncle and many of the other Jedi in an infiltration and surprise assault on the occupiers. Solo was confirmed as a Jedi Master by her uncle during this struggle.

C-3PO accepted the job with an initial enthusiasm, but found himself overwhelmed on a number of occasions, including one incident in which the twins caused him to become entangled within a tentacle-cactus during a diplomatic ceremony in the Skydome Botanical Gardens.

When a group of Sith battle hydras were sent by Kun to attack Luke's body, the Jedi's spirit warned the twins again.

Finally, at the age of nine, Han felt that Solo was responsible enough to help him with simple repairs and also allowed her to fly the Millennium Falcon.

Thanas told her about the group of nonviolent isolationist activists she was involved with, who had stirred up dissent towards the New Republic.

She sensed that one of the Force-sensitive Mandalorians, Gotab, had skill in the healing arts, and recruited him to apply Force-induced therapy on Vel. Solo took part in the two-hour process, lending her considerable Force strength to Gotab, and Vel began making a much more complete recovery.

Solo tried her best to assuage her fears and encouraged her to enjoy the day. While Beviin, Gev, and some of the other Mandalorians no longer saw her as a menace and a complete outsider, Fett himself remained as hard-edged and ruthless as always, and Solo overheard a conversation between him and Natasi Daala on Bloodfin about their mutual desire to be rid of both Jedi and Sith. Fett's trainings did develop a capability for total war in Solo, and she learned to not show compassion nor weakness in front of him or Beviin, who in particular advised her that a confrontation between her and Caedus needed to happen as she was the only one willing to handle the necessary job of killing him, though Solo preferred to capture him. Also, through discussion with former Jedi-turned-Mandalorian Gotab, Solo also came to the realization that because Caedus had lost everything that mattered in his life, he was now driven by the only things he had left to hold on to, his anger and hate.

In the early stages, she was criticized by Jagged Fel for not being \"grim\" or mature enough to handle war, which rankled with her. However, losing friends and family during the war hardened her, and in her grief and anger following the loss of her brother, she was nearly consumed by her emotions as she sought revenge on the Yuuzhan Vong by any means. Although she was redeemed from fully falling to the dark side, she continued to fight against the invaders vehemently, to the extent that her uncle named her the \"Sword of the Jedi\" in her knighting ceremony. Her lightsaber technique was described by her brother as cool and measured, never wasting any unnecessary effort. Solo was known for taking bold actions, often going farther in her prosecution of the war than the \"official\" Jedi position, and sometimes strayed from more orthodox Jedi doctrines, though not as far as Kyp Durron. Throughout the war, she was known for being a hard worker dedicated to the cause, and for pushing those around her to excel as well. Leia admitted Solo inherited her own work ethic. Inside, the losses of comrades affected her, and she confided that she expected to die in the war. Her armored exterior and purposeful distancing from others around her served to disguise the numerous emotional hurts, grief, and scars she bore."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jaina Solo's personality was further changed by the Joining process she experienced in the Dark Nest Crisis and subsequent Swarm War.

At one point, she pushed herself to the point where Jagged Fel thought she was overdoing her preparations, wearing herself out. Still, Solo saw herself as the Sword of the Jedi, a lone warrior and the avatar of the Jedi Order, which caused her to maintain an intense workload and keep herself from too many close relationships. By the latter stages of the Second Galactic Civil War, Solo was determined to set herself against her brother, who now styled himself Darth Caedus. Though she was reluctant to admit it, she eventually came to realize that the Jacen she had known was dead.

She knew that the only way she could defeat Caedus properly was for her mission to be a sanctioned one against a threat to the galaxy, not out of personal vengeance. Solo ultimately confronted and slew the Sith Lord her brother had become, but she still felt his loss keenly. Having to kill Jacen not only resulted in substantial physical injury for Solo, but also emotional and psychological trauma from slaying her twin. In the days that followed, she looked to her surviving family and friends for comfort, though several of her comrades had been injured or killed during the war. Solo was willing to sacrifice herself for the sake of stopping the dark side entity Abeloth.

In one diversion, she added a new humor routine to her R9, Rowdy, though she later decided that it left much to be desired, considering it reminiscent of Jacen's \"lame\" childhood jokes.

Though Solo was known for speaking her mind, she could also endure difficulty without grumbling, particularly when the greater good of her actions was explained.

As they continued to see each other, the two developed a mutual attraction, though neither would admit their true feelings. Despite their close bond with one another, Zekk couldn't stop her from her dark side leanings after the Mission to Myrkr, where Solo lost both her brothers.
