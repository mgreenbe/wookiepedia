During his stay on Tansarii he at some point flew out to Station Gamma to explore with his protocol droid E-5KL. While exploring he ran into a member of the Rak'qua, the pair fought and Frelka lost causing him to flee the station back to Tansarii, in his haste leaving behind E-5KL. Once back on Tansarii he headed to the cantina to sulk over his defeat, here he met a spacer who Frelka asked to head back to Station Gamma and find his droid for him. The Spacer then traveled to Station Gamma where E-5KL told them of Frelka's defeat and asked that they kill the Nautolan who humiliated Frelka. The spacer did so and returned to Frelka to inform him of his foe's death and the safety of his droid. Frelka begrudgingly thanked the spacer despite wanting to have kept his defeat a secret."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Frelka was unfriendly and rude after his defeat at the hands of the Rak'qua however this may not of reflected his normal personality, he was also extremely ungrateful to his droid, who he claimed he might scrap, showing he thought of it as a possession not a sentient being. Frelka was presumably also rather inexperienced in combat as the Rak'qua who defeated him was easily slain by an almost untrained spacer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Frelka was a NPC in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
