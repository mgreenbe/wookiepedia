The station once supplied the Galactic Empire, but eventually instead aided the fledgling New Republic after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. Around 5 ABY, the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing attacked Parozha VII to steal supplies. Squadrons Two, Three and Four from the fighter wing swarmed the outpost and destroyed the docked starships. The squadrons then blasted open cargo bays, suffocating the inhabitants and allowing cargo to be ejected for the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Edict to retrieve through the destroyer's tractor beam."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Parozha VII was mentioned in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
