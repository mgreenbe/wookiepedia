The region existed as an astrographical and political center for the reconstituted Sith Empire in the centuries following the Great Hyperspace War, and encompassed a number of other smaller sectors within its borders. It was located in the northeastern corner of the galaxy and bordered Hutt Space along its southeastern boundary. Some of the sectors included within the region were the Esstran sector and the Ojoster sector. The area was native to the Rakghoul mutants of Taris, the original Sith species found on Korriban, and the hybridized descendants of those Sith. Immigrated species included Humans, Chiss, and Epicanthix, as well as a myriad of other sentients that were brought in by the Sith's slave trade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Seat of The Empire grew from the expansionary efforts of the Empire during its post-Hyperspace War reconstruction process, but drastically increased in size and prominence after 3681 BBY, when the Empire revealed itself to the larger galaxy and began a campaign of domination launched from the region. After this Great Galactic War, the Sith-controlled Seat of the Empire was recognized as one of five major sectors of activity in the Cold War between the Empire and the Galactic Republic, as it hosted the Sith holy world of Korriban, their capital world Dromund Kaas, and the symbolically-important planet Taris."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
