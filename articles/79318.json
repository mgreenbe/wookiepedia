Later, having nearly killed himself five times with the weapon, Binks used it to strike down the B1-series battle droids that were about to execute an embattled Clone Captain Rex, saving him. As the lightsaber then slipped from Binks's hands, Rex chastised the representative and confiscated the weapon to prevent him from causing injury. The two then fought their way to a Separatist shield generator, with the captain refusing Binks's request to have the lightsaber back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Laan Tik's lightsaber appeared in the comic story \"501 Plus One,\" published by Marvel Comics in Age of Republic Special 1 on January 16, 2019.
