The tree was a conifer that towered more than 200 meters above the planet's surface and sported as many as 1,000 limbs. This created foliage so dense that waza forests blotted out all sunlight from the ground beneath them. This prevented other vegetation from growing, creating an environment of fungus growth instead. At higher elevations, entire ecosystems existed within the branches of the waza trees. The Ri'Dar species evolved in these mid-level elevations and inhabited warrens within the waza trees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
