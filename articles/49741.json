Through a few conflicts, she had been in command onboard of Darth Marr's flagship. In 3636 BBY, their ship launched a joint fleet operation of the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic with the aim of tracking down and destroying the former Sith Emperor Vitiate. When the joint combat fleet went to Wild Space for this purpose, they were attacked by a fleet of the Eternal Empire, which had previously attacked planets that were aligned with Republic and Empire. During the battle, Fora commanded a number of allied Republic-Imperial troops until they were stormed by Skytroopers that entered the ship, and Fora was killed in the attack shortly before Darth Marr's flagship was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
