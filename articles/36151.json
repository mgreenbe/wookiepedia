Using it, a skilled operator would be able to detect emissions from lasers, beacons and comlink transmissions. A DER concentrated its scanning in a narrow, focused beam and is intended to gather detailed, specific information on a previously detected target. Because of its narrow focus, a DER was of little use in early threat detection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "DERs were commonly found in the sensor suites of most military starships, including Rebel Alliance starfighters and Imperial Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dr. Lucien wished to install them in infiltration droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial Torpedo Spheres utilized thousands of DER devices to find and target weak spots in a planetary shield, by tracking down anomalies and fluctuations in the shields."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
