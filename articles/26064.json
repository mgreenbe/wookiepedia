The statue had been buried during an earthquake years earlier, causing the winged Stenaxes to stop flying in disgrace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rik, Dani and Chihdo began digging for the statue in an old temple that had served as a Rebel Alliance base commanded by Colonel Kindar.

For unknown reasons, Chihdo was captured by a team of bounty hunters, including Bossk and IG-88C, who were allied with Barpotomous Drebble.

Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker and Lando Calrissian tracked Bossk and IG-88 to Stenos, believing the hunters could lead them to their missing friend Han Solo, who was also frozen in carbonite.

The trio was soon interrupted by the arrival of Luke Skywalker, who had come to offer the Iskalonians a place in the newly forming government. Luke scolded them, before they were all attacked by a hungry chiaki sea creature. A sudden attack by the Iskalonians followed. The natives no longer wanted anything to do with offworlders and the three thieves acceded to Skywalker's suggestion they all leave. Only an Iskalonian named Kiro\u2014an old friend of Luke's\u2014decided to go with them. Skywalker recruited Duel and the others to give Kiro passage in their ship, the Moonshadow.
