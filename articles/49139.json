The commanding officer would usually utilize one of the heavy capital ships within the fleet, such as a Star Destroyer, as their flagship. The Galactic Republic maintained a fleet that was attached to each of its Sector Armies, totaling twenty. One of these twenty fleets was the 2nd Fleet. The Confederacy of Independent Systems possessed fleets in its navy when it fought the Republic, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic managed a fleet with which it fought against the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Imperial Navy, a fleet could be commanded by an admiral, a Fleet Admiral, or a Grand Admiral. Some Imperial fleets were mobile and travelled from conflict to conflict, such as the Third Fleet, the Seventh Fleet, and Death Squadron. On the other hand, sector fleets were set to a specific sector of the galaxy, such as the Lothal sector fleet and the Anoat sector fleet. Task forces, such as the Ninety-Sixth Task Force, were units of ships smaller than fleets that were under the command of an admiral or commodore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
