The frame of the PKN-49 slimmed down to a single wheel appendage; its ambulation resembled that of a Hutt. It could be equipped with worker arms for carrying, harvesting, drilling, or if necessary, combat. For carrying large loads, it was modified with a \"frill\" set around its neck and shoulders. The droid language of the PKN-49 had a musical, flute-like quality."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
