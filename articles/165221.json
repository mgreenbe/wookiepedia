The operation was an experiment by Commander Rezi Soresh to create the perfect assassin who would then go on to serve the Galactic Empire. Soresh wiped the participants' identities from a computer database system and had their faces surgically altered. Soresh put them through a brutal reconditioning program, which was designed to turn them into mindless servants by removing their past memories and emotions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, X-3 became friends with X-1, X-2, X-4, X-5, X-6, and X-7, the other participants in the training program. However, after Soresh started torturing them with electrocution, X-3, like everyone else, had his personality and mind changed completely until he felt no emotions. More than ten years prior to the Battle of Yavin, the would-be assassins were pitted against each other until only one remained. Despite X-3 being Soresh's personal favorite to win, X-7 killed X-3 with a vibroblade and earned the right to become Soresh's personal assassin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "X-3's only appearance in Star Wars canon is in a flashback in Rebel Force: Target, the first book of the young readers series Star Wars: Rebel Force, published on December 2, 2008 and written by Alex Wheeler."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
