An eel, possibly the same one that ate Cutup, was shot and killed instantly by Captain Rex, after receiving an expertly aimed shot through its eye and into its brain. He then marked the \"shiny\" armor of Echo with the animal's blue blood. Since Rishi eel blood was almost impossible to remove, the marking became permanently emblazoned on the rookie's armor.[source?] Later on during the Clone Wars, ARC Trooper Fives had a Rishi eel design on the top of his helmet as a tribute to Cutup."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
