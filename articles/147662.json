Seeking to reclaim the honor of his clan, Torian teamed up with the Grand Champion of the Great Hunt to hunt his father on Taris, joining with the Hunter's crew after the deed was done. Torian traveled with the Hunter for years, being briefly kidnapped by GenoHaradan on Hoth. After the Champion disappeared early in the Eternal Empire conquest, Torian answered the call of the new Mandalore the Avenger and eventually became the chieftain of Clan Cadera as its numbers dwindled. Joining other Mandalorians under the wing of the new Mandalore, Torian assisted the Commander of the Alliance opposing Zakuul in a raid on the Darvannis factory, formally joining the Alliance as Shae Vizla's representative afterwards. As part of the war against Zakuul Torian led a team of Mandalorian Commandos during the Invasion of Voss, helping to liberate the city of Voss-Ka. While reclaiming the Gravestone from the Eternal Empress Vaylin, Torian and other Alliance personnel were trapped by ARIES on the artificial world of Iokath and worked together to escape before the world was covered by a radiation pulse. When Vaylin launched an assault on Odessen where the Alliance base was located, Torian led a group of Mandalorian Commandos to assist Bey'wan Aygo, until their position was overrun, with Torian as the last one left standing. The Alliance Commander was forced to choose between rescuing either Torian or the Twi'lek escape artist Vette, with the second choice being captured and later killed by Vaylin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The honor of Clan Cadera"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Torian was born on the Mandalorian stronghold world of Geonosis to Jicoln Cadera, leader of the Crusader's schism and an opponent of Mandalore the Vindicated. All his life, Torian dedicated himself to overcome the stigma of being the son of a traitor, but the shadow of his father always seemed to weigh on him in the eyes of the other Mandalorians. As a consequence of the constant reminder of his clan's shame among his peers, Torian adhered to the Mandalorian codes of honor and traditions with more devotion than many warriors twice his age. He always strove to prove his loyalty to Mandalore. During the Cold War, Torian fought and traveled with his people, fighting with Clan Ordo on Eriadu to destroy a weapon's factory, being forced to face snipers and mines on the way. Things become trouble once they discovered resistance fighters hiding among the workers.

At the same time, the latest Grand Champion of the Great Hunt was dispatched by Mandalore the Vindicated to slay the Sithspawn and succeeded in his task. Torian later found out that his traitorous father was in hiding on the planet Taris and, motivated to cleansing his clan of his father's dishonor, traveled to Taris where under the command of Vorten Fett he went on to search for and kill his father. While on his mission, Torian again ran into the Champion, who was also searching for Jicoln to claim his bounty on the Blacklist.

Before they could come to blows, Gault arguing that he's been dodging poetic justice since before Torian was born, they received a summons from the Sith Lord Darth Tormen. Tormen offered the Champion to work for him, promising revenge against the Jedi Battlemaster Jun Seros and Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus for targeting them in return. While the Champion was chasing Zale Barrows on Belsavis, Torian was captured by the secretive assassination guild the GenoHaradan, being lured into a trap after receiving a meeting request from a friend.

When Breyer Chorn reported that he and his men were being overrun by Skytroopers, Torian stated that there was no honor and being killed by machines and attempted to target Chorn's location for an artillery strikes, killing the warriors along the droids, before being stopped by the Alliance Commander. The next day, Torian again joined the Commander in neutralizing the enemy forces at the Zakuulan listening post in preparation for the main assault.

Inside the factory, Torian revealed that he overheard the previous conversation between the Commander and Beniko and insisted that the Mandalorians were not animals, but warriors with a sense of honor. The Commander was successful in retrieving the PRIME and in the aftermath of the battle Torian requested the Mandalore to join the Alliance as her representative, which Shae Vizla granted.

The ship emerged from hyperspace in Iokath system, where Torian was the first to notice the entire Eternal Fleet around them. Vaylin and her remaining forces were found to be sabotaging the ship, with half the Alliance personnel spreading to stop the sabotage, while Torian remained with the other half to defend the ship's bridge.

The Commander and Vette went ahead, while the rest eventually followed, meeting them at a disabled colossus droid. There, Theron realized that even though he was unable to locate the Gravestone, he could still use his implant to remotely pilot the Alliance shuttle that was left in its hangar. However, before they could leave on the shuttle, SCORPIO contacted the group and revealed that ARIES, the droid that controlled Iokath, raised an energy shield that would destroy any vessel attempting to leave. With ARIES re-charging the weapon that incapacitated them to begin with and promising to use it again on a lethal setting, the only way out was to stop ARIES. SCORPIO revealed that ARIES base was located in the southern hemisphere and Theron dropped off the Commander and Vette there to deal with ARIES, while the rest went to reclaim the Gravestone based on the shuttle's last known location.
