Battle-scarred and weathered, Shazeen fended off all challengers for years, losing his left eye in one scrape, before tiring of being Top Bull and retiring north to warmer waters. His title passed to his wild and hotheaded nephew Kasarax, who started a lucrative racket charging exorbitant fees to land-dwellers for passage across their lake. Kasarax's improprieties disgusted Shazeen, prompting his return around 1 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to challenge his nephew's dominance, Shazeen agreed to transport an offworld group led by Corellian smuggler Han Solo, leading to a heated right-of-way dispute between Shazeen and his supporters and Kasarax's gang. The disagreement culminated in a one-on-one fight between uncle and nephew, which the more experienced Shazeen won by outwitting and outsmarting his younger foe. The defeat led to the downfall of Kasarax's racket and the dissolution of his large shore gang."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kasarax first appeared in Han Solo and the Lost Legacy, a novel written by Brian Daley and released in 1980."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
