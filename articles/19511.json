After the Battle of Yavin, the Trandoshan had become Borvo's personal guard. He was based in the Moenia Cantina which acted as the Hutt's base of operations for his business ventures on the planet Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, Dagorel, one of Borvo's thugs, was shot in an ambush during a mission in the Paitnnu Wetlands and severely injured. The guard quickly hired a spacer to find him, give him a medpac and escort him back to the Moenia. Borvo's guard later found out that Dagorell was set up by Niksel Frangee, a undercover officer in the Corellian Security Force and hired the spacer again to murder Frangee. The spacer took Frangee's detective badge and Borvo's guard ordered the spacer to go on Corellia to pass himself off as Frangee. During his six years in infiltration, all of Frangee's direct superiors had retired and been replaced. Thus, nobody in the CorSec knew how Frangee looked like at the moment of his death. The spacer met one of the CorSec senior officers, Captain Thale Dustrunner, in the Coronet Capitol. Dustrunner fell for the ruse and took the spacer for the long lost agent. He ordered him to protect Aldalad, a witness who wanted to testify against Borvo, and Maerzen, who had discovered evidence against Borvo the Hutt. The spacer killed both of them and returned to Borvo's guard, leaving the CorSec  without any evidence against the Hutt crime lord."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Borvo's guard appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
