The breaching grenade came as a mountable attachment to easily turn any standard blaster rifle, such as the DC-17, into a grenade launcher. Clone commando RC-1136 used a Merr-Sonn breaching grenade to allow Omega and Delta squads to enter a civilian home in Hadde to locate rebels responsible for launching a missile at the Republic base from within the city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
