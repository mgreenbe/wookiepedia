They promised the natives freedom when the Separatist invaders were repelled from Mimban. The Mimbanese were eager to help, and accepted modern weapons and training from the Mud Jumpers. The Mud Jumpers and the Mimbanese fought to drive the Separatist invaders from Mimban and succeeded. The 501st Legion also participated in the battle and at one point, Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" and Jedi General Laan Tik fought alongside the Mud Jumpers. During that engagement, Captain Rex ordered the Mud Jumpers to reinforce General Tik, but Tik was eventually killed and Republic forces were forced to retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While fighting, they received a shout-out from the host of the holographic Grand Army of the Republic music broadcast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mud Jumpers were first mentioned in \"Rookies,\" a 2008 episode of the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' first season, before making their first appearance in \"501 Plus One,\" a comic released in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
