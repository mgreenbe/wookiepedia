He began to give up hope and told El-Les that they would never become competent soldiers. When Domino Squad attempted to conquer the Citadel Challenge, Bric was highly critical of their inability to function as a unit and later had to break up a fight between troopers CT-782 and CT-1409 in the barracks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next day Bric and El-Les rallied Domino Squad and other cadet units on a hangar deck to take a lesson from the ARC Troopers of Rancor Battalion. Commander Colt addressed the troopers and watched the next attempt at the Citadel Challenge. Bric praised the first group, Bravo Squad, and told Colt that Domino Squad was inept. They watched as the group failed the test again, much to Bric's amusement. That night, he chewed out clone trooper CT-4040, saying that he was \"a real cutup\" and blamed him for his squad's struggles. Much to his dismay, CT-4040 took the nickname \"Cutup\" and drew inspiration from the criticism."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jedi Master Shaak Ti came to personally oversee Domino Squad's progress and next attempt at the Citadel Challenge, Bric decided to set back Domino Squad further by removing their ascension cables so they could not climb the citadel at the end of the challenge.

Nevertheless, the Siniteen was also impressed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
