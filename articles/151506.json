Outside the club were elaborate holovid screens that gave the false impression that it was an upscale establishment. The club, which was run by Omacala, was a popular haunt of death stick dealers and addicts, and during the early years of the Galactic Empire, various thugs loyal to the Human death stick dealer Speng operated opening within the club. The Kadas'sa'Nikto bounty hunter Kaa'to Leeachos was a patron of the club and after Leeachos earned the ire of the Pyke Syndicate and went into hiding, a group of Pyke-affiliated agents ventured to the Umbra Club in search of information on the Nikto's activities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
