The SU-42RS was a militarized version of the SoroSuub Corporation's SU-40 airspeeder and was built for high-altitude reconnaissance. During the Galactic Civil War SoroSuub engineers sympathetic to the Rebel Alliance, would produce the SU-42RS in small numbers and distribute them to rebel cells through the black market."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SU-42RS Flashbind Aerial Reconnaissance Airspeeder was a short wing-shaped airspeeder equipped with forward-mounted autoblasters and a IN-780 ion turbofan engine. The IN-780 engine in the SU-42RS was tuned to allow for maximum speed and lifting thrust. Although it reduced the Flashbind's overall agility, it allowed the airspeeder to climb altitude quickly and outrun any enemy starfighters or missiles. The airspeeder retained the two-position cockpit used by the SU-40 airspeeder but was slightly largered and protected by anti-splinter armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SU-42RS airspeeder was utilized by the Open Circle Fleet which served in the navy of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, SoroSuub Corporation engineers who sympathized with the Rebel Alliance secretly distributed the airspeeders to the Alliance through channels on the black market."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SU-42RS Flashbind Aerial Reconnaissance Airspeeder was mentioned in Lead by Example, a 2016 sourcebook for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
