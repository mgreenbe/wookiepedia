During the attack on Haidoral Prime in 3 ABY, they fought stormtroopers around the streets of Haidoral Administrative Center One and later infiltrated the Governor's mansion, where they killed the military officers and extracted the defecting governor, Everi Chalis. Shortly after they fought in the Coyerti campaign, where they first assisted Zab's squad in an attack on an Imperial camp. They then hunted down an AT ST and submerged it in a swamp. After, they destroyed a distillery by setting charges on the bio-toxin barrels. However the bio-toxins infected them and they had to be picked up by a dropship before they were killed by the chemicals. During a raid on an Imperial heavy freighter, Namir's squad kept the route back to their boarding pod clear while Namir and Chalis went to assist Sergeant Fektrin's squad. The two also helped Sergeant Maximian Ajax's squad to break free from Imperial forces, although Ajax did not make it out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hazram Namir's squad first appeared in the novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
