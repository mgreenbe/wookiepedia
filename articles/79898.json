Considered to be generally lackluster, he discovered his true calling of \"personality reconstruction\" while interring at a COMPNOR hospital's psych ward. With this newfound talent, Kraay's grades improved, and he graduated in the top quarter of his class. Joining the ISB's Re-Education branch, he quickly moved up through the ranks."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Running the Q'Maere Research Facility"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the collapse of the Galactic Empire and the fracturing of COMPNOR, Kraay was handpicked by Moff Kentor Sarne to head the penal colony on Q'Maere. Kraay accepted the challenge eagerly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kraay's tenure as the facility's director was indifferent; he preferred to leave the actual administration of the facility to the various department heads while he concentrated on \"curing\" the facility's dangerous patients.

Seeing a way to get off the planet, Kraay took the ship's landing party hostage.

He also decreed that for every hour past the deadline that the crew delayed, a randomly selected hostage would be killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Kraay was not a military man, and could not stop the FarStar hostage joining forces with the prison population to stage a jailbreak and take control of the facility. When the landing party stormed the operations center of the facility, he attempted to erase the formula of the antidote to the bacteria mutation, known as Variant Alpha, from the computer files and destroy the last sample. The FarStar crew managed to overpower him and take control of the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kraay was an eager and enthusiastic scientist, who strove to overcome challenges.
