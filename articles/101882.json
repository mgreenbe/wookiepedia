Instead of establishing branches on different worlds, the corporation moved its operations from planet to planet, primarily via the massive refinery ship known as The Oteroan Sky. On each planet, OteroaCorp also established a number of cities that would support orbital operations, and then began to strip the surface of the planet of anything useful. Unfortunately, the company neglected to care for The Oteroan Sky, and it eventually crashed into Dathomir during mining operations. The crash was so deadly and expensive that the company soon folded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
