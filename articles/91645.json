In Grappa's retinue, Sinn discovered the captive Imperial Interim Ruling Council member Feena D'Asta on Smarck, uncovering a Hutt-Black Sun conspiracy to replace her with a clone. Before she could report her discovery, however, Sinn was betrayed by her former subordinate, Lieutenant Massimo, who revealed her ruse to Grappa, only to be betrayed himself when he, along with Sinn, was turned over to the Zanibar to fulfill the debt the Hutt owed them of subjects to be used in their sacrificial rituals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unbeknownst to Sinn or Grappa, Kanos had himself infiltrated the Hutt's organization as the bounty hunter \"Kenix Kil\", with the assistance of Tav Kennede. Upon learning of Sinn's capture, Kanos followed the Zanibar transport to Xo in Sinn's A-wing interceptor, hoping to repay the debt he felt he owed her for the death of Sadeet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Landing the A-wing some distance away, Kanos continued on foot to the Zanibar village, which he found mostly deserted, most of the villagers having already gathered for the ritual. Taking the robe of a Zanibar sentry, Kanos found the ceremony already in process, with Massimo strung up as the first victim. Locating and freeing Sinn, Kanos fled with her to the concealed interceptor, pursued by the Zanibar who had discovered Sinn's absence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Sinn piloting the one-man A-wing, Kanos was forced to cling to the hull, preventing the ship from leaving the planet's atmosphere, and a pursuing Zanibar transport shot down the interceptor, injuring Sinn and stranding the pair in the jungles of Xo. Heading to an elevated extraction point to make contact with Kennede, Sinn was attacked by a carnivorous plant, only to be rescued by Kanos, remarking that it was the second time he'd done so that day, leading the two to argue over their debt to each other and Sinn's vow to kill Kanos. Setting aside their differences to put down an attacking local creature, Kanos suggested that they call it even."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Overloading the power regulator of his blaster rifle to provide heat through the night, Sinn remarked that Kanos' resourcefulness reminded her of her late husband, Jahren Sinn, a farmer and local leader on Nez Peron who was killed for rebelling against the Empire to keep his people from starvation. As Kanos attempted to justify the actions of the Empire he served, Sinn showed him a hologram of Darth Vader violently striking down her husband, asking Kanos to reconsider his dedication to his Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following morning, the pair arrived at the extraction point, a pre-Republic fortress of human design, only to be set upon by their Zanibar pursuers. Outnumbered and outgunned, Kanos and Sinn were saved by the arrival of Tav Kennede, flying a tandem X-wing starfighter, scattering the Zanibar forces for long enough for Sinn to board the craft. However, Kanos was overtaken by his attackers, and ordered Kennede to leave with Sinn, while he remained on Xo in the clutches of the Zanibar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sinn's time with Kanos on Xo abated her hatred of him due to Sadeet's murder, and her recognition of the similarites between Kanos and her late husband further fueled her attraction to him. As a temporary member of the New Republic, Kennede explained Kanos' motivations to Sinn, and flew with the Commander once again in the Battle of Smarck, as well as the subsequent rescue of Kanos and as an escort for Feena D'Asta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zanibar turned the captive Kanos over to Grappa the Hutt, soliciting his services as a go-between to redeem the sizeable imperial bounty on the former Guardsman's head. The loss of Kanos to Sinn's New Republic strike force, and Grappa's resulting failure to procure the Zanibar's bounty, led directly to the Hutt's eventual downfall and death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
