Teebo claimed that this fish might be the cousin of his other fish friend. When the Ewoks were preparing to leave the Coral Castle, Teebo summoned his small fish friend so that he would create them a bubble to get back to the surface. However, his summons brought \"Tiny\", a much larger fish. Although Teebo was surprised to see this other fish, he surmised that the two must have been related, and he allowed \"Tiny\" to create them a bubble so that they could return to the surface. After helping the Ewoks, \"Tiny\" departed as quickly as he had arrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
