The player can make their character jump, use Force Push, and use a variety of attacks with a lightsaber. A player's character is given three lives and a meter in the upper-left corner to display remaining health. Health is lost from enemy attacks or deadly obstacles. It can be restored at certain locations in the game. Players collect crystals placed throughout the game for points. Yellow crystals are worth two points each and red crystals are worth five. Blue crystals are awarded when enemies are defeated. At the end of a level, the player is given a final score determined by how many lives they have left, how many crystals were gathered, and how fast the level was completed. Platinum 2x2 bricks, similar to the red bricks in the LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy and LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga videogames, can be collected in some levels. They can be used to upgrade the player's stamina and abilities, such as their health,\njumping ability, and the amount of damage that their lightsaber(s) deal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Synopsis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The training level for the game starts with Anakin Skywalker onboard an enemy starship.
