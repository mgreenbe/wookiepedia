The shop was run by a Twi'lek named Sonou and had a staff consisting of other Twi'leks as well as droids, all of whom Sonou ordered around relentlessly. Sonou's Apparel stocked a complete range of clothes, designed to be starship-ready and available in designs to fit a number of common species. The clothes, which included jumpsuits, spacesuits, formal wear and environment specific garments, was all sold at about two thirds of the common market value due to the fact it was a lower quality than standard clothing. Most apparel bought at the store would last half the amount of time that clothing from elsewhere would, a fact Sonou freely told those who asked. The Twi'lek, who made a good living from the store, was always civil to customers despite how she behaved toward her staff."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sonou's Apparel first appeared in 2013 in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
