The perceived flaws of the schematics are humorously discussed, such as that the tractor beams are easy to shut off, owing to the low intellects of the common stormtroopers, and there are no support beams on the bridges because it would be too expensive to add them. The Emperor also notes the exhaust port as being too large at around fifteen meters wide, prompting them to reduce its size to the canonical two meters - the smallest possible safe size - and add multiple turbolasers and ion cannons to the trench to decrease the chance that a pilot could make the necessary shot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The title of the sketch is a reference to the movie A Star is Born and/or its remakes in 1954, 1976, and 2018."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The appearance of Bevel Lemelisk is different in this comic than in any other source where he is portrayed.
