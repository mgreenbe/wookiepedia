The Separatist fleet opened fire almost immediately destroying one of the Venator-class Star Destroyers. Led by Skywalker the fleet was forced to break off their supply mission and fall back. Skywalker engaged the Separatist forces in his Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor along with squadrons of V-19 Torrent starfighters to hold off the onslaught while the fleet could plot a hyperspace route in the navigation computer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Republic cruisers in disarray the Separatist fleet pressed their attack, launching C-9979 landing craft filled with B1 and B2 battle droids to land on the Republic cruisers to take them over. However most of the droid landing craft were intercepted and destroyed by the V-19 Torrent pilots and were unable to reach the nearby cruisers. The droids that did manage to land on the ships were quickly dispatched by clone troopers who were stationed to defend the hull.
