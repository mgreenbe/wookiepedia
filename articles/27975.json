During the battle, however, the Imperials discovered the gamblers, and, believing them to be supplying intelligence to the insurgents, attacked them. Trouvee fled with his copilot, Waglin, in his starship, the Millennium Falcon. Before he could escape, however, the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Desolator opened fire on him, missing and hitting two TIE fighters. This pushed the starfighter count two higher than the count on which Trouvee had bet; Trouvee, in desperate need of credits, entered this tournament. He made it until the third day of the tournament, when the pot had grown to ninety-thousand credits and Trouvee had a hand he didn't think could be beat. By then he had been forced to throw in the Millennium Falcon and Calrissian beat Trouvee with an Idiot's Array, winning the Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Solo vs Calrissian, 2.5 BBY"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han Solo won this tournament, held in the Yarith Bespin, and consisted of over a hundred competitors.
