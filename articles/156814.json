He ended up in the Imperial Prison of Dathomir, which was overseen by Inquisitor Olof and Warden Vinzel Haylon. The warlord managed to escape, stealing an old jetpack from a prison officer named Mozo Bondog. Although that jetpack was non-functional at the time, it had once belonged to the late bounty hunter Viume Loggun, and Bondog nursed a sentimental attachment to it. Because of his theft, the mercenary warlord was hunted by a spacer whom Bondog had hired to kill him. The two had a fight, which resulted in the warlord's demise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mozo Bondog was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
