The ability shared similarities to Shift Sense."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Practice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many Padawans of the Jedi Order struggled to apply this ability. The Padawans who needed help in this area were advised to practice Force-boosted hearing while meditating, with all other senses closed down. It was a common practice within the Jedi Temple to program a training remote to travel away from the practitioner at one meter per minute. The Padawan would have to listen to the quiet humming of its repulsorlift for a time and check how far it has travelled through the hallway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Jedi Seer Sabla-Mandibu this ability was particularly challenging for Padawans because the Force often supplied its own unique perspective which feels counterintuitive to use it for enhancing the same senses Padawans use every day."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
