He refused to take his helmet off, as he was part of the Children of the Watch, which forbade such actions. His old armor became irreparable when he fought a mudhorn, so he took the beskar that he received from the bounty on Grogu and replaced it. The Armorer suggested that he have a mudhorn signet engraved on his pauldron, but he stated it was not a worthy kill as he was assisted by Grogu. The Armorer then suggested he receive whistling birds as part of his armor instead, which Djarin accepted. In the Mandalorian tunnels on Nevarro, he received a jetpack. It was given to him by the Armorer, who also engraved the mudhorn signet at that time, which was the signet of a \"clan of two,\" whose members were Djarin and Grogu. Later, on Morak, Djarin was forced to remove his helmet to have his face scanned to be able to acquire the coordinates of Moff Gideon's light cruiser. Many people saw his face, which went against The Way of The Mandalore. He later took of his helmet again on Gideon's light cruiser so Grogu could see his face and touch it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
