As the Disney+ The Simpsons library was well received, executive producer James L. Brooks proposed to do a series of shorts where the show interacted with other franchises available in the streaming service. Showrunner Al Jean, a long-time Star Wars fan, pitched the idea of making a Star Wars-centric short in which Maggie is send to a Jedi preschool. Two shorts starring Maggie, The Longest Daycare and Playdate with Destiny, had been previously produced in 2012 and 2020. Both Lucasfilm Ltd. and Disney+ showed enthusiasm for the idea, and asked The Simpsons crew to have the short ready for May 4, 2021, given the \"Star Wars Day\" is celebrated in that date."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jean wrote the script along with Joel Cohen and Mike Price and The Simpsons director David Silverman directed the short. The first draft for the short was ready by January 18. They worked closely with Lucasfilm during throughout the short's development, providing suggestions and making sure that The Simpsons crew used the full universe of their characters. Among the characters included in the short as a \"Darth Maul Baby\" and BB-8, but Grogu was only referenced yet not included, as Jean felt that the character, best known as \"Baby Yoda,\" is probably the most demanded to Disney, so they understandably didn't want him to be overexposed. The Lucasfilm team also helped them to translate the Aurebesh writing correctly on a chalkboard. The short was finished on April 30, four days before its release date."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Trivia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point during the film, some Aurebesh writing can be seen on a chalkboard.
