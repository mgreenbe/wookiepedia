The Northern PCS was predominantly responsible for the command operations of the Death Star, and was where daily administrative work was carried out. As such, the Northern PCS was outfitted with various audience halls, briefing rooms, wardrooms, and other essential command areas. Such include the Emperor's tower, which contained the Emperor's throne room; the overbridge was also found in that area. The Northern Polar Command Center, along with the rest of the Death Star, was destroyed during the Battle of Yavin by the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
