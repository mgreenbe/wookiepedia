The laser cannons from the TIE replaced the ion cannons in the Y-wing's turret, and the TIE's sensor package replaced the Y-wing's missing sensor array."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This ship was one of the more common \"Ugly\" designs, thanks to the fact that Y-wings and TIE Fighters were two of the most common ship designs in use. It was neither fast nor maneuverable, but was comparatively durable and packed a punch. In a way, it combined the strengths of both fighters, having better shields and weaponry than a TIE/LN starfighter and better engines and firepower than a BTL Y-wing, whereas the opposite can be said for the TYE-wing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
