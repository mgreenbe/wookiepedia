The documents ended in Rorkee, a floating city of the nearby gas giant Genarius. To increase tourism, Rorkee decided to build a reproduction of the Excavation, based on the reports. The simulated Dorumaa Excavation opened in 46 BBY and continued for at least 15 years. In 31 BBY, Sullustan archaeologist Blibbie served as a guide to the simulation, although he himself could not imagine how to interpret the marks in the wall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That same year, a group of people from the Usable Resource Location, Recovery, and Development Corporation intended to kidnap the newest employee of their company, Dr. Shilaea Motacc, and force her to design the weapons they wanted to use. To perform the abduction, they simulated a natural cave-in in the Dorumaa Excavation Simulation. Dr. Motacc, an archaeology aficionado, had been awarded with a vacation at Rorkee and she was eager to visit the Excavation. The criminals recruited Blibbie and several dig workers, to avoid accidental deaths. Although the operation was relatively successful, Dr. Motacc was later rescued by independent agents sent by U.R.L.R.D. manager Fesvk Wefos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
