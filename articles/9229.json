He may have been of Alderaanian or Corellian descent and was six or seven years younger than Luke Skywalker. While in the wastelands of Nam Chorios, he found and took Luke back with him to Ruby Gulch to meet his Aunt Gin Scraf. He later participated on an attack on one of the Therans gun stations so Dzym could be allowed to leave Nam Chorios, though to him and the other Newcomers, they merely believed that they were opening up the world to free trade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
