In this region of space, an elite Imperial fighter squadron had been launching devastating hit-and-run attacks on Republic convoys. Finally the squadron had been tracked to an asteroid field in the Drexel system. So the Republic Command organized an ambush using the elite Coruscant Aegis squadron, supported by Thranta-class corvettes. The Republic fought very well destroying most, if not all, of the Sith forces there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is an upgraded version of the Battle of the Archenar asteroid field."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
