After the Empire was defeated at Endor, he spent much of his time in cantinas in the Vex Belt. There, he offered people to join him as apprentice scouts, but due to his weakened mind, he often accused them of theft or led them on wild flights through Wild Space, instead of teaching and paying them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
