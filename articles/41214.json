Tesla had been ordered by Sith Lord Darth Vader to find Jax Pavan, a Jedi Knight that had survived Order 66. When Tesla was searching the area on Coruscant around Ploughtekal Market he felt a Force presence, and followed it to a nearby repulsor field, where he caught up to and fought with the Force-sensitive, who happened to be Savaros, instead of Pavan. Tesla was impressed by Savaros' untrained skill, and attempted to defeat him with Force lightning, which reacted with the repulsor field and came back to him, knocking him out. Moments later, Jax Pavan and Twi'lek Gray Paladin Laranth Tarak appeared on the scene and took Savaros to safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Force-sensitive boy named Kajin Savaros had been living in hiding on Coruscant since the Galactic Empire had come into power.

The very next day Pavan began training Savaros as his apprentice. The young boy would serve as a powerful addition to Jax Pavan's friends and the Whiplash organization, though his presence there would begin create distrust among Pavan's friends. It would also prove very difficult for Savaros to bring his powers under control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Vader would later team up Tesla with two other Inquisitors, Yral Chael and Mas Sirrah, because Tesla didn't seem to be able to do the job alone.
