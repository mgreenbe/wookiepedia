He and his allies had just attacked a Trade Federation convoy in orbit and captured supplies for the Naboo resistance. His goal was now to deliver the supplies to the resistance, flying through the canyons near the city of Theed. The Trade Federation Droid Army had blockaded the canyon, though, and Dallows had to fight through a number of enemy vehicles so the Toydarian Reti could land with the supplies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After an alliance of Naboo pilots and spacers stole cargo from the Trade Federation during the Invasion of Naboo in the year 32 BBY, the pilots contacted the resistance down on the planet. Rhys Dallows agreed to deliver the supplies to them. He would be escorting Reti, who was carrying the supplies. He set up a rendezvous with other Naboo forces, but when they failed to show up, he deduced they were in trouble and needed to fly through the canyons to the resistance base. When Reti voiced concerns about flying in the canyon, Dallows reassured the Toydarian he had flown those canyons before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Into the canyon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Almost immediately, Dallows and Reti came under fire from Trade Federation patrols looking for the base, but the two kept on flying through the canyon. At the first clearing, Dallows destroyed a dropship attempting to land more battle droids. After wiping out the tanks and troop transports which had already landed, he and Reti continued through the canyon. At the second clearing, Dallows destroyed another dropship and more droids. Leading Reti into the canyon, he warned the canyon was going to get narrower. The Federation had stationed Turret Mines in that portion of the canyon. Dallows destroyed the mines while Reti was fearfully requesting an escort."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Meeting the resistance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After passing through the minefield, the two pilots flew into the third clearing and met with the Resistance who were flying their N-1 starfighters against Scarab droid starfighters and AMTs. Dallows helped destroy the opposition, and subseqeuntly received a distress call from the base further down the canyon, which was under heavy droid attack. The Resistance Laser turrets were firing at troop transports and tanks when Dallows and the other pilots arrived, and their combined firepower quickly wiped out the attacking force. Reti arrived and delivered the much-needed supplies, and he and Dallows vowed to help the resistance. They would soon have the opportunity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This mission appeared in the video game Star Wars: Starfighter, of which Rhys Dallows is one of the primary protagonists.
