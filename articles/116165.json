In the event of dishonor or deception conducted by a member of the Bha'lir, members of the society had to be prepared to take the life of the offending party. Some Bha'lir members took it upon themselves to seek out those who had violated the Bha'lir's code in accordance with the Rite of the Retributiom. These members, referred to as \"bloodied,\" were held in the highest esteem. Drake Paulsen invoked the Rite of the Retribution when he killed Izzat in retaliation for the the death of his father, Kaine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
