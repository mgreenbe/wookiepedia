Based on the Firespray DL-87 stun rifle produced at the same time, the rifle used most of the same firing systems but had an optimised and upgraded galven pattern added to fit the LBR-9's longer barrel. Fitted with composite furniture and iron sights, the rifle used a patented mix of blaster gases which, combined with the galven pattern, gave it enough strength to knock out most targets in one or two concentrated, high-precision bolts. The rifle had long range and accuracy comparable to most lethal weapons of the same weapon class as it. The rifles were mainly used by law enforcement agencies in the Core Worlds region of the galaxy, and few were found in the fringe regions of the galaxy during the Civil War. Those that did make their way out of the Core were quickly purchased by either bounty hunters or big-game hunters, who favored their non-lethal nature, precise handling and reputation for being finely made, dependable and accurate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The LBR-9 was first mentioned in Enter the Unknown, a sourcebook written by Sterling Hershey and released in 2013 for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
