Later, the Senate accepted Grand Admiral Rae Sloane's offer to conduct peace talks near Hanna City. In secret, this was a pretext for Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax to launch his attack on the New Republic leadership using the former prisoners as unwilling assassins controlled with inorganic bio-chips installed in their brains. The resulting Liberation Day attacks were broadcast live on HoloNet to audiences across the galaxy. This had the result of undermining morale in the New Republic and setting the stage for the Battle of Jakku. The attack also led for calls to relocate the New Republic capital to a more fortified world. Chandrila was also attacked during Operation: Cinder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the final months of the Civil War in 5 ABY,[source?] the Republic began the process of relocating the Senate to the Mid Rim world Nakadia for a year cycle after an Imperial attack.

During the Battle of Jakku, Wartol tried to assassinate Mothma by bombing her office. However, Mothma was out of her office but her Adviser Auxi Kray Korbin was killed. Shortly later, Mothma, Organa, Sondiv Sella, and Sinjir Rath Velus met with Grand Vizier Mas Amedda to sign the Galactic Concordance; which facilitated the Empire's surrender to the New Republic. The signing ceremony took place at the crystal cliffs north of Hanna City. On the same day, Organa gave birth to her son Ben Solo.
