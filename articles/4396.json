The track was operated by Selkaths Sslamoth and T'sllth, during the Jedi Civil War. The design was such that vehicles would hover over the surface of the water. Registration for the race could be done in Ahto East. Some complained, however, that the racing venue suffered with the destruction of Taris. During the Jedi Civil War, the track featured Hukta Jax, Casandra Mateil and Queedle Molto as prominent swoop racers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
