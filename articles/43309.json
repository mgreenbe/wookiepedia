It increased accuracy by reducing the time it took for the wielder to aim at short distances; in some cases, the shooter could place the crosshairs directly onto a target and hold the trigger. However, the crosshair was readily visible to those on the weapon's receiving end, especially in dark or places of low light. The cost of an electronic sighting system was 500 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
