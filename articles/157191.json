Corwyth tried to blame the failure in capturing Organa on the security system, but when the officer tried to reason that the system itself worked as intended, Corwyth throttled the officer by the collar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Infiltrator on Metalorn"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A human male served the Galactic Empire as a radio officer on the planet Metalorn during the Galactic Civil War. Serving under Governor Corwyth, the officer worked from Monitor Control, a communications hub that oversaw Metalorn's security. Due to a combination of Corwyth's information control program and the House of Tagge weapons detection system, the factory world's populace knew nothing of the Empire's war against the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the year 0 ABY, monitor control was paid a visit by Baron Orman Tagge. The visit happened to coincide with a rebel mission to infiltrate the planet and spread the seeds of rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The infiltrator, Princess Leia Organa, eventually stole an Imperial stormtrooper rifle, which triggered a condition red. Another officer reported the situation to Corwyth, who expressed outrage by the rebel attack. After the second officer got a bead on the stormtrooper's stolen rifle, Corwyth sent troops in pursuit. The radio officer then monitored both the movement of the troops and the blaster. Meanwhile, the heightened activity in the area was passed off as a drill to the curious populace."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Duped"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The blaster's signal eventually made its way to an ore conveyor, prompting the radio officer to ask if he should order the conveyor to halt. The request was angrily vetoed by Corwyth, who believed such an action would be in the Rebellion's favor. The radio officer, however, believed that Organa was intending to sabotage something. Eventually, a platoon of soldiers had managed to reach the smelting bay ahead of the blaster's signal in order to cut the princess off. Corwyth was pleased with the development, but in his state of concentration, he failed to notice Baron Tagge slip from the room. Meanwhile, the waiting unit's ambush proved unsuccessful: Organa had learned of the rifle's tracking device and had ditched the weapon in the ore conveyor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Furious, Corwyth grabbed the radio officer by the collar as he attempted to downplay Organa's escape as an unprecedented move of using the Empire's technology against them. Corwyth demanded additional units to find Organa. By then, however, Organa had already completed her mission and bested Tagge in a brief duel. Afterwards, she escaped the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The radio officer was a light-skinned human with reddish-brown hair and blue eyes. The officer dutifully followed the movements of Organa and Corwyth's men, and reported on the evolving incident as developments occurred. Corwyth derided the man as a fool, however, when the officer suggested a temporary halt to ore transportation in order to capture Organa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nevertheless, when Corwyth tried to blame the failure to capture Organa based on the weapon tracking system on Tagge's security measures, the officer reasoned that the system had indeed worked as intended.
