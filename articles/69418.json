It was run by Jasko, an Imperial cadet that had washed out of the Arkanis Academy. It was known to be only shop in the port that offered a decent cup of caf. Additionally, Jasko delighted in offering unmonitored comm booth services, his method of getting revenge on the leader of the Arkanis Academy, Commandant Brendol Hux.
