At ten years of age, he possessed what was termed an \"angry machine,\" that would be activated and put to use whenever he was in a particularly tumultuous mood. The angry machine would calm and soothe Wikyochee's body, allowing him to abandon his more incensed temperament in favor of a more affable demeanor.

The competition called for readers to create entirely original aliens influenced and inspired by the original trilogy of films from the Star Wars saga. Reeder developed his creation by drawing on three characters from the original trilogy\u2014Wicket the Ewok, Jedi Master Yoda, and Han Solo's sidekick Chewbacca. By amalgamating the characters, Reeder came up with Wikyochee. His entry was not a winner in the competition, but it was nonetheless published in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 7 alongside the winners under the \"honorable mentions\" category of the \"under 16\" subdivision. Star Wars continuity editor Leland Chee later stated that the successfully published \"Design an Alien\" material was to be considered canon. In spite of this, Wikyochee has yet to be referenced in any other Star Wars works."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
