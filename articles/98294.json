They were infamous for their regular raids on the agricultural planet of Taanab, lasting until 0 ABY, when Lando Calrissian happened to be in the system at the time. With the gambler at their helm, the local defense fleet decisively won the Battle of Taanab, capturing or destroying nearly all the Freebooters. Rumor has it Calrissian won the deed to a Clendoran brewery for his trouble."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
