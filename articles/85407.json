A rectangular stone island with smooth, steep walls was built around the Tho Yor, with triangular extensions jutting out from each corner that hosted laser cannons. The portion of the temple above that base consisted of several flat platforms that formed a gray-green step pyramid structure, and the tip of the Tho Yor that jutted above the pyramid was topped with a blue crystalline tower."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eight smaller pyramids with their own blue towers ringed the Tho Yor, and portions of Mahara Kesh also extended underwater. A number of towers jutted down from the underside of the temple, with a central prong that was larger than the others.

By that time, the Je'daii had established the tradition of the Great Journey, which saw young Je'daii known as Je'daii Journeyers travel the surface of Tython and visit each temple.

Ten days after Xesh and the others were brought to the temple, the Je'daii Council decided to exile Xesh to the moon of Bogan so that he could bring himself back into balance, and despite the protests of the Journeyers who had helped capture him, Je'daii Rangers Rori Fenn and Hawk Ryo took Xesh from Mahara Kesh to Bogan in their Peacemaker-class cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mahara Kesh was first pictured in the preview issue 0 of the Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi comic series, and it first appeared in the series' fifth issue.
