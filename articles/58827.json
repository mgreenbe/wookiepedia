In 0 BBY, during the construction, Hahrynyar ordered an extra exhaust port installed, which led him into a confrontation with Teela Kaarz, a Mirialan architect, over the placement of the port. Although the Wookiee took ill with a suspected parasitic infection before any change to the station's blueprints could be made, the exhaust port was ordered and installed as he had planned, a development that presented the Rebel Alliance with the means to destroy the Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hahrynyar was an enslaved Wookiee construction worker whom the Galactic Empire assigned to the first Death Star, a massive battlestation that was to be used against the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. He served as a shift chief on a subsector of Sector N-One. In 0 BBY, during the station's construction, Hahrynyar installed a secondary thermal exhaust port below the main port, and afterward was involved in an argument with Teela Kaarz, a Mirialan architect who specialized in encapsulated arcology, concerning the port's placement. Kaarz told the Wookiee that she had the authority to change the blueprints; Hahrynyar demanded to see that authority in writing. After the confrontation, Hahrynyar returned to his duties and ordered a crew to unpack and install equipment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At a later point during the construction, Hahrynyar was involved in a decompression accident that required a heart-lung transplant, which was performed by Doctor Kornell Divini. The Wookiee was placed on immuno-suppressive drugs, which caused him to develop a suspected parasitic infection. Plagued with a cough and a high fever, Hahrynyar was unable to return to work. He expressed his concerns over his absence in a brief conversation with Divini, which was translated by the droid C-4ME-O. As such, the work on the exhaust ports continued, as Kaarz had never obtained the authorization to remove them. During the Battle of Yavin, the ports became the target of the Rebel Alliance, as they led directly into the main hypermatter reactor core. A precise shot with a proton torpedo would allow the projectile to enter the port, trigger a chain reaction, and destroy the Death Star. The Alliance used this weakness to their advantage during the Battle of Yavin and fired the decisive shots that eliminated the superweapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Hahrynyar was an elderly Wookiee male, whose pelt had turned gray with age. He was a natural-born leader, and due to the Wookiee's attitude, Teela Kaarz suspected that Hahrynyar would have volunteered to join the Death Star construction crew even if he had not been enslaved. Grizzled and stubborn, Hahrynyar intentionally forgot how to understand Basic so that he was able to avoid communicating with his superiors. He had a sense of humor and once made a remark concerning Emperor Palpatine's personal hygiene."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hahrynyar was created by authors Michael Reaves and Steve Perry for the novel Death Star, first published on October 16, 2007, by Del Rey.
