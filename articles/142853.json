Wiker. However, with Wizards' shift in focus to the Star Wars Miniatures game, the sourcebook was ultimately canceled. As it was to be released before the Expanded Universe coverage of the Clone Wars had ended, it would also not have contained information on important stories such as Labyrinth of Evil or Star Wars: Clone Wars Volume Two. Much of the cut material was later reincorporated into The New Essential Chronology, also by Dan Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
