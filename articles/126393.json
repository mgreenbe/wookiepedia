It was used by the Skaak Tippers as a base of operations. Circa 1 ABY, Tanoa Vills dispatched a spacer to the cave in order to get octave regulators from Skaak Tipper machinists. This allowed Vills to build a sequencer that can be used in a Stonewall Labs security beacon. Later, a Royal Naboo Security Forces agent entered the cave and killed one of the Skaak Tipper's leader, Dee Skaak, to retrieve a piece of a stolen Gungan artifact for Boss Rugor Nass."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
