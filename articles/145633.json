Outside of the cities, the Tholothian planetary government designated great swathes of land as wildlife preserves. Keeping large industry on other planets in the star system, Tholoth remained an idyllic garden world free of the pollution of other highly populated planets. Tholoth's axial tilt caused the night's sky to be filled with the bright light from the Deep Core for half of the year, and the dark, muted brilliance of the galaxy's arms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Benefiting from the trade and immigration that flowed from the Core Worlds, the native Tholothians quickly implemented strong policies to regulate the flow of extraterrestrial visitors to their world. Insisting that the influx of new visitors integrate in a ecologically-minded way, the Tholothian cities grew their cosmopolitan charm by incorporating foreign architectural styles with a distinct Tholothian twist. This blend of styles helped Tholoth remain distinct from the urban sprawl of the ecumenopolises across the galactic core."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Modeling themselves after the Galactic Republic, the democratic strictures of the planet's government saw the appointment of an executive and a senate of legislators. After the rise of the Galactic Empire, the planet became prison-like to the inhabitants. Prolific commanders of the Imperial Army established estates across the planet's protected zones, turning these environs into their own personal vacation lands. The local economies surrounding these private estates were forced to support these Imperial officers and their needs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tholoth was first mentioned in Labyrinth of Evil, a Star Wars Legends novel written by James Luceno and released in 2005.
