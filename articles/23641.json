In between these two sections was slung a series of the modular Xizor Transport Systems cargo containers, connected via a small, flexible coupling section. The Cargo Tanker had immense hauling power, and it was able to easily pull long chains of even the Class-J cargo container."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, with this capacity came the need for protection from piracy. The Cargo Tanker lacked any form of offensive capability, possessing neither laser cannons nor warhead launchers. The ship was equipped with a strong defensive shielding system.
