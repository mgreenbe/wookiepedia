The Millennium Falcon was docked here when Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, and C-3PO came to Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina to find passage to Alderaan in order to deliver the secret Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance. It was there that they found Solo and his First Mate Chewbacca, and booked passage aboard his ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moments after Kenobi, Skywalker, R2-D2 and C-3PO arrived and boarded the Falcon, a squad of stormtroopers arrived and immediately opened fire on the ship. Han was able to fire a few shots before running up the Falcon's gangway, yelling for Chewbacca to launch the ship. The Falcon barely escaped the Imperials and headed off into space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
