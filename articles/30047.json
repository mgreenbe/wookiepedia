Based on early designs for Powered Battle Armor, it employed an energized exoskeleton that included a series of servomotors. These characteristics enhanced the wearer's strength. The armor was favored by professional soldiers, mercenaries, and bounty hunters. From 22 BBY to 8 ABY, a typical suit would have cost ten thousand credits and weighed approximately eighteen kilograms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
