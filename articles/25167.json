The herb was considered a possible cure for an ancient Drall disease, the Balding Sickness. The local Dearic Garden Club kindly helped Biahin in his efforts and located a specimen of the herb in the Talusian wilderness. Biahin paid a spacer 25 credits to meet with the club's representative in the wilderness near Dearic and bring a sample of the Natterbloom to him. As a token of gratitude Biahin asked the spacer to deliver a recording of the anthem Flowers of Drall sung by young students at the Boiling Sea Music Academy on Drall to the Garden Club's chairperson.
