Manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata and standing 1.93 meters tall, the droid was under the command of Kerkoiden General Piar Nagelsa prior to the First Battle of Plagen. Shortly before the battle, the droid assassinated Nagelsa due to issues that most tactical droids had with serving under unfit organic leaders. The droid then assumed command over the Confederate forces as it threw away Nagelsa's battle plan and led the Confederate forces to win the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The T-series tactical droid was first mentioned in 2012's The Essential Guide to Warfare, an extensive guide on the conflicts in the galaxy, written by Jason Fry and Paul R.
