It was located near the Estauril River, two blocks up from the Dry Goods Emporium. Political activist Gerta Haman worked there as the inventory supervisor. When she created the Cularin resistance and disappeared, the entire day shift disappeared themselves with her, failing to show up for work one day. That night, the night shift also disappeared, and the logo of the resistance had been painted on the front of the warehouse. Basca reported to the Office of Peace and Security but, as nothing had been stolen, the agents were not in a hurry to go."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
