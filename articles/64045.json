They possessed a large muscled upper torso, with two arms and a head. Their faces included two white eyes and a mouth of sharp teeth surrounded by red tentacle-like appendages. The beasts skin was purple with red spots covering parts of their head, shoulders and upper arms. In the year 0 ABY, a hyropodic aetherbeast was brought before the queen of the planet Ktath'atn as a curiosity in the hopes that it would pique her interest enough for her to grant its owner an audience to make a request of her. The queen was initially interested in the beast enough to consider its owner's request, but ultimately turned the owner away with compensation after being presented with the Jedi Luke Skywalker by the archaeologist Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A hyropodic aetherbeast first appeared in the comic book The Screaming Citadel 1, which was written by Kieron Gillen, illustrated by Marco Checchetto and released on May 10, 2017."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
