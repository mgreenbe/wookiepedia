Master Douglas Sunvale tried to encourage his Padawan Imri Cantaros to levitate during the latter's training. In 232 BBY, Master Avar Kriss led an emergency rescue operation deployed to the Hetzal system to protect it from fragments of debris emerging from hyperspace during a catastrophe that became known as the Great Hyperspace Disaster. Aboard the Third Horizon, Kriss levitated a meter above the ground in a meditative state while coordinating the rescue efforts through the use of her rare power that connected the natural bonds of Force-users."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Great Disaster, Vitus used levitation aboard the Amaxine station to float eight meters above the floor. He did so as a demonstration of power to quell looters causing havoc throughout the abandoned station. The display was affective, as the troublemakers laid down their weapons and returned their plunder. Days later, a group of people exploring the Amaxine station were attacked by a swarm of 8-T droids with pruning claws. Affie Hollow, who had witnessed Vitus's levitation, suggested that the two Jedi present could fly everyone to safety. Jedi Knight Dez Rydan explained that levitation could only be used during less stressful situations, prompting Hollow to remark that the ability seemed pointless if it couldn't be used in dangerous circumstances. Padawan Reath Silas agreed with Hollow's point, albeit internally."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After resolving the incident on the Amaxine station, Vitus returned to the Jedi Grand Temple on Coruscant where he levitated while meditating in a meditation chamber.

The diversion he provided allowed his allies to escape, although the strain of Force projection caused Skywalker to collapse and become one with the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35 ABY, Skywalker's former Jedi Padawan Rey levitated a few meters above the ground on the jungle moon Ajan Kloss while she attempted to commune with the spirits of past Jedi via meditation.
