The Blade operated primarily in the Ison Corridor in the Outer Rim, where the Blade raided and pillaged mid-size trade vessels with military escorts. According to Imperial dossiers, the Red Blade regularly docked at shadowports such as Port Nowhere and Wild Byth's. The Blade himself rarely emerged from his ship or the private suites the Blade would purchase upon landing, only appearing during celebrations of his latest score."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during his travels, the Blade encountered Dheno Rey on Hoth.

The Imperial agent, who was attempting to convince Nem'ro the Hutt to form an alliance with the Sith Empire, used the identity they received from their Arcona contact Jheeg.

The agent continued under the alias until they departed Nal Hutta, when they were contacted by Jheeg on their way to Jiguuna's hangar. The Arcona informed the agent that the real Red Blade was on their way to the planet. The Red Blade was confronted by the agent as they landed, and the pirate threatened to reveal the deception to Nem'ro. As a result, the agent and the Rattataki Kaliyo Djannis fought and killed the pirate.
