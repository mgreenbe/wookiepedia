Remaining loyal to the Republic, in the last year of the war the planet was attacked by a Confederate fleet under the command of Admiral Trench, as part of the Outer Rim Sieges.

After Echo was rescued from the Techno Union on Skako Minor, Republic forces hacked into the transmissions of Trench's flagship, ordering him to commit his forces to the assembly complex\u2014where they would encounter Jedi Generals Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the 212th Attack Battalion.
