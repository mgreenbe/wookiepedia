When the Galactic Empire discovered Echo Base after one of their Viper probe droids landed on Hoth, they launched a full-scale assault against the Rebels. The Rebels decided to flee, and Blake was present in Echo Base's south hangar when the first of the Alliance's evacuation transports safely escaped the system. Though the Alliance was able to successfully evacuate Echo Base, they suffered many casualties and the battle was viewed as a significant victory for the Empire. Nevertheless, Blake believed that the battle was the Alliance's finest hour and that it proved that the spirit of the Rebel Alliance could never truly be broken by a military power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance went on to win a major victory against the Empire in 4 ABY at the Battle of Endor and soon after reformed itself into the New Republic. Blake served the New Republic as a general and used the experiences at Hoth to train officer cadets in combat. Blake put the cadets through a three-part simulation of the Battle of Hoth, splitting them up into two teams that each took on the role of either the Alliance's General Carlist Rieekan or the Empire's General Maximilian Veers, and pitting them against each other to gain control of Echo Base. Blake hoped that the simulation would give the cadets a better understanding of Alliance's victory at Hoth, and that they would pass on the lessons they learned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
