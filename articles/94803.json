Holoprojectors were placed throughout the canyon, which deployed holographic versions of Dagger starfighters to act as targets for trainee pilots. Essara Till took Rhys Dallows in a run through the canyon to train him; at the far end, they engaged in a mock dogfight, with Dallows winning. The canyon was also suitable for racing and practice dogfights. After the start of the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, the Naboo Resistance established a base at the far end of the canyon. Dallows led Reti, who was carrying captured munitions through the canyon to meet with the resistance. Dallows helped the resistance destroy Trade Federation forces attacking the base and ensured the delivery of the supplies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Naboo training canyon appears in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Starfighter.
