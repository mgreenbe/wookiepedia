After the fall of the Old Republic and the rise of the New Order, Imperial forces blockaded the planet Zolan, homeworld of the Zolanders and the shape-shifting Clawdites. Imperial Intelligence sought to restrain access to and from the planet in order to prevent any changeling people in aiding Rebels. The blockade began early on in the reign of the Galactic Empire and remained while the Empire was in power. Unfortunately, the death of Emperor Palpatine that ended the blockade led to an era of tensions between the Zolander and the Clawdites, culminating in a full-scale civil war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
