The Republic was composed of various member worlds spread across light-years of space. Instead of affixing the Galactic Senate to Coruscant, the galaxy's historical seat of government, the capital shifted from one Republic world to another on a rotating basis. Beginning with the Core World Chandrila, homeworld of Chancellor Mon Mothma, the new system culminated in Hosnian Prime, which served as the Republic's final capital approximately three decades into the New Republic Era."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was reorganized into the New Republic, which was officially founded a year later. Modeled on the principles of its predecessor, the New Republic strove to dismantle Palpatine's New Order by restoring democracy after an era of Imperial rule. After the Battle of Jakku, the Republic accepted the Empire's formal surrender in 5 ABY, resulting in the Galactic Concordance peace treaty that ended the civil war in the same year. The New Republic Defense Force was significantly reduced, serving as a peacekeeping force while individual member worlds raised their own planetary defense forces. The Republic was only a fraction of the size of its predecessors, and therefore, relied on egalitarian policies to remain on friendly terms with neutral star systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Cold War between the Republic and the First Order began following the Centrists' withdrawal from the galactic government. Senator Leia Organa created the Resistance as a result of the Senate's unwillingness to risk open conflict with the First Order.

The Republic subsequently collapsed during the war that ensued, while large swathes of the galaxy were conquered by the First Order.

Centered on the capital world of Coruscant, the Old Republic fell and was replaced by the modern Galactic Republic, which was ruled by the Galactic Senate, which in turn was led by an elected Supreme Chancellor. Under the protection of the Jedi Order, a religious order of Force wielders who possessed seemingly supernatural power through connection with the Cosmic and Living Force, the \"second\" incarnation of the Republic enjoyed a millennium of peace and prosperity. However, as time went on, the government of the Republic became bloated and corrupt. The Senate, filled with self-serving politicians, was unable to deal effectively with disputes that arose between the member worlds of the Republic. With growing protest from the outer systems over one-sided trade deals and centuries of economic exploitation, about ten years before the eruption of the Clone Wars, a dispute over plasma exports and the taxation of Free Trade Zones in the galaxy caused the Trade Federation to invade the planet Naboo. Although the Jedi, with the assistance of the Naboo people and the Gungans, were able to end the occupation, then senator of Naboo Sheev Palpatine took advantage of the conflict, which he had secretly organized, leading to his successful election as Supreme Chancellor. In secret, Palpatine was Darth Sidious, a Dark Lord of the Sith, whose order was thought to be extinct, and he sought to restore the Sith Empire. Palpatine then manipulated the rise of a Secessionist Movement, during which time worlds who had become disaffected with the Republic seceded to form the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The discovery of the Separatist Droid Army, as well as a clone army for the Republic commissioned secretly by Palpatine, by the Jedi eventually led to the First Battle of Geonosis and the first major war in a thousand years, the Clone Wars. For three years, the galaxy fell into chaos, and for three years, Chancellor Palpatine amassed more emergency powers to the Office of the Chancellor, and made changes to the Galactic Constitution."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Clone Wars drew to a close, a group of 2,000 concerned senators formed the Delegation of 2,000; they created the Petition of 2,000, which identified the entire membership of the group, formally protested Palpatine's actions, and demanded he return to the Senate the emergency powers he had claimed following the conclusion of the war. However, when the Jedi discovered Palpatine's identity as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and that he was not going to give back his power, a group of Jedi attempted to arrest Palpatine but failed following the intervention of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker on Palpatine's behalf. Skywalker joined with Sidious and became his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. Palpatine issued Order 66, which forced the clone troopers to execute their Jedi Generals via pre-installed bio-chips, while Vader led the Siege of the Jedi Temple. Palpatine then called together the Senate in an emergency session of Congress, where he denounced the attempt to arrest him as a Jedi rebellion. He then declared that the Republic would be reorganized into the Galactic Empire and proclaimed himself Emperor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Resistance groups emerged on a number of worlds as the Empire tightened its grip on the galaxy, which, in time, caused the Galactic Civil War to break out. However, under the leadership of Senators Mon Mothma and Bail Organa, rebel cells eventually coalesced into the full-blown Alliance to Restore the Republic. These resistance fighters resolved to depose the Emperor from his rule over the galaxy and restore the Republic. In 0 BBY, the Emperor disbanded the Imperial Senate, the last remnant of the Old Republic still within the Empire, as the Empire unveiled the planet-destroying Death Star. However, the Rebel Alliance destroyed the battle station at the Battle of Yavin. Despite an ensuing four years of setbacks, in 4 ABY, the Rebel Alliance fought the Empire again at the decisive Battle of Endor. During the battle, Darth Vader sacrificed himself in order to save his son, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, by killing the Emperor, while the Rebel Alliance successfully destroyed a second Death Star.

The Alliance pressed its advantage against the Empire by pursuing shattered Imperial forces throughout the galaxy, hoping to prevent them from regrouping into a larger foe once more. With many celebrating the defeat of the Old Empire's dictatorial ruler, including a riot in Monument Plaza, the Empire would still maintain the military superiority over the fledgling Rebellion. Seeking to prevent the disheartened Imperial forces from reorganizing, the Alliance embarked on campaigns such as the Beltire Liberation and Battle of Cawa City, with both operations seeing the Alliance victories and Imperial blunders. Twenty days after the Battle of Endor, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, who had been sent by Mon Mothma, Chancellor of the Alliance, visited the Queen of Naboo, Sosha Soruna. In the royal palace's throne room, Organa asked for Naboo's support in the establishment of a New Republic and the restoration of a senate. The queen accepted Organa's offer, claiming that the Naboo felt great shame over Palpatine's actions. Although the Empire attempted to destroy Naboo and a variety of other worlds such as Burnin Konn, Candovant, Abednedo, and Commenor using climate disruption arrays during Palpatine's posthumous contingency plan Operation: Cinder, the plan was ultimately foiled by Alliance forces. During the subsequent Naboo invasions, with Imperials who sought to claim Naboo as a rallying point around their defeated leader's former homeworld, the New Republic continued to successfully defend the planet, its efforts there led by Thane Kyrell and Corona Squadron, along with several Imperial deserters who informed the Republic of Imperial strategy. As chaos and hope slowly gripped the galaxy, Imperial propaganda soon began touting several contradictory messages, with some claiming that the Emperor lived on, or that the so-called New Republic slowly plundered innocent star systems for its terrorist organization, while others feared legitimizing it by referring to it as anything other than a criminal organization. Governor Ubrik Adelhard locked down all communication and travel from the Anoat sector, hunting down any that spoke word of the Emperor's death with his Purge Troopers. Nonetheless, New Republic forces quickly began to swell as propaganda broadcasts featuring the destruction of the second Death Star rallied thousands of individuals to take up arms against the Empire. Officially founded a year after the Battle of Endor, the New Republic and its fledgling government soon chose Chandrila as their capital, while the Galactic Senate was re-established and its newly seated members elected Mon Mothma as the Chancellor. Chancellor Mon Mothma, former leader of the Alliance to Restore the Republic knew that a unified, singular message would be required to win the hearts and minds of civilians across the galaxy. Making clear that her new position was merely provisional, Republic communications bureaus worked around the chrono, crafting inspiration messages of hope, rebirth, empowerment, and self-determination. The Empire soon installed an actor to play the role of Palpatine, however, some were able to see through the facsimile. Inevitably, the truth of the Emperor's demise became known to the general citizenry, while ambitious men announced their ascension to the Imperial throne almost every day. In reality, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, the former aide to the Emperor who had served him since the Clone Wars would hold all the real power, and embark on the impossible task of maintaining the administrative and military functions of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the New Republic appeared unstoppable following the destruction of the Death Star II, several Republic leaders such as recently promoted Fleet Admiral Gial Ackbar knew that the Alliance's victory at Endor was nothing more than pure luck. Despite major victories on Sevarcos and Malastare, along with foiling an attempt to restart the droid foundries on Geonosis by SpecForces, the Republic still feared what a unified, singular thrust against populated New Republic systems could spell for the movement. Luckily for the Republic, the Imperial leadership could barely contend with themselves let alone an external threat. Ambitious members of the Imperial Council soon began carving up pieces of the Emperor's territories for themselves, while ambitious Moffs such as Valco Pandion and Randd began a rapid process of self-promotion and aggrandizement. While the Imperial Military maintained a semblance of unity owing to old loyalists and a common fear of the Rebellion, a few senior Imperials counted the days until someone of prominence broke away from the fold, ushering in the true collapse of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With numerous splinter fleets and factions of the Empire rising up, several of them retreated to worlds in the Outer Rim to escape the attention of the New Republic as it made inroads into the Outer Rim, gaining many victories, while strategically unimportant worlds such as Naalol would see heavy fighting in the months following the Emperor's death, with the Imperials using them as fallback positions as other worlds slowly eluded its grasp. To several Republic leaders, the shift of the Empire to worlds in the Outer Systems only made sense with the foreknowledge that many of the original seeds of the Empire originated there. Meanwhile the Iron blockade in the Anoat sector was into it first few months, forcing citizens of local worlds such as Burnin Konn to turn to crime bosses and the black market to obtain the food and supplies they needed to survive as the shortage was beginning to spark a substantial demand for smuggled goods. Wedge Antilles, a New Republic starfighter pilot, eventually tracked a gathering of Imperial forces on the Outer Rim world of Akiva, but was captured by the Star Destroyer Vigilance before he could report to the New Republic, necessitating a mission to rescue him. In reality, the military build-up would be the result of Admiral Rae Sloane, who attempted to bring some of the last leaders of the Empire together in the Imperial Future Council, where they would discuss the Empire's long-term strategy and appoint a new Emperor. Before any progress could be made, the resulting Rebellion on Akiva which was inspired by Norra Wexley saw several key Imperial figures killed or captured, with the New Republic Defense Fleet interrupting the gathering owing to Imperial admiral Gallius Rax, who had been feeding the Republic information under the codename the \"Operator.\" The Operator had in fact been providing the New Republic with sensitive Imperial information for months following Endor, with the intentions of removing those he saw as weak from leadership positions to 'cleanse' the Order from the inside out. With the summit exposed, Admiral Rae was forced to end the council dealings and the decision on a future Emperor was halted. But their escape plans were complicated by the destruction of their shuttles at the hands of Norra and was further complicated when Akivan protesters tried to storm the Satrapy of Myrra palace. Commander Kyrsta Agate would then arrive and would lead the Republic intervention force as the uprising against Imperial rule grew. With the eventual defeat of the Imperial fleet and garrison, the Satrapy of Myrra then capitulated and with Akiva becoming the first Outer Rim world to join the New Republic, dealt yet another major blow to the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months after the Battle of Naboo, General Solo went to Takodana to seek out an Imperial defector Ralsius Paldora, who knew where the data cubes were stored in the nearby forest that contained information crucial to both the Republic and to help free Kashyyyk. However, a skirmish broke out when the Imperial Military discovered his treachery and interdicted the general, however, Inferno Squad's arrival allowed Solo and Paldora to escape with the intelligence. Following the victory on Akiva, Princess Leia persistently lobbied the new Galactic Senate on the matter of liberating the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk from Imperial occupation. Her husband Han Solo's Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca came from Kashyyyk and Solo wanted to return a favor to Chewbacca, who owed him a life debt. The planet was governed by Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck, who had turned Kashyyyk into a planetwide slave labor camp and fitted every Wookiee on the planet with inhibitor chips. The Wookiees were exploited as disposable slave labor by the Empire and endured brutal conditions. However, the Republic was preoccupied with its military offensive against the remnants of the Empire. In frustration, Solo resigned his commission as General and embarked on a hastily-scrambled campaign with Chewbacca to liberate the Wookiee homeworld. Despite rallying Wookiee smugglers and refugees at Warrin Station, the initial campaign failed due to an Imperial trap. Solo managed to escape but Chewbacca was captured by the Empire and imprisoned at the bleak automated prison of Ashmead's Lock on Kashyyyk. After losing contact with her husband, Princess Leia turned to the New Republic officer Norra Wexley and her team for help in rescuing her husband. Wexley and her team which included her son Temmin, his B1-series battle droid Mister Bones, the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, the Zabrak bounty hunter Jas Emari, and Republic soldier Jom Barell had been participating in a campaign to hunt down Imperial war criminals including Vice Admiral Perwin Gedde. Meanwhile, New Republic forces took more former Imperial worlds including Arkanis, Kuat, and clashed with Imperial forces on Nag Ubdur. With the relaxation of censorship, HoloNet networks such as Queen of the Core Network freely reported on the New Republic's war efforts and Imperial atrocities and suicide attacks. While the Imperial capital Coruscant fell a true state of civil war with some sectors remaining free from Imperial control and Rebel resistance fighters entrenching themselves with Rebel resistance fighters while other loyal sectors actively fought against the rebels. Grand Vizier Mas Amedda took control of Imperial forces on Coruscant with the Imperial Security Bureau coordinate the planetary forces. In the face of the Republic's military advances and growing internal unrest, Vizier Amedda secretly met with Chancellor Mothma and Senator Leia of the Alderaan sector on the watery planet of Velusia to offer his surrender. However, the Republic leadership rejected his surrender and ordered him to find a way for the Empire to surrender."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response, Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax established a Shadow Council consisting of Grand Admiral Sloane, former Commandant Brendol Hux, Grand Moff Randd, General Hodnar Borrum, and Imperial propagandist Ferric Obdur to manage the dwindling remnants of the Empire. Rax mustered sizeable Imperial fleets in the Vulpinus Nebula, the Almagest, the Recluse's Nebula, the Queluhan Nebula, the Ro-Loo Triangle, and the Inamorata. He planned to launch a coordinated strike against the New Republic from the Imperial holdout worlds of Zhadalene, Korrus, and Belladoon in the Outer Rim. In the midst of the fighting, criminal elements like the pirate Eleodie Maracavanya took advantage of the lawlessness to expand their criminal enterprises. Answering Leia's call, Norra and her commander Wedge Antilles tracked Solo's last coordinates to the edge of Wild Space. After being rescued from Imperial forces, Norra resigned her commission in the New Republic Starfleet after Admiral Ackbar refused to sanction her mission to rescue Solo and ordered her to resume her hunt for Imperial war criminals. After Sinjir acquired information about Ashmead's Lock from the captive Yupe Tashu, Norra and her team subsequently traveled to the Siniteen prison builder Golas Aram's redoubt on the planet Irudiru. After reuniting with Han, the rebels joined forces to storm Aram's compound and force Aram to divulge information on Ashmead's Lock. Using this information, Norra's team and Solo traveled to Kashyyyk where they managed to infiltrated the automated prison. After disabling the computer system SOL-GDA, the rebels managed to free Chewbacca and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband and Temmin's father Brentin Lore Wexley. The Republic had also launched an assault on the Kuat shipyards utilized by Kuat Drive Yards where after weeks of fighting, the guild head and the sector governer Moff Pollus Maksim conceded to the Republic. Grand Admiral Sloane shortly after opened up peace talks at ending the war with Mothma agreeing to convene an emergency session of the Senate to discuss the Imperial offer. While Norra and Temmin flew the prisoners on the Millennium Falcon back to Chandrila, Han, Chewbacca, Sinjir, Jas Emari, and Jom stayed behind to organize a campaign to end Imperial domination over the Wookiees of Kashyyyk. For the next month, Jas recruited several smugglers and Wookiee refugees including the former slave Greybok. Han and his team also searched for Grand Moff Tolruck's hidden island fortress, from where he presided over his slave empire. Meanwhile, Grand Admiral Sloane grew disillusioned with Fleet Admiral Rax's leadership and agenda. After uncovering information about his connection to the late Emperor and the planet Jakku, Sloane became privy to Rax's plan to launch an attack on Chandrila, the New Republic capital. To lull the New Republic into a sense of complacency, Sloane had already posed as the Operator and offered to enter into peace talks with Chancellor Mothma and Admiral Ackbar in the aftermath of the Empire defeat over Kuat. Believing that the Empire was near capitulation, the Senate had agreed to peace talks. Meanwhile, on Kashyyyk, Han and Chewie's team managed to infiltrate Grand Moff Tolruck's island fortress and disable his inhibitor chips. This triggered a mass planetwide uprising which saw the rapid overthrow of the Imperial garrison on Kashyyyk. In desperation, Tolruck ordered the orbiting Imperial Star Destroyers to initiate orbital bombardment of Kashyyyk. However, Tolruck's order was intercepted by a New Republic probe droid which transmitted the footage to Leia, who alerted Wedge Antilles, Chancellor Mothma, and Admiral Ackbar. Han and his team also managed to hijack the Star Destroyer Dominion and destroy one of the other Destroyers. When Leia, Antilles, and Ackbar arrived with reinforcements, the remaining Imperial forces on Kashyyyk capitulated. The Wookiees regained control of their homeworld and began mopping up operations against the remaining Imperial holdouts on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The liberation of Kashyyyk was accompanied by the Empire's abandonment of its remaining garrisons on the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth, which was subsequently liberated by the Free Ryloth Movement. In Chandrila's capital Hanna City, Chancellor Mothma organized a celebration called Liberation Day to honor the Ashmead Lock's prisoners. This celebration coincided with Grand Admiral Sloane's arrival on Chandrila for the peace talks. Unknown to the New Republic, Fleet Admiral Rax had fitted the prisoners with inorganic biochips. After the Imperial agent Windom Traducier activated a transponder at the top of the Hanna City opera house, the liberated prisoners including Brentin involuntarily attacked several New Republic officials. Mon Mothma narrowly escaped assassination but numerous officials were maimed or murdered. Disgusted with Rax's tactics, Sloane turned against Rax and narrowly escaped death at the hands of her aide Adea Rite, who was a secret agent of Rax. The attack on Chandrila had serious repercussions for the New Republic's public image since the violence had been broadcast live on HoloNet. Several systems that had been considering joining the Republic withdrew their applications. Some advocated moving the Republic's capital from Chandrila to a more secure system. Some proposed forming an alternate Independent Systems Alliance. The New Republic also suspended hiring bounty hunters since soliciting their services made the Republic's security and military forces look weak. Following the Liberation Day attacks, Fleet Admiral Rax assumed control of the Shadow Council on the pretext of Sloane's alleged death. Appointing himself as Counselor to the Empire, Rax marshaled the Imperial armadas for a pitched battle against the New Republic on the barren Inner Rim world of Jakku. Meanwhile, the fugitive Sloane joined forces with Brentin to hunt down and kill Rax.

Chancellor Mon Mothma also had to contend with a political rival in the form of Senator Tolwar Wartol, who accused her of being weak and advocated a stronger, more centralized and militarized New Republic. These problems coincided with the New Republic's efforts to relocate its capital to the Mid Rim agrarian world of Nakadia. Chancellor Mothma apportioned resources and infrastructure for worlds devastated by the Empire during a meeting of the Committee for Imperial Reallocation, which was formed to deal with redistributing the resources of the Empire. Growing weary, Mothma advocated ending the meeting early and delaying it till next month. Despite maintaining a strong military, Mothma made sure that it was not too powerful in an effort to differentiate her government from the Empire. During a secret gathering, Mothma pointed out the fact that Senator Leia had authorized Norra Wexley and her team a mission to hunt for Rae Sloane was the jurisdiction of the Senate and responded that they had to be careful before proceeding to Jakku, she further explained that she was unable to authorize the deployment of military forces consulting the Senate.
