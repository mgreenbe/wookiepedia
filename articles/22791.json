That year, the planet was embroiled in an immense Force Storm, and Calleh, Naro, and the other Temple Masters\u2014who collectively formed the Je'daii Council were forced to join together and lend their strength to Temple Master Quan-Jang, who shifted the planet back towards the light side of the Force and into balance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly afterward, the Force-sensitive offworlder Xesh was brought to Mahara Kesh along with several other Je'daii who had been injured while capturing Xesh, including Quan-Jang.

Calleh expressed sympathy for the hard life Xesh had led, as was clearly visible by the numerous scars that covered his body, and the Selkath explained that the stranger was at Mahara Kesh.
