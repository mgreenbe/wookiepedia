In 0 BBY, he was assigned the role of a sandtrooper in the Galactic Empire's Foot Patrol 7 unit by Imperial Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, alongside Sardis Ramsin, TD-787, Tintop, and their commander, Wanten. The unit was dispatched to the desert planet of Tatooine, where they were tasked with recovering two missing droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, who were affiliated with the Rebel Alliance and were carrying the plans for the Death Star battle station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While stationed in the Imperial barracks located on the outskirts of the Mos Eisley spaceport, the clone witnessed an argument break out between Tintop and TD-787 after the former slipped an additive in the latter's food that made his stomach feel gaseous. Crag broke up the altercation by describing where the name \"stormtroopers\" came from, to which Tintop stated that it originated from their helmets being shaped like buckets. After Crag snubbed him for referring to the wrong origin of their name, Wanten arrived at the barracks and stated that they were \"born in the storm,\" to which Crag pointed out that it was \"the storm of history\" that served as the namesake for stormtroopers.

The commander ordered all available units to converge on Docking Bay 94, as he had received confirmation on the passengers' position from their spy, Garindan ezz Zavor. Crag led Foot Patrol 7 as they rushed to the hangar, but they were unable to reach the ship in time as it took off and left the planet after a brief firefight with another detachment of sandtroopers in the landing bay.
