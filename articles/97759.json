Nizzon's ship patrolled a remote sector for years with little action, but on one loop in 3 ABY, Nikkon discovered a small rent in the dimensional fabric that aroused great curiosity. Plikk and Nizzon gathered their fleet and blasted the rent open, passing through to discover the City of Dreams, a utopian dreamscape created through psychic energy from former Rebel hero Cody Sunn-Childe. Nizzon's fleet attacked and destroyed the city, but afterwards found that they did not have the hyperdrive power to escape Sunn-Childe's pocket dimension, trapping them there for good."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nizzon first appeared in Star Wars 46, written by John Marc DeMatteis and released in 1981.
