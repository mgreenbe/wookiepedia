Shortly before the First Battle of Plagen, a T-series tactical droid killed Nagelsa due to issues most tactical droids had with serving under unfit organic leaders. It then discarded Nagelsa's tactical plan as it assumed command and led the CIS forces to win the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nagelsa was mentioned in 2012's The Essential Guide to Warfare, an extensive Guide on the conflicts in the galaxy, written by Jason Fry and Paul R.
