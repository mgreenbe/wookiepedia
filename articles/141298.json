Created at great expense by diverting a natural river through the entertainment center of Kuat City, the planetary capital, the Tekshar Falls became something of an extravagant water feature for the eponymously named Tekshar Falls Casino that was built within its cascading waters. The waterfall provided the casino with hydroelectric power independent of Kuat City's power grid, and automated force fields prevented any water from reaching the casino itself. To reach the casino entrance, gamblers were required to pass through a stretch of the Tekshar Falls, which would part upon detecting incoming guests via a motion sensor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tekshar Falls was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the novel Sacrifice, the fifth entry in the multi-author Star Wars: Legacy of the Force series, written by Karen Traviss and published May 29, 2007."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
