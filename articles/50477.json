After the audition, he did not think he had landed a role, but received communication a few months later that he had been cast. Kelly then researched the film, which was then under the codename 'Redcup', and realized it was a part of the Star Wars franchise. Despite having been a Star Wars fan when he was younger, he had not seen any of the films released after Disney bought the franchise from George Lucas in 2012. Kelly opted to not watch the films he had not yet seen so that he could portray the part in his own way. He and his mother traveled to Pinewood Studios to film his speaking role, and in the film's credits, he is listed as \"Eager Scrumrat\". The film was released on May 25, 2018."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Filmography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
