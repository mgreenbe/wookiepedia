Later the newly constituted Community killed and overthrew the Imperial forces that operated the research facility. For many years, Maker and all the clones resided on the moon and only in 41.5 ABY, they escaped the facility by stealing a CloakShape fighter that had been flown to the moon by the Anzat Sith agent Kell Douro but unfortunately Alpha was killed by the Jedi Knight Jaden Korr."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maker and all of the other members of the Community, with the exception of the clone Soldier, suffered from a sickness as a result of their clone heritage and as they escaped from the research facility, the CloakShape passed through the remnants of the Lignan cargo of the Sith dreadnaught Harbinger, which had been destroyed a short time earlier. The Lignan enhanced the clones' perception of the Force and accelerated the effects of their sickness. Driven mad by the Lignan ore and the death of Scar, his mate, Maker began a feud with Soldier, which ended in his death by Force choke. Seer believed that the illness was a test that had been set for the clones by Mother and she then ordered Soldier to fly the CloakShape fighter to the planet Fhost, so that the clones could obtain some medication, and planned for the clones to then travel to find Mother."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the book, it was never explained who was the template of Maker.
