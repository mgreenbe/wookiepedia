The Death Star was equipped with 2,500 such weapons, which were all linked to a tactical computer system throughout the battle station, and had a faster recharge rate than most cannons. Each cannon was manned by one standing gunner, a seated targeting technician, and a seated energy technician. The gunners were stationed in pressurized chambers with open ports that were protected by invisible force fields."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
