The Class 720 freighter Onderian Raptor landed in the hangar and an armored individual emerged from it, and told Truminn that his name was Bail Antilles and that he and his crew were bounty hunters. However, the Executor's bridge commander detected a Rebel Alliance code that was being broadcast from the freighter, and ordered Truminn and a group of crewmen to apprehend Antilles and his crew.
