Return of the Jedi was scheduled to premiere on March 7, 1997, but due to the box-office success of the first two (mostly A New Hope, which grossed the most of the three re-releases), it was pushed a week, to March 14. Coverage on CNN in 1997 notes that George Lucas spent $10 million to rework his original 1977 film, which was roughly what it cost to film it originally. $3 million of that was spent on the audio track for the Special Edition.
