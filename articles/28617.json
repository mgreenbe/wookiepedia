As a part of the \"modification packages\" from Hydrospeare, the company's Design Team Beta took the Incom design and made it aquatic. This particular package had found Imperial acceptance. The main change was the replacement of the cockpit with a sturdier model for two collaborative pilots. Additionally, the body was streamlined, adding more shielding in the wings, and the weapon was replaced by an upper turret, while at the same time keeping the traditional harpoon of the T-47 in availability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
