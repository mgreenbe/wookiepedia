Unther lost two frigates, a cruiser, and a full wing of fighters in the first two weeks of the battle. In the ensuing weeks, Unther lost a squadron of fighters while the Moff in charge of the ground assault lost four supply ships. Eventually, the Empire emerged victorious, as the remaining Rebels abandoned their bases and fled the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
