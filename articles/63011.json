On board the Razor Crest, Djarin asked Kuiil to pad the container so Grogu could sleep better, but the Ugnaught offered instead to fabricate a better hovering pram himself. Kuiil's version retained the egg shape and closing cover of Grogu's original capsule, but was fashioned out of metal. Djarin used Kuiil's capsule to transport Grogu until it was ripped open by Koska Reeves so she could retrieve Grogu after saving him from a mamacore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
