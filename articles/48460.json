A group of firefighting battle droids used firehoses that were attached to the Malevolence in order to blast heavy streams of foam on fires that had broken out in the ship's hangar bay. The Confederacy left some of them on the planet of Iego. Jaybo Hood later mixed these units with parts from other leftover battle droids. Firefighter droids employed by Nebula Consumables on the planet Tyed Kant were colored in white and crimson."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
