The increase of a weapon's lethality was a common modification made by such individuals, and was often accomplished through the installation of an augmented spin barrel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using an updated and streamlined Galven pattern heavy-duty static pulse adapter, augmented spin barrels increased both the damage output and armor penetration of blaster rifles and heavy blaster rifles.
