The chamber was created by the incorporeal shadow lurkers\u2014disembodied spirits of the Oblee species\u2014as a defense to help contain the Darkstaff, an ancient Sith artifact that was housed within the asteroid. The room contained six shadows, each corresponding with a planetary body in the Cularin system, and only by passing through the shadow that represented the world Oblis could the chamber in which the Darkstaff was situated be accessed. Passing through the shadow that represented the planet Cularin would cause an individual to suffer injuries, while passing through any of the other shadows brought about the onset of insanity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
