They were surprised by the sudden appearance of Blackwing Flight and was ordered by Blackwing One to land at Velery Station. What the planetary government didn't know was that Night Caller had been commandeered by the New Republic starfighter group Wraith Squadron, and the pilot of one of the TIE's was celebrated pilot Wedge Antilles.
