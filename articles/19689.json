A large number of laws and traditions regulating nearly every aspect of the conflicts, including vendettas, privateering, and all-out war, emerged over the subsequent millennia. Both the Republic and its successor, the Galactic Empire, only intervened in the Botor-Daupherm conflicts when they began to spill over into the larger galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pirate who was the mother of the Dawferim Evram Darkmere died around 30 BBY, during one of the long wars between the Botor Enclave and the Daupherm Planet States. By 10 ABY, the Botori Enclave and the Dawferim had engaged in a five-hundred-years-long small-scale feud that attracted renegades and scavengers from nearby star systems. Also by that time, the systems of the Botor Enclave grouped together and formed a protective federation due to the lack of a centralized galactic government and the continuing conflict between the Empire and the New Republic following the former's fragmentation at the Battle of Endor of 4 ABY. In the process, the Botor Enclave also declared its independence from both the Empire and the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Botor Enclave was inhabited by an ursine sentient species known as the Botori.

During the first campaigns of the latter conflict, the Twentieth Army of the Republic was tasked with protecting the vicinity of the system against the military forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. By 17 BBY, the Botor system had been incorporated into the territory of the Empire. Forty-six years later, New Republic military forces passed through the system as part of the war effort against the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Botor Enclave was first mentioned in the 1993 Dark Empire Sourcebook, which was authored by Michael Allen Horne and published by West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
