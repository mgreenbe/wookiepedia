Lieutenant Magna Tolvan was spared an execution, which was supposed to have occurred because of three demerits. However, a message from headquarters announcing her promotion to Lieutenant-Inspector had been delayed due to the destruction of Scarif. Her promotion was the result of the death of her old mentor, Thanoth, who had named her as his successor. Tolvan's execution was stayed as a result of this news. According to Imperial Article 3, Section 9, the Inspectorate operated on a four demerit system\u2014unlike the field corps, which operated on a three demerit system. Tolvan was therefore released."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
