The first in the series of advertisements, it is drawn by Jan Duursema, the artist for the Star Wars: Legacy comic series, and is based on the style of the old super-hero fruit pie adverts. The storyline features characters from both the Rebellion era and the Legacy era, to highlight the diverse nature of Star Wars: Miniatures, where chracters from any era can be used together. It was printed on the back covers of Star Wars Insider issues 100, 102 and 103, the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide and also in a number of Dark Horse comics. Parts of the advertisement were also used to feature in ad banners on StarWars.com. Duursema also penned a similar advertisement for Star Wars Miniatures: Knights of the Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cade Skywalker and Deliah Blue are confronted by the Sith Lords Darth Krayt, Darth Talon and Darth Nihl, who are trying to capture Skywalker. Cade said that they should be afraid of him, because he was a tough bounty hunter, when he was suddenly confronted by Boba Fett, who planned to capture Skywalker and Blue to claim their bounty. Luke Skywalker was somehow also present and warned Fett to leave Cade alone, causing Fett and Cade to both become very confused about his presence there. Darth Krayt interrupted then and attempted to bring the focus of the encounter back to him, but Han Solo was also somehow there and with Blue's help, he was able to kick Krayt in the head. Cade then drew his blaster and held it aimed at everyone present, demanding to know how everything that had just happened was possible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the ad contains characters from different eras who would never have interacted, it can be considered to be non-canon. The frame of the comic where Luke Skywalker speaks to Boba Fett originally had Luke saying Stay away from my great-grandson! and this version of the comic featured in the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide. However, in later versions of the comics, Luke's dialogue was changed to Stay away from that Skywalker! Cade's exact relation to Luke has never otherwise been stated, only that his father Kol is a descendant of Luke."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
