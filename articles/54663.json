Girov used his own men and the Rogues as a diversion while he infiltrated the temple. Inside, he confronted Cartariun and his Rogue Squadron prisoner, Dllr Nep, managing to gain control over the Sith magic and using it to kill the former and imprison the latter. He then launched an attack on his former comrades, using Irrukiine in TIE Interceptors, but was defeated, thanks to the intervention of Plourr Ilo and an Eiattu 6 fighter squadron. He died when Dllr and fellow Rogue Herian I'ngre sacrificed themselves to blow up the Sith temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
