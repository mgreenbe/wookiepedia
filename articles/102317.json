It had a complex air scrubber system that allowed it to pull breathable gases out of poisonous atmospheres. It used a standard energy cell which provided four hours of operation and could be recharged in one hour. It did not have any internal storage, so it had to be used in an atmosphere that had at least some breathable air in it to be effective."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
