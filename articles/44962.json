Not wanting Rey and Finn to be involved, Solo placed both of them in the lower corridors of the freighter while he and Chewbacca went to meet with the criminals, with BB-8 accompanying them. The smuggler tried but failed to convince both parties that he would fix things eventually, with the Guavian Death Gang negotiator, Bala-Tik recognizing the BB unit from a First Order bounty placed on it and two fugitives. They demanded that Solo hand over the droid and the fugitives. As the scuffle continued, Rey accidentally released three rathtars. They successfully escaped the gangs and jumped into hyperspace in the Falcon leaving the Eravana in the hands of the Guavians. Immediately, Bala-Tik ordered his men to inform the First Order that Solo and the droid had escaped from the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Eravana appears in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.
