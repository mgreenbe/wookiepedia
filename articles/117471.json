Victims bitten by the tesfli piercer who did not seek medical attention found the bitten limb suddenly swollen and then turn a discolored black. The flesh soon fell apart, rendering the limb useless. This disease was at its worst when a victim was bitten dozens or hundreds of times upon encountering a swarm of these insects."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
