He and two others assaulted Langu Sommilor and his pilots on the landing pad on the planet Kynachi. The impostor, a male individual, in his guise of Sommilor, a male Kynachi, traveled to the planet Vaced to meet with his escort to Coruscant, the Jedi Nuru Kungurama. Once on Vaced, the impostor greeted Kungurama, and was almost immediately assassinated by a Mandalorian sniper. Kungurama pursued the sniper and eventually appeared to defeat him. Believing that the impostor really was Sommilor, Kungurama had his clone trooper team Breakout Squad stow his body onboard his freighter and intended on returning it to Kynachi. The ship was then used to transport the team to Bilbringi Depot. After the battle, the droid Cleaver found the real Langu Sommilor and his pilots, who were unconscious and tied up in the freighter's hold. Breakout Squad checked the body and realized it had a synthskin mask and gold wig. The body of the impostor was turned over to Republic Intelligence for identification. Although he had a Black Sun tattoo on his forearm, his body had not been identified after four days."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although first appearing in Ryder Windham's young readers book The Clone Wars: Secret Missions 3: Duel at Shattered Rock, he was not revealed to be an impostor until the following book, The Clone Wars: Secret Missions 4: Guardians of the Chiss Key."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
