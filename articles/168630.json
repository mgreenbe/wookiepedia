It calmed the minds of most species upon inhalation. It was in liquid form (though it was being developed to be administered airborne as well) and had no color or scent. Anakin Skywalker was once captured and exposed to the drug on Vanqor, when he and Obi-Wan Kenobi were investigating the planet. He became entranced in a state of ecstasy and docility to the point that he didn't care about escaping. Obi-Wan rescued him and Zan Arbor fled Vanqor. She then created Blackwater Systems with the help of Granta Omega on Falleen to increase production of the Zone and to test new methods of distributing the Zone, but the facility was purposely destroyed by Zan Arbor and Omega when it was discovered by the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
