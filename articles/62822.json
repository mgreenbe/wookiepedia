House Kassido based itself in the Juvex sector, where it controlled the planets Kassido and Ossiathora. The Kassido nobles became very rich as a result of trade with star systems in the D'Aelgoth sector and in the direction of the Core Worlds, although their dealings with outsiders led many within Senex-Juvex to hold little esteem for House Kassido. The humanoid Kardurans were a client species of House Kassido."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
