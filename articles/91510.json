Princess Leia Organa ordered Skywalker to do the talking over hologram. Once the Millennium Falcon landed, Skywalker set off, while Solo was distracted by the Rion Swoop race. The latter took part of their credits to enter. Meanwhile, Skywalker successfully concluded the bargaining, but noticed that the credits were missing. A group of bounty hunters were trying to catch Solo during the race, but Skywalker intervened, allowing Solo to win.
