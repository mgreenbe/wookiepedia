The harvesters could plough the land and immediately plant seeds in its own trail; it also could collect the mature season's growth later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A combine-reaper had several decks, which included: The main planting-and-reaping machinery just over the massive continuous tracks; immediately over it, the bins to storage the harvested crops and the packaging machines to process it; later, two more decks in the upper part with the living rooms for the crew; and last, a control cabin protuding in the upper deck. The aft part of the combine-reaper also provided an external landing bay so that visiting freighters could land directly in the harvester to collect the crops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reflecting the peace-loving ideas of the settlers, the combine-reapers had no weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the combine-reapers were long-ranged machines, most of the Human settlers of Leritor lived inside the nomadic combine-reapers. There was a permanent planetary capital in the biggest continent, mostly an expanding depot that every combine-reaper visited annually for supplies and reparation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human settlers and the native Sauvax species negotiated a Settlement Pact that forbid Humans and other outworld presences (including combine-reapers) to approach the coastal line where the Sauvax lived. In later years, several Sauvax contacted with roaming combine-reapers, mostly with cultural and commercial intentions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Combine-reapers were named individually. Known combine-reapers include the Nellist, which was attacked by Profex Rynalla, as well as the Gevion, which was harassed by the Sauvax soon afterwards in a misdirected answer to Rynalla's further actions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
