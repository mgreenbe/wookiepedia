During the War on Shu-Torun, the baron sent it to attack the Shu-Torun royalty's Ancestral Retreat, in the hopes of killing Queen Trios, who served the Galactic Empire and was at the retreat with her allies planning their next move in the war. The vessel emerged from the magma surrounding the retreat and opened fire on the scared building, causing Trios to try and flee in a shuttle. The Sith Lord Darth Vader and his Imperial allies Morit Astarte and Aiolin Astarte then joined her on the shuttle, but instead used it to board the leviathan. Using lightsabers, the trio cut through the hull of the leviathan and then fought their way through its occupants to reach either end of the hull. There, they cut large holes that allowed the ship to flood with magma and then retreated in the shuttle, leaving the leviathan to sink into the magma and be destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
