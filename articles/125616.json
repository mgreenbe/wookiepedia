Following the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire, Master Silvarte returned to the ancestral Jedi homeworld Tython with the rest of the Order and helped rebuild during the Cold War, residing at the Temple there. Selecting the young Moracen as his Padawan, Master Silvarte and fellow Master Yollo became suspicious of their students, believing that both Padawans Moracen and Spanios had begun a romantic relationship. To get an idea of the situation's severity, Master Silvarte sent another Padawan to discover whether the two apprentices were indeed romantically involved."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While serving as an instructor at the academy, Master Silvarte would mildly rebuke his students who fought with a clumsy stance during practice, masters of the \"Form of the Guid\", comparing their lightsaber stance similar to the wild guid that roamed Tython.
