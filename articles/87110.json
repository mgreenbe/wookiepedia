Shortly after the Battle of Endor, he was in command of the Victory-class Star Destroyer Harrow. Sate Pestage dispatched him to recover the stockhouse of Eidolon Base for him on Tatooine, offering Semtin a percentage of its armaments in return. This assignment brought him into conflict with Rogue Squadron. As the Rogues and their allies attacked the base, Semtin tried to kill Firith Olan but was intercepted by Sixtus Quin. Quin killed him while he was trying to escape, the Imperial Agent having become disillusioned with his commander after being left behind during a mission to Ryloth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
