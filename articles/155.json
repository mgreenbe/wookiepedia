The malfunction of an environmental control unit released toxic gas into the area; it was not detected until the worker shift change. The gas killed five workers and incapacitated ten more. Medical staff expressed concern that later effects could still manifest themselves, and reported to security that they were doubtful that the gas could have been generated randomly by the malfunction of the control unit.
