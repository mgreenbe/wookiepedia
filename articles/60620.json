Although the heist was successful, the rebels' astromech droid, Chopper, was accidentally left behind at the depot during the raid: left to guard the starship Ghost while the others stole the fuel, he saw a droid leg that matched one of his mismatched legs for sale at a nearby stall, and was haggling with the Ugnaught vendor when the others made their escape. Chopper subsequently stole the leg and escaped Horizon Base on an Imperial freighter, where he befriended and freed Imperial protocol droid AP-5."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the loss of their command ship Phoenix Home in an Imperial attack, the rebel group Phoenix Cell had begun a search for a location in which to set up a proper base.
