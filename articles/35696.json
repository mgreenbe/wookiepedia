It was the social center of the small village, a wooden structure that served both food and drinks. By 3 ABY, Daz, a Human male, owned and operated the tavern. Linia, his daughter, also worked there. Anna and Jani both served as cooks at the eatery. Veeter, a depressed Squib, was a regular customer at the tavern, constantly trying to dampen his sorrow of being stranded on the planet by drinking."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
