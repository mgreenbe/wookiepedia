However, they spoke Basic slowly enough to irritate non-Kitonaks when speaking with them. As they were polite beings, they usually decided to speak to aliens only when they were directly addressed or when they felt they had something important to say. This, however, did not solve the problems of other beings when talking with Kitonaks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
