Skakoans wore a special suit to prevent this, as they were unable to survive in most environments. If this suit was ruptured, the Skakoan in question would instantly die."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Explosive decompression also occurred to starships traveling through hyperspace. The physics in hyperspace were unpredictable, and whereas a ship's hull typically exploded outward, a breached part of a ship could simply leave it in a seismic tug, eventually exiting hyperspace and reverting to realspace. When the Harbinger collided with the Omen just as the latter entered hyperspace in 5000 BBY, the Omen's armory and a part of its quarterdeck was torn away from the Sith dreadnaught by a seismic tug."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
