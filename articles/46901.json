He was an outspoken opponent of the centralization of power experienced by the Republic during Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's time in office and became involved with a secret organization of Loyalists known as the Republic Group. Zar was a key member in the group's plan to \"restore honor to the Republic\" by revealing the Insignia of Unity; however, intervention by the Senate Bureau of Intelligence left the plan in obscurity for decades. His opposition to Palpatine eventually led him to become a member of the Delegation of 2000, a group of Senators and representatives who disapproved of the sweeping amendments made to the Galactic Constitution over the course of the Clone Wars. Shortly after the Battle of Coruscant, Zar accompanied other members of the Delegation to present the Petition of 2000 to Palpatine in the hope that the Supreme Chancellor would begin to relinquish some of the powers granted to him by the constitutional amendments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Delegation's plea fell on deaf ears, and Palpatine seized absolute power, transforming the Republic into the Galactic Empire at the close of the Clone Wars. The new Galactic Emperor targeted members of the Delegation of 2000 as traitors to the Empire, and Zar was detained for a time by the Imperial Security Bureau. Upon release, he was ordered to remain on Coruscant; however, the Sern Prime native abandoned his post as Senator and fled to Alderaan. There, Zar was granted political asylum by Bail Prestor Organa, a founding member of the Delegation of 2000. After residing in the Aldera Royal Palace for several weeks in 18 BBY, Zar's flight from Coruscant was revealed to the Emperor, who dispatched Darth Vader to retrieve the former Senator and return him to the Imperial Security Bureau. Not wanting to involve Organa in his troubles with the Bureau, Zar contacted a crime lord on Murkhana to obtain passage from Alderaan to Sern Prime. The crew of the freighter Drunk Dancer undertook the mission to transport Zar and was successful in recovering the former Senator from the Royal Palace. However, before he boarded the Drunk Dancer and departed Alderaan, Zar was attacked by Darth Vader, who threw his lightsaber at the Senator. The blade cut through Zar's chest, resulting in his death shortly thereafter on the Drunk Dancer's operating table."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars and a dying Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human male Fang Zar hailed from Sern Prime, a world in the Sern sector of the Colonies region. Zar owned estates on his homeworld, as well as Ghorman and Coruscant, all three of which he frequented. He was eventually elected to represent the Sern sector in the Galactic Senate during the waning years of the Old Republic. In his time in office, he gained a reputation as a staunch defender of civil liberties and a strong critic of the sweeping amendments made to the Galactic Constitution during the reign of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. The Chancellor's aides quickly identified Zar as an obstacle to be removed; however, Zar's colleagues in the Senate held him in high regard. At some point during his career, the Senator became a member of the clandestine Republic Group, which sought to limit Palpatine's growing control over the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Zar became a close ally of several like-minded Senators, including Bail Organa of Alderaan and Mon Mothma of Chandrila. Zar was also as a good friend of Corellian Senator Garm Bel Iblis, who was absent from the Senate during the early stages of the Clone Wars as a result of his enactment of Contemplanys Hermi, which closed the Corellian system off from the Republic. Shortly after the Battle of Duro, the Corellian government decided to once again retreat from the Republic's forefront and defend its own borders, a decision Zar supported due to his friendship with Iblis. By 19 BBY, the Senator of the Sern sector had been appointed to the Loyalist Committee, an advisory council of Senators formed by Chancellor Palpatine several years prior. At that time during the conflict, the Committee consisted primarily of Senators who opposed the Chancellor's methods of waging the war as well as the Senate's continuing compliance with his wishes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Outer Rim Sieges, Zar and several of these Senators organized a meeting with the Supreme Chancellor in order to bring their concerns before him. Sate Pestage, a close advisor to the Chancellor, attempted to delay and derail their meeting; however, the Senators proved persistent and refused to leave Palpatine's office until they were granted an audience with the Chancellor. Meeting with Palpatine, Zar and his allies pressed Palpatine to rescind several measures outlined in the Enhanced Security and Enforcement Act that had been passed by the Senate earlier in the war. They claimed that the removal of Confederate forces from the Core Worlds and Inner Rim Territories negated the necessity of such decrees. The discussion moved to the Senators' desire to see a peaceful end to the war, and at this point, Zar suggested that the Republic cede embattled Outer Rim worlds to the Confederacy, as Core and Inner Rim trade had been restabilized since the start of the war. Intent on continuing the war until the Confederacy issued an unconditional surrender, Palpatine dismissed both the Senators' and Zar's proposal."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Plans with the Republic Group"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, Zar and his confidants in the Republic Group, including Senators Largetto and Des'sein and Jedi Master J'oopi Sh\u00e9, decided that the Republic was headed down a dark path caused by Palpatine's growing and unchecked power. Over a decade earlier, the Republic Group had stolen the Insignia of Unity, the symbol of the Republic, from the Senate Rotunda while it underwent heavy renovations. The group planned to re-reveal the Insignia of Unity to the Senate, hoping it would serve as a reminder to those who had fallen under the Chancellor's sway that their duty was to the Constitution and the people of the Republic, not its leader. While Zar and the other members of the group awaited the arrival of information on the Insignia's whereabouts, the Confederate Supreme Commander General Grievous launched a surprise invasion of Coruscant. During the fighting, Grievous himself abducted Palpatine from Coruscant and attempted to flee the Republic's capital with his hostage. A successful rescue attempt was mounted by Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, during which the Confederate Head of State Count Dooku was killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time Palpatine was returned to the Senate, the Republic Group's couriers, Tobb Jadak and Reeze Duurmun, were able to make it to Coruscant's surface and rendezvous with Zar, Largetto, Des'sein, and Sh\u00e9 at the Republic Executive Building. Jadak and Duurmun arrived in the Stellar Envoy, a YT-1300 light freighter owned by the Group, and delivered a case containing recorded information on the Insignia. While Master Sh\u00e9 installed a transponder on the Stellar Envoy that would allow the ship to access the Insignia, which was hidden away on Tandun III, Zar explained to Jadak and Duurmun that their next mission was to deliver the Envoy to an Antarian Ranger known as Folee on Toprawa. Folee was then to retrieve the Insignia of Unity and return it to the Republic Group on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Zar and the Republic Group's plan never came to fruition. Armand Isard, the Director of the Senate Bureau of Intelligence and an ally of Palpatine's, was informed by a member of his staff of the group's meeting and dispatched a contingent of clone shock troopers to interrupt the proceedings. Zar and the other Senators were taken to safety by Master Sh\u00e9 before the trooper's arrival, but Jadak and Duurmun were chased off planet by clone forces. The two made a desperate hyperspace jump to Nar Shaddaa, where they collided with a bulk freighter and were believed to have been killed. In reality, only Duurmun was killed, while Jadak entered into a decades-long coma. The Stellar Envoy, which was believed to have been destroyed, was instead reclaimed and repaired by mechanic Bammy Decree who then gave it to Nar Shaddaa criminal Rej Taunt. The Republic Group's plan to reveal the Insignia of Unity to the galaxy thus went unheard of for over half a century."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Petition of 2000"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the immediate wake of the invasion of Coruscant, the governmental infrastructure of the Republic underwent radical changes. The day after the invasion, the Senate held a vote on an amendment to the Security Act, which passed by a wide margin. The amendment transferred command of the Jedi High Council from the Senate to the office of the Supreme Chancellor and removed congressional oversight of the Republic's military. The following day, Palpatine issued the Sector Governance Decree, a proclamation that installed Regional Governors to oversee sectors within the Republic. To Zar and his allies, these developments meant the end of the Senate and the Republic's democracy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hoping to create a cohesive opposition to Palpatine, Senators Organa and Mothma organized a meeting between themselves and other Senators that they believed they could trust. Zar was invited to the meeting in Organa's offices alongside Senator Giddean Danu of Kuat, Senator Terr Taneel of Neelanon, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo. Organa and Mothma expressed their concerns about the path the Supreme Chancellor was leading the Republic down and began to hint at actions they were prepared to take. Zar and Amidala were wary of these \"actions,\" but nevertheless agreed to keep the meeting confidential. Following the discussion, Organa and Mothma drafted a petition that called for Palpatine to begin relinquishing his emergency powers, as the end of the war appeared to be drawing near with the death of Count Dooku. Zar signed the petition alongside 2,000 other Senators and Senatorial delegates. The signatories, who became known as the Delegation of 2000, met in Padm\u00e9 Amidala's apartment to discuss bringing the Petition before Palpatine. During the meeting, Zar expressed his belief that the existence of the petition alone might pressure Palpatine to moderate his policies, and that involving the Jedi Order in the Delegation's struggle was premature, contrary to Senator Amidala's claims."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Delegation resolved to present the petition to the Supreme Chancellor and voice their concerns on the Sector Governance Decree. Zar accompanied Amidala, Mal\u00e9-Dee, Nee Alavar, and Meena Tills to a meeting with Palpatine in his Executive Office, where the Chancellor was once again dismissive of their concerns. However, Palpatine was now flanked by Anakin Skywalker, whose presence overshadowed the original intent of the conference. Skywalker noted to himself that Zar seemed to be hiding something and that he was the only Senator present who was capable of becoming a threat to Palpatine's regime. Zar attempted to push Palpatine on the pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the war, but was quickly cut off by the Chancellor and excused from his offices."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial justice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Only days after Zar's meeting with the Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine called an Extraordinary Session of the Senate that every delegate was obligated to attend. During the session, Palpatine declared the Clone Wars over and issued the Declaration of a New Order, proclaiming himself the new Galactic Emperor and transforming the Republic into the Galactic Empire. Palpatine framed the Jedi for planning a rebellion to overthrow the Senate and accused members of the Delegation of 2000 of plotting alongside the Order. Shortly after the birth of the Empire, Zar was one of sixty-three Senators from the Delegation that were arrested by the newly formed Imperial Intelligence agency. He was held in custody on Coruscant, where he was interrogated by the Imperial Security Bureau on the members and activities of the Delegation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zar, now no longer a sitting Senator, was eventually released from custody but ordered by the ISB to remain on Coruscant. He instead fled the Imperial capital and sought refuge on Alderaan. Bail Organa, unaware that Zar had illegally left Coruscant, allowed the former Senator to stay in Aldera Palace for several weeks. In 18 BBY, a conflict on Sern Prime that was preventing Zar from returning to his homeworld ended, prompting him to contact the crime lord Cash Garrulan on Murkhana. Zar intended to return to Sern Prime, but he wished to keep Senator Organa oblivious of his fugitive status so as not to implicate his friend in any criminal activities. To that end, Garrulan contacted the crew of the freighter Drunk Dancer to discreetly smuggle Zar off Alderaan. While the smugglers planned to spirit Zar away, Palpatine was informed of the former Senator's flight from Coruscant by Mas Amedda. The Emperor ordered Sate Pestage and his new second-in-command\u2014Darth Vader, formerly Anakin Skywalker\u2014to travel to Organa's palace on Alderaan and retrieve the fugitive Zar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zar planned to have the Drunk Dancer arrive in Aldera on the day that large anti-Imperial protests were occurring outside the palace. While members of the smuggling ship's crew searched the palace for their charge, Darth Vader arrived and was greeted by Bail Organa. Organa and Vader, both unaware of Zar's plan to escape Alderaan, waited while the former Senator was summoned. This allowed Zar time to reach the palace's south gate, where he was originally to be picked up by the Drunk Dancer. However, as the protests outside the south gate became increasingly violent, he was forced to divert to the east gate. The change in plan cost the Senator time and confused the Drunk Dancer's crew, Skeck Draggle, Archyr Beil, and Roan Shryne. After the three encountered Queen Breha Organa, the palace's alarm was activated, alerting Vader to the presence of the smugglers and Zar's attempt at escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Zar raced from the south gate toward the Drunk Dancer parked on a HoloNet correspondent's platform, Vader located him and the three smugglers attempting to catch up with him. Zar and the smugglers reached the loading ramp of the Drunk Dancer, where they were greeted by Captain Jula Shryne. Vader knew he would be unable to reach the vessel before Zar and the crew boarded and threw his lightsaber toward them with the Force. The blade cut through Zar's upper chest and came close to decapitating him before swinging around once again to burn Jula Shryne across the back. Roan Shryne aided the mortally wounded Zar onto the Drunk Dancer, which quickly fled Alderaan. En route to Sern Prime, a 2-1B medical droid began surgery in an attempt to save the former Senator's life. The damage to major blood vessels inflicted by Vader's lightsaber was too extensive to repair, and Zar died on the operating table."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zar's death had several severe repercussions for those who opposed Palpatine's rule. The crew of the Drunk Dancer fled to Kashyyyk, where they hoped to find Jedi survivors of Palpatine's Order 66. Having confronted Roan Shryne on Alderaan during the fight over Zar, Vader followed the Drunk Dancer to Kashyyyk and laid siege to the planet, burning the forests and enslaving much of the Wookiee population. On Sern Prime, the president-elect threatened to recall the planet's delegation from the Senate in anger over the death of its Senator. Vader was troubled by the events on Alderaan, and his handling of the situation led him into an argument with his Master, Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor, however, was pleased with the outcome. The Senate believed that Zar had committed sedition on Coruscant and had fled to Alderaan to inspire rebellion against the Empire. His death served as a reminder to other Senators that dissent would not be tolerated in the New Order and that the power lay with the Emperor. Bail Organa remained silent about the events that transpired within his palace, hoping his complicity would lure Palpatine into trusting him. Mon Mothma disagreed with Organa's actions, however, believing that Zar's death could be a lightning rod to gather those who would openly challenge Palpatine. Zar's death instead resulted in over half of the Delegation of 2000 rescinding the demands made in the petition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fang Zar was replaced in the Imperial Senate by Gebnerret Vibrion, a Ghorman native. In 43 ABY, Zar and the Republic Group's plans to discredit Palpatine were rediscovered by Han, Leia, and Allana Solo during their investigations into the history of their ship, the Stellar Envoy, now known as the Millennium Falcon. The Solos eventually united with Tobb Jadak to seek out the Insignia of Unity and together the four were led by the Millennium Falcon to Tandun III. There, they discovered that the Insignia that Zar had believed to be authentic was in fact counterfeit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fang Zar was a firm believer in a decentralized government and strong civil liberties. He commanded great respect among his colleagues as a result of his unwavering idealism and straightforward discourse. However, Palpatine's aides and allies kept close watch on the aged Senator. While in office, Zar became close to several other delegates who shared his political philosophy. His views were so similar to those of Garm Bel Iblis that the two Senators could have been one and the same. Fang Zar's outspoken and defiant nature led him to join the Republic Group and the Delegation of 2000, both of which aimed to limit the growing power that Palpatine was gathering in the Republic's executive branch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the last days of the Clone Wars, Zar focused on bringing the conflict to a peaceful resolution, pushing for the Republic to open negotiations with Count Dooku's Confederacy. Zar was willing to recognize the Confederacy as a legitimate government and even surrender several Outer Rim worlds to the Separatists. Although tireless in his efforts against the Chancellor, the Sern Prime native was cautious when he was approached by Bail Organa and Mon Mothma on taking \"actions\" against Palpatine.

The now-former Senator fled to Alderaan, but was unwilling to involve Bail Organa in his legal troubles. In an effort to maintain Organa's innocence, Zar kept both his fugitive status and his plans to escape Alderaan from the Senator. Following his death, Zar, who was once considered to be a noble and incorruptible representative of the opposition, was lambasted in the Imperial Senate as a traitor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zar's demeanor and personal appearance gave him a gruff exterior.

Zar was intended to appear in Revenge of the Sith as one of the Senators who laid the groundwork for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, but the scenes he appeared in were cut from the final film.
