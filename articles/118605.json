As various planets, sectors and star systems seceded to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, many pro-Republic citizens rallied to the newly-created Commission for the Protection of the Republic (COMPOR). A political movement dedicated to the preservation of the Republic, one of COMPOR's main objectives was to ensure its own future by recruiting younger generations into the organization's growing ranks. To that end, the Sub-Adult Group (SAGroup) was created as a sub-division of COMPOR."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the SAGroup was controversially\u2014much like the rest of COMPOR\u2014composed of a super majority of Human-born citizens. On Coruscant, the galactic capital, a youth rally was held at the Monument Plaza of Galactic City and broadcast by HoloNet News. While the rally itself was met with approval, critics disapproved of what they saw as Humanocentrism within the SAGroup. With roughly six thousand members in attendance, more than 95% were Human while the remainder were of near-Human descent. Crueya Vandron, a spokesperson for COMPOR, dismissed the media's criticism and stated that the organization was in the process of reviewing applications from non-Humans, although none had yet to be admitted. During the rally, SAGroup brigadier Nenevanth Tion\u2014flanked by two clone troopers\u2014gave a speech that praised Supreme Chancellor Palpatine for his efforts to defend the Republic against the Separatist rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY not only signaled the Separatists' defeat, but also marked the Republic's transition into the Galactic Empire. Soon after the newly-anointed Emperor Palpatine established his reign over the galaxy, the Commission for the Protection of the Republic was renamed as the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order (COMPNOR). The SAGroup remained intact, but would serve in a new capacity as a tool for indoctrinating the core tenets of the New Order into young Imperial citizens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SAGroup was possibly intended to reference the Hitler Youth or perhaps the Junior Anti-Sex League, from George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.
