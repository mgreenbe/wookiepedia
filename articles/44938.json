Daiman corresponded with Vilia by hologram while on the bridge of the ship. During the ensuing fighting, the Helm drove several of Daiman's crew into a homicidal frenzy and the Sith Lord was forced to fight back with Force lightning."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Era Daimanos first appeared in John Jackson Miller's stand-alone novel Star Wars: Knight Errant which first debuted on January 22, 2011.
