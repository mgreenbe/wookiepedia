That said, he did seem to have shown a high degree of tactical ability, destroying the planet's garrison by engaging it with an advance force before landing the main body of his troops behind them, catching them between his two contingents and almost completely wiping them out. He showed somewhat less finesse in dealing with a force of Sons and Daughters of Freedom, overrunning their position through sheer weight of numbers, though it should be noted that he was directly ordered to do so by Dooku\u2014an order which he protested against at the time. Although this attack caused his forces to take severe casualties, he was nevertheless able to effectively face the clone trooper counterattack, using a mobile reserve of tank droids and underground bunkers to shield his droids from artillery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite all his careful planning, Pors Tonith's one fatal mistake was having the hostages close to the command center.
