During the Clone Wars, it was hired to the Liana Liberators, who were posing as members of the Alderaanian Biological Research Institute and planned to slice into important computer systems in the Cularin system from it. However, it was attacked by mynocks, although the CST safety ship Starchaser IV was able to rescue it.
