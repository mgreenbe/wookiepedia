It became a tributary state of the Galactic Empire during the reign of Emperor Palpatine. Claiming the planet Shu-Torun as its domain, the kingdom was ruled by a hereditary monarchy, although the ore-dukes possessed considerable wealth and influence. Therefore, peace and stability on Shu-Torun depended on the throne's ability to maintain the allegiance of the nobility. A chancellor was appointed to run the day-to-day affairs of government on behalf of the Monarch of Shu-Torun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shu-Torun's volcanic environment granted the kingdom an abundance of natural resources, making it valuable to the galaxy's economy, and therefore, the Empire. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Shu-Torun maintained a degree of autonomy so long as its people paid their ore quotas to the Empire. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, the king conspired to assassinate the Emperor's right hand, Darth Vader, in an attempt to liberate the Shu-Torun homeworld from Imperial rule. The plot was foiled by the Sith Lord, who killed the conspirators save one: Princess Trios, the king's youngest heir and sole surviving member of the royal family. With the deaths of her father and siblings, Prince Monthan and Princess Hollian, Trios was crowned by Vader as the new Queen of Shu-Torun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Protectorate of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Age of the Empire, the Galactic Empire controlled the planet and its people through the monarchy of Shu-Torun.

Facing pressure from the ore-dukes, the king conspired to assassinate Emperor Palpatine's emissary, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, but was killed by Vader's assassin droids instead. As a result, the crown passed to his sole-surviving heir, Princess Trios, whom Vader spared so that she may serve the Empire's interests as a vassal queen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader then handed her a package he had with him the whole time. Inside there was only a chunk of rock, which Vader explained was a piece of the planet Alderaan after its destruction by the Death Star due to its lack of loyalty to the Emperor. The queen said the ore-dukes would still resist her and the Empire, but Vader stated that she would put down any rebellion with aid from the Imperial Military and said that she and her people served the Empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "War on Shu-Torun"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Empire had Shu-Torun's full support following the coronation of Trios, the recently appointed sovereign faced a rebellion of disaffected ore-dukes led by Duke Rubix against her reign. Upon the growing situation, Palpatine sent Vader to lead military intervention to back the War-Faith in the face of the insurrection with the aid of Grand General Cassio Tagge. Trios decided to be on the frontlines herself alongside Vader, as otherwise her people would lose respect for her. During one attack, she declared that their foe was too strong and demanded a retreat. Lord Vader, however, refused as the battle was only a distraction to allow Tulon Voidgazer to destroy the ancient citadel. Trios would later ask Vader to treat her with respect in front of her subjects, fearing that she would have little power after the Imperials left. Vader stated that he would be respectful in front of her subjects as long as she never questioned him in public, which she agreed to and left."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trios and Vader sent a holographic to the ore-barons demanding their surrender, Trios then moved to the ancestral retreat of the Shu-Torun royalty. The retreat was then attacked by Rubix Lava Leviathan which had been sent to kill Trios. The queen would then flee in a shuttle with Vader as well as Morit Astarte and Aiolin Astarte. They then repositioned the shuttle above the Leviathan and dropped down onto it and entered the vessel where they battled through Rubix's soldiers onboard and destroyed his vessel, leaving it to sink into the magma below.

However with the return of her Imperials returned and Trios knew that she had won the day, Vader forced Rubix to surrender immediately upon his arrival at the citadel. The duke declared he would recognize her rule. When she reached the traitor, he began to give a speech about his failure, but tired of hearing the baron speak, Trios ordered his immediate execution for the thousands of deaths he had caused, ending the war. The Empire then withdrew from Shu-Torun after the war, Trios had promised Vader that none of the barons involved in the war would survive her wrath, but that their family lines would continue to keep things in order.

The exploratory force then dropped crystal resonators onto the surface and detected a large concentration of kyber crystals in what had once been the Catacombs of Cadera to which the former leader of the Partisans Saw Gerrera, had stolen sizeable amount of crystals from the Empire and stored them there.
