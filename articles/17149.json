The array fired a blue lightning-like blast that was capable of piercing conventional shields in a manner similar to ion cannons. However, it required a large amount of power and as a result, shield strength would often suffer when the weapon fired. The weapon was mounted on their Qektoth attack cruisers, and was the cruiser's main weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
