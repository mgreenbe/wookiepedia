It was hired out its services to all legal organizations seeking military forces for legal activities. The guild employed no less than 1% of the native population of Coyn, generating a considerable portion of the planetary income. The Guild would hire out soldiers to serve legal government entities such as the Galactic Empire, but would not hire out soldiers to the Alliance to Restore the Republic. However, once the Alliance transitioned to the New Republic, the Guild made it services available to the new galactic government. The guild had offices located in the Elrood Bazaar, Torina, Derilyn, and Lanthrym."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
