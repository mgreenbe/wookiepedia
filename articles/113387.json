Reginard Base was commanded by General Halomar Corros and populated by Humans and a Mon Calamari. The base was in a cliff on an island in the sea, on the opposite side of the planet from the main continent. When the Rebel base set up a passive sensor array on the main continent, it activated a hidden beacon which identified itself as a Stellar Class spaceport. This caused Hawker Bryce-Kelley, traveling in his ship Queen's Victory, to come to the planet as he was fleeing Imperial Customs Frigate 517. A group of Rebels managed to convince the Imperial ship that they had not seen the ship, however, and it soon left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
