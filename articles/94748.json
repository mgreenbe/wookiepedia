Bravo Twelve and Bravo Eight were among the forces stationed there. After his return to Naboo, Bravo Squadron pilot Rhys Dallows agreed to transport captured munitions to the base. When he arrived at the canyon, his escorts were not there, so he led Reti, carrying the munitions in his starship Zoomer, into the canyon. They found the escorts in a dogfight with Scarab starfighters. Together they finished off the Scarabs and continued onto the base, which had fallen under attack by a large force of Trade Federation Multi-Troop Transports and Armored Assault Tanks. The resistance fighters destroyed the Droid Army forces and saved the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The resistance base appears in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Starfighter.
