Two-tone in color, the embroidered exterior was gold in color, with its interior a red, matching the color scheme of his golden robe and belt. In 34 ABY, the disfigured dark side wielder wore his slippers as he sat on his throne, located within his personal flagship. During this time, he was often visited by First Order General Armitage Hux, his apprentice Kylo Ren, and, before his death, the Jedi trainee Rey. It was Ren who was responsible for Snoke's death, slicing him in half from afar, using the Force to manipulate Rey's lightsaber, which sat beside Snoke's person. With Snoke's body split in two, his slippers remained on his feet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Disfigured and in pain, the dark side wielder Snoke designed the slippers to maximize his comfort.

Following the siege of D'Qar, which saw the destruction of the First Order's Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought, the Fulminatrix, Snoke summoned General Armitage Hux, the officer responsible for the dreadnought's demise, to his throne in order to be reprimanded. Though Hux positively convinced Snoke that the First Order had the Resistance \"hanging by a thread,\" Snoke was not amused when his conflicted apprentice, Kylo Ren, appeared before Snoke, Hux, and the slippers. With Hux dismissed, Snoke started to discipline his apprentice, subsequently rising from his throne and limping his way to Ren. Sometime after his scolding, Ren returned to the throne room with Rey, a gifted Jedi trainee, by his side. With her prized lightsaber in Ren's possession, a seated Snoke retrieved the item via the Force, placing it beside his person."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Realizing her powers, Snoke began to toy with Rey, often utilizing the Force to attack or otherwise move her at his discretion. At the height of their confrontation, Snoke Force pushed Rey to an armed Ren, exulting at the resolve he now sensed in his oft-conflicted apprentice. He ordered Ren to \"fulfill his destiny\" by murdering Rey, having promised to kill the former scavenger with the cruelest stroke, but Ren had other plans. Using the Force to blindside his master, Ren managed to kill Snoke, whose visions and Force senses failed him, by cutting him in half with Rey's lightsaber. With his body split in two, Snoke's torso fell over his legs and the slippers. Upon investigating the throne room's damage following a skirmish between Ren, Rey, and Snoke's Elite Praetorian Guards, Hux saw Snoke's separated body.
