During the height of Pelagon's power, over twenty of the artificial platforms existed, each sprawling for dozens of kilometers. All but two of the platforms were destroyed when the Galactic Empire and House Mecetti assaulted the planet. Around the time of the Battle of Hoth, six platforms were in operation, having been rebuilt from scavenged parts. Pelagon's capital, Pelagar, was the largest platform reaching over twenty kilometers in diameter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
