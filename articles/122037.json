It consisted of a durasteel neck restraint and a heavy chain. They incorporated a pair of shock panels in order to better control unruly captives. If the collar was damaged or an attempt was made to remove it, it would inflict painful neural shocks and usually knock the victim unconscious. They could be attached to other collars or a pair of stun cuffs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jabba Desilijic Tiure was fond of using these to keep his slave girls within easy reach.
