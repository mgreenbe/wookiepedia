It had half-standard gravity. It was covered in brown-and-red desert, high mountains, foothills, and craters. Local bandits made their base out of a damaged Super Transport VI, which was also named Blood Nest. The bandits were defeated by Wraith Squadron, although Jesmin Ackbar was shot down and killed in the conflict, and her astromech droid, Shiner was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
