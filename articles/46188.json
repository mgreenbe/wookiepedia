At some point during a civil war between members of the Croke species, the Croke introduced the invasive Lugubraa species as soldiers in the Croke Reach. The plans of the Croke backfired, however, when the Lugubraa began to overrun Croke settlements and strip them of all resources. Eventually, Explume Minor was also lost to the Lugubraa, and Shell Conjurer Firtha ordered the cloaking and evacuation of Croke nestlings in a final transmission from the celestial body."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Explume Minor was introduced in the 2010 sourcebook The Unknown Regions, published by Wizards of the Coast for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
