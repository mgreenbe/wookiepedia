Like her husband, she was part owner of Pryce Mining but by the time of the doonium vein discovery, her daughter was running the company. After the loss of the family mine to the Empire, Elainye and Talmoor were relocated to Batonn. They lived there for the next few years and were present at the Batonn insurgency. Elainye and Talmoor survived due to the intervention of their daughter Pryce, whose actions caused many deaths during the Siege of the Creekpath Mining and Refining complex."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime prior to the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Elainye met and married Talmoor Pryce on the planet Lothal. She began working for his family mine, and eventually gave birth to their only daughter, Arihnda. By the time a doonium vein was discovered in their mine, she and Talmoor had taken a less active role in running the mine, allowing Arihnda to handle executive decisions."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Accusation of Embezzlement"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once Governor Ryder Azadi and his representative at Pryce Mining Arik Uvis learned of the doonium vein Arihnda had discovered in the mine, they approached Arihnda with an offer to buy a controlling interest in Pryce Mining in exchange for their protection from the Empire and mega corporations. Arihnda, refusing to give in to Azadi and Uvis' fear tactics, rejected the offer, leaving both Azadi and Uvis incensed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In an act of retribution, Azadi and Uvis falsified embezzlement charges and Elainye was promptly arrested. She was held in prison without bail while Arihnda went to Senator Domus Renking to plead Elainye's case. Renking informed Arihnda that he could not simply release Elainye until she was proven undoubtedly innocent, mentioning that Elainye's next mining job may well be on Kessel. As a solution, Renking suggested that Arihnda sell the mine to the Empire in exchange for Elainye's freedom, a job for Elainye and Talmoor on Batonn, and a job for Arihnda on Coruscant. She took the deal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elainye was later released and cleared of charges when Arihnda took Renking's deal, and she and Talmoor were relocated to Creekpath Mining and Refining complex on Batonn to serve as an assistant manager and foreman respectively.

Both Elainye and Talmoor agreed with the rebels about the state of Batonn's government, Governor Restos and the Empire as a whole, but refused to join the rebels in their stronghold. They insisted that while they agreed with the rebels, they were not rebels themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elainye greeted Arihnda and ISB Agent Gudry at the door the day of the Battle of Batonn, welcoming them into her home. Unbeknownst to her, Arihnda stole her comm.

She didn't have much time to be surprised, however, as Arihnda quickly demanded that both she and Talmoor pack their belongings to evacuate Creekpath before the battle began. Elainye was hesitant to evacuate, not wanting to abandon her friends and neighbors, but Talmoor convinced her to do as Arihnda said."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elainye and Talmoor began to pack, prioritizing datacards filled with memories from Arihnda's childhood. Elainye witnessed Arihnda's murder of Gudry from the stairs as she was attempting to pack a multicolored crystal that held sentimental value to her. Elainye was surprised by the murder she witnessed but it didn't change her opinion of Arihnda, as she quickly resumed packing after making sure her daughter didn't need first aid after her fight with Gudry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once she was packed, Elainye accompanied Arihnda and Talmoor away from the Creekpath mine. She was distracted by the explosion of a nearby bulldozer when Arihnda executed the guard blocking their path out of the shield generator, and bought Arihnda's lie that the guard had been killed by shrapnel from the explosion. Elainye wanted to temporarily stop running to help the guard, but Arihnda told her there was no time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moments later, Elainye, Talmoor, and Arihnda were stopped by two Imperial Navy Troopers who informed them that ISB Colonel Wullf Yularen had sent a team to find Arihnda and Gudry in the Pryce family home.

Elainye was horrified by the explosion, never knowing that it was her daughter who had triggered it. Following her daughter's orders, Elainye boarded a shuttle to Paeragosto City and then took the Duggenhei to the Governor's Mansion on Lothal. She and Talmoor remained there until Arihnda had time to visit them to plan their futures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elainye Pryce was a human woman.
