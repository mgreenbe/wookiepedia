Orbited by at least fifteen moons, including the moon of Quantxi, Ord Mantell was 14,050 kilometers in diameter and served as the sector capital for the Mid Rim's Bright Jewel sector, which in turn was the capital for the Bright Jewel Oversector. In close proximity to the gas giant Wynkahthu, Ord Mantell was situated in the northern New Territories portion of the Mid Rim, lying on a cross-section between the Bright Jewel, Qiilura and Dohu sectors along the Celanon Spur, Burke's Trailing and Entralla hyperspace routes.

On the surface, every landmass on Ord Mantell was dotted with mountain chains, but its population of four billion lived on its arid equatorial continents amid the foothills of its mountains and plains.

At the time, Ord Mantell was isolated in what was known as the Wild Space of the northern quadrant, and was only accessible through an intricate network of frontier hyperspace routes. As the Republic expanded its territory, Ord Mantell lost strategic significance, but the presence of a fully equipped military shipyard and drydocks encouraged a thriving civilian cargo trade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After 3700 BBY, Ord Mantell became notable as a trading post for spacers who ventured west off the Hydian Way super-hyperroute. The planet also became a port for less salubrious visitors, such as smugglers, tax-evaders and Black marketeers. Together with support from the independent spirit of Corellians, criminal groups sowed the seeds of a lawless world that lingered on in the planet's culture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime before the outbreak of the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Republic attempted to create several other trade hubs across the galaxy, in hopes of rivaling Ord Mantell's success as a trading port.

Of the planet's casinos, the most popular was Lady Fate Casino, however, more professional gamblers were found in the side streets and alley casinos such as the Chance Cube, Throw Me a Bone, or the Lucky Detooa's in the city of Savroia.
