In the throne room of the palace, KRONOS delivered his report to the Hutt crime lord and asked for a second chance, believing that he could easily complete the assignment if given another opportunity. Ziro expressed his displeasure in his most trusted assassin, and seeing KRONOS as useless, the Hutt activated a secret control that neutralized his weapons and ordered that the droid be used for spare parts.
