Petitioning both the ancient spirit of the dead Sith Lord Freedon Nadd and the power of her living husband, Amanoa enveloped both the Jedi and the Beast Riders of Onderon in waves of utter darkness. Immediately the affected were weighed down by the dark side, experiencing feelings of total confusion and despair. Ulic Qel-Droma and the other Jedi were crushed by a great sense of oppression and fear, so strong it nearly snuffed out their own connections to the Force. It was not until the arrival of Jedi Master Arca Jeth that the power of Nadd's influence was lifted. Through Jeth's battle meditation, the Jedi's resolve was renewed along with the Beast Riders, who eventually overcame the dark-side warriors of Iziz. Afterward, when Master Jeth stormed the hidden Tomb of Freedon Nadd with Jedi and Beast Riders in tow, they found Amanoa there, drawing fully on the source of her power. However, in Jeth's presence the darkness could no longer endure; Amanoa's power waned as Freedon Nadd's influence was driven out by the light of the Jedi. In her daughter's arms, the Queen of Onderon joined her evil ancestors in death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
