It was a variant of the T-65 X-wing starfighter. Both this model and the T-65B were the primary X-wings of the Rebellion. However, the C-A2 model was rare due to the T-65's difficult construction. New X-wings were always a rare sight during the Galactic Civil War. It was seen in use before the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
