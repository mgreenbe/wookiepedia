Majestic-class heavy cruisers were incredibly durable; their thick armor and shields were equal to the previous generation of Imperial-class Star Destroyers. This armor and shield power gave them the ability to close with the enemy to exchange close-range fire. Like other New Class ships, the Majestic also boasts superior fire control systems compared to contemporary Imperial ships with heavy guns of the same power. With this ability, the Majestic can score as many hits at long range as an Imperial-class Star Destroyer can at medium ranges and can remain at that range as long as it has space to evade the Imperial ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These ships were equipped with Class 1 hyperdrives, capable of 90-second spin-up times. They carried a crew of 4,050; 640 troops; and enough consumables for 5 months of operation. The Majestic-class was also capable of carrying five squadrons of starfighters, often including X-wing and E-wing starfighters for screening and escort duties as well as K-wings for strike missions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following New Class practice, the basic hull design of the Majestic-class heavy cruiser was derived from that of the Defender-class assault carrier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The only official image of the Majestic-class heavy cruiser is found in the RPG sourcebook Cracken's Threat Dossier, but the image looks nothing like that of the Defender-class carrier, which is supposed to be built on the same hull, according to the Black Fleet Crisis novels, on which Cracken's Threat Dossier is based. Because of this, many fans believe that this picture cannot be an accurate representation of the ship.
