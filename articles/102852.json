Somewhat similar in appearance to the carrion spats of Corellia, the Painted Spat differed: The coloration of the skin was much darker with pronounced horizontal stripes along the back; the bony structure protruding from the mandible was not, from appearance, a true beak (the jaw did not resemble a beak at all, rather, resembling a reptilian jaw). At least three of these animals were seen roughly 3,500 meters from Nashal Starport. Their large 'beaks' were sometimes used as trophies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
