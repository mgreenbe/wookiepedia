Born to Domain Jamaane, he was marked from birth as a candidate for Supreme Overlord. Around 29 BBY, he fell under the sway of the former Shaper Onimi, who used his powers to take control of Shimrra. Under Onimi's direction, Shimrra overthrew Supreme Overlord Quoreal with the support of many warriors. He then announced the discovery of a new galaxy, and proclaimed that the Yuuzhan Vong were destined to conquer it, whereas Quoreal had made the decision to avoid the galaxy, due to the presence of the living planet Zonama Sekot, which he believed to be a portent of doom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 ABY, the Yuuzhan Vong launched their invasion of the galaxy, beginning the Yuuzhan Vong War. The Yuuzhan Vong made early gains and soon had the New Republic reeling. Three years into the war, Shimrra settled on Yuuzhan'tar, which would be his home for the rest of the war. He conducted meetings from his palace, directing the war and attempting to quash the Jeedai heresy. However, the war took a downward spiral after the Battle of Ebaq 9, and Shimrra grew increasingly unstable. In 29 ABY, Zonama Sekot\u2014purportedly a sign of doom\u2014appeared above Yuuzhan'tar, sparking riots and weakening Shimrra's already-declining power base. Soon after this, the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar commenced. Refusing to surrender Yuuzhan'tar to the Galactic Alliance, Shimrra set fire to large swaths of the planet. Shimrra was finally attacked in his citadel by a trio of Jedi led by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who dueled and finally killed the Supreme Overlord.

The Yuuzhan Vong were an extra-galactic species that had been traveling through the Intergalactic Void for millennia in hopes of finding a new galaxy, after destroying much of their home galaxy in an intra-species war. As the followers of a belief system known as the True Way, the Yuuzhan Vong were devoutly religious, and worshiped several gods, chief among them Yun-Yuuzhan, the creator god. Yuuzhan Vong society was divided into castes, consisting of the Supreme Overlord, warriors, intendants, priests, shapers, workers, and Shamed Ones. Because of their reliance on their gods, the Yuuzhan Vong placed a great deal of importance in their priests, and their god-king, the Supreme Overlord. Only the Supreme Overlord held a link to Yun-Yuuzhan, and all of the other Yuuzhan Vong were completely subordinate to the Supreme Overlord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shimrra had a twin brother; they were only the third set of twins in the species' history. In the previous two instances, one of the twins had killed the other, and then gone on to lead the Yuuzhan Vong during times of crisis. Because he was a twin, and of noble birth, Shimrra was placed into a small group of candidates for the position of Supreme Overlord. As a candidate for Supreme Overlord, Shimrra received many luxuries, and was trained in warfare and religion. Due to the work of Shapers, he grew to an extraordinary size. At the age of seven, Shimrra killed his brother to eliminate a possible rival for the throne, early on displaying aggressiveness and ruthlessness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After many hopeless years traveling through space, the Yuuzhan Vong discovered a galaxy, which they began scouting. In 32 BBY, Supreme Commander Zho Krazhmir, who had been dispatched to scout the galaxy by Supreme Overlord Quoreal, discovered the planet Zonama Sekot in the new galaxy. Zonama Sekot was a sentient planet, one with many similarities to the species' original homeworld, Yuuzhan'tar. Ancient legends told of a living planet that would bring about the doom of the Yuuzhan Vong, and so, when informed of this discovery in 29 BBY, Quoreal elected to keep traveling in hopes of finding another galaxy. This decision made him unpopular among the Yuuzhan Vong, particularly Domain Jamaane."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At this point, a disgraced former shaper named Onimi decided to act. Earlier, Onimi had learned that the eighth cortex\u2014the final level of Shaping protocols dispensed directly by the gods and available only to the Supreme Overlord\u2014was empty, contrary to what the species had been taught and believed. Upon discovering this, Onimi realized that the Yuuzhan Vong were doomed if they could not adapt. He attempted to graft yammosk tissue to his brain, but the experiment left him physically deformed, causing him to be marked as a Shamed One and stripped of his rank. However, it also opened him up to the Force, which the Yuuzhan Vong had been cut off from millennia ago. Onimi believed that after traveling through the void for thousands of years, the Yuuzhan Vong would wipe themselves out if they did not have an enemy to direct all their focus toward. Furthermore, he sought to take the place of the gods, and believed that by conquering a new home, the Yuuzhan Vong could ascend to the same level as the gods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using his powers, he bade Shimrra to take him as his familiar, and jester.

He then executed many of Quoreal's most ardent supporters, as well as the other candidates for the position of Supreme Overlord in an effort to consolidate his power. He also suppressed all knowledge of Zonama Sekot. Having done all this, the new Supreme Overlord announced to the rest of his people the discovery of a new galaxy that he claimed had been revealed to him in a dream from the gods. However, before the Yuuzhan Vong could take the galaxy for their own, they would have to defeat the countless beings already in the galaxy. The Yuuzhan Vong viewed them as infidels, as they did not worship the Yuuzhan Vong gods, and used machine technology, which was disdained by followers of the True Way. Thus, before the Yuuzhan Vong would be content to settle in the new galaxy, all infidels would have to be killed or converted, and their technology destroyed. Though not all members of the species supported Shimrra and his decisions, the dissidents were silent, as they knew that anyone who opposed Shimrra would be killed. Meanwhile, as Onimi's power grew, less and less of the Supreme Overlord's original personality remained, although the fact that Onimi was anything more than Shimrra's jester remained a secret known only by Onimi, the power behind the throne, and the true Supreme Overlord."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The invasion begins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After several decades of preparation, the Yuuzhan Vong launched their invasion of the galaxy in 25 ABY. The ensuing war began well, with the Yuuzhan Vong catching the New Republic completely off-guard. Reluctant to enter into all-out war, the New Republic concentrated on defending the major hyperlanes leading to the Core Worlds and the Colonies, while the Yuuzhan Vong made major advances in the war's first six months. Under the command of Warmaster Tsavong Lah, they captured a number of planets, such as Obroa-skai and Ord Mantell, surprising the citizens of the galaxy with their brutality. With the galaxy in turmoil, the Yuuzhan Vong would continue to make gains over the next two years.

In 27 ABY, Warmaster Lah enacted Battle Plan Coruscant, which focused on gaining control of Coruscant, the galactic capital. The Yuuzhan Vong were able to defeat the New Republic in the Battle of Coruscant, taking over the planet and leaving the New Republic reeling. The New Republic later attacked Obroa-skai, believing that Shimrra was visiting the planet.

Shortly after landing on the planet\u2014now renamed Yuuzhan'tar, after the Yuuzhan Vong's original homeworld\u2014Shimrra held a meeting in his throne room with the Elite, the leaders of the four main castes. There, he chastised Tsavong Lah for the heavy casualties the Yuuzhan Vong had suffered in taking Coruscant, as well as for failing to adapt to new techniques used by the New Republic. He also questioned Executor Nom Anor, who had served as an advance spy, about the government of the other beings of the galaxy, finding their tolerance and democracy to be a new\u2014and foolish\u2014concept. After finishing his interrogation of Anor, he began speaking to Master Shaper Ch'Gang Hool, who was directing the terraforming of the planet. The effort had been replete with failures, however, and when Hool confessed the fault, a furious Shimrra ordered him to be executed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after this meeting, Shimrra was present at a ceremony dedicating a temple to the creator god Yun-Yuuzhan. The Yuuzhan Vong planned to execute over a hundred captives from the Battle of Coruscant, many of them senators or military officers. However, before the ceremony could begin, the Square of Sacrifice was filled with waste that had, for some reason, been rejected by the maw luur, creatures that disposed of sewage. Angered, Shimrra declared the ritual null and void, and ordered the captives to be killed without onlookers. He then held a meeting in the temple with the Elite, scolding them and questioning if the World Brain\u2014the creature in charge of the terraforming\u2014could be behind the various failures in the process.

Sal-Solo, along with his bodyguard Darjeelai Swan, had come to meet with Shimrra. An interrogation of Swan revealed that the New Republic, not Sal-Solo, was in control of Centerpoint Station.

However, he had altered the deal; the Yuuzhan Vong would help Sal-Solo's Centerpoint Party take control of the Corellian system, after which Shimrra would be in charge of the system. In addition, the Yuuzhan Vong planned not to send Sal-Solo back to the Corellian system, but to make him leader of the Peace Brigade on their headquarters of Ylesia. The citizens of the galaxy saw the Peace Brigaders as traitors, and Shimrra knew that by forcing Sal-Solo to associate with them, the Human would be discredited and kept under the Yuuzhan Vong's thumb. When informed of the many changes to his plan, Sal-Solo tried to negotiate his way out; however, his speech only angered the Supreme Overlord.

However, the battle was actually a trap created by the New Republic, resulting in the death of Tsavong Lah. After the battle, Shimrra met with the Elite in his throne room, and informed them that the defeat was merely a test from the gods. Swearing revenge on the infidels, he also proclaimed Nom Anor to be a traitor, placing a death sentence on his head.

As Nen Yim's efforts to develop new Shaping protocols continued to produce no results, Shimrra grew increasingly angered. Part of this was due to the recent Jeedai heresy led by the prophet Yu'shaa, who was secretly Nom Anor in disguise. The Jeedai heresy was a rapidly growing movement of Shamed Ones that worshiped the Jedi as their saviors, and condemned Shimrra as the \"Rainbow-Eyed Enemy,\" the being who kept them enslaved. Around this time, Shimrra received a report from Commander Ekh'm Val. Val had stumbled upon a mysterious planet, and brought back a starship from that world with several features characteristic of Yuuzhan Vong vessels. After hearing details of the apparently living planet, Shimrra knew that it was Zonama Sekot. Seeking to prevent others from learning of the planet's existence, he had Val killed, his name removed from the records, and his vessel, the Noble Sacrifice, destroyed.

On the strength of this evidence, a furious Shimrra had the Prefects and their families killed. However, the evidence had actually been planted by the Priestess Ngaaluh, a secret follower of Yu'shaa. Nom Anor sought revenge on his enemies, and had arranged for their downfall; Ash'ett and Khalii had been innocent of the crimes they were charged with.

The ship was of Sekotan origin, and while examining it, Nen Yim discovered that it had many similarities to the Yuuzhan Vong's yorik-et fighters. When Yim revealed her discovery to Shimrra, he ordered her to develop weapons that could be used against the vessels if the Yuuzhan Vong ever met such ships in battles.

The gods, the Supreme Overlord believed, had grown angry because the Yuuzhan Vong no longer needed them.

Shimrra suppressed all knowledge of Zonama Sekot, and killed Ekh'm Val for discovering the planet during the Yuuzhan Vong War so as to prevent others from learning of the world that supposedly foretold the Yuuzhan Vong's doom. He also kept from his species for decades the knowledge of the emptiness of the eighth cortex, knowing that if such knowledge ever spread, his authority would greatly weaken."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For much of his life, Shimrra exerted total control over the Yuuzhan Vong. Ruling with an iron fist, he frequently ignored the advice of his advisors on the Great Council. The Supreme Overlord intimidated other members of his species into submission, and gained a reputation for being ruthless and terrifying. Other Yuuzhan Vong were fearful of him, and even Warmasters trembled in his presence. In addition, Shimrra had an uncanny ability to sense what others were thinking, thanks to Onimi's Force-sensitivity. Such was the Supreme Overlord's seeming omniscience that High Prefect Yoog Skell once warned Nom Anor to never even think of lying to Shimrra. Shimrra was also very skilled at manipulating others, and was talented in the field of political intrigue. Onimi was able to use his Force powers to subtly influence other Yuuzhan Vong, thus making it appear as though Shimrra had the mysterious ability to affect others' minds. This added to his reputation as a terrifying, omniscient leader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To help further his stature as an omnipotent vessel of the gods, Shimrra had both his public and private thrones in his Citadel equipped with dovin basals\u2014creatures that could produce gravitational fields. Through use of these dovin basals, Shimrra made it seem as though those who walked toward his throne were walking uphill, and that to merely approach the Supreme Overlord was a monumental task in itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike most Yuuzhan Vong, Shimrra did not place his faith in the gods, but sought to overthrow them, much as he had overthrown Quoreal. Under the influence of Onimi, Shimrra grew to hate the gods, and declared war on them. He believed that the Yuuzhan Vong had surpassed them, and were ready to take their place. Shimrra thought that the gods were fearful of this, and that they conspired to destroy the Yuuzhan Vong. The appearance of Zonama Sekot in 29 ABY was just a test, the Supreme Overlord believed. By destroying Zonama Sekot, he felt that the species would prove themselves and force the gods to surrender."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 29 ABY, Shimrra had gone completely insane. Despite his ability to intimidate and manipulate others, many Yuuzhan Vong had lost confidence in Shimrra. His declarations that the gods were the Yuuzhan Vong's true enemy, not the Galactic Alliance, were met with skepticism from the Elite, a group that normally was greatly fearful of him. However, some of them had heard rumors of Zonama Sekot, and as the war began to take a downward spiral, their faith in Shimrra wavered, with some believing that the Yuuzhan Vong had been better off under Quoreal. Prefect Nom Anor and High Prefect Drathul were two such members of the Supreme Overlord's court who had lost all confidence in Shimrra by the time of the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar. Anor believed that Shimrra no longer provided stable guidance for the Yuuzhan Vong, and that the species was lost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To maintain the charade that Shimrra was the Supreme Overlord, and Onimi nothing more than his jester, Onimi had Shimrra abuse him in public. This prevented anyone from learning that Onimi was the power behind the throne, and though many wondered why the Supreme Overlord kept a Shamed One as his familiar, they did not question Shimrra to his face.

Luke Skywalker noted that the Supreme Overlord was the largest Yuuzhan Vong he had ever seen, and Nom Anor observed that he towered over the Elite in meetings. The hau polyp creatures that made up his throne would occasionally burst due to the strain placed on them from supporting the Supreme Overlord's massive frame. Shimrra had thin limbs and a large head, and his torso and head were covered in brands and tattoos honoring the gods. He wore gray robes made from the flesh of Steng, a rebellious Yuuzhan Vong Warmaster from millennia ago."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shimrra had mqaaq'it-implant eyes that constantly shifted colors, although they were most often red. His eyes glittered when he was angry, and had the effect of causing anyone under his gaze to feel intimidated and as though the victim's mind was being read. Nom Anor feared the Supreme Overlord's eyes, finding the frequent color-changes to be unnerving."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shimrra Jamaane was created for The New Jedi Order, a nineteen-book series published by Del Rey between 1999 and 2003. The character was mooted during the initial meetings between several authors and Lucas Licensing editors that plotted out the overarching progression of the series. At this preliminary stage, James Luceno, who was then acting as a consultant but later authored three of the series' novels, suggested the idea that the Supreme Overlord could be a mere \"puppet ruler\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shimrra was first mentioned in Luceno's The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial, published in 2000 as the fourth novel in the series.

He made his first appearance in Greg Keyes' The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth, published in 2001. Shimrra's true role as Onimi's puppet was hinted at in The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way, and the character's importance grew near the end of the series, as he was given a major role in several books, culminating with the final novel in the series, The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force.
