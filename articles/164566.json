On arrival, they were met by the Bothan Jedi Knight Nysis Belzara, while Es'Loma screamed and seemingly fell off the ledge of the landing platform. A group of humans approached in a speeder, who killed Belzara and injured San and Nia. Wojarra was able to shoot their speeder with a tracer, before he was shot with a stun bolt and collapsed. A group of spacers, who were also part of the Pulas operation, came over from a nearby platform just afterward and Wojarra explained to then what had happened."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
