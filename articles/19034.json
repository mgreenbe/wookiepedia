The original Scurrg H-6 bomber prototype was equipped with proton bombs that were released via two bomb chutes. However, after the modifications, the rather unstable bomblet generator could provide an infinite amount of bombs for the pilot's destructive needs. This generator was totally modular, allowing its safe removal for use in other craft when necessary. The space pirate Nym had a bomblet generator installed on his ship, the Havoc."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bomblet generator was also installed in certain configurations of the Unstable Terrain Artillery Transport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
