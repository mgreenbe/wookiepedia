The judge of the case was Mavari Zudan, a female Falleen, and Horn's lawyer was the Twi'lek Nawara Ven. It was decided that Horn was incompetent to stand trial, but that he was also too dangerous to be simply confined in a conventional prison. Therefore, it was ruled that Horn would be encased in carbonite and placed in the Armand Isard Correctional Facility. This would eventually lead to a rescue mission attempted by rogue Jedi Knight Seff Hellin, who was suffering from the same psychosis as Horn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
