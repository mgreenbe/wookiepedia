On most days, thick clouds covered the skies. Despite this heavy cover, enough red sunlight filtered through to give the landscape an eerie reddish cast.

Ergeshui soil was one of the planet best-kept secrets. This soil was so laced with nutriments and minerals that it could grow and support plant life from most worlds in the galaxy. The Ergesh did not export this soil, as they felt that this would deplete the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The most interesting natural phenomenon to be found on Ergeshui was the tidal flats. Due to the presence of the moons, there were huge variation in the tide. When the tide was out, the continents almost doubled in size.
