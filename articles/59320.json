The species' name was given to them by aspiring scientist Avon Starros while she was stranded on the moon with several others. Possessing multi-colored fur, six limbs, and long tails, they lived on a diet of fruit. Handsies took shelter during Wevo's persistent acid rains, before emerging in the daytime to eat. One handsy, Chiri, was briefly adopted as a pet by Jedi Padawan Imri Cantaros before it was killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
