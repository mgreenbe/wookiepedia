The pair thought there was nothing to be found in the cantina. When exiting, Zeta Squadron was attacked by Jawa Het Nkik wielding a blaster. When the pistol failed to fire, 1047 removed his own weapon from its holster and shot the Jawa dead, hesitating only to deride the Jawa's foolishness.\nSoon after, he received the order to converge when the droids were sighted in nearby Docking Bay 94. His unit failed to prevent the launch of the freighter Millennium Falcon, carrying the droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
