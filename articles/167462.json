ZA-13's survival was critical, as Zaarin's fleeing forces already destroyed every other TIE Avenger factory station in the Omar system.

Maarek Stele again was chosen to be the lead flight as he had to escort personnel to ZA-13 while repelling another attack by Zaarin's forces, led by the Carrack-class light cruiser Z-Jumimi and three CR90 corvettes from the Z-Caplure Group.

During the conversion, however, Rebel raiders attacked the convoy, code name Rope 17, that was bringing the parts for the conversion to ZA-13. The Rebel fighters and bombers were armed with their new magnetic pulse warhead. Admiral Thrawn's forces quickly drove the Rebels off, and routed the origin of the raid. The Rebel raiding force came from a Rebel space station, RS-32, which manufactured Mag Pulse warheads."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn knew this would be a chance to strike a major blow to the Rebels and sent most of his task force to capture RS-32, leaving two EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates behind to defend ZA-13.
