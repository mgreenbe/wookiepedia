One of his first targets were the TIE/ad starfighter production facilities in the Omar system: Omar 1, Omar 2, and Omar 3. Sending a massive fleet that overwhelmed the local defenses, Zaarin left the loyalist Imperial forces with no other choice but to abandon the facilities and to save the surviving personnel on these stations. The Timber was one of the many Imperial transports assigned to rescue as many of the surviving crew as possible on Omar 1, and then escape before Zaarin's forces could intercept it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A retaliatory strike led by Tan Maarek Stele distracted Zaarin's forces long enough for the Timber, the last vessel to arrive, to board Omar 1 and retrieve the last of the Imperial personnel still stationed aboard.
