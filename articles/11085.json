Part of a trio of extermination ships commissioned especially to serve rabidly Humanocentric Imperial Grand Admiral Danetta Pitta, it was commanded by Admiral Mir Tork, with chief scientist Leonis Murth\u00e9 serving as second-in-command. Along with the Angrix and Apocahk, the Azgoghk and its considerable escort forces were deployed to the Outer Rim Territories, officially on an Imperial exploration mission, in truth to locate, enslave and eradicate non-Human civilizations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For several years the Azgoghk roamed the Rim, harvesting planets of their resources and populace; however, the dungeon ship's escort force was called to fight at Endor in 4 ABY, and the vulnerable Azgoghk was disabled by Rebellion forces.

Pitta advocated the extermination of non-Human species, and to this end he was given control of the three dungeon ships. Officially they were used for exploration and expanding the Empire's borders in the Outer Rim Territories, but Pitta used them solely for genocide. Each ship worked separately, with a large escort force consisting of several Star Destroyers and other, smaller support craft. Once a planet's species was wiped out and its resources stripped bare, each ship would move on to another world ripe for exploitation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Azgoghk was commanded by Mir Tork, a ruthlessly efficient, fanatically Humanocentric Imperial admiral. Second-in-command was chief scientist Leonis Murth\u00e9, another whose hatred for aliens was matched only by Tork and Pitta.

A force of stormtroopers rounded up the population, informing them that they were to be taken offworld for their own safety. Inquisitive Gulmarid were brutally punished, and the na\u00efve species acquiesced to the Imperial demands and boarded the ship.

Ostensibly to improve his damaged reputation (following his defeat at the Great Pit of Carkoon), Fett accepted the job. On Malicar 3, Fett single-handedly brought down the ship with an ion cannon. Fett then infiltrated the ship and killed Tork and Murth\u00e9.

The survivors, represented by Slique Brighteyes, were determined that Tork and Murth\u00e9 would die before the last of the Gulmarids did. Pooling together their resources, which totaled a miserly one hundred credits, they decided to put out a bounty on Tork and Murth\u00e9. Prices had previously been put on the pair's heads, but bounty hunters had either died trying or refused to touch the contract, believing that the Azgoghk was impenetrable. Brighteyes, however, sought to hire Boba Fett; once the most notorious bounty hunter in the galaxy, Fett's career was stuttering after a number of high profile failures, and Brighteyes hoped he would accept the mission to prove his abilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brighteyes outlined his proposition to Fett, but when the Gulmarid informed Fett of the reward, the bounty hunter almost killed him on the spot for wasting his time. However, after further consideration Fett accepted the offer, in a last ditch attempt to reignite his failing career. The Azgoghk mission was said to be one of the most bizarre bounties ever accepted by Fett, and in a galaxy rife with Fett impostors, some questioned whether it was even Fett who undertook it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
