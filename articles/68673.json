In 3976 BBY, Jagi served under Ordo during the Mandalorian's capture of the planet Althir. During the battle, Jagi and his comrades were abandoned by Ordo while he sought a quick end to the engagement, which resulted in the deaths of Jagi's fellow Mandalorians. He swore to take his vengeance on Ordo for what he believed was the Mandalorian's cowardice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3956 BBY, the final year of the Jedi Civil War, Jagi encountered Ordo as the former was assisting the Jedi Padawan Revan in his search for the Star Forge, an ancient Rakatan superweapon that was fueling the Sith Empire's war effort. During the encounter, Jagi challenged Ordo to a duel in the Dune Sea on the planet Tatooine. Eventually, he and two thugs met Ordo and Revan near a broken sandcrawler owned by Czerka Corporation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While fighting a battle over the world of Althir, Ordo saw an opening in the Althiri fleet and decided to turn his attack force on the exposed area, leaving his other men and Jagi to die. Most of the Mandalorians under Jagi's command died and Jagi himself believed Ordo abandoned them all without good reason, though Ordo would later state that he did it to save the lives of more of his warriors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After having spent several years tracking his former commander, Jagi finally found him on one of the planets where there was a Star Map, and challenged him to a duel in the Dune Sea of Tatooine, threatening him to lose all honor in the eyes of Mandalorians.

If the player fails to convince Jagi to see Ordo's viewpoint, the character and his men attack and are killed. However, if the player attempts to use Force Persuasion to convince Jagi not to fight, Canderous will say he does not want the player to do so, and Jagi attacks anyway. Regardless of the action taken, Canderous will have the same response after the skirmish, and neither option affects the player's alignment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
