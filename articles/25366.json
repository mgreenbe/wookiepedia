He was taken from the Temple and hidden from the Galactic Empire for many years, and his memories during these times are dark and filled with fear. Tano also laments that she had only met one such being of this species, Jedi Grand Master Yoda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Tano asks if Grogu can still wield the Force, Djarin asks if she means his powers. Tano explains that the Child draws his power from the Force, which she describes as an energy field created by all living things. To wield it takes a good deal of training and discipline. Djarin says he has seen Grogu do things that he can't explain, adding that his task was to bring him to a Jedi. Tano explains that the Jedi Order fell a long time ago.

At Tano's prompting, Djarin asks the Child to pass the stone but Grogu is stubborn. Tano tells Djarin to connect with the Child. Breathing deeply, Djarin fetches the joystick ball which the Child had been playing with earlier. Djarin convinces the Child to take the joystick with the Force, telling him that he wants it.

Djarin also briefs Tano about the magistrate, explaining that she has a small army of guards armed with A350 blaster rifles, two HK-87 assassin droids, and a hired gunfighter.

Tano explains that Elsbeth had plundered worlds, destroying them in the process. Djarin says that Elsbeth is still in business.

The two exchanges blows while the standoff between Djarin and Lang continues, with Lang attempting to convince Djarin to change sides.

While Tano refuses to train Grogu, she tells Djarin to take him to the seeing stone on the planet Tython, a place with a strong connection with the Force where Grogu can decide his own fate.
