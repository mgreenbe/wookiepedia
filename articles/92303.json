He lived alone in a small hut in the northern mountains of the planet Dantooine during the Galactic Civil War sometime after the Battle of Yavin. He was visited by a spacer and fellow armorsmith during this time who wished to learn how to construct the R.I.S. armor. Ni'mai demanded 50,000 credits from the spacer before he would even begin instructing. The spacer paid the fee, and Ni'mai began by instructing the spacer in the creation of the armor segment, which provided the armor its protection. The armor segment required bones from a woolamander harrower for strength, the hide of a gurk king for flexibility, and for inner protection and warmth, the scales of a great dune kimogila. The armor's appearance layer was next, requiring the feathers of a peko-peko albatross. Once Ni'mai was satisfied that his student had learned the basics of the armor's construction, he told the spacer to craft a complete pair of the R.I.S. boots, which the spacer was successful in doing. Ni'mai considered the boots adequate and rewarded his student with the schematics for the remainder of the R.I.S. armor pieces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mol Ni'mai was a very arrogant man, believing himself to be the greatest master armorsmith in the galaxy and refusing to even speak more than a few sentences to those of lesser comprehension in the art of armor crafting.
