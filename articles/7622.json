Upon activation it would establish a firing solution on any incoming missiles and then begin firing into its projected path. It would fill that path with a large amount of metal shrapnel with the intention of detonating the missile before it reached its target. These weapon systems were deployed on some of the New Republic's New Class Modernization Program designs, most notably the Majestic-class heavy cruiser and Warrior-class gunship, and were used during the Battle of ILC-905."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
