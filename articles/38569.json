Ingoda was a business rival of Jabba Desilijic Tiure; becoming indebted to Jabba, Ingoda had to sell him two of his slaves, Diva Shaliqua and Diva Funquita. Jabba then presented Funquita to Gardulla as a gift, keeping Shaliqua for his own house band. Before the Boonta Eve Classic, Gardulla ordered Diva Funquita to ensure that Anakin Skywalker would not be able to compete. She enlisted the aid of Ark \"Bumpy\" Roose to sabotage Skywalker's podracer, but the Nuknog did not know which pod was Anakin's and erroneously sabotaged another podracer instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Diva Funquita was played by George Lucas's daughter Amanda Lucas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
