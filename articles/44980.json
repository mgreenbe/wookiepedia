Members of the species were heavily involved in slave trading and Ereesus was the site of a profitable slave trade. In 4200 BBY, the Ereesi species engaged in slave raids throughout the sector. Their harassment of the Argazdans prompted the latter to join the Galactic Republic that year. In 3970 BBY, Argazdan Redoubt forces devastated Ereesus, exterminating all life including the Ereesi slavers in retaliation for the latter's depredations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
