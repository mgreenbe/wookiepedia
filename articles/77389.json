Led by Noka, they flew to Kashyyyk on a slave ship to capture Wookiees for the Xonti Brothers. Upon arrival, Kootan expressed his keenness to kill a Wookiee and Noka reminded him of the job at hand. Noka expressed his worries as two slaving teams had already been lost to Wookiees in the last month alone.

Kootan fired a stun blast at it, only to find it had been left to bleed to death. One of the slavers was suddenly shot and Kootan ordered the others to open fire as another slaver was quickly shot dead. The third slaver was quickly gunned down and only Kootan and Noka were left. After taking cover behind a tree, the pair realised that the dead Wookiee was bait and Kootan decided to open fire on the attacker. Kootan left his cover to be knocked out by the attacker, a black Wookiee named Black Krrsantan. Krrsantan then threw him into another tree which killed him on impact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kootan was a male Trandoshan slaver with orange eyes and skin.
