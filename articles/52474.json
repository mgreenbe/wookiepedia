His card used the image of Umpass-stay, a Klatooinian visible in the Jabba's Palace scenes of the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. As a result of that inconsistency, in 2011, Holocron continuity database maintainer Leland Chee announced that he was planning to retcon Wironicc as one of several unnamed Klatooinians seen in the background of the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. However, that retcon was never implemented before the Expanded Universe was declared non-canon. For this reason, Wironicc's species is also considered undetermined."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
