Amidst his ruminations, Yoda felt Padawan Anakin Skywalker's inner turmoil as he slaughtered a group of Tusken Raider's on Tatooine. While the Force did not provide any of the details of Skywalker's pain, Yoda heard the voice of the deceased Master Qui-Gon Jinn urging Skywalker away from making a terrible choice.

Soon after, Master Windu joined Yoda to meditate on the news of a possible threat lurking on the planet Zigoola. Delivered to the Council by Knight Kenobi, Windu and Yoda questioned the validity of the report and eventually decided that they should not divert any troops towards a threat which hadn't yet revealed itself. Windu later revealed his need to discuss his feelings with Yoda or else he would not be able to function. Yoda encouraged him to release his fear and follow the ebb and flow of the Force.

After meditating on the information, Yoda reluctantly agreed to send the two on an undercover mission to discover what the Confederacy of Independent Systems was doing on such a backwater; provided that the Special Operations Brigade arranged false identities for them. Within days of the assignment, Yoda summoned Master Kenobi to his quarters again to take tea with him, an invitation typically exclusive to members of the High Council. While sipping the fragrant tea, Yoda discussed with Kenobi the darkness that had plagued the young master since his return from Zigoola. Yoda warned that death and loss awaited Kenobi on Lanteeb and to take caution and trust his feelings if he sought to prevail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, Masters Yoda, Windu, Tholme, and Ki-Adi-Mundi were present in the Grand Master's quarters when Master Agen Kolar reported on the apparent defection of Jedi Quinlan Vos to the Separatists.

Plagued by visions of the death of someone close to him, Yoda encouraged the young Jedi to release himself of attachment and let the Force guide the hand of fate. Skywalker sat quietly through the meeting, though privately dismissing Yoda's advice as typical Jedi dogma. Soon after the meeting, Yoda departed his chambers for the final time on a mission to the war-torn planet Kashyyyk. While away from the capitol, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was discovered to be the elusive Darth Sidious. One of the only individuals in the galaxy to discover this terrible truth, Yoda was prepare for the attack that besieged him during Order 66.

Assigned to the Temple, High Inquisitor Malorum set up his offices in the former residence of the exiled-Grand Master. When Darth Vader arrived for a meeting with Malorum, the ex-Jedi Ferus Olin, who had managed to infiltrate the Temple with the help of his friend Trever Flume, used the time to break into the office and look through Malorum's files for signs of the rumored Jedi Prison. Before he could finish, Darth Vader and the Inquisitor walked into the room, causing the infiltrators to hide amidst the rubble in the hall outside. As Vader began to argue with Malorum, Olin and Flume attempted to evade notice; however Vader began whirling the Force around the office causing debris to rattle and fall lose of the ceiling. The grate behind which Olin was hidden shook free, revealing him to the Dark Lord.
