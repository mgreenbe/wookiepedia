In 185 BBY, he and his friend Barraak were still young pups. They were training to become great warriors under the guidance of Tarfful, an Wookiee teenager who had already gone through his hrrtayyk rite of passage and become an adult. That year, the two friends embarked with their seniors Tarffull, Chewbacca and Ralrracheen on a dangerous journey in Kashyyyk's Shadowlands. Those were the deepest, densest part of the Kashyyykian forest floor on the planet Kashyyyk, and were inhabited by savage beasts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While there, the group encountered a group of slavers who sought to ensare live Wookiees.
