In contrast to a regular trooper, members of Imperial Reconnaissance, (Known as Reconnaissance Troopers or Recon Troopers) would carry lighter, more flexible armor and in turn were faster. They were specially trained to use K-406 Sniper Rifles. These troopers were adaptable to any environment, due to their intense training.
