It combined verbal sounds and an elaborate sign language using the Twi'lek's head-tails, called lekku. That sign language allowed the Twi'leks to communicate complete concepts without having to pronounce a single word. Raising the tip of one's right lek meant \"Hello!\", while dipping the tip of one's left lek meant \"Goodbye!\" By crossing over both lekku tips twice, a Twi'lek meant to say \"I love you.\" Both lekku tips jabbed into the speaker's back were to be understood as \"May spice salt your wounds!\" Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was able to speak Twi'leki."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Examples"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
