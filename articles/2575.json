It was produced by Greff-Timms Industrial and was considered state-of-the-art millennia before the Galactic Civil War. The weapon functioned on the same basic principle as modern blasters during the war, but fell under the auspices of disruptor weapon bans and control acts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Whenever ancient ATA pulse-wave blasters were newly discovered during the war they required only some basic maintenance and a fresh power pack to operate like new, but were confiscated and destroyed by authorities as quickly as possible. Because of this, the weapons were worth a large amount on the black market at 750 credits per weapon. News of new pulse-wave blaster caches discoveries traveled fast, with criminals trying to beat authorities to claim them from the source or liberating entire shipments destined for destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ATA pulse-wave blaster appeared in the new Star Wars canon in Gadgets and Gear, a 2019 role-playing supplement released by Fantasy Flight Games.
