Knowing they have to destroy it, their generals gathered to make a plan. Reports showed that a direct assault would be untenable, but they came up with the only option-a covert mission to infiltrate and destroy the shield protecting the superweapon. Their next problem was to  figure out how to deliver the commando team. Crix Madine proposed a plan to raid an unguarded space station using a skilled pilot to deliver commandos to steal the shuttle and clearance codes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once at the target, the team encountered a large number of TIE Fighters, but the commando team was able to slip in and locate a suitable shuttle, the Tydirium. The team, along with pilots, ran through the station to capture the shuttle while evading capture by the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
