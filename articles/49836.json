Both males and females made up the Force cultists' ranks. The pilgrims had a uniform dark red robed-and-hooded attire with gold accents, and some amongst them held wooden staffs that featured a gray lamp that glowed a luminous yellow towards the top, the lamp being hung from an arch, one side of which circled down to the straight trunk of the wooden staff. The staff was gnarled and featured red and black and white and black stripes.

As part of their attire, pilgrims wore flowing leg coverings, draping, dark purple cloth extending along the arms, a black undertunic, a red overtunic with golden markings across the chest, as well as a belt that hung a golden pendant.

The overtunic was similar to a Port Nowhere mobster's armor, and both shared the same gold markings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, a Force Pilgrim could also wear a similar armor attire that had a red and orange color scheme as opposed to dark red and gold. It replaced the flowing leg coverings with a dress, featured no draping cloth along the arms, lacking the torso covering that had golden markings across the chest, and without the belt showcasing the golden pendant. Instead, a gray belt with a metallic, bronze device was worn around the waist, and a pair of gray, metal gloves was worn over red bracers encircled by a golden ring."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force Pilgrims appear in the 2020 Update 6.1 of Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught, a digital expansion to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.
