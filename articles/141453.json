Hidden inside a mesa in the polar region of the planet Telos IV that housed the abandoned Telos Polar Irrigation System, the Jedi Academy was afforded secrecy and security. Although the Academy never housed any students, it was inhabited by Atris and the Echani Handmaiden Sisters who served her. The building also hosted numerous Sith holocrons that Atris had collected, along with other relics. Among the collection was various materials of learning that had been saved from Dantooine's Jedi Enclave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five years after the end of the Civil War, Meetra Surik, an exiled Jedi who had been fleeing the Sith, traveled to Telos' Citadel Station aboard the Ebon Hawk. When Atris had the ship brought to the Academy, Surik, accompanied by her companions, Kreia, Atton Rand, and Bao-Dur, followed a trail of evidence that pinpointed the Hawk's location, thereby discovering the Academy. Once there, Surik met with Atris to discuss the past struggles between the Jedi Order and the Sith before leaving to gather other surviving Jedi Masters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located within a mesa in the planet Telos IV's polar region that housed the abandoned Telos Polar Irrigation System, the Telosian Jedi Academy was retrofitted from the facility by Jedi Master Atris\u2014founder of the Academy and Jedi historian of the Jedi Order. Also known as the Telos Polar Academy, the building was designed to be completely self-contained, having been built with every facility needed to maintain its self-sufficiency. The Academy's interior was clad in blue-gray hues, and was similar in appearance to the water-distribution network of the Galactic Republic capital planet Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Academy's mesa drew power from the Telosian shield network's power grid to generate a shield protecting itself. The building held a hangar that was large enough to accommodate a light freighter. In addition, it had storage rooms, a prison, and separate quarters for any on-site personnel, as well as a private meditation chamber for Atris, as well as a Jedi Council meeting chamber. The chamber was circular, with seats resting upon yellow and red carpets and arranged at equal distances from each other around a gray rock pillar. The mesa was black and squat, with its base wider than its top, the Polar Plateau, which was covered with snow. The Academy's entrance was located at the plateau's southern half. Four black towers rose up around the mesa, arranged at equal distances from each other to form a perimeter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 990 BBY, Telos was a Jedi world and a hub of information on which Jedi Consulars fulfilled their researching and teaching duties.

Telos was selected to host the Academy, partly in the hope that the Sith would not devastate the same world twice; however, prior to the war it had served as a place where Jedi who had failed their training would continue to serve the galaxy as farmers and laborers. Throughout the Jedi Civil War, which Revan's Sith waged against the Jedi and the Galactic Republic from 3959 BBY to 3956 BBY, Jedi holocrons and other materials and relics of historical value had been secretly evacuated from Dantooine to Telos. However, according to Jedi historian Tionne Solusar in Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force, a historical compendium created in 40 ABY, the Jedi Master and historian Atris also amassed a collection of Sith holocrons at the Academy around 3956 BBY. without the knowledge of other Jedi, delving into forbidden knowledge of the Force's dark side in hopes of finding a way to defeat the Sith from within."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the height of the Jedi Civil War in 3956 BBY, the Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council foresaw the destruction of the Enclave and organized an evacuation.

With most members of the Jedi Order being killed at the disastrous conclave on Katarr around 3952 BBY, Atris decided to bring about the Order's rebirth. She gathered several members of the Echani species, daughters of the famed Echani General Yusanis and collectively known as the Handmaiden Sisters, at the Academy, and demanded an oath from each that they would never be trained in the Jedi ways, even if they themselves were Force-sensitive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Atris then instructed them in vigorous mental exercises that were aimed at teaching them to resist Force-based influences. The Handmaidens were intended to protect the Academy from the influence of the dark side; as part of their service they were ordered to deal with any Jedi who showed signs of falling under its sway, including killing them. Atris was the only one whom the Handmaidens absolutely trusted; she was the only Jedi who resided within the Academy.

The Hawk was taken to Telos, where the Academy's hangar secretly received the freighter. From Restoration Zone RZ-0031 on Telos, engineer Bao-Dur accessed a landing pad's computer panel to help Surik find her lost ship. While the Jedi Exile said that the Telos Security Force could only determine that the Hawk was not present at any of Telos' sanctioned landing sites, Bao-Dur deduced that the ship could be at a shielded yet unofficial site. The engineer then found that power was being diverted to supply a shield covering a small mesa in the polar region, and confirmed a subtle, seemingly unsuspicious anomaly in the planetary shield network's power grid. While an orbital camera revealed empty lands, the Exile's mentor, Kreia, stated that they should investigate further, feeling that the lead was their best chance at finding the Hawk. The group thus took a shuttle from the nearby military base and traveled to the polar region."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While passing through the snowing polar region, the shuttle was shot down by pursuing HK-50 series assassin droids and crashed on the Polar Plateau. While the Exile and her group survived the crash, Bao-Dur was rendered unconscious, and the crew were confronted by three HK-50 units. Having detected nothing of interest at the icy mesa, the droids queried why the Exile traveled to the remnants of the Telos Irrigation System before attacking her. However, the Exile and her group destroyed the HK-50s and proceeded to search for refuge, leaving Bao-Dur behind as they entered the secret Academy's entrance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While two Echani Sisters inspected the crash site, the Exile's group arrived at the Academy's entrance chamber below and were confronted by three other Sisters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surik retrieved the Ebon Hawk, which had been stolen by one of the Handmaidens\u2014however, upon securing the vessel, she immediately left Telos and Atris behind.

Instead of resurrecting the Order on Telos, they decided to meet in the rebuilt Jedi Enclave on Dantooine in the hope of fighting the threat of the Sith when it was finally exposed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Atris, however, was proven to be wrong in her belief that the Sith would not attack Telos twice. Darth Nihilus arrived with his fleet above Telos in order to feed on the Force energy within the Jedi who he believed dwelled at the Academy. Nihilus's plans, however, were thwarted by Surik, who defeated the Sith Lord aboard his flagship, the Ravager, thus preserving the Academy's structural integrity. By then, as part of the training of Meetra Surik, Kreia had exposed Atris's corruption and fall to the dark side, provoking the Jedi Master into acknowledging her own dark nature before leaving for Malachor V to complete Surik's training. Soon after, fresh from her efforts to drive the Sith away, Surik arrived at the Academy and was attacked by Atris in the Academy's Council chambers. However, Atris was defeated, and, against her predictions, was spared by Meetra Surik in the wake of their duel. Seeing the flaws of her actions as a result, Atris decided to leave the Jedi, wishing to find her true self in doing so.

Later, by special arrangement with the organization, the Empire allowed members of the Bounty Hunter's Guild to train on three properties formerly used as Jedi chapter houses. The three facilities' locations were a closely guarded secret, being known only to Guild members and a select faction of Imperial officers.

While Atris meditated with her large collection of Sith holocrons in an attempt to unlock the secrets of defeating the Sith, the Handmaiden Sisters relentlessly trained themselves both in fighting techniques and in closing their minds to Force-based influences.
