However, because the birds were seen as valuable hunting trophies, they were nearly hunted to extinction hundreds of years before the Galactic Civil War. As a result, Chandrila's squall population increased dramatically, endangering crops. Eventually, the blackback was protected by the Chandrilan government and allowed to roam large preserves, such as the Hanna Wild Game Reserve."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Empire, blackbacks in the Hanna Wild Game Reserve were hunted by ghorla-riding hunters. In order to be able to participate in the hunt, one required a permit that cost more than 200,000 credits per kill, a sum that was used by the Chandrilans to fund breeding programs for the birds. During the Empire's blockade of Chandrila, all such permits were suspended except for those belonging to Imperial officials."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The blackback was first mentioned in the 2003 Star Wars Roleplaying Game sourcebook Coruscant and the Core Worlds, which was published by Wizards of the Coast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
