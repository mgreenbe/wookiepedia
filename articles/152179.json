He was present on the planet Haruun Kal when ground forces led by Lieutenant Canonhaus. The commanding officer of the Imperial ground troops ordered a march to a lake thirty kilometers away. Canonhaus would remember this decision as being tactically unsound, but ascribed the poor judgement to the fact that the CO had larvae of fever wasps growing in her brain. After the wasps killed her, the formation was stranded in the wet darkness of the Haruun Kal jungle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
