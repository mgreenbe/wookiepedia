He came into contact with the Shining Man, also known as Albathius, and was changed by the experience. Xanar learned to speak Basic and learned much of the world beyond Voss, distancing him even further from his people. He patiently waited for the Shining Man's return near his starship in the Dark Heart of the Nightmare Lands for many moons. Finally, another outsider came - Cipher Nine of the Imperial Intelligence. He revealed to Xanar that the Shining Man had died, after which the Gormak attacked and tried to kill the Agent but perished himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
