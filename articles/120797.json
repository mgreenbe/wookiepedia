An Adarian's lineage determined their occupation within society for the duration of their lifetime. The cast system was rigidly enforced, and members of different castes were forbidden from pursuing romantic relationships. Strict rules were enforced during inter-caste business dealings. During the Galactic Civil War, young Adarians began calling for the re-ordering of the sceel'sara. While they did not call for the abolition of the system, they did want the opportunity to be assigned to different castes based on merit and ability rather than birth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
