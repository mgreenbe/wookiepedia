Ciasi had thin torsos, and their backs had a slight bend in them, thus appearing as if they were always leaning forward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ciasi also had rather thin limbs that held them upright, including double-jointed legs that ended in three slender toes; the Ciasi stood upon those toes as opposed to the flats of their feet. The Ciasi's long, slender arms led to hands with four thick digits\u2014three fingers and a short thumb. Ciasi also had thin tapered tails that came from their rear, which were held slightly above the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On their face, Ciasi had long, thin and trunk-like noses with two nostrils on the end. Their mouths were located below the trunk, and it was from there that the Ciasi could grow sharp, pointed tusks. Ciasi had round and beady eyes; some Ciasi, such as Slide Paramita, had black eyes. Paramita also exhibited grayish-brown colorerd skin. Ciasi also had tall, pointed ears that stuck out of the tops of their heads."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ciasi evolved somewhere in the galaxy, and individuals could be spotted in the galactic community by as early as 32 BBY, during the final decades of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Ciasi in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least one Ciasi, Slide Paramita, displayed athletic prowess both physically and mentally. Paramita made it as far as the intergalactic Podracing circuits by 32 BBY, where he became well adapted to ice racing, and gained fame on the icy planet Ando Prime. Paramita achieved success on an invitational course known as the Ando Prime Centrum, as well as a drag racing course on the planet. However, Paramita had a reputation for being an easily angered Podracer elitist.

Ultimately, he was cut from the script, although Tund remained as the homeworld of another Podracer pilot, Ben Quadinaros.
