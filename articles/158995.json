During its stay on New Plympto, the Valance and all other ships in the Cadgel Meadows spaceport were grounded by Imperial forces following the Empire's conflict with the native Nosaurians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Valance was grounded, the crew of the Maka-Eekai L4000 transport Uhumele, who were also grounded in the port, found reason to believe that the crew of the Valance would rather inform the Imperials of any attempt to escape the port than take part in one, in hopes of protecting themselves from the possible consequences. When the Uhumele did attempt to escape to avoid being searched by the Imperials, one of its crew, the Jedi Knight Dass Jennir, stole an Imperial Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter and, acting on the assumption that the Valance's crew would not defy the Imperials, opened fire on the small freighter to give the impression that the Imperial forces were attacking the grounded ships. The Valance was damaged by the attack and collapsed forward onto its nose while the other ships in the port fled, as their crews believed that the Imperials meant to attack their vessels as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Valance appeared in 2007 in the second issue of the Dark Times: The Path to Nowehere story arc, which was written by Randy Stradley under the name Mick Harrison, and illustrated by Douglas Wheatley."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
