In his time as constable, Liddell obtained notoriety for being a just man and a very good sniper, winning ten times the annual Landing Shootout and retiring undefeated. He also was one of the main figures of the events surrounding the reappearance of the believed-extinct Menahuun species.

As the job was technically a branch of Outer Rim Oreworks and this enter in conflict with the Sailor's Union, Liddell stopped being a member of the syndicate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Being Liddell still an inexperienced rookie, Bartyn's Landing and nearby areas, including farms and boat routes, were raided by a gang of outlaws that was rumored to be lead by a lightsaber-wielding dark Jedi sorcerer known only as \"The Padawan.\" Ertine took his four Seconds, including Liddell, and tracked the gang to their hideout. The Padawan \u2014who was really Byrch Dyshkava, a fallen Jedi\u2014 was cautious enough to keep a watch and saw Ertine coming.

He appointed several Seconds who had been sailors up to this point, including Grubber Vapps, and used the help of trusted citizens to prepare a trap for Dyshkava, including a farmer who offered his property as the battlefield. Liddell them attracted Dyshkava's gang and ambushed them in an overwhelming defeat. Most of the desperadoes were either killed or captured, and even Dyshkava was apprehended. The Padawan was chained and sent to jail, but he escaped during Liddell watch, the only prisoner to achieve this feat. A bounty was offered for his capture, but Dyshkava had disappeared from any civilized area, having been captured by the secretive sentient species known as the Menahuun.

He organized posses to go after offenders and hunting groups to free the area from dangerous predators or to map the mountains. He hunted dangerous animals by himself, found lost pets and mediate quarrels among the citizens. He also appeared during fistfights in local watering holes, including the Tailfin Cantina, should anyone tried to use lethal weapons. In time, the citizens of Bartyn's Landing considered Liddell to have been the best Security Chief in their lifetime \u2014 a notable achievement in the case of MD-0C6, who subscribed that opinion and who had lived in the Landing without a memory wipe since around five hundred years before the Battle of Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time as Chief, Liddell believed that ORO was periodically sending official inspectors to check the local mines, but the Administrator was really bribing the ORO officers and sent his men, disguised as inspectors, just to mislead Liddell and the locals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 55 BBY, crack sniper Liddell won the first prize annual Landing Shootout of Bartyn's Landing for the first time.

That same year, a member of the town council was killed in the unfavorable area known as The Ring, and Liddell and his allies investigated the case. At that point, Liddell believed that several of his Seconds were being bribed by Administrator Guther Bartyn so that he could hide some of his unofficial activities, but Liddell still trusted his personal friend Vapps and the Gungan known as Boom Boom. Bartyn was also pressing Liddell to investigate supposed attacks of gremlins \u2014really Menahuun\u2014 in the docks, mostly because Bartyn was worried about his personal yacht."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That same year, Byrch Dyshkava escaped from the Menahuun that had been jailing him for forty years. Considering himself to be a useless elderly man, he went to Bartyn's Landing, wanting only to die in a blaze of glory, preferably in a duel against Liddell. As Dyshkava was unable to find the Calamarian, he challenged some bystanders and was knocked down during the fight. Liddell appeared soon afterward and approached the winners of the duel, taking care to place an armed Vapps in the crowd just in case. When Liddell recognized Dyshkava, he took The Padawan to jail and got medical care for him. He also interviewed the victorious gunslingers, offered them the hefty bounty for Dyshkava and explained them the origin of their foe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trusting his instinct, and deciding that many of his current men were not reliable, Liddell offered to hire these newcomers as his Seconds. At that point, Dyshkava woke up and, questioned by Liddell, explained that he had been captured by the Menahuun while going through the coastline, but he could not give many more details as he was seriously ill. Liddell then raised his proposal to the group, offering to pay for rooms in Miss Mylla's Saloon, and then gave them the badges of Seconds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Liddell sent his new Seconds and Boom Boom to examine the area where Dyshkava had been captured, and they indeed found Menahuun presence \u2014hostile, organized, laser-armed Menahuun presence that tried their best to leave little proof of their existence.

Liddell identified it as a mining laser and sent the Seconds to meet with Guther Bartyn, Administrator of the fully-automated mines. Liddell warned them against Bartyn using circumlocutions instead of giving them information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Seconds discovered a Menahuun community hiding in the mines, and negotiated a peace with them. The sudden reappearance of the Menahuun was particularly shameful to ORO, as they were living proof of an agent of ORO trying to commit genocide; this led to ORO abandoning Lamaredd, which in turn reduced the power of the Bartyn family. Guther Bartyn was ceased as the Administrator, and Mix Liddell stood for the public office."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a pre-election rally, a young outlaw who wanted to became a renowned criminal like Dyshkava sniped at Liddell with a slugthrower rifle. Liddell survived and became the new elected Administrator, being replaced as Security Chief by Vapps. Guther Bartyn, in turn, went crazy and re-programmed two MMV security droids to attack several alien citizens of Bartyn's Landing. Administrator Liddell and Chief Vapps were unable to handle the situation by themselves and looked for external help."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Liddell was skillful when using the baton or the vibrodagger he carried with himself, he was a real expert using slugthrower weapons, which he also handcrafted as a personal hobby \u2014 slugthrower weapons were preferred by many in Lamaredd, as energy for blasters was a rare luxury. Beyond his offensive abilities, he was also knowledgeable in the fields of law enforcement and had experience as a sailor.

Vapps took part in illegal Cargo Track races in the area of Center Sphere District, and commonly won. Vapps believed that this was a secret, but Liddell had discovered his out-of-hours activity. Nonetheless, Liddell decided not to mention it because having a trusted man in these activities could be useful one day, and also because Vapps was a winning horse at that."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Liddell was admired and appreciate by the citizens of Bartyn's Landing.

To become a policeman, he had to renounce to the Sailor's Union, something he regretted fondly.

She had declared repeatedly that only Liddell could make her settle down and abandon her life or vice, and she was decided to make him fall to her feminine tricks. Although Liddell did appreciate Mylla, he considered himself too much of a professional to openly chase such a woman."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even if their relationship was unorthodox at best, Liddell spent most of his free time at Mylla's Saloon, commonly talking to her. Mylla provided Liddell some elusive data that helped him during frustrating cases. They respected each other greatly. During the Menahuun crisis of 29 BBY, Mylla was having problems with corrupt ORO customs officers that were stealing her shipments of Corellian brandy. She knew she could have resorted to Liddell, but she feared he could irritate his ORO employers one time too many, and thus she instead looked for help elsewhere as she was worried about her man."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mix Liddell was created by writer Cory J.

Bartyn takes over the command and recruits Liddell, his Seconds and many able-bodied citizens to join the battles defending the area. With the sudden disappearance of the police, crime raises.
