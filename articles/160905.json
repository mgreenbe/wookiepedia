Rex asks how they are going to get out, and Ahsoka says she has an idea. \"Which is?\" he asks, drawing his pistols, which Ahsoka tells him to set to stun so as to not kill the troopers, causing him to quip that she should tell that to them. They stand ready, with Ahsoka saying to wait until the cutting is complete. As soon as the cuts converge, Ahsoka pushes the door back with the Force, then deflects blaster fire as Rex stuns his former squadmates. Ahsoka tells R7-A7 to find them a way out, and the droid closes several blast doors cutting off most of the troopers. As the escape pods have been destroyed, Ahsoka suggests using a shuttle to escape. Rex asks Ahsoka if she'd heard that Maul had also escaped, but Ahsoka replies that he didn't escape \u2014 she let him out. Rex asks incredulously \"Why?\" and she replies, \"As a diversion.\" As Ahsoka and the droids run down the hall, she yells for Rex to come on, and as he follows her he remarks to himself \"That's one word for it.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sabotage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul walks toward the hyperdrive room, still using a clone trooper's wrist comm to listen in on their radio chatter. Over the radio, one of the clones reports to Jesse that Tano has escaped. Jesse asks about Rex and is told he is still missing in action. He asks if Rex has aided in Tano's escape, but they don't know. Two clone troopers round the corner and train their guns at Maul, who lifts them into the air, choking them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul enters the hyperdrive room, quickly and violently dispatching the clone troopers inside it with the Force. He tears the control console away, then uses the Force to rip the hyperdrive engines out of their moorings. On the bridge, an officer reports that the hyperdrive is failing and is ordered to disengage them, but cannot. More troopers enter the hyperdrive room but are crushed when Maul brings the hyperdrive engines down on them.

Rex notes that the clones have anticipated their actions, and have sealed the hangar bay doors and locked down all systems \u2014 he says that if they weren't trying to kill them, he'd be proud. Ahsoka assigns R7 to unlock the bay doors, Cheep to prep the shuttle, and G-G to find out what has happened to the hyperdrive.

Ahsoka tells R7 to open the doors, as Jesse's troops converge on the location, followed by Maul, and the disintegrating vessel begins to enter the atmosphere. A bay door opens, revealing a Nu-class attack/transport shuttle, but also two platoons of clone troopers, who gather information below the observation windows. Rex suggests fighting their way to the shuttle, but Ahsoka says there are too many of them, and she doesn't want to hurt them. Rex says the clones don't care, and are willing to die if it means taking Ahsoka and Rex with them. He falls silent, and Ahsoka gently removes his helmet, revealing tears streaming down his cheeks. Ahsoka says he is a good soldier, but so are the troopers in the hangar, and they may be willing to die, but she is not going to be the one to kill them. Rex asks if they are going to surrender, and Ahsoka says no, to which he responds that he doesn't see any other option. Ahsoka, studying the clones waiting in the hangar, notices something and tells Rex that she thinks she has a good idea. Handing Rex's helmet back to him, she kneels down and asks the droids if she can count on them, promising to explain her plan on the way. Ahsoka leads the way as they run out of the control room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A trooper tells Jesse that Maul is headed their way. Rex enters the hangar, holding Ahsoka at gunpoint and telling them to hold their fire. Rex tells Jesse he has the situation under control, but Jesse says he must follow orders, and if Rex doesn't, he will. Rex reasons that Order 66 was to execute the Jedi, but Ahsoka is no longer a Jedi. As the droids sneak past, Jesse says that Rex himself said Tano was to be executed by order of Darth Sidious. Rex attempts to appeal to his comradeship with Jesse, saying if they don't get this right, they will be the ones committing treason. Jesse does not fall for it, and accuses Rex of treason against the Grand Army of the Republic, saying he will be demoted and executed for assisting the traitor Ahsoka Tano. Turning to Ahsoka, Rex admits that he never much liked being a commander anyways. As Jesse orders his troops to take aim, the droids finish their work, and the hangar elevators drop suddenly, knocking out most of the troopers. Ahsoka runs forward and Force pushes Jesse into the hole, before Rex tosses her lightsabers back to her. As Ahsoka and Rex fight off the remaining clones, Maul enters the hangar and runs towards the shuttle.

Forced to choose between stopping Maul and saving Rex, Ahsoka reluctantly lets the shuttle go and Maul takes off into hyperspace. As the clones surround them, Ahsoka spins her lightsabers around, cutting a hole in the floor to the starship bay. Jesse orders his troops to blast them, but G-G and Cheep raise the elevators again, and are executed by the clones. The cruiser fully enters the atmosphere and the officer in charge orders the ship's retrorockets fired in order to try and control their descent, but a technician reports that they've lost lateral control and will break apart just as the bridge explodes, killing all the officers.

He sees Ahsoka in the distance, wearing a cowl and standing before the helmet-marked graves of dozens of clone troopers, including Jesse. She holds up her lightsaber, prepared to leave it there in order to sell the deception that she too died in the crash.

He kneels down and reaches through the snow, finding and igniting the lightsaber Ahsoka Tano left there. A convor cries above and Vader looks up to see it circling in the sky.

While the ending of \"Shattered\" showed several clones getting shot or stunned in front of the door before it was sealed, this episode begins with a shot of the corridor being completely clear of any corpses or other remnants. Considering the events continue from the very minute where they finished in the last episode, it is obvious that there was no time to clear the hallway \u2014 and the clones' behaviour means it makes no sense for them to have done so to such a degree."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Ahsoka novel, a clone is buried in Rex's armor and a fake grave marker is made with an inscription claiming Ahsoka and Rex killed each other. In this episode, however, Rex leaves with his armor, and no inscribed grave markers are made. Additionally, the novel states that Ahsoka ignites her lightsabers one last time before leaving both of them, and that they are green; the episode shows Ahsoka only hesitating to drop one of her blue lightsabers. The novel also indicates that the grave site is on Mandalore, when in the episode the graves are on an unidentified moon. Finally, the novel has Ahsoka alone when she abandons her weapons, with Rex having already left. The episode has him still there, as it is indicated they must leave the moon together since they only have one starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
