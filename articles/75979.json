The army operated from the Cularin system asteroid belt and under Jeen's direction, they launched a bloody attack on the planet Genarius, which triggered a war that became known as the \"Dark Jedi Conflict.\" The Jedi Order eventually dispatched two Jedi to the Cularin system in 181 BBY, to bring the conflict to a resolution. The Jedi lured Jeen's army into a trap and after a fiercely-fought space battle, the pirates were defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
