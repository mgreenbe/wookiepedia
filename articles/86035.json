It constantly monitored its stimuli-response subsystems and internal mechanisms and ensured that each functioned within prescribed limits. If some sort of abnormality was detected, the management circuit tried to adjust the subsystem. Should the abnormality be uncorrectable, the droid would then attempt to attract attention by activating an audible warning sound or speaking through its speech synthesizer or vocoder. The management circuits and the sensory-response module were subsystems within the behavioral circuitry matrix."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
