The bar sat on an island in the swamp, connected to nearby islands by a system of waterways and a pier-like bridge system. In 0 ABY, the Human pilot Jal Te Gniev acted as a Rebel Alliance recruiter from the establishment. At this same time, the bartender was a Snivvian. Due to Gniev's drunkenness, the Galactic Empire discovered the name of Luke Skywalker as the pilot who had destroyed the Death Star. Gniev's blunder also brought a group of stormtroopers to the bar, where they burned it to the ground with flamethrowers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
