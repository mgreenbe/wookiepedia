When the Galactic Republic launched a strike against the Colicoids, four battlegroups infiltrated the facility in order to end the production of battle droids. Reaching the innermost wall, they were attacked by a Scorpenek annihilator droid that destroyed a duracrete barrier of the factory serving as the clone's cover and killed three battlegroups until the remaining troopers fled the scene."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
