It was published on the Wizards of the Coast website on March 10, 2005 and took the form of a short story believed to have been written by Osten Dal'Nay detailing a character named Nightwing who was a member of the Navy of Thaere. Nightwing was cleaning his rifle when the Nikto commander Kulkis entered his barracks.
