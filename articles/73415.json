He was fascinated by the Jedi, and when he heard that a Jedi Knight had apparently come to Mustafar, he headed out alone to the lava mine, where he heard the Jedi had been seen. However, the \"Jedi\" in question was in fact Anakin Skywalker, who had recently fallen to the dark side of the Force and become the Sith Lord Darth Vader, and had been sent to Mustafar to execute the Separatist Council on the orders of his Sith Master, Darth Sidious, who was busy proclaiming the Galactic Empire on Coruscant. Kakan realized that the visitor was no Jedi upon seeing Vader's yellow eyes, and fled in fright as Vader pursued him to eliminate all witnesses. A miner, Lellis, witnessed the chase and grabbed Kakan, deactivating the repulsor vents and filling the area with psychoactive fumes so the two could escape. However, Kakan was affected by the fumes and saw a spectre of Vader, falling from a ladder he was attempting to climb."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
