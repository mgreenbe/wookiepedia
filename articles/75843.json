After the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker killed Jabba's pet rancor, the crime lord demanded Skywalker and his companions Han Solo and Chewbacca be executed at the Great Pit of Carkoon. The Hutt and his entourage traveled to the pit in Khetanna in order to view the executions, but the prisoners managed to board the sail barge and kill Jabba, destroying the sail barge as they escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Jabba the Hutt purchased the Khetanna."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early part of the Clone Wars, the Khetanna was carrying the Hutt's infant son, Rotta back to his palace. However, it then came under attack by a Trident-class assault ship commanded by Asajj Ventress, acting under orders from Separatist leader Count Dooku and his ally, Jabba's uncle Ziro.

However, the attempt ended up failing and Organa was forced to become Jabba's slave, while Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca were sentenced to death by being consumed by the sarlacc in the Great Pit of Carkoon. Jabba, accompanied by Organa and his entourage, traveled to the pit in Khetanna to witness the execution. However, R2-D2, who was still aboard the sail barge, launched Skywalker's lightsaber into the air, allowing the Jedi to catch it and fight back against Jabba's henchmen, while Organa went on to kill the Hutt. Skywalker soon managed to board Khetanna, and after neutralizing the guards on top, told Organa to aim the vessel's main blaster cannon at the deck. The pair proceeded to swing across to one of the nearby skiffs while the cannon fired at the barge, starting a chain-reaction and causing it to explode. Its remains ended up burying the sarlacc, allowing Jawas to scavenge them for their business."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Khetanna's destruction, Lugubrious Mote, a performer who claimed she was present during the rescue of Han Solo, had a scaled replica of the vessel created that she used during performances.

As such, artist Claudia Mullaly pitched an idea of featuring Jabba mobilizing in a miniature version of the Khetanna with a control column at the bow for steering. However, as incorporating it into the original footage would have been difficult (especially when Solo steps on Jabba), this idea went shelved."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
