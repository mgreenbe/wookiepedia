It could be scraped up and salvaged, but only under a high degree of safety measures, as rhydonium was dangerous to exposed skin. Rhydonium was highly explosive, the explosion produced typically being extremely colorful, though the explosions caused by rhydonium mined near an Imperial refinery on Morak were only orange in color. Rhydonium's volatile nature meant that it was tricky to transport at ground level, necessitating a low speed otherwise the fuel would become agitated and explode."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems extracted rhydonium from a secret mining installation on Abafar and loaded it onto a captured Venator-class Star Destroyer in a failed attempt to pilot it into and destroy the Republic space station Valor, which was hosting the Republic strategy conference.
