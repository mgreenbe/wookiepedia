Its 28 meter-long hull was coated in materials that negated most sensors while a unique baffled drive system provided it the ability to move at sublight speeds while leaving minimal trail. In addition, the ferret's primary sublight drive ran on chemical thrust, avoiding detectable ion emissions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While shieldless, the ferret was armed with a pair of concussion missile dispensers. If a ferret's defenses were overwhelmed, its droid brains were set to purge the onboard computers and trigger a baradium charge to detonate its missile cache, destroying the vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A small quantity were refitted as couriers to rapidly shuttle one or two occupants, or important material, to desired destinations.
