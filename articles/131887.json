There is a set of specific hints, called \"Empire Busters,\" at the end of each stage. These hints usually pertain to the stage they follow, but often apply to any section of Shadows of the Empire. An appendix explains the pros and cons of each of the four \"prizes\" you receive after wrangling all the challenge points for a skill level.\nThis book is written for the game's default skill level (medium), but strategies and challenge point locations remain the same regardless of the level you play. Killing enemies will be hard\u00ader or easier, depending on your chosen skill level. Included is a set of winning strategies\u2014 and, indeed, if you follow this guide you will defeat the game. However, playing a compli\u00adcated game like Shadows of the Empire inevitably leads you to develop your own route to victory. Remember, this book is merely a guide outlining one or two strategies for each chal\u00adlenge in the game. Use it to enhance areas of game play you find difficult, not to restrain your creative instincts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skill Level Distinctions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There are, of course, four skill levels in Shadows of the Empire. This book is written from the perspective of the default (medium) skill setting, but the strategies remain the same regardless of your skill setting.

Shadows of the Empire was/is an incredibly engrossing experience and working on this book certainly did not seem like work at all. Well, OK, it-did seem like work. But it was fun. My hat goes off to everyone at LucasArts that had a hand in developing this game, but special thanks must go to Brett Tosti, Darren Johnson, Mark Halgh-Hutchinson, and Eric Johnson for providing quality support and a helping hand whenever I needed it. To the crew at Prima I must again offer sincere thanks. Dan Francisco, Juliana Aldous, and Scott Schrunn all knew exactly what to say to prop up my ego when the crunch was on, and for that I am grateful (and surprisingly well adjusted). I would point out Connie Nixon's truly exceptional design, but that speaks for itself. Thanks also goes to Chris Balmain, who guided this book with a fluffy iron hand from start to finish. Don't be fooled, Chris is the real thing, we'll all be working for him one day. Lastly, I'd like to thank Kent Fillmore for getting me into this business, and Chris and Emily Parsons for just being themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
