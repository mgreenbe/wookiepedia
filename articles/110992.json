During the raid, the rebel crew consisted of Hera, Kanan, and the astromech droid Chopper. Following the raid, the Ghost was pursued by four TIE fighters. While Kanan manned the Ghost's turret cannon, Hera piloted the ship. In the ensuing dogfight, the TIEs gained the upper hand over the Ghost and managed to inflict damage on the ship's deflector shield.

Hera then ordered Chopper to tell Kanan to take out the last remaining TIE.
