An assassin trained under Domain Shai was dispatched to the planet Wayland to attempt the assassination of Elan. New Republic forces thwarted the assassination attempt, however, New Republic Fleet Intelligence analyst Yintal was killed in the fight and the operation solidified the perception that Elan was a legitimate defector with valuable intelligence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
