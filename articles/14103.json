The local Maujasi Clans rebelled against the local government and allied themselves with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, conducting several successful raids on GAR supply convoys. The Galactic Republic then sent in troops to stop them. During a particular raid, Omega Squad was able to kill the Maujasi leader, Jolluc. The battle continued to draw on for a month and more troops which included Delta Squad, were sent to the planet. The battle also served as a testing ground for the 14th Infantry Brigade, a newly-created batch of clones created in secret on Centax-2. Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan recommended that the Republic abandon Haurgab, as the battle was pointless, believing the Maujasi would be just as much trouble for the Separatists and that no advantage would be lost if the planet joined the Separatists. As a result, the Republic eventually did withdraw its troops, ending the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
