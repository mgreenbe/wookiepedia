The Gotal told him about an individual who was allegedly the best pilot in the galaxy, but Grool dismissed it. Shortly after, the individual the Gotal had mentioned, Xiono himself, was playing holo-darts with an Aleen named Grevel and accidentally threw a dart into Grool's back. The Klatooinian confronted him, and Grevel simultaneously attempted to get his winnings from Xiono. Grool pushed Grevel aside, but he tried to intervene again, and Grool threw him into the arms of the Snivvian Nod. Grevel then threw a cup at him, and he threw Xiono aside. The cup hit a Rodian, who then began throwing cups at the Snivvians Nod and Narb, starting a full-scale bar fight. Grool came for Xiono again and pinned him on the bar until Jarek Yeager arrived to break up the fight with his blaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grool was later running his stall at the Colossus marketplace when Xiono came to him to make a deal.

Xiono was nearby, being confronted by Grevel, Nod and Narb. His droid, BB-8, then electrically shocked Grool, and the box of gorgs flew out of his hands and onto the Grevel and the Snivvians.
