In Con Man, Wray Nerely is a struggling, down-on-his-luck typecast science-fiction actor. Thus Tudyk, an actor, would have played another actor who had been cast in Rogue One. When it was announced that his scene was ultimately cut from the final version of the film, Tudyk responded: \"I was really looking forward to seeing Wray Nerely in Star Wars, but truthfully Wray Nerely would never get that good of a job. So it was probably pretty good that he didn't.\" Although it was initially announced that he would portray K-2SO in Star Wars: Andor, Tudyk later clarified that he would not appear in the first season, but would in later seasons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Work in Star Wars"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
