When her father was killed during the Battle of Botajef, Vevec was told by the newly-risen Mand'alor, Yaga Auchs, that her ex-husband Hondo Karr had become a traitor to the Mandalorians and was the one responsible for murdering her father. Vevec tracked Karr\u2014who had joined up with the Galactic Empire on Botajef, only to defect to the Galactic Alliance Remnant at later point in time\u2014intent on avenging her father.
