Lant freed Tantor and informed him of the squad's loyalty. With Tantor freed, the stormtroopers stole the TR-MB prototype and stormed the prison, freeing Luke Skywalker. The group trekked through Kalaan's canyons, picking up support from the Kalaanite resistance until they arrived at a Rebel base set up by Tyr Taskeen. From there, they were taken to Taskeen's fleet, where would presumably have been imprisoned temporarily along with their general. When released, they most likely continued serving the Rebellion as infantry under Tantor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
