As part of his training, the Human was taught how to resist Jedi mind tricks. Serving X1 in the latter's fight against the New Republic, the Human was at one point stationed on the planet Dathomir as part of a contingent guarding the Imperial prison, which X1 used to conduct cloning experiments. Eventually, X1 abandoned the facility and relocated his main forces to the planet Mustafar, leaving behind a small regiment, including the Human, to operate the Dathomir prison. After X1 left, however, a group of Nightsisters\u2014a sect of the native Witches of Dathomir\u2014attacked the facility. Almost simultaneously, the New Republic unit Grey Squadron arrived on the planet in an attempt to locate X1. Grey Squadron was led by the clone named X2, who was X1's genetic \"brother\" and also a Jedi Knight. X2 took with him a small portion of his squadron and left to investigate the prison, leaving the rest of his men at their landing site to guard their X-wing starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeing an opportunity to sabotage the enemy's efforts, the Human slipped to the landing site undetected and planted detpacks on the majority of Grey Squadron's X-wings. The resulting explosions inflicted heavy casualties for the New Republic forces and took many X-wings out of commission. During the commotion, however, the Imperial saboteur was captured by the surviving pilots. X2 soon arrived back at the site after finishing his mission at the prison and discovering that X1 had moved to Mustafar. The saboteur was brought before X2, who questioned him regarding what X1's plans were on Mustafar. The saboteur refused to speak, claiming that his training would protect him against any Force influence X2 could attempt. Angered, the Jedi then used the Force to choke the saboteur but was soon stopped and calmed down by one of the Grey Squadron members, Shara. The remainder of Grey Squadron then left the planet in pursuit of X1."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human saboteur was loyal to his master, X1, refusing to reveal the latter's plans to X2.
