The dish was a staple for the Gungan species of the planet Naboo, which was also the homeworld of the nyork. Dex's Diner, an eatery located in the CoCo Town district on the planet Coruscant, served the chowder as a lunch item. Dexter Jettster, the Besalisk chef and owner of the diner, considered the meal delicious and charged 2.1 for a cup of the chowder and 3.1 for a bowl. The chowder was served at Dex's at some point prior to the eatery's destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's rule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nyork chowder was introduced in the 2009 Hyperspace article \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written by Gregory Walker.
