Hundreds of years before 3 BBY the Fromprath lived on Dathomir but were forced to live in exile away from the planet after being forced out by the Dathomirians. They exploited the natural resources of the planet, which caused the Nightsisters to form a symbiotic alliance with rancors, in order to drive out the colonizers.
