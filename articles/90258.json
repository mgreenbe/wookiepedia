The Tarisian became a scavenger after the orbital bombardment, using his swoop skills to forage and recover supplies for the few scattered survivors. Centuries later, the remains of an old swoop track became known as Brejik's Run in Brejik's honor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Milos Brejik was first mentioned in the Codex entry for Brejik's Run in the 2011 BioWare's massively multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, and there are similarities between Milos Brejik and Brejik, a character from another of the company's games, the 2003 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. In the latter game, Brejik is a Tarisian male and the leader of a swoop gang. However, the character is killed by the player character in Knights of the Old Republic shortly before Taris's destruction, meaning that he cannot be the same character introduced in The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
