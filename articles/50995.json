He was previously condemned to a 12-year sentence in the Spice mines of Kessel, where he saw the deadly and terrifying spider creatures that prowled the depths of the mines. When he completed his sentence, the Pykes offered Fandita the chance to continue on as a shift boss. He declined their offer, swearing he would never go into \"the Dark\" of Kessel's mines again, and instead sought a position with the Mining Guild. He succeeded in joining the Mining Guild, and was stationed on the planet Vandor, where he frequented the Lodge after shifts with his co-workers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
