Along with moisture farming, the two also operated a hotel. The two occupations kept both busy to the point that they infrequently visited the family of Dama's sister, Beru Lars, who lived twenty kilometers from Anchorhead. Around 15 BBY, the couple got a new A-1 Deluxe Floater landspeeder. Some time after, the Brunks visited to the Lars homestead. There, Sam gave the recent news of the Podracing being made illegal by the Galactic Empire. During the visit, Sam was surprised to find that Beru's husband, Owen Lars, had removed his relatives' headstones from their graves at the homestead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
