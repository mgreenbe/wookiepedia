Fortunately for him, a gray reptilian creature jumps out to meet him, giving him a good lick, straightening the antenna out. BB-8 is lost and frightened somewhere deep on D'Qar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
