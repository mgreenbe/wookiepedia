It had a double-wing configuration and served in various roles, including that of a troop dropship, bomber, or transport. This model was utilized during the Sacking of Coruscant in 3653 BBY. During that battle, it was used in strafing runs on the Jedi Temple, which was reduced to rubble as a result. During the Cold War, the Republic strike team known as Havoc Squad tracked down one of these transports in use by the Empire to a remote canyon in the eastern Jundland Wastes, where it was reported to transport a Republic Strategic Information Service operative. Havoc Squad successfully extracted the operative, destroying the transport in the process. The Republic Colonel Laren Omas possessed one of these craft and used it as a shuttle named the Starbreeze during the Great Galactic War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
