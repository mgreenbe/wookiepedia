She instructed them to make their way through a tunnel in the well to meet up with her on the other side.

There she took it and gave it to Luke, who, after defeating Darth Vader and healing Leia's wounds, gave it back to her. She then left Mimban with Luke and Leia to join the Rebel Alliance, though not before admitting to Luke that rather than being a master of the Force, she was really a faker and a charlatan, capable of doing \"parlor tricks\" but little more."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
