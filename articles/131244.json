The player is a Rebel agent (presumed to be a kid, based on the target audience) disguised as a Jawa interested in joining Wimateeka's clan.

According to the plot, this is to prove your worth to Wimateeka. In actuality, however, it is to test the player's knowledge of energy, force and motion, simple machines, light, and magnetism.
