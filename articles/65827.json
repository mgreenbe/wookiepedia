Rau is a prisoner of the rebellion and is held in a cell guarded by two rebel troopers.

However, Rau is reluctant and thinks that giving the rebels safe passage through the Concord Dawn system is more than enough. He argues that he only made deals with the Empire and the rebellion to survive, and stresses that his true loyalty is to Mandalore. Sabine vows to keep trying, and Rau expresses an admiration for his nominal opponent if not for her \"traitorous\" past. Rau, in return, tries to talk Sabine into joining forces with him to fight for Mandalore.

Sabine remarks that it was too bad her people didn't learn how to resolve their differences.

When Ezra feigns ignorance of the rebellion, Saxon reminds the boy that he is dealing with a seasoned Mandalorian warrior, not a fresh-faced Imperial Academy recruit.

Sabine pretends to yield, and takes off her helmet despite Ezra's protests. Sabine passes the helmet to Chopper and quietly tells him to send feedback to frequency 337 on her mark. Sabine kneels while Ezra deactivates his lightsaber. When Saxon approaches Sabine and demands her fealty, she tells him that he is a fool and tells Chopper to send feedback to the Mandalorians' helmets.
