Truly arrogant, he believed himself a broader thinker than his ex-wife, who he claimed never understood what the Dark side of the Force had to offer, and to be far stronger than Victor and his 'little pals'. He did not, however, appear to be of a particularly sophisticated mind, as he was easily deceived by his own daughter and his means of turning people to the Dark side seemed to be making abrasive demands and reaching for his lightsaber if they said no."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krio Vin was a competent lightsaber duelist, capable of easily parrying three Jedi initiates' attacks simultaneously (Cole, Maya Phoenix, and Artemis Oophanoe) and intercepting a powerful blow from Mr. Zefyr.
