A new Galactic Federation Triumvirate consisting of the Jedi Order, the Fel Empire, and the Galactic Alliance Remnant is established. The new Empress Marasiah Fel embarks on an ambitious project to link the Outer Rim Territories with the rest of the galaxy. During a mission to the Carreras system, the Imperial Knight Yalta Val is ambushed and kidnapped by a rogue Sith, who imprisons him and steals his identity. This sets off a chain of events which leads to the Carreras Incident."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the rogue Sith's escape from the Carreras G51 communications array, Ania Solo tends to her wounded companions: the Mon Calamari engineer Sauk and the assassin droid AG-37. The damaged AG-37 convinces Ania to stop the mysterious rogue Sith by telling her that her ancestor Han Solo helped his friends because he knew that what he was doing was right. Meanwhile, Governor Biala and her men attempt to shut down the Carreras communications array only to find that it is being directed remotely by the rogue Sith from his secret base on the floating world of Mala. Meanwhile on Mala, the Sith impostor frees the real Yalta Val from his restraints and uses the Carreras communications array to make a galactic-wide broadcast. During his broadcast, the rogue Sith introduces himself as Darth Wredd and mocks the new Galactic Triumvirate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Wredd then attempts to execute Master Val before a live-galactic audience. Before he can carry out the deed, he is attacked by Ania Solo. During the struggle, Solo manages to pass a lightsaber to the Imperial Knight Yalta Val. Val uses the lightsaber to break free of his restraints and attacks Darth Wredd. As the Carreras communications array begins to descend into Mala's gravity, Governor Biala orders an evacuation of the station. Meanwhile, Ania flies back to the spacestation and rescues Sauk and AG-37. Despite gaining the upper hand over Darth Wredd, Val is unable to stop the rogue from escaping. Luckily, he is rescued by Ania Solo. Ania and her companions escape Mala on AG-37's freighter seconds before the communications array collides with the floating world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly later, Val's Imperial comm droid surfaces with Jao Assam, who despite the odds had survived being impaled by the rogue Sith Darth Wredd. AG-37 reasons that the comm droid rescued Jao out of gratitude for the latter traveling to the Carreras system to rescue it. He concluded that sometimes a debt of gratitude could weigh heavily on a droid. Jao receives urgent medical treatment from the ship's medical droid. On the galactic capital Coruscant, Empress Marasiah Fel and her fellow Triumvirate members receive news of the Carreras Incident. While details are patchy, they learn that a young woman named Ania Solo was involved in the destruction of the Carreras communications array."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
