In times long past, when the Mandalorians were a devoutly religious people, they believed the stars in the night sky over Mandalore to be the spirits of the fallen rulers of their cultural homeworld. According to myth, the Ka'ra represented a guiding council that the culture's former leaders would join upon their deaths."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time, the Mandalorians eventually developed into a more secular and less superstitious society. These more pragmatic and rational Mandalorians no longer looked upon the myths of the past as literal examples of the supernatural, but instead as parables. From ancient stories such as the Ka'ra and the Akaanati'kar'oya, they sought allegorical or philosophical insights, rather than factual truth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ka'ra were first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the Star Wars Insider article, The Mandalorians: People and Culture, authored by Karen Traviss and published in February 2006 as part of the magazine's eighty-sixth issue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
