It patrolled the world's seas, rescuing sailors in distress, battling pirates, and preventing conflicts between Irmenu's feudal fiefs from getting out of control. Service in the Navy was a religious obligation for members of Irmenu's noble families, and younger sons of the aristocracy who would not inherit could find honor in its service. Sail-powered ships like caravels and galleons were dominant in the fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Navy was still active during the last decades of the Galactic Republic.
