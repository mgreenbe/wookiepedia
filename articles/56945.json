George Lucas also stated in the commentary for the deleted scene that this was the same Greedo that appeared in A New Hope. However, in order to keep the Expanded Universe backstory developed for the A New Hope character intact, later references have retconned the Rodian who fought with Anakin as Greedo the Elder. However, in 2010, following the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode Sphere of Influence, which also featured Greedo, it was re-retconned that the Greedo in The Phantom Menace's deleted scene is indeed the very same Greedo of A New Hope."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
