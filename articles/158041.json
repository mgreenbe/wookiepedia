The design was based on Join, a recruitment poster created by Coba Dunivee for the Galactic Empire. Although similar to the regular Join poster, there were some key differences: In particular, the \"Join\" word was obscured by a painted on stylized version of \"Rebels\", with a blue starbird at the bottom right corner, and the stormtrooper helmet was obscured by a \"no\" sign."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
