Two stormtroopers were talking to each other when Chewbacca knocked their heads together and knocked them unconscious. A stormtrooper commander and two other stormtroopers ran into Chewbacca.

A stormtrooper was on a speeder bike and started to chase Chewbacca through the forest but Chewbacca pushed the stormtrooper off the speeder bike and took control of it.

Hiding underneath debris from the stormtroopers, Chewbacca made his way up and climbed to the top of a Wroshyr tree with a struggling Terbus behind him. Chewbacca looked down and saw stormtroopers loading Wookies into a shuttle. The angered Chewbacca noticed Crano's X-wing fly overhead but as Chewbacca tried to call to it but the X-Wing didn't notice him.

They question what he was and preceded to chase the Porg when he ran away. But the stormtroopers slipped and fell down a mudslide and then into the river as Chewbacca stared down at them from a tree. Chewbacca set up more traps for the stormtroopers to fall into and started to pick them off one by one. The stormtrooper commander had enough of it and ordered his remaining soldiers to for a perimeter around the remain encampment. Terbus caused a distract by tripping the alarm as Chewbacca went over to save the other Wookiees. But the stormtrooper commander stopped him and threatened him. But Terbus came by and chewed the cords off the cages and freed the Wookiees. The angry Wookiees received help by Beaumont and his group and the stormtrooper commander retreated. Daz Crano landed her X-Wing and joined everyone else as more of the Porgs joined together. Everyone was happy to see each other.
