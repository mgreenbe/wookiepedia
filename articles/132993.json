It would have been written by Al Williamson, who had been George Lucas's first choice for writing a comic-strip adaptation for the film due to reading his Flash Gordon strips. Although he managed to write up to the portion where the Lars family got R2-D2 and C-3PO within two weeks, he ultimately stopped working on it. The actual comic strip was written by Russ Manning. Williamson eventually did adaptations of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
