As Luke calls out to his father to save him, Vader's mind flashes back to those same words being spoken by Padm\u00e9 Amidala in his dreams. Vader claims that even now, he still loves Padm\u00e9. He fell to the dark side because he couldn't trust the Jedi, who were trying to tear the two of them apart. He sought power so that he could hold his family in his arms and keep them safe.
