At one time C6-E3-GE3 had been in charge of directing the other droids in the warehouse, until he was replaced with by C7-E3. Much to C6's dismay, C6 was re-assigned to assist C7 instead, and C7's arrogant and condescending nature infuriated him. C6-E3 attempted several times to convince his owners that the C7 unit should be shipped to maintenance, but as Vogga had little concern over the details of how the warehouse was ran, his requests were ignored."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When T3-M4 infiltrated the warehouse, the droid C7-E3 reassigned him to C6-E3. T3 attempted to convince him to let him go further into the warehouse but C7-E3 threatened to give T3 a memory wipe and make him undergo behavioral reprogramming. When T3 discovered the hostility between the two protocol droids, he offered a way for C6 to regain his old position if he would then grant him access to the secured areas. C6-E3 agreed, and when T3 destroyed the C7 unit C6 took over his old position until it too was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In cut content, if the player allowed the right conditions for B-4D4-GE3 to escape Czerka, he and T1-N1 were meant to reach Nar Shaddaa and find employment in Vogga the Hutt's warehouse.
