The Sith were dispatched to capture Khai and kill the Skywalkers; additionally, both sides were searching for the dark side entity Abeloth. These aims led to a duel between the two factions. While Annnax watched, her three companions engaged the Jedi and Khai in three separate duels and were quickly killed.

The Lost Tribe of Sith\u2014a group of Sith from the planet Kesh\u2014also encountered Abeloth in the Maw, and High Lord Sarasu Taalon convinced the Skywalkers to ally themselves with the Sith to defeat Abeloth.

Luke Skywalker had established a blood trail on Abeloth and was therefore able to find the entity on the world. The Sith also tried to find Abeloth, and Khai sent a secret message to her father, Gavar Khai, revealing that Abeloth and the Jedi group were on Nam Chorios.

When the Jedi group returned to their airspeeder, Annax jumped on their vehicle and demanded that Vestara surrender. She neglected to do so, and Annax reacted by sending the rest of her team to attack the Jedi and the Sith girl. While the Keshiri Saber stayed behind, the other three engaged all three enemies in one-against-one duels. Vestara fought against a petty officer of her father's; he tried to use the Force to throw stones at her, but she was able to strike her enemy down by stabbing her blade through his heart. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker cut his enemy in two and rushed to help his son. However, the younger Skywalker beheaded his opponent shortly afterward. Annax escaped after the defeat of her team, using a cable to climb a ravine before driving away in another airspeeder. Additionally, the Keshiri destroyed the Jedi's speeder, leaving them without a vehicle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith petty officer used the Force during the duel, an action that caused a Force storm somewhere on the planet, as the tsil crystals on Nam Chorios greatly boosted and redirected Force energy. A short time after the duel, Luke Skywalker received a message from the journalist Kandra Nilitz, who was able to convince the Grand Master to meet with her. Shortly before arriving at Nilitz's landspeeder, the Jedi group once again had to fight off several Sith, but they escaped and continued the search for Abeloth in the city of Crystal Valley. The Sith, meanwhile, also continued their search for Abeloth and the Jedi, leading to another confrontation between the three parties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The skirmish first appeared in Fate of the Jedi: Conviction, the seventh novel of the Fate of the Jedi series.
