It consisted of Pau'an Warriors that acted as infantry. The Pau'an military outfitted its warriors with ancient ceremonial armor and weapons due to the lack of necessary resources to outfit themselves with updated military equipment. Every warrior was well trained with their outdated axes and shields, and were able to utilize them with grievous results when near enemies.
