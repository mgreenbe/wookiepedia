After that, he decided to join the Alliance Military. His first assignments were fire-support. He used his strength to transport heavy equipment, and survived many intense lightfights before he was promoted to sergeant, when he joined Team 19. Whumparrin taught the rest of the team to speak Shyriiwook, thereby eliminating a lot of communication problems. He became the team's heavy weapons specialist and worked on administrative duties with the droid C-7NO."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
