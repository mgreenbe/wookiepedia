The Selvaris system is also the rendezvous point for the Yuuzhan Vong's prison transfer convoy, so the Galactic Alliance's plan is to save most, if not all, of the prisoners at the planet. The reason that the Galactic Alliance sees to saving the prisoners of this particular convoy is because the likes of Captain Judder Page and Major Pash Cracken are needed to lead and rally other planets against the Yuuzhan Vong.

Here, it turns out that the system's inhabitants have been fending themselves off against the Yuuzhan Vong for several weeks since the disruption of the HoloNet thanks to the Vong's adaptability in their biotechnology. Nevertheless, despite the fighting, the crew aboard Caluula Orbital agree to fix the Falcon up. And though Han and Leia Organa Solo help out in the space station's last stand against the Vong, they eventually escape to ship their load of freed prisoners back to the Galactic Alliance, despite the fact that some of them, such as Pash Cracken, have decided to stay behind in order to keep fighting the Vong. Later on, however, the Alliance finds out that Caluula had willingly surrendered in the fall of its space station, but asked the Vong to allow scientists on the planet because of a natural phenomenon called the Nocturne of the Winged-Stars, which occurs quite rarely on the world. Han and Leia, with several other accomplices\u2014Meloque, Wraw, Kyp Durron, and Judder Page\u2014arrive on the planet disguised as scientists and meet up with two other spies, Ferfer and Sasso, to help them kill Caluula's yammosk, which appears to prove crucial to the Yuuzhan Vong's plans in attacking the Galactic Alliance capital world of Mon Calamari (in reality, this is merely a ploy for tactical purposes on the Vong's behalf)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The team members, however, are intercepted by specialized Vong patrols, with both spies killed, and Han, Leia, and the others are captured and are taken to be executed at the yammosk.

Kyp theorizes that the Vong on Caluula died because of an earlier deployment of the Alpha Red pathogen on the world. Wraw confirms this, saying that he was sent here to report on Alpha Red's effectiveness; this explains why Caluula had willingly surrendered in the first place. Han, Leia, and most of the others find this to be a potential galactic catastrophe because Alpha Red could even harm and/or kill other life across the galaxy, just as the indigenous life, notably the winged-stars, on Caluula had suffered, which also explains the hindering of the Nocturne that had been noticed earlier.

Since then, Harrar had lost faith in his religion after discovering the connections between his species and the living planet. This was originally discovered by the late Yuuzhan Vong Master Shaper Nen Yim, who was killed by Nom Anor in order to prevent her from stopping him from trying to malfunction Zonama's hyperdrive cores and subsequently killing it in the process (the latter had failed, obviously). Sekot comes to recognize Harrar by his species via the encounter that it had with the Vong a few decades earlier. Because of Sekot's recognition of the Vong, it explains to the characters, through its possession of Magister Jabitha Hal, that the original Yuuzhan'tar back in the Yuuzhan Vong's home galaxy had stripped the species of their Force-sensitivity. The reason for this was because the ur-Vong were becoming a violent race who craved war and brutality, which was what led to their hatred for mechanical machines as they fought the opposing droids that invaded their galaxy. So the ur-Yuuzhan Vong's original homeworld had seen fit to cut them off from the Force. This caused them to experience great pain, as they had lived in symbiosis with the original Yuuzhan'tar, rendering them unable to contact the Force or be detected in it ever again. This was among one of the reasons that the Vong hold pain and death as such an essential part in their religion, because, when they were cut off from the Force, they realized that pain and death were the only other forms of living symbiosis that they could achieve. Thus, the ur-Vong had cemented this new way of life into their religion by creating gods who look so positively upon their creations as those creations embrace what all living beings must suffer in life and more. And when the ur-Yuuzhan Vong had devastated their own galaxy as a whole in the Cremlevian War, they were forced to journey into the Intergalactic Void in search of another galaxy for them to conquer and live in, thus leading into the eventual invasion of this galaxy. Meanwhile, Jacen Solo experiences the return of the voice that told him to \"stand firm\" at Duro three years earlier, along with the vision of failing to catch the lightsaber tossed to him by his uncle Luke.

This promotion was influenced under the mistaken belief that Nom Anor had killed Zonama Sekot. But unfortunately for him, he still has to bare the existence of High Prefect Drathul, who is secretly a Quorealist, a member of the forbidden party who believes that Shimrra's late predecessor, Quoreal, was killed dishonorably by the current Supreme Overlord, and that Quoreal was right about refusing to conquer the galaxy. Drathul is vaguely aware of Nom Anor's lack of faith in the Vong religion and in Shimrra's competency as the Supreme Overlord. So the High Prefect tries to use this as leverage in order to coerce Nom Anor into being a Quorealist. And what is even worse for Nom Anor's return to Vong society is that his own Jedi heresy, which he conducted as Yu'shaa, Prophet of the Shamed Ones, continues to stand strong by the will of the Shamed and Worker castes even without his leadership, thanks to his once-trusted aide, the Shamed warrior Kunra. This is evident as the heretics break up the sacrifice of the Alliance captives, saving many of them, including Major Cracken, even at the cost of some of their own lives. And even with Shimrra demanding the deaths of many heretics and potential heretics alike, the Jedi heresy still stands strong. All of this simply adds to the list of problems that Shimrra and the rest of Yuuzhan'tar are going through with the World Brain still making unpleasant activities to disturb the Yuuzhan Vong high command in spite of Shimrra's attempts to tame it, the rumors that the Supreme Overlord is growing mad with power, and that loss to the Galactic Alliance is inevitable. One of the few things guaranteeing Shimrra's position in power is his own royal guard of Slayers, genetically modified warriors designed not only to protect him loyally, but also specialized to kill Jedi (they also pilot the specialized ships seen by Han and Leia in the Selvaris and Caluula systems, as well as being responsible for Ferfer and Sasso's deaths and Team Meloque's capture on Caluula)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Zonama Sekot arrives in the Coruscant system, coinciding with Nom Anor's false prophecy to the heresy from The Final Prophecy as it appears in Yuuzhan'tar's skies. This coerces Warmaster Nas Choka to recall his armada from their winning battle against the Galactic Alliance at Mon Calamari to Yuuzhan'tar. It also distorts the mainstream social hierarchy of the species and causes great joy in the Shamed Ones and workers for bringing their oppressive rulers down. Shimrra even seems to go insane, as Nom Anor sees from the demands that the Supreme Overlord makes to the highly placed officials at his command. This apparent insanity is further proven when Shimrra, who believed that the Yuuzhan Vong no longer need their gods, whether or not the deities actually existed, tells Nom Anor that he declares open war on Yun'o (the gods), even though it was likely that Shimrra never really believed in the gods throughout the course of his reign, while he tells the rest of the Elite that it is time to prove themselves independent of Yun'o. The Dread Lord explains himself by saying that Yun'o fear that they will lose their own power over the Yuuzhan Vong as the species gain their independence from the deities; pitting Zonama against the Vong is just one final test to see if the species is worthy of ruling the galaxy, and, as Shimrra announces, the galactic invaders have already been provided the means of killing the living planet thanks to the Alpha Red-infected Slayer ship (since Zonama's biology is closely related to the Yuuzhan Vong and their creations' own biology, it can kill the living planet). Suspicions to Shimrra's insanity further increase when he orders the deaths of all potential future Supreme Overlords meant to replace him when it was time for his reign to end, and to put an end to worshiping all gods but Yun-Harla in order to provoke anger from the other deities, as part of the declaration of open war. But despite these suspicions, these orders from the Dread Lord are successfully carried out as he also demands for the deaths of all the rioting heretics, which the warriors begin enacting loyally. Meanwhile, as the Galactic Alliance loses its great Admiral Gial Ackbar from old age, its military passes through Vong defenses at the captured planet of Corulag after a victorious battle, making it possible for an advance on Yuuzhan'tar."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Part Three: A Time to Every Purpose"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, the Galactic Alliance forces finally arrive at Yuuzhan'tar, and Shimrra telepathically orders the World Brain to destroy Yuuzhan'tar so that if the Yuuzhan Vong lose against the Alliance, they will not have Coruscant to reclaim.

All of this marks the beginning of Recapture of Coruscant. And while the Galactic Alliance forces duel the Vong fleet in space, on Yuuzhan'tar, around Muscave, and at Zonama Sekot, Han, Leia, and Harrar lead a mission aboard the Millennium Falcon to either convince the World Brain to cease its efforts of trying to destroy Yuuzhan'tar or kill it. But they are then captured by Yuuzhan Vong forces led by Drathul, and Han, Leia, Harrar, C-3PO, R2-D2, Cakhmaim, and Meewalh are taken by them in order to be executed at the Well of the World Brain as sacrifices to the creature. Meanwhile, Mara Jade Skywalker, Tahiri Veila, and Jedi Master Kenth Hamner fight alongside the heretics and their Alliance allies against Shimrra's forces, and Tahiri comes into contact with Nom Anor. She captures him and holds him for Mara to come over so that the latter can see it her way as to how he should be punished for all of the wrong that he had committed throughout the war. However, Nom Anor escapes Tahiri's grasp and flees, but Mara chases him down into an abandoned building. After a brief fight between the two of them, Mara defeats and nearly kills Nom Anor for giving her the coomb spore virus years earlier and for all of the other misdeeds for which he had given the Jedi and the late New Republic during the invasion. But the false Prophet pleads for mercy, telling Mara that he had changed as Yu'shaa; he also knows that even if his species wins the war, Coruscant could never be Yuuzhan'tar; and finally, killing Nom Anor would be an act of vengeance, of the dark side of the Force, which would greatly break Mara's son, Ben's, heart. So, even though Mara does not believe a word he said, she spares him for others to decide his fate after the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, assuming that the Galactic Alliance will win. He also tells her that Shimrra had ordered the Alpha Red-infected Vong ship, transferred from Caluula, to Zonama Sekot, as it is set to kill the living planet. So the Jedi and heretics travel to the Well of the World Brain to save Han, Leia, Harrar, and the others from being executed and subsequently warn the Galactic Alliance forces about the Alpha Red-infected Vong ship headed for Zonama Sekot. The latter situation is all for naught as that ship successfully evades the Alliance and Zonama's defensive forces to arrive at the living planet.

Jacen, thanks to the mental connection that he made with the World Brain, breaks Shimrra's own telepathic connection over the planet-controlling dhuryam and convinces it to cease its destruction of Yuuzhan'tar. This prevents Han, Leia, and Harrar from killing the World Brain (Han, Leia, and Harrar's hostage, Master Shaper Qelah Kwaad, had told them that it would be impossible to sway the dhuryam of Shimrra's commands).

While Page and the Katarn Commandos storm the lower levels of Shimrra's Citadel, Luke and the Solo twins battle their way through Vong warriors as they travel up the mountainous worldship.

Then the Citadel begins to sway and tip in all directions, making the Jedi think that the World Brain is doing this in order to help them combat the Slayers, but the battle becomes all the more difficult for both parties because the swaying and tipping is affecting both groups' performances against each other. In the end, though, the Slayers are all killed in combat against the three Jedi despite the special Yuuzhan Vong warriors' efforts thanks to their opponents' awesome skills with their lightsabers, combat training, and the Force. However, after apparently forcing his Citadel to stay put in its regular placement because of the mental connection that he has with it, Shimrra knocks Jacen unconscious when the latter tries to attack him, knocks away his lightsaber, and begins to suffocate Luke with his special amphistaff, the Scepter of Power. Then the Supreme Overlord prepares to kill Luke by utilizing the lightsaber of the late Anakin Solo (the lightsaber was collected by the Yuuzhan Vong after Anakin died at the Mission to Myrkr two years earlier, and which was brought to Shimrra after the late Ganner Rhysode used it against the galactic invaders prior to his own death around the same year). Disregarding the Vong's hatred of mechanical technology by harboring Anakin's lightsaber in order to show Luke how it feels to be fighting something that is part of, or at least bears similarities to, their society, Shimrra reflects on his species' battle against Zonama Sekot, the living planet that they feel should be sacred to them, but was thrust into fighting them by their enemies and, apparently, their gods (even though the Vong's sacred texts stated that attacking a galaxy with a living world in it was sacrilege anyway). Meanwhile, Jaina follows the Supreme Overlord's Shamed familiar, Onimi, into the control section of the coffer.

Onimi believes that the Jedi are the avatars of the Vong gods, with Jaina being Yun-Harla, the Trickster goddess, which she used as a persona in the latter half of the invasion as psychological warfare against the Vong. This supports Onimi's motivations as he explains that he was once a Shaper who fused his brain with yammosk tissue in order to gain knowledge for what he discovered to be the empty eighth cortex of Shaper science. The eighth cortex was meant to find a way to save the Yuuzhan Vong from the decades of violence against each other as they crossed the Intergalactic Void in order to arrive in the galaxy. Onimi, in his goal of trying to find a way to save his people via the yammosk fusion to his brain, became a Shamed One for this. He then blamed Yun'o, especially Yun-Harla, for his afflictions in their motivation for retaliation against the Shaper who was trying to divulge their divine knowledge. However, Onimi found that he had regained the Yuuzhan Vong's lost connection to the Force (mistaking it for power from the gods, however), and then used it to manipulate Shimrra via mind-control into invading the galaxy. Behind the scenes, at Shimrra's throne, Onimi was the one who really led his species into the invasion, as he previously confirmed, and he originally thought that the war was just a test by Yun'o assigned to him and his species in order to see if they were worthy of the worlds that the galaxy had provided. But as the war went on, Onimi later evaluated that the gods wanted to destroy him and his rule with Shimrra acting as his puppet, and thus, destroy the Yuuzhan Vong as a whole. He asserts that Yun'o would not want one with such power to be stronger than they were if this was the reason that their creations were losing the war, especially with the living planet of Zonama Sekot now among those battling the Vong. Since these events have transpired, Onimi had lost his mental hold on what was left of Shimrra's psyche because he had been preoccupied with defeating the Yuuzhan Vong's enemies, which was what brought upon the false Supreme Overlord's \"insanity,\" as Nom Anor observed as the final battle of the Yuuzhan Vong War begun. It is also revealed by the real Supreme Overlord that he was responsible for the swaying and tipping of the Citadel. Onimi performed this by using the mental connection that he had with it, which was obviously greater than Shimrra's, in order to increase the chances that the Slayers had in winning the battle. Now, even with the presence of Zonama Sekot, Shimrra's death, and the fall of Yuuzhan'tar, Onimi believes that he will be able to become a god with Zonama's destruction via Alpha Red.

As for the Alpha Red-infected ship, Zonama Sekot managed to repel it before the vessel could arrive at the living planet. The rest of Alpha Red is destroyed by the Galactic Alliance, considering that it is no longer needed. Director of Galactic Alliance Intelligence Dif Scaur, for his actions in creating Alpha Red with the Chiss Ascendancy, is quietly forced to resign by Alliance Chief of State Cal Omas and is replaced by Belindi Kalenda. Sekot also brought down all warships in its immediate vicinity\u2014both the Alliance's and the Vong's\u2014down to Zonama's surface, getting rid of the invaders' weapons and halting the entire battle around it. And after the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, the Peace Brigade is disbanded and Choka makes a deal with the Galactic Alliance at the Sekot Accords; the species will be spared, in spite of the invasion that they had caused, which resulted in 365 trillion native galactic deaths, and the Vong will be brought to Zonama Sekot. During this time, Sekot realizes that it is the seed of the original Yuuzhan'tar, and, taking on the form of Vergere, it shares this information with Luke, Jacen, and Harrar, which is something that the Yuuzhan Vong themselves will soon come to realize."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Choka and his remaining obedient forces collect all other remaining Yuuzhan Vong forces across the galactic invasion corridor for Zonama\u2014especially those who have not heeded Choka's orders to agree to the Sekot Accords. The living planet then takes the remaining Vong in the galaxy and travels into hyperspace. From this hyperspace jump, Zonama Sekot disappears back into the Unknown Regions so that the Vong will be safe from vengeful galactic denizens, such as the Bothans, who still have their ar'krai declared against them. On the planet Zonama, and by the intelligence Sekot, the once-violent species will learn the meaning of peace and regain their connection to the Force. Joining Zonama Sekot and the Vong are the likes of Danni Quee, Tekli, and Tahiri Veila, because Danni and Tekli want to study the living planet while Tahiri, being half a Vong because of her fusion with her Riina Kwaad personality, wants to help the species regain the Force and become peaceful. The Galactic Alliance also automatically reclaims Yuuzhan'tar as Coruscant as part of their victory, rebuilding what the Vong have destroyed and keeping some of what they introduced to the planet for vanity reasons, including the World Brain, a sign of compromise that even Bothan Admiral Traest Kre'fey appreciates. Though it would be unlikely that Coruscant could be properly habitable within any foreseeable amount of time, the citizens of the galaxy are optimistic. In the meantime, the Galactic Alliance relocates their capital to Denon as Coruscant heals thanks to the Galactic Alliance and help from Vong Shapers that Zonama Sekot didn't take off with. Admiral Kre'fey, meanwhile, is promoted to Supreme Commander for his heroic efforts in rescuing Coruscant from the enemy's clutches, replacing Sien Sovv."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke announces that coinciding with the war's end is the beginning of the New Jedi Order's belief of the Unifying Force. This belief also allows the Jedi to embrace the idea that the best way to serve the Force is to act accordingly to their consciences and, for all those who wish it, stay out of the affairs of the Galactic Alliance in the postwar galaxy. Jacen, in the aftermath of achieving oneness with the Force in his fight with Onimi, decides to go off on a sojourn throughout the galaxy in order to study numerous beliefs and theories about the Force, train under them, and find out which Force belief will be the most appropriate for him to follow now that the war is over. Meanwhile, Imperial Remnant Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, as a token of his gratitude to the Galactic Alliance for helping the Remnant fight back against the Yuuzhan Vong, gives Han and Leia the Alderaanian moss painting, the Killik Twilight, which Han and Leia lost to Grand Admiral Thrawn 21 years earlier when the recently-married Solos were on a mission to Tatooine. Cherishing it as one of the few remnants of her destroyed homeworld, Leia is especially thankful to Pellaeon for giving her the memorabilia. Jaina is forced to finish her relationship with Colonel Jagged Fel because of Jag's duties to the Chiss and Jaina's duties to the rest of the galaxy, though Jag promises that whenever he can, he will visit Jaina as a galactic ambassador of the Chiss Ascendancy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The novel finishes with many of the characters, including Jacen before he leaves for his sojourn, going back to Kashyyyk in order to honor the late Chewbacca, who gave his life early in the war at Sernpidal so that Han and Anakin Solo, along with many other inhabitants of the planet gathered aboard the Millennium Falcon at the time, could live when the Praetorite Vong, the specialist\u2014and treacherous\u2014advance force of the extragalactic invaders, destroyed the world. Han plants Anakin's lightsaber on Chewbacca's memorial so that if another threat like the Yuuzhan Vong were to arise in the galaxy ever again, as Luke announces, someone worthy of Chewbacca's honor and courage will take the weapon and conquer that potential menace. The characters then have a celebratory feast, finding humor and relief in the fact that, once again, the galaxy is at peace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Release"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon release, The Unifying Force hit the New York Times Bestsellers List, going on to spend a total of two weeks on the list.
