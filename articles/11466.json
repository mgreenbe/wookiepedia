It was low-cost, partly due to its lack of defensive armament, effective and capable of extremely long range bulk transport duties.\nThe BFF-1 was designed to haul four Xizor Transport Systems Class-A cargo containers, attached in arrays of two on either side of the vessel's main hull, and modified into cheap yet capacious storage holds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Galactic Civil War, BFF-1s could be found in almost every container depot, cargo station, customs checkpoint, or shipping port in every sector. Considered easy targets by raiders because of their low sublight speed and lack of defensive weaponry, they often traveled in convoys defended by more combat-worthy starships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The BFFs in the first X-wing game were also used as hangars, bases, facilities, repair yards, 'platforms', and haulers.
