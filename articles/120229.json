As she grew up, she became an apprentice to Inquisitor Jerec, who completed her training as a Dark Jedi. She was one of Jerec's most loyal followers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sariss never knew that she was the daughter of Lord Cronal, one of the Prophets of the Dark Side who raised her in the dark ways of the Force on Dromund Kaas. There, Sariss first met her future master, Jerec of the Inquisitorius in the Galactic Empire. Because Cronal held to a creed of violent nihilism, the mere existence of his daughter constituted a shocking offense, as it was tribute to creation instead of destruction. Consequently, Sariss was disavowed by her father in the most horrid way he could conspire. Cronal not only allowed his fellow Prophets to freely engage her in carnal relations, but he also partook in the repeated rape himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Prophetess\" was the alter ego assumed by Sariss on Tatooine, where, working in cooperation with local governor Tour Aryon, she posed as a local fortune teller as cover for her true job as a spy for the Secret Order of the Empire. As a fortune teller, she claimed that Wuher was the reincarnated soul of Cedo Partu. Wuher never allowed the Prophetess to enter Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the hours before the Battle of Yavin, as part of her espionage, she trailed Jabba Desilijic Tiure and his bodyguards to Docking Bay 94 in Mos Eisley. Shortly thereafter, Sariss had to quickly make way for a group of stormtroopers rushing to the docking bay in a vain attempt to prevent the escape of the droid R2-D2, holder of datatapes containing the stolen plans of the first Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the rebellion on Tatooine that followed the Battle of Endor four years later, Sariss abandoned her post to become a Dark Jedi apprenticed to Jerec, although outwardly she claimed devotion to the Empire's Church of the Dark Side. In her role as a disciple of the quasi-religion, she seduced a wealthy Epicanthix mineral baron on Panatha, to whom she became engaged. Sariss then seduced his son, Yun, whom she taught her \"faith.\" She convinced Yun to kill his own father\u2014then gave the baron's wealth to her master, and also presented him with Yun, whom Jerec took as an apprentice. In time, Yun would also come to regard Sariss as his master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the death of Emperor Palpatine in 4 ABY, Sariss assisted Jerec in his efforts to rebuild the collapsing Empire and locate the Valley of the Jedi, a Force nexus formed in the final battle of the New Sith Wars more than a thousand years before. After learning that a surviving Jedi Master of the Old Republic, Qu Rahn, might know the location of the lost Valley, Jerec blockaded the planet Dorlo to intercept Rahn in the midst of a mission for the Rebel Alliance. Sariss's master then dispatched a landing party led by herself, her apprentice Yun, and her compeer Maw. Hunted down by Maw's ability to \"smell\" fear and anxiety, Rahn's team managed to destroy the landing party's troop-bearing skimmer and flee aboard a CR90 corvette. The Dark Jedi trio pursued the Rebel craft, but their own skimmer was caught in the corvette's slipstream and crashed. Sariss and the others aboard survived the impact, though her helmsman did not survive Maw's wrath."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jerec was able to capture the Rebel corvette by deploying a tractor beam from his waiting Super Star Destroyer, the Vengeance. Sariss, Yun, and Maw regrouped with Jerec and their three cohorts on the Vengeance's bridge, where their master interrogated Qu Rahn. The Jedi refused to respond even as his Rebel companions were murdered one by one, then sought to goad his captors into his own execution; but Jerec instead resorted to violating Rahn's mind. He discovered that although Qu Rahn did not know the location of the Valley, his friend Morgan Katarn\u2014killed by Jerec several years earlier\u2014had known, and hidden a map leading to it in his home on the planet Sulon. Qu Rahn broke free and fought the assembled Dark Jedi, mutilating Maw and outmatching Sariss and the rest\u2014until Jerec intervened and slew the Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sariss was sent to Sulon with Boc and Yun to gather the pieces[source?] of the hidden map, which were discovered in the ceiling of Morgan Katarn's homestead by the droid information broker 8t88. She ordered her apprentice to accompany 8t88 to the city of Barons Hed to decipher the stone map while she returned to the Vengeance and reported on their progress. Yun soon transmitted the digitized map and destroyed the original on Jerec's order, foiling the efforts of another Jedi: Kyle Katarn, son of Morgan, who sought to beat Jerec to the Valley of the Jedi. The Dark Jedi were able to determine that the Valley lay on the planet Ruusan; Jerec mobilized his forces and established an excavation site on the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, Sariss spoke with Yun, conveying Jerec's acknowledgement that Yun had done well. She gave him his next assignment: to discover the status of Patrol Zulu, Able, Mary 341, which was long overdue. Sariss later accompanied Jerec when the Dark Jedi Master confronted young Katarn, furious at the Rebel Jedi's slaying of Maw on a landing pad near Jerec's personal cargo ship, the Sulon Star. Jerec sought to turn Katarn to the dark side by persuading him to kill his partner and love, Jan Ors, whom Jerec's men had captured earlier. Katarn managed to hold off his anger and keep to the light side of the Force, and Yun watched as Sariss pushed the Jedi into the Sulon Star[source?] then sent the doomed ship plumetting to the surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Katarn managed to escape from the Sulon Star in his own ship, the Moldy Crow, though he crashed the vessel in the process. He was later found unconscious by Sariss, Boc, and Yun and taken to be executed. As Sariss struck at Katarn with her lightsaber, Yun, in an act of pure instinct, deflected his master's blow, which collided with his own body and inflicted a mortal wound. Tears came to Sariss's eyes as she struggled to comprehend why Yun would turn against her. Yun eventually told her that Kyle was a true Jedi, and that he shouldn't be killed, and deserved a fighting chance. Watching her apprentice die, she chose to spare Kyle and engage him in a lightsaber duel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yet enraged by the loss of Yun, Sariss was determined to destroy the self-trained Jedi. She initially held the advantage, but as they locked blades she came to realize the meaning of Yun's final words to her: that Kyle was a true Jedi of the light side. Katarn countered her own use of a lightsaber technique known as the Flowing Water Cut and ran her through the chest with his blade. Sariss would die of the wound, and Kyle went on to rescue Jan and defeat the last of the Dark Jedi cadre, Boc Aseca and Jerec, once and for all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sariss was quiet and reserved, but a formidable opponent in combat and deemed the most skilled lightsaber fighter of the seven Dark Jedi, relying almost exclusively on her fencing skills instead of using additional Force powers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She was also the only known practitioner of Deadly Sight, allowing her a measure of ranged attack as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sariss was played by Valerie Wildman in Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II.

In all these instances, Sariss was voiced by Nancy Crocker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the non-canonical ending of Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, where Kyle chooses the dark side, he kills Yun instead of Sariss, and she later appears as Emperor Katarn's aide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "William C. Dietz and Dave Dorman, in their novella Dark Forces: Jedi Knight, add a further dimension to the relationship between Sariss and Yun.

In the novella, Yun's block superficially injures her in the arm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the audio version of Dark Forces: Jedi Knight, Sariss deliberately kills Yun when he tries to stop her. She shows no remorse in Yun's death which enrages Kyle leading him to kill her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The figure of the 'Prophetess' was initially only an uncredited extra appearing for a second in A New Hope. Afterwards, that figure's backstory as the \"Prophetess\" was created for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. Abel G. Pe\u00f1a, in his The Dark Forces Saga articles, retconned the Prophetess and Sariss into the same character.
