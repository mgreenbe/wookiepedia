Though they shared the Duinuogwuin ability to survive in the vacuum of space, the Kadri'Ra could only survive in space for a few days while Duinuogwuin were said to live in vacuum for months at a time. Some of the Duinuogwuins' more unusual abilities, like natural repulsorlift flight and biological cold fusion, were also absent in the Kadri'Ra."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kadri'Ra continued to grow through their life, reaching lengths of up to two hundred meters. They were protected by a tough exoskeleton, which expanded along with every growth cycle. Older, and therefore larger, Kadri'Ra could become a danger to themselves and others, often retreating to deep caverns or asteroid caves, where their exoskeletons conformed to their surroundings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kadri'Ra were wise and philosophical by nature. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, they were declared a non-sentient slave species by the Galactic Empire. Their immense strength and ability to survive vacuum made them popular targets for slavers, who forced them to become heavy laborers in construction projects or space docks. Slavery had reduced the Kadri'Ra population on Arapia from an estimated 140 million during the days of the Galactic Republic to a mere 14,000 by 0 BBY. The Force-sensitives among the Kadri'Ra also suffered, forced to hide their abilities or be killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saadoon-Kauldi, a crime lord and Rebel sympathizer based on Neftali in the Socorro system, was one of the galaxy's prominent Kadri'Ra during the Galactic Civil War period."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kadri'Ra were mentioned in the article Supernatural Encounters: The Trial and Transformation of Arhul Hextrophon, however the article was never officially published.

While most of the creatures that were brought forth from this union, the Kadri'Ra proved to be among the few exceptions, as they adapted the Duinuogwuin cultural benevolence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
