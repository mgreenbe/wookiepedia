His suit followed an ancient Sith tradition, in which the warriors of the dark side of the Force would adorn themselves in heavy armor. The suit's construction incorporated Sith alchemy to augment Vader's severely diminished physical strength and vitality."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The suit provided a suite of life-support system and gave Vader relatively free movement without having to use a hoverchair. It was damaged or broken several times during its use, necessitating upgrades and repairs. The suit was finally irreparably broken in 4 ABY, when Vader absorbed Emperor Palpatine's powerful Force lightning in his face aboard the second Death Star to save his son, Luke Skywalker, from certain death. After Vader's death, Luke ceremonially cremated his father along with the armor on the forest moon of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The armor encased Vader completely, creating a seal to protect his charred skin and lungs. It was also uncomfortable to wear. Vader slowly learned to live with the isolation and anonymity that the suit imposed on him. Vader had to change his lightsaber style to compensate for the weight, bulk and inflexibility of his armor. The electronics of the suit were sensitive to electrical discharges, though Vader added a limited amount of insulation to the suit after discovering this. To escape the armor's claustrophobic nature, Vader had several pressurized meditation chambers built where he could remove his mask and suit and still survive. Vader longed to be less dependent on his armor and tried at times to function without it, but he labored in vain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the weaknesses imparted by the suit, it also provided a number of strengths. These included greatly enhanced durability and stamina, numerous sensory enhancements, and protection from extremely inhospitable environments and biological weaponry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Design"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Helmet"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like traditional Sith armor and patterned after that of ancient Sith droids, Darth Vader's suit was made to be both intimidating and fearsome. The front was carved out to fit around his head and show his \"face.\" This helmet had a raised ridge that ran from between his eyes to the back of his head, where it merged into the durasteel, obsidian, and plasteel of the helmet itself. In addition, it was also rumored that the helmet's already strong metallic hull had also been further strengthened via dark side alchemy, with the specific technique not being found in the database of the Rhinnal Medical Academy. Two less jagged ridges swept over the eyes of Vader's mask proper and served to accent them. The jagged edges also acted as a means to deflect potential energy blows onto the thick shoulder armor. This helmet locked into the mask, via a pressurized seal comparable in integrity to a Class C spacesuit. Besides protection, it also stuck needles into Vader's skin when fixed in place, which feed neurological data on brainwave activity to the central chest computer, and possessed radiator conduction pads that were installed into the helmet as a means to allow excess heat to bleed through the metal surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mask itself went halfway around Vader's head. The mask's appearance was given a similar appearance to a skull in order to enhance the fear factor of the Dark Lord of the Sith. The top of this mask was crowned with a circular interface dotted with an array of square slots around a disc of silver. This disc served as an interface between the mask and the helmet. Made of black durasteel, these components were hermetically sealed and connected with a flat backpack that cycled air to Vader's lungs. The air pump itself was located inside the top of the mask, which, via a ventilator, supplies a distinctive rasp. An implanted enunciator linked to an electronic voice processor enabled Vader's scorched vocal cords to produce speech. Around the part of the mask covered by the helmet was the external neural sensor array. Also hidden beneath his mask were four red heat dispersion vents, accented by yellow wire. The face of the mask was somewhat exaggerated and angular, with two ridges above his eyes that fit in with those of his helmet. The optical lenses appeared bulbous. This front part of the mask was of a more highly polished black material than that of the back, being the more flexible of the two. The ridged bridge of the nose seemed lost in the largeness of the eyes, but jutted out in a manner similar to a bare Human skull. The mask's cheekbones were generally angular, curving slightly to join the nose at its base. The base of the nose was a silver multipurpose detector that acted as the suit's primary environmental sensor, and could measure radiation, temperature, and atmospheric toxicity and displays the information in the HUD, was rounded in shape, with a triangular grill growing out from beneath it that served as an air filter, further contributing to its skull-like appearance. The optical lenses served as visual filters, allowing for Vader to detect infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths, while also blocking out excess light, due to the inability to repair Vader's damaged retinas. In addition, the lens also came equipped with a HUD that supplied critical data automatically as an overlay if Vader entered new environments, including information about atmospheric composition, nearby bio-signatures, and others, which could also be selected via the mouth or tongue controls (by pursing the lips, or extending the tongue). The lens, likewise, came equipped with secondary eyeshields that activated within 5 milliseconds, automatically sliding over the optical blisters to prevent blindness when approaching intense light. Components for a disassembled SoroSuub DH-57 comlink were also built into the mask's interior, as a result of it being a cheaper solution compared to custom-designing a new unit. It also was equipped with audio enhancers and sonic dampeners, the latter of which were also capable of reducing noise as a defense against sonic weapons, and they can extend Vader's hearing range to 40 kHz, enough to be higher than a Ronto. It also came equipped with a voice synthesizer, which, upon picking up the electronic sounds from a built-in vocoder, translated Vader's otherwise weak speech to be audible, and also added a timbre, bass and amplification to produce an impressive amount of vocal quality."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A hermetic collar wrapped around Vader's neck and slanted forwards in the front to meet the mask at the bottom of its triangular grill. It was added in because the artificial vertebrae alone were of limited value as structural units. The back, which sloped slightly outward at the base of his neck, was studded with metal interfaces. The two sides of the front were edged by two tubes that followed the mask's edge until it reached the base of the triangular grill. At the end of these tubes were two silver studs. On top of the slanted front of this collar were several interfaces, with wires running back from it to the back of the collar. From the sides of the collar came two metal stems capped with a curved fixture. These touched the outer corners of Vader's mouth. The collar, along with the chest armor, was also lined with electrodes that feed information status of the suit's performance during monthly maintenance sessions at the EmPal SuRecon. The collar was also equipped with feeding straws that allowed Vader to feed himself from an implanted bladder filled with RepMed vita paste, and could be refilled either during monthly maintenance, or on demand. Despite this, however, a redundant system to accommodate intravenous feeding was also installed because of the vitapaste's terrible taste. The collar also came equipped with a vocoder in the jaw assembly to aid in Vader's weakened speech, as well as mouth controls that Vader could utilized to his advantage in combat, including visual overlays; optical magnification, comlink-frequency selection; boot magnetization; and targeted audio amplification for surveillance. The collar locks the mask in place via electromagnetic clamps."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Torso"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader's pectoral armor appeared to be one piece that protected his entire upper torso. The durasteel material was gray in hue with several black vertical stripes. Around the neck of the full-shoulder pauldron was a black chain, and connected to the upper seam of the armor was Vader's black, flowing, nearly floor-length armorweave cape. Coming from beneath the pectoral armor was a black tabard which was open in the front and reached down to the ground. The shoulder armor itself weighed 12.2 kg overall, was resistant to both blasters and energy blades, and was capable of withstanding hits from both weapon types with only minor surface pitting. A drawback, however, was that its weight made it difficult for Vader to raise his lightsaber to full height, though he could still raise his hands above his head if pressed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around his entire abdominal area, he wore a plastoid girdle that protected his organic and synthetic internal organs, and on his back, hidden by his cloak, he wore a flat black backpack. Over his solar plexus, he wore a chest unit that served to regulate many of the life-support functions of the suit, including the status of Vader's cardiopulmonary and neural systems. The chest control box had three slots, relating to neural systems data; respiratory systems data; and circulatory systems data for the top, center, and bottom slots, respectively, and several rectangular buttons adorning the unusually vulnerable piece of machinery. The blue button activated the suits auto control functions, while the red button, located below the blue button, activated the suit's manual override. The rightmost switch, located at the bottom, acted as a system reset while the rest of the four switches located at the bottom were programming touch plates. There were also two shafts located on the left and right of the control box, acting as the life function sensor arrays. The data slots accepted RepMed data wafers Ix44a and Ix44ax sizes, which, when inserted, uploads within 200 milliseconds full diagnostics of all suit systems for monthly maintenance. The uploaded diagnostic information, likewise, is required to be stored in a permanent archive. Although the chest computer and other systems were designed to run for weeks, they also were rechargeable via two access ports in the rear of the chest box. The fastest method of recharging involved attaching cables to a fusion furnace. His belt, which went over his tabard, and also was mostly black, had three metal boxes around the front. The middle one had a silver electromagnetic clasp adorning it that included the release button and audio sensors. The other two boxes were symmetrical blocks decorated with several green, yellow, and gray buttons. The left box was the respiratory controls, which contained six gray knobs for manual adjustment; a red system active indicator button; two green buttons composing of a reset switch (left) and an auto/manual toggle (right); and a gray rectangular surface that acted as a CO2 vent. The right box were the temperature controls, containing two green buttons that had the same purpose as the green buttons on the respiratory controls; a heat vent below the green buttons; a system active indicator button and manual adjustment knobs. The clasp also contained a compartment containing a spare energy cell in case of emergencies, as well as backup comlink and a tool kit for simple suit repairs."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Protective systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader wore a black ribbed, padded, multi-ply body glove that covered everything below his neck. This flexible, quilted suit was blast-dampening, and was made of a fireproof material that provided some protection against flames and corrosive gasses. The armor was constructed in ten layers, with each subdivided into three primary layers. The first primary layer was a self-sealing surface similar in function to a standard Emnat suit worn by most Imperial military officers. The outermost layer was a black insulating shell, and the inner layer was an Andwa gel-crystal matrix. The second primary layer dealt with impact protection from physical shock due to the irreversible damage to the torso. The first layer was Reifflex cellular padding which was also utilized for some Stormtrooper helmets; the second layer was orthofabric; the third layer was mylar laminate; the fourth layer was polychlorophene-2 fiber weave, while the final layer contained a rechargeable energy suit. The third primary layer related to the pressure and temperature regulatory functions of the suit. The first layer contained plastex pressure garments; the second layer related to temperature stasis and the third layer was a compression sheath."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was also a gasket within a suit that accesses the cartridge containing kouhunin chemicals to lessen Vader's perception of pain. The suit was also lined with sensors plugged to diagnostic systems to monitor Vader's pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neural interfaces and feed the data to the central chest box. The suit's temperature was likewise regulated via a heating unit installed on the back."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The outer cape and the tunic were made out of armorweave, as they provided protection from environmental damage and were light enough for adequate movement. The cape also acted as a protective cloak designed to block fire and acid jets, thus helping protect the suit's electronics. Similarly, the cape also minimized the possibility of grit and other contaminants from entering and potentially clogging up the filter."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Gloves and boots"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On his hands he wore black reinforced gauntlets, the right glove being a Mandalorian crushgaunt fitted around one of Lord Kaan's indestructible Sith amulets, and modified to include grip-augmentation circuitry. The gauntlets were also made of a micronized Mandalorian iron weave to protect Vader against glancing lightsaber blows during the patient's physical therapy sparring sessions, as well as deflecting a direct hit from a blaster bolt. The gloves, as well as the boots, contained magnetic clasps that snapped onto Vader's prosthesis tubing, in order to prevent him from shifting equipment or clothing during combat. Because of Vader's prostheses being effectively skeletal in nature, the gloves and boots also contained padding to provide definition, with the added benefit of confusing enemies as to which portions of Vader were cybernetic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader's shiny black all-terrain combat boots contained shin armor of durasteel that hinged on the sides of the foot of the boot to allow him to walk. The boots soles also contained a ferromagnetic core which could be activated by Vader's mouth-operated controls to generate a strong magnetic field similar to that of zero-g spacesuits used by soldiers to cling to starship hulls, and the shin armor was among the heaviest items in the armor's assembly. In particular, the shin armor's durasteel also rendered him invulnerable to stabbing strikes or shrapnel spray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Functionality"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Life support"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the extent of Vader's injuries remained concealed by his foreboding armor, it was known that he required an advanced life-support system to stay alive. This life-support system was integrated into his armor, thus freeing Vader of the limitations inherent in external life-support equipment. Circuitry throughout the suit monitored cardiac, respiratory, and neural systems, and three slot-like dataports located on Vader's chest unit allowed access to collected diagnostic information. Like Stormtrooper armor, the suit was equipped with a sensitive temperature-regulation system, which could be controlled by a function box on his belt. This unit was powerful enough to allow Vader to walk the surface of icy Hoth without any additional protection. Impulse generators lacing the armor provided electrical impulses to stimulate Vader's muscles, providing him with great mobility and strength despite his severely damaged muscles and nerves. To amplify this even more, Vader's strength and constitution were boosted by chemicals created with Sith alchemy. These were provided by the life-support apparatus in his armor, and were constantly injected into him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader's mask was one of the most important pieces of Vader's armor, and was vital to his survival. Without it, he would die unless in the pressurized, controlled atmosphere of one of his specially-made meditation chambers. Inside the mask were many needles that poked into his flesh to interface with him. The pressurized helmet monitored and regulated Vader's body temperature, contained radiators to diffuse heat generated by the suit's electrical systems, and contained a primary environmental sensor that continually evaluated Vader's surroundings for potential hazards. Lenses filter out light that could cause further injury to Vader's damaged corneas and retinas.They also provide infrared and ultraviolet vision, enabling Vader to see clearly in complete darkness. Sensors in the Sith Lord's helmet relay environmental data, which is then displayed as peripheral readouts. When piloting a starship, such as his personal TIE Advanced x1 prototype starfighter, Vader could slide a second layer of eye shields across the mask's eyepieces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On his belt, Vader wore two small system function boxes: the left system box featured a temperature regulation system and the right system box contained a respiratory sensor matrix. The center buckle featured an audio enhancement unit built into the electromagnetic clasp of the system status belt. Also included in the belt buckle was a small tool kit, spare energy cell, and backup comlink."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the suit doubled as armor, the life-support system was made to be somewhat tough, though the electrical systems themselves were delicate. Vader's armor was built around a plastoid girdle that protected the natural and synthetic internal organs in his abdomen. Though Vader's heart still functioned, his pulse was machine-regulated so that it could not quicken unless directed by the suit. More visible durasteel armor plates covered his shoulders, upper body and shins. His gloves and the padding on his chest and arms consisted of blast-dampening armor, and were made to be impervious to fire and well-protected against explosions, piercing, and poisoning. In addition, his helmet and mask kept light from blinding him. When damaged, Vader's pressure suit self-sealed against wounds and burns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once sealed, Vader's mask and armored suit could serve as an airtight spacesuit for at least a short time. He relied on an internal oxygen supply when he flew his TIE fighter in the Battle of Yavin, and he had survived surprise exposure to space during assassination attempts by mutinous Imperial officers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader's prosthetic limbs and all of the armor's functions were powered by dozens of rechargeable energy cells located throughout the suit that allowed Vader to travel for long stretches without recharging his armor. Even when the energy cells were depleted, he could maintain basic life-support functions through replaceable backup power cells. Typically, however, Vader recharged his suit within a meditation sphere, such as the one located aboard his personal Star Dreadnought, the Executor\u2014although he could access any standard fusion furnace for this purpose. In addition, several implants, referred to as a central implant cluster, were inserted into four of his organs. In particular, his cardiac implant took the place of his original heart and major arteries by pumping blood; the circulatory implant regulated blood flow; and the respiratory implant disperses oxygen throughout the organic tissues. All of these implants connected via a thick central cable to the chest computer, with an additional set of cables connecting the lungs and throat added after two and a half hours of microscalpel surgery. It also possessed a waste recycler similar to those employed by long-haul asteroid miners. However, all of the linkages were faulty and unreliable, thus forcing Vader to undergo frequent maintenance of his suit and be dependent on Imperial medical specialists for the rest of his life. The surgical droid DD-13 speculated that Palpatine deliberately allowed for these design flaws in order to keep Vader from rebelling. Despite how integrated the suit appeared to be with regard to Vader's cybernetics, virtually all of the external components of the suit could be removed in their entirety, as Vader was known to routinely remove both the suit and his prosthetic limbs during maintenance sessions."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Senses"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of his injuries, most of Vader's senses were irreparably damaged and thus were replaced by his armor. The dark hemispherical goggles that covered his eyes filtered out light that might have caused further injury to his damaged corneas and retinas and enhanced his vision; however, in enhanced mode the optical sensors in the half-globes shifted the light toward the red end of the spectrum. Its bulkiness prevented him from seeing the toes of his boots without tilting his head almost ninety degrees. Similarly, the mask's eyes were tinted red as well, this being visible under certain lighting conditions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Various displays inside Vader's helmet supplied the Sith Lord with a steady stream of data, amplifying his already formidable connection to the Force. His helmet's eye coverings provided infrared and ultraviolet vision, allowing Vader to see clearly even in complete darkness, and dampeners offered limited defense against sonic attacks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The medical droids had rebuilt the cartilage of his outer ears, but his eardrums had melted beyond repair in Mustafar's heat. Sound waves had to be transmitted directly to implants in his inner ear. Also, Vader could still smell naturally, but the mask he wore amplified his olfactory senses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader could take food through his mouth, but only when he was inside a hyperbaric chamber, since he had to remove his triangular respiratory vent. It was therefore easier for Vader to receive nourishment through liquids, intravenous and otherwise, and to rely on catheters, collection pouches, and recyclers to deal with liquid and solid waste. Though liquids were preferable, he still had the capacity to chew if he wished, though a nutrient feed provided Vader with all the nourishment he required. In the event that he did desire oral consumption, he would ingest RepMed vitapaste via straws located inside the grills of his facemask. In public, Vader was known to claim that he never ate or drank."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Limbs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "What remained of his real limbs ended in bulbs of grafted flesh, inserted into machines that triggered movement through the use of modules that interfaced with his damaged nerve endings. The stumps of each organic limb were implanted with neural links that relayed muscle impulses between the brain and the limbs, allowing for the limbs to move under conscious control. The servomotors likewise were modeled after the human form, allowing for movement and rotation possible for various joint parts including the wrists, ankles and knuckles. The limb pistons likewise utilized hydraulic fluid to operate, and as such required a replenishment of fluid as well as a piston realignment every six months and diagnostic check-ins during the monthly maintenance sessions. His mechanical appendages provided him with greater strength than an ordinary man; he could adjust the servodrivers and pistons in his forearms to provide his hands with enough strength to crush nearly anything they could grasp. With the power of his arms alone, he had the ability to lift an adult being off the ground, though he had always been able to do so with the Force, especially in moments of rage. When put to use, his mechanical legs would allow him to leap a considerable distance. His gloves incorporated a unique micronized iron that could deflect anything short of a lightsaber blow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Vader first had to walk with his new legs, he had to take slow, deliberate, thudding steps. By the time he was accustomed to his new legs, he retained the noisy gait, as it \"announced\" his coming, though he soon walked more naturally. The durasteel alloy of Vader's lower legs were enhanced by strips of armor similar to those that filled and gave form to the long glove that Vader had worn over his right-arm prosthesis; these leg prostheses were protected by the greaves of Vader's suit. The alloy strips were added in late into the surgery, to allow for Vader to walk relatively normally after simulations revealed that his stock prosthetic legs would buckle under the overall weight of his armor. Vader's boots also adhered to his artificial limbs and the soles could magnetically adhere to bulkheads if Vader wished\u2014during an assassination attempt in which Vader was put into an open airlock, his boots remained planted to the floor while his companions were sucked out of the breach. Later, however, he jumped into the void willingly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of the large amount of mass the overall armor contained (the shoulder armor alone weighed 12.2 kg), Vader did not often run, but was still capable of doing so if necessary. In addition, he was still capable of using Force speed, but rarely did so."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Spine"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader's back, specifically his spine, was not whole. Although his injuries on Mustafar did not significantly affect the spine, it still was injured to the extent that, coupled with the projected strain of the shoulder armor and the later-adopted hermetic collar, the original bones had to be replaced with artificial and structurally superior components. This forced Vader to wear a thick electrode-studded collar that supported his helmet to safeguard the cybernetic devices that replaced his upper vertebrae. The first few vertebrae of his neck were not natural and their sharp-edged regularity suggests that they were cybernetic replacements. Bone was broken at the second and third vertebrae, and possibly the first and fourth. The spinal cord itself was not broken above the third or fourth vertebra. The severing must have been nearly but not totally complete, as he retained the ability to breathe weakly for at least a few seconds unaided."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Breathing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader's helmet was the center of his life-support system. It was fitted with an air pump, which was connected to a flat filter system worn on Vader's back. Together, the backpack and the air pump continuously cycled purified air through Vader's ravaged lungs. A small, back-up air-processing filter was located in his distinctive mouth grill, which also doubled as a respiratory intake system. Vader's life-support system also included a chest-worn, computerized control panel unit that regulated his respiratory functions. From this chest panel, a thick cable entered his torso, linking to a breathing apparatus and heartbeat regulator. The ventilator was implanted in his terribly scarred chest, along with tubes that ran directly into his damaged lungs, and others that entered his burned throat, so that should the chest plate or belt control panels develop a glitch, he could breathe unassisted air for a limited time out of his mouth, which had not been burned to the extent of his throat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A belt-mounted function box housed the respiratory sensor matrix responsible for controlling Vader's breathing. Using it, Vader could easily adjust the controls on his armor to increase or decrease his supply of oxygen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader's breathing was machine-regulated, but his pace of breathing quickened during physical exertion and could be overridden by involuntary emotional reactions. In addition, his respirator would also let out a strained rasp if undergoing extreme exertion rendering him exhausted or if part of his armor is significantly damaged. This is especially evident when Vader lost his right arm to Luke Skywalker in their final duel. The respirator slowed down or sped up in response to changes in his remaining body's functions, but Vader was unable to stop it or hold his breath, nor could he slow it. Additionally, Vader's breather functioned even while he was speaking. However, it is apparent that a dampener or similar device had been installed into his suit by 3 ABY, as he was able to surprise Luke Skywalker in a dark passage near the carbon-freezing chamber on Bespin. Vader's ambush was only possible because he could temporarily quiet his loud breathing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lord Vader's breather was seriously damaged by Force lightning during his struggle with the Emperor. Although it continued to operate to some extent, the sound of the mechanism was reduced to a strained rasp, implying that the respirator was broken. The labored breathing sound persisted until his final unmasking."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His signature, labored mechanical breathing was the sound of the iron lung Vader was forced to wear. The med droids that had made the suit had inserted the redundant breathing tubes low enough so that, with the aid of an enunciator, his scorched vocal cords could still form sounds and words through a voice synthesizer in the mask. Absent from the enunciator in Vader's mouth grill, which imparted a synthetic bass tone, his own voice was little more than a whisper. Though limited by what the respirator could do, Vader could still make his respirator approximate a laugh or a sigh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader was able to speak even when unmasked shortly before the destruction of the second Death Star.

In addition to the partial replacement of Vader's spine, the rib-cage was also partially removed for the installment of the organ implants, with the sternum being replaced with a perforated metal plate accommodating the cables running to the chest computer, and at least one of his shoulder joints (the right one) being required to undergo partial prosthetic replacement. The remaining organic bones were likewise artificially modified via a tensile-strength augmentation through mineral solutions dripping through the nutrient feeds.

The process included eight hours to supply artificial implants to his internal organs, two and a half of which were dedicated to implementing the linkages. Budgetary limitations and lack of effective equipment imposed by the Empire also acted as a factor to the shoddy attempts at repair, with DD-13/HK speculating that the limitations may have been deliberately orchestrated by the Emperor in order to ensure Vader didn't rebel. 2-1B/DRX likewise ordered for Vader's helmet to be waxed with woodoo hide in the hopes that the resulting shine would distract Palpatine from the shortcuts they were forced to implement during the surgery.

The weighty cloak and pectoral plating so restricted his movement that he had difficulty lifting his arms over his head, only doing so when necessary, such as when Boba Fett set off the smoke detonator that nearly blew Vader off the edge of a cliff on Maryx Minor.

As a result of having artificial arms, Darth Vader fashioned Force lightning to suit this handicap preferring to use it as a last resort also because of the delicate life support he was more vulnerable to it. Vader would attempt to compensate for this vulnerability to Force lightning by upgrading the armor with some sort of insulation, though this provided only limited protection. However, while the insulation provided only partial protection against electrical discharges, the limit to the amount of current that it could absorb appeared to be fairly high.

He had retained both the academic knowledge of lightsaber combat and experience that he had attained as a Jedi, and began to borrow elements from all forms of lightsaber combat, even the highest and most dangerous ones. The style that resulted was a unique hybrid lightsaber form built around Djem So that incorporated anything Vader could use to compensate for his weaknesses. He primarily used his overwhelming strength and endurance to easily overpower his opponents, but added a great deal of precision to his technique. He would use his immense strength to overpower his enemies with or without a lightsaber by - for example - either grabbing a man's throat lifting him into the air and crushing it, or blocking a lightsaber hilt and throwing its wielder a distance, with one arm simultaneously knocking someone else a distance. In an extreme display of strength he lifted the emperor in the air with a full cybernetic arm even with the restriction of a missing hand, as well resisting force lightning and finally throwing him down the Death Star's core. Due to his incorporation of multiple styles into his own, his technique also became quite unpredictable. His speed and agility, though hampered, would eventually see drastic improvement, and by the time of his duel with the Starkiller clone, he was capable of moving faster than the human eye could perceive by using short, precise bursts of the Force speed ability. He also began to use the Force far more actively in combat, using it both to overpower opponents that he could not out-fence, or incorporating it into his lightsaber sequences to improve his overall viability as a duelist.
