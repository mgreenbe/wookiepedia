After constructing them, Vitiate sealed deadly guardians inside the vaults to protect the vault from intruders, where they hibernated until disturbed. Its existence was kept a closely guarded secret, so much so that its details were nothing more than a rumor among the Sith Empire's leaders. Likewise, the Republic Strategic Information Service had very little knowledge of the vaults, with expeditions to locate a vault turning up nothing, such as with Jen Alkier's hunt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The existence of such vaults were revealed to the Alliance Commander when the Commander sought refuge in one at the Sanitarium during the Commander's hunt for Vaylin.

However, this vault and the rest of the artifacts within were destroyed along with the Sanitarium during Vaylin's ritual."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Sanitarium's destruction, Gault Rennow hoped to find other vaults filled with priceless artifacts that he could sell on the black market.
