An enchanted world, Endor was notable for being the native home of the Ewoks, and being the location of the Battle of Endor, which would result in the downfall of the Empire and the first death of the Emperor Palpatine. Due to its proximity to the Unknown Regions, Endor was a relatively quiet planetoid both prior to and after the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Endor was also known for the vast amount of sentient species it supported, from baseline to exotic.

However, the Forest Moon also contained vast dry deserts and grassy plains, small oceans, secluded lakes, and mountain ranges. The moon's low axial tilt and regular orbit of its gas giant primary helped ensure a comfortable climate. The Forest Moon was temperate and mild, with polar caps regulating the sea levels. Flora life included Cambylictus trees and other large plants, thriving with many types of fruit including the Grava berries.

Few spacers had ever heard of Endor, let alone visited the moon. Of those who had, there were two types: those who continued on their way, not wanting to waste their time on such an unimportant puffball of a moon and those who had crash-landed in the forests due to the stellar anomalies, such as the Endor Gate black hole, in the area.

The forest moon met the strict requirements demanded by no less a person than Darth Vader; the location must be remote, and must have a diverse geosphere capable of sustaining Human life. Endor's location was quite advantageous; the Moddell sector was far from most Imperial outposts. Lord Vader thought that the Rebellion wouldn't expect a new base to be hidden so far from the Empire's seat of power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first Imperial scouting expedition, Survey Team IX3244-B, was led by Captain Toss, who recommended the Endor moon even before his team had explored the surface.

Toss, wanting the credit for discovering the new Death Star construction site, ignored him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lack of a detailed report displeased the Emperor who authorized the deployment of a second scouting expedition under Pfilbee Jhorn. Pfilbee Jhorn's team studied the Ewoks further and also discovered several other species including the Teeks, Goraxes, Yuzzums and the Sanyassan colony. In the end, only Pfilbee and two others survived the mission and went offworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 3 ABY, the Empire had established a research outpost on Endor, to enable further study of it. The \"harmless\" Ewoks encountered there did not go unnoticed by others in the Imperial hierarchy. Dr. Raygar, a servant of the Emperor, believed that these Ewoks guarded a powerful artifact he had been seeking: the Sunstar. Though he had originally intended to present the Sunstar to Emperor Palpatine, Raygar decided that with such a powerful artifact in his possession, he could overthrow Palpatine and rule the galaxy himself. He used the Sunstar to construct a devastating weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The incident ended disastrously for Raygar, as Ewoks boarded his ship, stole the Sunstar and escaped back to Endor. Admiral Kazz, who had never believed in the Sunstar's power to begin with, arrested Raygar for treason.

When Imperial teams arrived to construct the shield generator complex and other installations, they discovered Alliance Captain Junas Turner, who had come to the moon to locate the new Death Star. He was taken captive and sent to the automated prison station Balis-Baurgh, along with an Ewok named Grael. They would later escape, but it was too late to inform the Rebellion of the threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the Sunstar was now safely returned to Bright Tree Village, its power had not prevented Raygar from stealing it, and so the Ewoks avoided the Empire whenever possible. They despised the crimes against nature perpetuated by the construction teams for the generator complex, but could see no way to fight against such powerful beings, particularly Darth Vader, who swept several Ewoks away on a wave of flame."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This attitude changed when Wicket W. Warrick spotted an AT-ST tumbling over the Yawari cliffs. This proved to the tribal elders that the invaders could be killed.

It confirmed the existence of a second Death Star, being constructed over the moon of Endor. It was not realized then, but Emperor Palpatine had purposely allowed the plans to be captured, so that the Rebels could be coaxed into a trap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel fleet amassed near Sullust and was addressed by Mon Mothma. She and Admiral Gial Ackbar informed the battle-weary freedom fighters that the Emperor himself would be aboard the station, further emphasizing the need to win the battle, which would either way end the war. The entire operation was orchestrated to coordinate the fleet, commanded by Ackbar, and a substantial starfighter force, led by Lando Calrissian to jump to Endor through hyperspace and arrive to a shieldless, incomplete Death Star. A commando team would be sent on ahead in a coup-de-main (or, clandestine operation) and disable the shield generator and projector housed on the Endor moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The commando team, led by Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, and Luke Skywalker, used the stolen Imperial shuttle Tydirium to slip past Imperial defenses and land on the moon. After speederbike chases, Leia going missing, and other confusions, the team fell into a primitive trap set by the main indigenous species, the Ewoks. At first they saw C-3PO as a deity, and prepared to sacrifice the main team in celebration to the droid. The Rebels were soon freed however after Luke Skywalker, using a few clever Force tricks, and with the help of C-3PO deceived the Ewoks into believing the droid possessed powerful magic he would use against them if his friends were not freed. Afterwards, Threepio captivated the Ewoks with an epic recounting on the events leading up to their arrival on the forest moon. The Ewoks then inducted the Rebels into their tribe with great enthusiasm, cementing their cooperation against the Imperials in the forthcoming battle in which the Ewoks would play a pivotal role."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel fleet jumped insystem, prepared to assault the Death Star. With the shield still up, a massive Imperial fleet revealed itself, pinning the Rebels between them and the shield, and the climactic battle began. Luke, who had voluntarily allowed his capture by Imperials to meet Darth Vader in hopes up turning him back to the light, watched from the Emperor's tower on the Death Star as Palpatine's trap unfolded. On the moon below, Han Solo and the team had been captured. Things looked grave as the shield remained up, and Ackbar ordered the only thing the fleet could do: attack the Imperial Fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But Rebel fortunes changed. The Ewoks, thanks to an impromptu distraction from C-3PO and R2-D2, attacked the groundside Stormtrooper legions, and the Rebel commandos took advantage of the confusion. Despite early setbacks, the Ewoks and the commandos beat the Empire through guerrilla tactics, but the Ewoks' presence was the catalyst needed. In space, the fleet succeeded beyond all odds in attacking the Imperial Fleet. Several vessels, including the Super Star Destroyer Executor, fell under the guns of the Alliance Fleet. Solo's team finally destroyed the shield generator; Lando Calrissian, Tycho Celchu, Wedge Antilles, and a handful of other pilots descended into the now shieldless battle-station's innards to destroy the core; and Luke Skywalker, who witnessed Anakin Skywalker redeem himself from the specter of Darth Vader and kill Emperor Palpatine, barely escaped with a father who did not survive long enough to get off the Death Star with him. It was a victorious day for the Alliance. Soon, races all over the galaxy from Tatooine to Coruscant would be celebrating, and soon afterwards the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This was immediately followed by the Rebels relocating their main base from Haven Base on Arbra to Bright Tree Village on Endor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ssi-ruu Invasion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The day after the Battle of Endor, the local Rebel forces received a distress call from Bakura, and so the Alliance fought the Ssi-ruu Imperium from the Unknown Regions for a week.

This conflict was known as the Nagai-Tof War. The Nagai were an alien race, also from the Unknown Regions, and had encountered the Alliance of Free Planets on a number of occasions, but these were only minor missions to lay the groundwork for their invasion of the galaxy.

When Khabarakh arrived, she left the Millennium Falcon in orbit of Endor while she traveled with Khabarakh to Honoghr. Some time later, Grand Admiral Thrawn came to Endor and had the Falcon brought on board his ship upon discovering it in orbit.
