Once the First Order reached the outpost, Ren commanded his forces during the Battle of Crait while standing over Tavson's shoulder. When the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker emerged from the outpost and survived a full barrage of all of the First Order's weaponry, the Supreme Leader ordered the shuttle land so he could confront the Jedi alone. General Armitage Hux initially objected to this idea, but after Ren used the Force to hurl Hux into a wall, Tavson quickly obeyed the command. Skywalker ultimately was revealed to have only been projecting an image of himself on to Crait using the Force, and while Ren was distracted by the projection the surviving Resistance members escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jober Tavson first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017.
