Those protocols stipulated that every newly discovered species should be contacted and studied on behalf of the Galactic Senate. After the Republic was replaced by the Galactic Empire, the Unknown Alien protocols remained in application. Although the officers of the Imperial Navy did not like handling such tasks, many members of the Imperial Senate still supported the protocols, which made them hard to revoke despite repeated requests from the High Command. It was rumored that Emperor Palpatine himself was working to revoke them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
