She was leader of the pirate gang known as the Cloud-Riders and wore a distinctive set of armor and a mask that she later passed down to her daughter. At some point, she told Nest about a band of mercenaries who went to a peaceful planet for a resource they coveted, they kept coming back until one time, the people resisted and in retaliation the mercenaries cut off the tongue of every man, woman and child. Eventually the mercenaries became Crimson Dawn, one of many criminal syndicates who committed unspeakable crimes across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After revealing herself to Han Solo, Tobias Beckett, Chewbacca, and Qi'ra, Nest told the group the tale her mother had told her.
