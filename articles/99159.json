Although Ob was Cradossk's longest-serving aide, Ob felt little loyalty to Cradossk, and the conniving Twi'lek plotted with several bounty hunters\u2014including Cradossk's own son Bossk\u2014to overthrow his master. Ob dug out peepholes in the walls of Cradossk's throne room in the Guild headquarters, allowing him to monitor the Trandoshan's every move."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Bossk launched a coup against his father, killing him. Ob Fortuna fled the Guild headquarters for pastures new, booking transport with N'dru Suhlak. Unfortunately for the Twi'lek, Boba Fett was on his trail, and apprehended his vessel near Uhltenden. Fortuna was so terrified of being taken back to the bounty hunters that he strangled himself to death with a length of cable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boba Fett's bounty, however, was paid whether Fortuna was dead or alive.
