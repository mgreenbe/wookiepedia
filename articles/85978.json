He believed that if he was successful, he would be able to become a Black Sun enforcer and so gain more power and wealth. To capture the transport, Greeku sent out a distress call, claiming to be a Republic ambassador. The Queen then left its course to try and find the ambassador and the Strike then attacked the transport on the edge of an asteroid belt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Queen's hyperdrive was brought off-line during the attack, so Greeku led a boarding party over to it, to take control of the transport and then repair it. He planned to then fly the transport to Nar Shaddaa. However, the Republic dispatched an ILH-KK Citadel-class civilian cruiser to recapture the Queen, and it ambushed the Cutting Strike. Greeku then sent a transmission to the cruiser, warning its crew not to board the Queen. However, Republic troops were sent over anyway, and they attacked Greeku and the other Black Sun boarders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
