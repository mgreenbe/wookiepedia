During one of Bobbajo's visits, a band of Zygerrian slavers descended upon the town in their cruiser. Vun, Bobbajo, and the rest of the citizens of Reestkii were forced into the town hall building and held there while the Zygerrians raided the town for supplies. To calm the frightened villagers, who could not see out of the building's high windows, Bobbajo told a story. While Vun and the other captives listened to the story inside the building, Bobbajo's trained pets on the outside rendered all of the slavers unconscious, setting the villagers free."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vun reacted with disbelief and denial after Reestkii's capture.
