The defense minister was present in the Toydarian Royal Palace alongside King Katuunko and a few other ministers when Alderaanian Senator Bail Organa and Naboo Representative Jar Jar Binks approached them, asking for aid for the suffering Twi'lek on Ryloth. But Neimoidian Senator Lott Dod arrived in a bid to make sure that no relief supply ship is sent to Ryloth. Katuunko then proposed for a debate.
