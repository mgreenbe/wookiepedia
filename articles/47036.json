Cort was relieved when Corran Horn and Ooryl Qrygg showed up, shepherding a tanker of bacta hijacked from one of Isard's convoys.

Darklighter, convinced the Star Destroyer had followed him, gave Cort his blaster and took off, thinking he could lead the Imperial forces away if they were actually after him.
