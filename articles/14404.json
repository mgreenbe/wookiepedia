They were attacked by a group of stormtroopers and other forces, including those of Gizor Dellso's Rebellion, while above them X-wings and TIE fighters were still fighting. X1 was using his clone facility on the planet to try and make a clone of Skywalker, and released his clones of Wookiees to try and hold off X2."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Brother against brother"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "X2 saw X1, and they exchanged a few words. X1 now looked similar to the Emperor, Palpatine. X2 got the upper hand in the duel and had a chance to kill his brother. However, he refused to kill him, saying the prisons on Kessel will hold the pieces. X1, using a Force pull, tried to impale X2 with his lightsaber. X2 jumped over the blow and X1 impaled himself, before falling into the lava of the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "X2, Luke Skywalker, and the New Republic troops returned to their frigate, preparing for all the challenges of the New Jedi Order and whatever else lay ahead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DS version of the events played out a bit differently. In the DS version, it is implied that X1 reactivated the Separatist Droid facility on Mustafar for additional manpower, and that X2 had to open the door to the facility by activating a few switches. Also, the reference to cloning Luke Skywalker was cut, and as a result, the reason for X1 kidnapping Luke Skywalker was implied to just be out of pure spite. Also, Luke encourages X2 to fight X1 by himself as a test to his strength in the Force. Also, X1 and X2 immediately battle with absolutely no aid from either side, meaning that the clone Wookiees and Stormtroopers aiding X1 in trying to defeat X2 was not in the DS version. Lastly, the final words between X2 and X1 were lengthened somewhat, namely on X1's part."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
