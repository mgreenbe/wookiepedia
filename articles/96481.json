It was an ancient and cold system, with a dozen barren planets in orbit around an unnaturally green star. The seventh planet of the system was Netalych, which hosted DN-949A, formerly the Empire's tertiary fueling port and chemical processing facility for the Croynar sector. It had no significant strategic or cultural value, with the settlement holding around 500 organic beings and 1600 droids of fifth-degree intelligence and better. Yrica Quell and a striketeam of members from the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing flew to the system, and then DN-949A, seeking out the Surgeon. They were followed closely after by Chass na Chadic and Kairos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
