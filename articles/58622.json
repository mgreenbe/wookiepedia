The module also suppressed the droid's memories of its former self and instilled an interest in education, including the learning of new languages. When installed, the HK protocol pacifist package prevented the droid from creating violence and destruction, instead exhibiting a peaceful, pacifistic personality and expressing care for all living things."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The HK protocol pacifist package was designed for use with the HK-series assassin droid to deactivate the droid's assassination routines and add pacification programming without the droid's knowledge. Designed to be downloaded onto the droid's behavior core, the module could be installed by even the least technologically-savvy being. The package also worked to suppress the droid's memories; when asked to participate in combat or kill another being, the droid expressed shock and dismay at the concept and recalled none of its prior behavior as an assassin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now acting as a translator and protocol unit, the droid became interested in teaching itself by means of educational activities\u2014a desire instilled by the package's installation\u2014including learning new languages and watching informative holovids.

As a result, Geeda came into possession of an HK protocol pacifist package, which she stocked in her storefront on the moon Nar Shaddaa.

Upon Surik's request to remain vigilant, HK-47 vehemently opposed any violent activity and instead showed a desire to learn. HK-47's completely reversed personality drew concern from Surik and her other companions, including utility droid T3-M4, and Surik removed the HK protocol pacifist package. Restored to his original self, HK-47 expressed disgust at the change forced upon him and requested that any further upgrades be run through a diagnostics bay before their installation. However, the droid begrudgingly admitted that the module had instilled some slight insight to the desire for peaceful resolutions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The HK protocol pacifist package appeared in the 2004 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords.
