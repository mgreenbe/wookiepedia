Before the bounty hunters can capture them, Rik Duel and Dani jump out from their hiding place behind Chihdo's carbonite slab, firing their blasters wildly. Using the element of surprise, Luke, Dani, Lando, and Rik are able to fight back the bounty hunters. However, IG-88C is able to signal several other hunters, and they quickly overwhelm the opposition, capturing Lando and Dani. Rik and Luke are able to escape from the assault and begin to plan a rescue. Luke attempts to contact Chewbacca and R2-D2 with his comlink, but the two have left the Millennium Falcon to explore the city. Chewie and R2 begin to search for their friends and come into contact with a local Stenax. Meanwhile, Lando and Dani are being led to a carbon-freezing chamber. Lando attempts to bribe the guard who is escorting them, but his attempts are thwarted by Barpotomous Drebble, who has paid the guards to freeze Calrissian and transport him to his home planet. Dani, distraught over their impending doom, attempts to seduce the guard but is also unsuccessful. However, as the guard pushes her away, she responds with a kick to the face, knocking him unconscious. Drebble notices their escape attempt and orders the hunters to chase them down, and Lando and Dani begin to flee through the city streets. However, the hunters are able to herd the two directly to their carbon-freezing chamber and recapture them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Rik and Luke have made their way to the top of the city buildings, directly above the bounty hunters' carbon-freezing chamber. As Dani is about to be lowered into the chamber, Luke and Rik ambush the hunters but are quickly subdued by the overwhelming opposition. However, Chewbacca comes to the rescue, having co-opted the Stenax into helping him. As the hunters are cut down by Stenax spears, Bossk and IG-88C try to make a quick escape out the back exit only to be stopped by Chewbacca who incapacitates them. With their leaders defeated, the rest of the bounty hunters are quickly subdued. Lando and Luke thank Chewbacca for his help and apologize to the Wookiee for having met another dead end in the search for Han Solo. Chewbacca playfully lifts his two friends, and the Rebels make their way back to the Millennium Falcon, leaving Rik Duel to postulate how to emulate Chewbacca's feat of recruiting the Stenax and unfreeze Chihdo from the carbonite. As the Millennium Falcon departs from Stenos, they are surprised to find a stowaway. Dani, infatuated with Luke, has decided to accompany the Rebels and leave Rik to his ponderings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
