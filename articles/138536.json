The TIE punisher was armed with forward-mounted light laser cannons, a ventral-mounted twin proton bomb chute with tandem release for surface targets, and either four fire-linked forward-mounted proton torpedo launchers or concussion missile launchers. Due to the value of delivering a successful payload, the TIE punisher has a sturdier defense than other TIE craft, including deflector shield systems to ensure delivery of the munitions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a bomber, the TIE punisher was not suited for dogfights, and instead used its payload to launch volleys of warheads to blast and obliterate enemy starfighters, freighters, and gunships. The TIE punisher used this same tactic against capital ships, and was able to stay out of range of enemy point-defense laser cannons. The TIE punisher then used its bombs to destroy ground targets, large cruisers and battleships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE punisher was not equipped with a hyperdrive or navigation computer, and had a short-range sensor and twin ion engines.
