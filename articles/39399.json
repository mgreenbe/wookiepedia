Upon arrival, visitors would take the long, paved walkway that led to the keep and was flanked at either side by three ornamental gardens. In front of the palace's main entrance was a double line of obelisks. The main tower, in which the Count's quarters were contained, was as high as 65 Galactic Republic clone troopers stacked one on top of another, thus nearing 119 meters. It also featured a grand, 22-meter high StainGlass window on cliff side. What appeared to be ten secondary buildings scattered on the palace's grounds were in fact a network of relay towers with incandescent windows."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Interior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku's palace was lavishly decorated with many statues and elaborate paintings. His private quarters were made up of luxurious furnishings.

However, it failed and the palace sustained damage in the process. Mother Talzin then brought Savage Opress to the palace to become Dooku's new Acolyte. Dooku then tested Savage by sending him to Devaron to capture a key military base. Savage then successfully returned to Dooku to be trained to become his new Dark Acolyte. He taught Savage that his anger gave him strength and that he must feed off it to succeed. He then sent him on a mission to Toydaria to capture King Katuunko."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later on, mastermind Moralo Eval constructed the Box here for training bounty hunters, in order to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later Dooku summoned General Grievous to Serenno and ordered him to kill Ventress and the Nightsisters on Dathomir. Mother Talzin attempted to kill Dooku while he was in his base, which caused him terrible agony, but he contacted Grievous via comlink and ordered that he kill Talzin and follow the green mist which would take him to her. Dooku was saved by Grievous at the last moment. He then believed that the Nightsisters were destroyed so he redirected his attention to Savage Opress, his former apprentice. He summoned Grievous to his base and told him that he could sense that Opress was growing stronger each day. Although Grievous dismissed the fact that Savage could be considered a threat, Dooku said he was a threat to all people including themselves and that something sinister was rising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
