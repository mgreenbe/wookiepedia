The disagreement threatened to erupt into full-scale butchery, as the entire species was destined to join the coming battle. The clans formed two armies that were each bent on the ultimate destruction of their enemies, but before the final battle, a group of passing Jedi Knights intervened. The Jedi, including the Ithorian Jedi explorer Noga-ta, listened to both sides and passed a fair judgment. In accordance the Jedi decree, clans always had to share hunting grounds, and a clan's largest kill of the night had to be given to the head of another clan. They settled a peace agreement that ended the Barabel War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Impact"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic continued its expansion, and the Great Peace of the Republic lasted for nearly nine hundred more years. Later in the era, economic forces began to shape the Republic, as companies bought Tingel Arm star systems to establish the Corporate Sector.

They developed a rich mythology around the \"great warriors from beyond the clouds,\" although the different stories sometimes mentioned a band of Jedi, sometimes a single Jedi with companions.

They referred to the legend of the Barabel War, when the Jedi stopped a thousand years of slaughter.

The end of the Barabel war had been mentioned in various earlier source materials describing the Barabels, but these sources provided no exact time frame for the event. In 2006, The New Essential Guide to Alien Species was the first to provide a date for the event by stating that a civil war erupted on Barab I around 4500 BBY, and Jedi \"mediated a truce that is never broken.\" However, in 2008, The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia placed the event around 902 BBY. In 2009, the Galaxy at War roleplaying sourcebook solved the discrepancy by stating that the civil war lasted for millennia and was settled \"centuries before the Empire.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
