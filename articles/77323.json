The shuttles had S-shaped landing struts and drooping wings. By 44 ABY, the Lost Tribe of Sith had acquired at least four of these vessels for use in their Sith armada. One Kondo-class shuttle, the Obuuri, transported at least fifty Sith, including High Lord Sarasu Taalon and Sith Saber Gavar Khai, to the moon Pydyr to find Luke Skywalker and Abeloth. The Obuuri was destroyed en route to a Fallanassi village on Pydyr while searching for Abeloth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
