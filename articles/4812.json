At this time a totalitarian system of government ruled the planet. The Civilized received all the benefits, while the Workers lived in poverty. Alani's father, Ewane, was a leader of the resistance against this social system. Due to this activity he spent many years in the prison and saw his daughters rarely. Alani and Eritha were raised mostly by friends of their father, since their mother had died around the time they were born.

Roan, a close friend of their father and his successor, adopted them. At that time, Alani and Eritha conceived a plan to gain the power on New Apsolon. That plan included killing Roan and kidnapping Tahl, who died as a result of the injuries suffered. However, the plan failed with no small part due to the actions of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi who came to New Apsolon looking for the missing Tahl. Because Alani wasn't as clever as Eritha, she had bragged to Obi-Wan that Qui-Gon would die in a trap elaborated by her sister, leading Obi-Wan to rescue Qui-Gon. After the failed plan, both Alani and Eritha, along with their associate Balog were arrested."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
