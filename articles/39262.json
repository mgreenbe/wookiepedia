When that venture failed, Renking scapegoated Pryce and sacked her. Renking's actions earned him Pryce's enmity which led to his undoing after she ascended to the Governorship of Lothal.

Since Governor Azadi was determined to acquire Pryce Mining due to a doonium vein beneath the Pryce family mine, Senator Renking convinced a reluctant Pryce to sell her family company to the Galactic Empire in order to prevent Azadi from acquiring the mine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As compensation for the loss of Pryce Mining, Senator Renking offered Arihnda a job as an aide at one of his citizen assistance offices on Coruscant.

However, Renking did not tell Pryce that the data card had false data on it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pryce did as her employer instructed. Unfortunately, Ghadi saw through Senator Renking's game and sprayed her with an illegal spice called polstine spice.
