In 21 BBY, four bomb squad troopers were deployed on Naboo when the Republic discovered a secret Separatist laboratory, where the scientist Nuvo Vindi had built dozens of bombs that would release an airborne version of the Blue Shadow Virus. The bomb squad troopers, alongside several standard clone troopers, led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, attacked the Separatist laboratory to disable the virus bombs and free a pair of prisoners. During the resulting battle, Vindi activated the virus bombs, but the bomb squad troopers managed to deactivate them before they could detonate, while Skywalker and Kenobi captured Vindi. As the bomb troopers were guarding the captured bomb store, Vindi's assistant droid sneaked past the guards and reactivated a bomb, causing the explosive to detonate and leak the Blue Shadow Virus throughout the laboratory. However, Skywalker and Kenobi were able to find a cure on the planet Iego."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clone ordnance specialists were specialized clone troopers in the Grand Army of the Republic, trained to disarm and dispose of bombs and explosive devices. This was often considered one of the most dangerous jobs in the army and required a gentle touch, steady nerves, well-trained dexterity, and a sense of how machines work from the troopers. The troopers served during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. Besides deactivating bombs, bomb squad members would also safeguard stores of disabled bombs in hostile conditions, such as during the middle of a battle. Bomb squad troopers wore phase I clone trooper armor, customized with orange marking and an insignia on the left shoulder to signify their bomb disposal role."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Gungan Representative Jar Jar Binks discovered a secret laboratory in the eastern swamps on the planet of Naboo, where Confederate scientist Nuvo Vindi had created an airborne version of the deadly Blue Shadow Virus.
