In 3 ABY, Devaronian chef Torro Sbazzle cooked for Darth Vader at Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian's request following Vader's arrival in Cloud City. Presuming that Darth Vader was human like most of the Galactic Empire, Sbazzle chose dumplings as one of the dishes. She considered using bantha butter instead of zaffa oil as it was less likely to burn and the resulting dish would be more bland, then she decided to use the oil instead for what she knew could be the last meal she ever cooked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Star Wars Legends continuity, zaffa oil was first mentioned in the story \"A Very Special Meal\" by Peter M.
