During the leadup to the Telosian Restoration Project, it was highly infiltrated by Czerka Corporation lobbyists who sought to integrate the company into the new government as much as possible in order to maximize profits. Nominally in control of security in the form of the Telos Security Force, the Telosian Council was also in charge of overseeing the many Restoration Zones on the surface that lay in the shadow of Citadel Station as well as the Station's infrastructure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thanks largely to the actions of the Jedi Exile in securing certain evidence and witnesses for the Council's deliberation, they were able to finally expunge Czerka and the Exchange from Citadel Station and Telos itself, though the many mercenaries that the corporation had hired remained a threat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
