Some of the galaxy's most influential beings were invited to the Hunters' Moon to participate in various debauched but purposeful festivities incorporating obscure ceremonies and rituals in an encampment near Hego Damask's fortress. While the Gatherings of past generations had simply served as glorified business summits for the financially powerful, particularly under Caar Damask, it was during the reign of kingpin Hego Damask\u2014the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis\u2014that they became infinitely more: a highly complex political tool for shaping gainful alliances and, indeed, the future of the galaxy in accordance to the Sith Grand Plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On occasion, the full governing body of the Holdings steering committee met on Sojourn during the Gatherings, as happened for the Gathering of 67 BBY. 'Magester' Damask at that time, after conferring with Holdings colleagues, held audience with several select individuals and delegations from disparate worlds, including those of Nal Hutta and Malastare\u2014to create new alliances, or recast sundry secret combinations, for maximum political gain and financial profit. Criminal cartels came to conspire at that time, and were elegantly received by the Muun overlord, including plotting members of the Gran Protectorate, the Yinchorri High Command, and the colorful entourage of crimelord Gardulla Besadii the Elder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Damask's Gatherings continued to be hosted until 43 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
