As Anomids had no vocal cords, their civilization developed using gestures rather than sounds to communicate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though almost all Anomids used vocalizer masks which allowed them to communicate vocally in such languages as Galactic Basic Standard, they preferred to use their sign language among themselves. Though non-Anomids and their protocol droids could learn the language, they could rarely \"speak\" it. This was because Anomid sign language required six-fingered hands, so that many of their words were unreproducible by other species. Apparently, the digit restriction only applied to the Anomid lexicon, and not to other parts of the language, such as syntax."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anomid sign language had no written form."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
