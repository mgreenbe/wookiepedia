At some point, the transport was boarded near the Dilestri system by a team of mercenaries who sought to rescue the prisoner Qin.

Djarin argued with Mayfeld and the Devaronian Burg to keep Davan alive, igniting a tense standoff between the three.

Lanter told this story in an interview on SYFY's \"Jabba the Pod\" podcast and expressed his enjoyment in taking part in the show, comparing it to working on a Star Wars film. He also claimed that the costume for Davan had to be remade after Filoni realized it was a \"slight wrong color\" and that because of the secretive nature of the episode's production, Lanter had to wear a cloak over his costume when leaving his trailer to go on set for \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lanter told Star Wars Insider that the moment where Migs Mayfeld mocked Davan's shoes was entirely improvised by Mayfeld's actor Bill Burr. In an interview with the \"Rebel Force Radio\" podcast, Lanter told the hosts that he had a body scan of himself as Davan in a trailer, where he had photos taken from numerous angles of him in a number of different poses using a large number of cameras. The scan came as a part of what he thought was protocol for all characters, and he speculated that it could be for an action figure. Lanter also told the podcast that during the first take of Davan's death, he stumbled into a fake control panel, which he collided with in the scene, and broke it. This angered the set dresser, who allegedly advised Lanter into being more cautious with the set in the next few takes."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inconsistencies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Joe Schreiber's 2021 junior novelization of The Mandalorian, Davan is described to have been knocked out from Xi'an's knife throw.
