One of the strongest minerals in the galaxy, cortosis could even withstand the blow of a lightsaber. It could also redirect the heat of explosions, as discovered when General Anakin Skywalker attempted to collapse the entrance of a cortosis mine, and the resulting explosion breached through Mokivj's crust. Despite these advantages, cortosis was very fragile, making it normally useless as armor, and had difficulties with prolonged energy attacks, such as those of lightning guns, which would overload the material."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Grysks, who used cortosis for energy management, told Count Dooku of an effective way to use cortosis against the Galactic Republic. By specially weaving cortosis fibers within a protective matrix, it was possible to create armor that was both durable and immune to blaster fire. The cortosis armor also redirected the energy of a lightsaber back into itself, causing the lightsaber to temporarily shut down upon contact. Duke Solha was placed in charge of creating B2-series super battle droids equipped with the armor and, under the supervision of Darth Sidious, clone armor that could be used for Order 66. This was discovered by Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Anakin Skywalker, and the Chiss Mitth'raw'nuruodo, who proceeded to destroy the clone armor and sabotage the battle droids so they would overheat minutes after activating."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also during the Clone Wars, the cyborg business analyst Count Denetrius Vidian had a cortosis mesh skin graft installed on his body. Years later, when Vidian was attacked by the Jedi-in-hiding Kanan Jarrus and the Twi'lek pilot Hera Syndulla, the Count was able to utilize the graft to conduct energy from a blaster bolt fired by Syndulla into Jarrus, who Vidian was holding at the time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cortosis first appeared in I, Jedi, a novel by Michael A.
