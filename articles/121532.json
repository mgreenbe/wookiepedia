These 'second-wavers' prospered, leaving the original settlers to wallow in poverty. The disparity in wealth caused a division between the two groups, which in turn led to a degree of prejudice between them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dalven Kyrell, the older brother of Thane Kyrell, disapproved of his brother's friendship with a First Wave girl named Ciena Ree.
