The image showcased soldiers of the Death Watch, a Mandalorian terrorist splinter group, in action. In the foreground, three armor-clad Mandalorians could be seen on the ground, and another using their jetpack to take off into the air, with all four in front of a large fire. In the background was a city and a red sky, as well as seven Mandalorians flying overhead with their jetpacks. This piece, as well as several others, were the first in ages to depict Mandalorians in battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
