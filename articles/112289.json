They were fast and powerful, but not particularly safe or nimble, and not at all compact, quiet, or efficient. The Rebel team that was delivering the young Schenor A'kazz to his nest-guild used a reaction car to transport the youth from the spaceport at Chafflock, avoiding attempts by local Imperials to waylay them on their way to A'kazz's nest-guildmaster, B'karitz."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
