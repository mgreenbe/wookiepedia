Around 9 ABY, the trooper traveled aboard Gideon's light cruiser, which tracked the gunship Razor Crest to the planet Tython in search of the Force-sensitive infant Grogu. The Stormtrooper Commander was deployed by Gideon to the surface on an Imperial transport, leading a unit in search of Grogu. After the dropship landed next to the Razor Crest and the stormtroopers exited, proceeding toward the child's location. However, they immediately came under fire from the bounty hunter Boba Fett and assassin Fennec Shand, positioned up a hill slope, who killed several of them before the Stormtrooper Commander ordered them move up the slope after the two."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The commander's squad fired on the two enemies with their E-11 blaster rifles and the trooper told one of the unit to flank them from above to their left.

As stormtrooper reinforcements deployed from the dropship, the troopers continued to fire up the hill slope, taking further losses from Shand.

After eliminating three more stormtroopers with his weapon, Fett walked to the Stormtrooper Commander and grabbed the trooper by the throat, throwing the commander to the ground and impaling the trooper's chest armor. The rest of the stormtroopers soon retreated despite another Imperial transport arriving, and Fett destroyed both dropships upon their ascent.
