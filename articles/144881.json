The bounty hunter Din Djarin, known often as \"the Mandalorian\" or simply \"Mando,\" was a member of the organization, as was a female Mandalorian Armorer and Paz Vizsla. The rest of the Tribe consisted of a number of adults and children. Tribe members were restricted to allowing only one member to be outside of the covert at a time as a means to minimize the risk of being discovered. The Tribe was part of the Children of the Watch, who according to Bo-Katan Kryze were a cult which practiced the archaic Way of the Mandalore, which had fallen out of the mainstream Mandalorian society. This practice forbade members from removing their helmet in the presence of others, among other tenets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Into hiding"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Galactic Empire's Great Purge, the Tribe hid themselves in a covert on Nevarro, allowing only one member to be outside of the enclave at a time in fear of exposing the group's secrecy. Around 9 ABY, the bounty hunter Din Djarin visited the Tribe's Mandalorian Armorer, who was known as \"the Armorer,\" within the enclave, providing an ingot of beskar he acquired from preliminary bounty payment, which was enough to forge a pauldron. The excess metal was reserved for foundlings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon delivering Grogu to his mysterious client, Djarin later returned to the Tribe with a camtono of beskar, enough to forge an entirely new cuirass of armor. Members of the Tribe slowly entered the armorer's quarters after noticing the large amount of beskar possessed by whom they deemed a traitor, due to Djarin's acquiescence to Imperial demands. Paz Vizsla, one such member, mocked him for conducting business with the Empire's remnants and attempted to remove his helmet to shame him. As a brawl ensued between the two warriors, the armorer halted the fight, reminding the Tribe that survival at all costs was the Way of the Mandalore that they must adhere to, to which the Tribe replied in unison, \"This is the Way.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Revealing themselves"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Djarin was attacked by members of the Bounty Hunters' Guild as a result of refusing to relinquish Grogu, the Tribe negated their rule of covertness and emerged en masse to defend their brother-in-arms, providing him with an opportunity to escape with Grogu. During the ensuing battle, Djarin commented that the Tribe would have to seek out a new enclave in order to maintain anonymity following the clan's attack, quickly escaping in his starship, the Razor Crest. Vizsla saluted the bounty hunter as he fled the scene, reaffirming the Tribe's allegiance to one of their members."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, the Bounty Hunters' Guild lost control of Nevarro, and the Imperial remnant cracked down on the Mandalorian enclave for their part in the incident. Many Mandalorians were killed when the covert was attacked by forces of the remnant. The Tribe's armorer managed to survive the attack and hoped that a small number of Mandalorians had managed to escape the planet. She remained to salvage what she could in the enclave. When Djarin returned to Nevarro, he was eventually forced to flee to the enclave and found the armor and helmets of his fallen brothers and sisters. The Armorer explained what had happened and sent him on a new mission to reunite Grogu with his own kind. After Djarin and his allies left, stormtroopers entered the enclave in search of him. The Armorer fought them, killing many."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The covert was eventually completely abandoned, even by the Armorer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Ideology"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tribe believed in the orthodox ways of the Children of the Watch, which others in Mandalorian society, like lady Bo-Katan Kryze and her resistance, called a cult of religious zealots. When a cult member reached adulthood, they swore to the Mandalorian Creed and were instructed to not remove their helmets in the presence of another living thing, as part of an ancient Way of the Mandalore. Those who did reveal their faces could not put their helmets back on again. Members were able to take in foundlings, who could either continue as part of the Mandalorians and swear to the creed when they are of age, or be returned to their kind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tribe first appeared in Chapter 1 of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Dave Filoni, which aired on November 12, 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
