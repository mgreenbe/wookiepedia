Usually growing between 2.6 and 2.8 meters in length, they fed mainly on fish and lived in groups known as pods, normally consisting of a single male, known as the bull, and between two and twelve females, known as cows. Each pod would inhabit a single fishing territory which the bull would defend viciously against intruders and competing bulls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arabores were generally sleek in appearances due to their aqua-dynamic shape, but were covered in layers of fat for insulation. Great flat tusks protruded from a short snout on the rodent's face which the bulls used to defend themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were hunted occasionally by their planets native sentient species, the Whiphids, who were renowned hunters and were capable of killing them with just their hands and tusks. Normally a young Whiphid hunter might kill a bull to prove himself as would newly elected Spearmasters, the title of the head elder of Whiphid tribes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arabores were first mentioned in the second edition of Galaxy Guide 4: Alien Races, a roleplaying game supplement published by West End Games in 1994.
