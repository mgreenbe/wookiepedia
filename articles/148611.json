While the basic code was produced by the frequency pattern of the ship's engines, the transponder director set the smaller elements of the code while broadcasting it for other ship's to see. Each transponder director was sealed into every engine, making it difficult to alter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
