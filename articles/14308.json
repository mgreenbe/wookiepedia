Believing that terrorizing civilian populations was the essence of war, General Grievous released the Brainrot Plague during the battle. The plague spread through the entire Weemell sector, killing all the Clone armies and nearly every Human in the sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plague left the Weemell sector temporarily uninhabitable. The release of the Brainrot Plague, together with actions such as the bombardment of Humbarine, horrified Core Worlders. Amongst the Separatists there was also division on the use of bioweapons. Dooku feared that use of such weapons might fuel Republic propaganda, whilst leaders like Nute Gunray and Lott Dod considered it insulting towards Neimoidians, as they were often victims of plagues and diseases."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
