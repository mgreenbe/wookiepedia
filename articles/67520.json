With yellow feathers on their wings, they were noted for plumage that was pleasing to the eye. Nevertheless, they were notorious for their violent behavior toward others of their species. In contrast, they were quite nurturing to their young and taught them how to take care of themselves. Upon reaching maturity, when they developed that pugnacious disposition, offspring would often attack their own parents indiscriminately. Two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Tahl, saw an irid while visiting Ragoon VI for a training mission in the wake of Jinn's apprentice, Xanatos, turning to the dark side around 53 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An irid briefly appeared in a flashback from the fifteenth novel of the Jedi Apprentice young readers series, Jedi Apprentice: The Death of Hope (2001), by Jude Watson.
