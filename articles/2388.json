It is often necessary for any missions that deal with significantly hazardous topography in space, such as Asteroid fields. In order to function, the relays need to be within proximity of a TIE squadron, as otherwise it will break down. It also icludes a distress beacon in the event that a TIE fighter is lost in space and/or crash landed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
