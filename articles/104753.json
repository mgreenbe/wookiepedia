It was largely created as a means of individuals resolving inter-hive conflicts, as opposed to open warfare. It involved the use of the \"Petranaki array\" of five weapons: the picador's spear, the confessor's whip, the Petranaki scimitar, the caster's net, and the beastwarden's shield. The Petranaki arena was named after this combat style."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
