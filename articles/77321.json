He tried to contact Dorin and ask for help, but sources there could not provide him with atmosphere in less than four days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hopeless, Uuln looked for some friends of his that could possibly help, asking them to find the captain and its cargo. These friends discovered that the Renegade was on planet, but her cargo hold was empty and the captain had gone missing. There were several possible explanations: The captain could have been kidnapped and the cargo stolen; a usurer with whom the captain was indebted could have taken both the captain and the cargo; one of Uuln's enemies could have bribed the captain to \"disappear\" until it was too late; or an oppressive, pro-Human government or faction could have arrested the captain on trumped-up charges in order to to eliminate aliens living on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
