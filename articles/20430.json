He trained many groups, as well as helping defend the facility from at least one Imperial attack. He once tracked the traitor Nik down and confronted him in a downtown alley in Rakati. When Nik threw a thermal detonator at his feet, he immediately activated his jet pack, propelling him from the brunt of the blast and allowing him to fire his blaster at Nik, causing Nik to fall unconscious and allowing Hanson to put binders on him after he had recovered from the blast, and take him to stand trial before the Rebel high command."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
