Its borders were continually being redefined during the civil war between the Melida and the Daan. There are records of more than twenty-five separate battles between the Melida and the Daan, dating back more than sixty years before the Battle of Naboo. The Tenth Battle of Zehava was considered the bloodiest battle fought for control of the city. Shortly afterward, Zehava was divided into northern and southern regions, with the Daan controlling the northern-half and the Melida, the southern half. During the Eighteenth Battle of Zehava, the Daan used the tunnels and drains under the city to gain secret access to Melida-held areas. Shortly before the Twenty-Fifth Battle of Zehava, Daan and Melida divided the city into sectors, and even lived side-by-side for a short time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
