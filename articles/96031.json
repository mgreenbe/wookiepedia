He owned a modified Shieldship called Penumbra, which he used to escort guests or captured ships to his base, so that he could have them gutted for spare parts. He was very paranoid and didn't trust his crew or his Twi'lek Majordomo, so he would often disguise himself as a pilot and fly the ship himself. He also secretly fitted it with a hyperdrive, so that he could abandon his base in an emergency."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
