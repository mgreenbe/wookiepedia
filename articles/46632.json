Working out of a cobbled-together ship she called Skybarge, Fadoop was both unusually overweight and outgoing for her species, doing much of her business with offworld visitors. In 2 BBY Fadoop became an acquaintance of the Corellian smuggler Han Solo, who visited Saheelindeel while working as a mechanic on Grigmin's Traveling Airshow. Fadoop developed a friendly relationship with Solo and his first mate Chewbacca, trading parts with the offworlders in between cargo deliveries. Fadoop even allowed Solo to borrow her ship when Solo decided to quit his job working for the hotshot pilot Grigmin, using Skybarge to humiliate Grigmin with his superior flying skills."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fadoop made her first and only appearance in the Star Wars Legends continuity in the novel Han Solo and the Lost Legacy, written by Brian Daley and released in 1980."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
