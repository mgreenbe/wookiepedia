Despite its transformation into a thriving economic hub, the city had maintained much of its rustic charm. Many of the settlement's original buildings still stood and the residents maintained historic areas throughout the city. Kor Vella also lacked the huge skyscrapers that dominated the skylines of most other Corellian cities. The city was known for its excellent scientific research."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Corellia's more primitive times, long before the advent of hyperspace travel, intrepid explorers made their reputation by successfully scaling the Kor Vella mesa. The terrain was treacherous, and the area around the mesa boasted numerous predatory creatures. Those Corellians who did manage to reach the mesa, however, found that the bleak, weather-beaten landscape actually offered great solitude. Kor Vella mesa became a site for introspection and meditation, where Corellians could escape the trials of daily life for a few hours of reflection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nearly ten thousand years before the Battle of Yavin, a small religious sect established a monastery on Kor Vella mesa. The religious retreat shunned metropolitan values and emphasized self-reliance over creature comforts. Despite Kor Vella's harsh rules, the religious retreat attracted other Corellians, who built shanties around the central monastery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kor Vella's history changed dramatically when local miners located large deposits of ore near the mesa. This discovery coincided with a sudden surge in demand for Corellian starships throughout the galaxy. As starship manufacturers purchased ore from Kor Vella, the influx of credits nearly overwhelmed the community. Nearly overnight, the inhabitants of Kor Vella could afford all the luxuries that they had formerly despised. Kor Vella eventually dropped all pretense of being a religious retreat and emerged from relative isolation to become one of Corellia's most respected cities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Kor Vella was garrisoned by a large Imperial force that patrolled the city in an effort to crack down Rebel insurgents. Commander Zhanks and TA-667 were garrisoned there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, the criminal organization known as the Chirq Council established an important spice smuggling operation in Kor Vella.
