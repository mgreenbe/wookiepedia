The Aqualish war party discovered the cave in the wilderness of Talus and took up permanent residence when they realized that it was the perfect staging ground for their raids. Over the centuries, the Aqualish had managed to keep their base hidden from everyone, especially the human settlers on Talus. The Lost Aqualish were still living in the cave during the time of the Galactic Civil War, ready to take the fight against the Corellians when the conflict would begin anew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, a mercenary in Nashal requested a spacer to attack the cave and eliminate as much Aqualish warriors as possible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The same year, a spacer visited the cave and collected a sinew wrapped knife."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
