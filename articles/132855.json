Villie then details his relationship with one Quinlan Vos. He tells of how Vos was a former Guardian, kicked out of the service for his alcohol problem, and how the two of them perpetrated a scam with Vos posing as a Jedi, until Vos became too arrogant. Villie claimed that in an attempt to prove he really was a Jedi, Vos demanded Grahrk shoot him, so he could parry the blast.
