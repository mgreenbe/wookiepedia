The individual had brown hair, gray eyes and brown skin. After the people of the planet Valahari took the side of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in 22 BBY, the Republic established blockades of neutral worlds that supplied military aid to the Separatists. The Jedi was placed in charge of a blockade of one such planet, along with a fleet of Venator-class Star Destroyer and V-19 Torrent starfighters. Shortly afterward, the Aqualish's forces were attacked by the Valahari ace pilot Tofen Vane and his squadron, Tofen's Raiders. The Jedi flew a Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor into battle, but was killed by Vane. The entire Republic fleet was also destroyed. The Aqualish was one of the dozen Jedi pilots killed by Vane."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Jedi's only appearance was in The Clone Wars 11, a 2009 comic book written by Henry Gilroy and Steven Melching and illustrated Brian Koschak.
