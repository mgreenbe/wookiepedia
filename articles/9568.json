They took note of the large-scale damage, and attempted to negotiate a truce with the Ssi-ruuk. When that proved futile, the New Republic Fleet engaged in another punitive battle against the already-weakened Lwhekk, then departed on Mon Mothma's orders to aid in the liberation of Clak'dor VII. The New Republic Intelligence Service believed that Admiral Ivpikkis commanded the Ssi-ruuvi forces in that engagement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It would be many years until Lwhekk fully recovered from the attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
