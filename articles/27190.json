Four of the tall red thorns rose from the corners of Sauro's long but low Senate office desk. And, upon Palpatine's appointment of Sauro to the position of Deputy Chancellor (done to keep this arch-enemy of the Supreme Chancellor close, and on a leash), in a temporary garden in the exterior courtyard outside the Galactic Senate complex, twin horns of the bloodred bush could be seen towering above the exotic flowers there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
