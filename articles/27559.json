The pilot of a clawcraft would throw his or her craft into a wild, erratic spin that was centered around the ball cockpit, constantly firing and moving unpredictably. It was popular among clawcraft pilots for use in space, but was considered incredibly dangerous to use within an atmosphere. During the Battle of Tenupe, Captain Jagged Fel, flying on one engine and with no shields, successfully used the Clawcraft Spin while in atmosphere to evade fire from Jaina Solo and Zekk Joiners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
