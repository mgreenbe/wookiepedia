At one point, he was captured by Morgukai warriors and used as bait to lure in a female Jedi. The Morgukai was a cult of Force-resistant Nikto warriors who trained recruits to attack Republic targets. After defeating the Jedi, the Nikto let Phomm go, and he would harbor a grudge agaist them for years to come. In 3643 BBY Phomm resided on Nar Shaddaa and discovered the Morgukai have set up the Morgukai temple in the area. He hired a Republic hero to attack the Morgukai, expecting them to fall in battle and satisfy the Morgukai bloodlust, but instead the hero surviced the ordeal and crippled their entire operation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
