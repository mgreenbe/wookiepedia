Human and Selonian settlements on the shores of the Sea of Jarad were quaint throwbacks to earlier times. The sea was a mating ground for styanax, and the hunting of these creatures was an important part of the Tralus' culture. Human clans and Selonian dens gathered together and organized parties of stabmen, or styanax hunters, who tracked and harpooned the creatures from unpowered, oared vessels called nagaks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
