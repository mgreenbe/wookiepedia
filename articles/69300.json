At some point, she was photographed with her husband and daughter on Batuu. Around ten years prior to the start of the First Order/Resistance War, she and her daughter attended a race that Yeager and his brother, Marcus Speedstar, were competing in. In order to beat Yeager, Speedstar used large amounts of coaxium to fuel his ship, but during the race, the ship combusted and crashed, killing her and her daughter. Following this incident, Yeager became estranged from his brother for over ten years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
