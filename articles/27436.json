This was perhaps due to the lessons learned during the Clone Wars on the effectiveness of droid armies. Regardless, the Empire rejected the idea and the designs of the Class 1 defense unit were later seen within the Corporate Sector. They were used extensively by the Espos and were used in their armies to subdue the Trianii, a move strikingly similar to that used by the old Trade Federation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droids moved on four legs and were armed with two medium blasters; one standard and the other anti-vehicle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
