The Unifying Force was thought to be present in all shining stars, surrounding and penetrating them, thus connecting all universal things.  It was one of the four primary aspects of the Force, along with the Living Force, the Cosmic Force, and the Physical Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi believed the Unifying Force relied on their understanding and was attuned to space around them. The Unifying Force was believed to have neither the light nor the dark side. The light and dark sides were instead conceptualized in a metaphorical way, treating all beings equally. Followers of the Unifying Force always kept their eyes open for future possibilities. In the end, it resulted in them trying to fulfill a destiny rather than focusing on the present, which was one of the main tenets of the Living Force philosophy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Visions of the future were of particular significance to Unifying Force supporters. Yoda was one of the most adamant proponents of heeding visions of the future, though he did not adhere to many of the other views common with the Unifying Force. Many of these Jedi believed a similar philosophy focusing on the flow of time as a whole, ignoring primary use of the Living Force. Voices for the latter espoused a philosophy of \"live for the moment\" and heavily relied on their instincts. This viewpoint might have allowed the Jedi Order to stave off the conflict that gave rise to the Galactic Empire, as its members lost themselves in looking forward rather than analyzing the unfolding events before them. Yoda later espoused beliefs closer to the philosophy of the Living Force when training Luke Skywalker on Dagobah."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ironically, Emperor Palpatine, known as Darth Sidious, also supported this belief in the Unifying Force. He agreed that there was only one Force: the only difference worthy of note was that the Sith saw the Force as a means to an end while the Jedi saw it as an end in itself. This view was also supported by Vergere, who taught Jacen Solo that there was no light side or dark side of the Force\u2014only the Unifying Force. Vergere also told Solo that \"the Force was everything, and everything was the Force\"; that the Force did not have sides and never took sides. However, the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis disagreed with this belief. His own studies of the Force had indicated to him that there was a clear and obvious distinction between the light and dark sides."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lord Kaan used the term \"twilight\" to describe an idea that the Force was not split into light and dark sides during a portion of the Ruusan campaign."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
