Around 40 BBY, Averross visited the cantina that Selbie worked at with a group of Pijal varactyl riders, coming from the stables connected to the Pijali palace.

Although the Chagrian threatened to report Averross to Pijal's authorities, Selbie gleefully informed him that the Jedi was the ruling regent of the planet.
