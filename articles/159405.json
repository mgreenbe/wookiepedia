Swirling silica-dust storms caused the world to have a blue-gray hue when viewed from space. Vanqor was located six parsecs away from the closest planet, Florrum, and was the homeworld of the gundarks, fierce, aggressive creatures known for their overwhelming strength who inhabited the planet's caves. Also inhabiting some of Vanqor's caves were bio-luminescent organisms that lived on the cave walls."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 22 BBY, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Knight Anakin Skywalker shot down Count Dooku, leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, over Vanqor, forcing him to crash-land his ship on the planet's surface. However, their shuttle was also forced down during the ensuing battle. On Vanqor, Dooku abandoned his solar sailer and evaded the Jedi by hiding in a cave filled with gundarks; when they pursued him inside, Dooku used the Force to bring down stalactites, separating the Jedi and buried Skywalker, whose lightsaber Dooku took before leaving the cave and collapsing its entrance. Outside, he was found by Hondo Ohnaka and his gang of pirates, who agreed to take him to Florrum. Although the Jedi emerged unscathed, they were attacked by an angry gundark. While using the Force to build a barricade, the Jedi accidentally opened a fissure and noxious green gas began filling the cavern. As the pair tried to dig their way out of the collapsed opening, the gas began to overwhelm them and they collapsed just as the cavern entrance exploded from outside as Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, and her clone forces blasted the cave open. After the pair exited the cavern, the clones eliminated the gundark by collapsing the entrance once more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, an attempt on Jedi Master Mace Windu's life by Boba Fett resulted in the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance crashing onto Vanqor. There, its commanding officer, Admiral Kilian, Clone Commander Ponds, and a navigation officer were taken hostage by Fett and his team of bounty hunters, consisting of Aurra Sing, Bossk, and Castas. While Windu and Skywalker were searching the wreckage for survivors, Fett made another attempt on the Jedi Master's life that left both Windu and Skywalker trapped under debris until they were rescued by Jedi Master Plo Koon, Tano, and the 104th Battalion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, the Quarren pirate Kragan Gorr arrived on Vanqor and rescued the Mirialan Synara San off the streets of Vanqor.
