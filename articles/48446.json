As the droid project went into its final stages, the Fireclaw Horde sent a Togorian gang to Tindark to obtain the security codes that would allow them to acquire several MMR-9 prototypes. However, their plain was partially foiled when the droid's designer, Imik Suum, managed to escape after witnessing the Togorians murder several technicians and staff in the base. A group of freelance agents tracked the Togorians to their hideout on Nub Saar, where they discovered the gang's plans for the hijacking. Intercepting the Queen, the freelancers fended off the Horde and the luxury liner was safe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Investigation into the Fireclaw Horde and its activities led authorities to implicate them in other attempted crimes; such as an attempt to steal Gomalo's treasures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
