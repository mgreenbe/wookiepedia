The Treaty of Coruscant ended the Great Galactic War, sealing the Sith Empire's partial victory and its annexation of almost two thirds of the known Galaxy. Peace was gained, but tensions between the Empire and the Republic remained high, especially as the Sith began seizing more planets in the Core Worlds. In the ten years after the war, fear and uncertainty gripped the galaxy. Border skirmishes and proxy wars between the Empire and Republic erupted, and the uneasy truce between the two foes appeared to be on the verge of collapse, as it finally did in 3642 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The eleven year period during which the Cold War took place was perhaps one of the most significant periods in galactic history, particularly for that of the Sith. As a result of the immense power that they held during the Cold War, this was well-regarded as having been the time in which the Sith were at their mightiest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The terms of the punitive Treaty of Coruscant called for an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of all Republic and Jedi forces from battlefields across the galaxy. As the Treaty went into effect, worlds once allied with the Republic were left defenseless and were quickly absorbed by the Empire. Other planets, angered by the Senate acceptance of the treaty, decided to separate themselves from the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Jedi returned to their ruined temple on Coruscant, they were met by anger on the part of the Senate, who placed blame for the war at the feet of the Jedi Order.

He handed over control of the Empire to the Dark Council, a body of twelve Sith Lords who would oversee the day-to-day affairs of state. The Dark Lord went on to pursue his own mysterious goals as the Sith consolidated their power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Border skirmishes and proxy wars between the Empire and Republic erupted, and the uneasy truce between the two foes appeared to be on the verge of collapse.\nThe conflict included small battles in the Outer Rim and other conflicts fought by proxy.

On Tython, two incredibly talented apprentices, a Consular and a Knight, arrived and were trained, both becoming notable participants of the war and contributing greatly to the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Consular began by saving the Tythonian Forge from destruction at the hands of Nalen Raloch, and successfully gathered three of four holocrons, and found the Fount of Rajivari, which contained the contents of the fourth holocron, and more. The Consular then saved the Jedi Order from internal destruction by learning an ancient shielding technique when several Jedi Masters became infected by an ancient, dark plague. Successfully learning the technique, the Consular healed the afflicted masters and tracked the plaguemaster to a lone flagship. The plaguemaster, Lord Vivicar was defeated, and the spirit of Terrak Morrhage was expelled from his body. The Consular was then named the third Barsen'thor in the history of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knight first began helping the Jedi Order by defeating the Flesh Raiders and two Dark Jedi, Callef and Bengel Morr, who were responsible for controlling the Flesh Raiders during the events of the Flesh Raider uprising. The Jedi Knight then followed up with victories against the Sith, pursuing enemies across the galaxy, such as Tarnis, a Sith Lord under the disguise of a doctor. When Tarnis was slain, his father, Darth Angral, bore a personal grudge against the Knight during the resulting Desolator crisis. When Angral decided to unleash a powerful superweapon on Tython in order to destroy it, the Knight was responsible for defeating Angral, destroying the Desolator and protecting Tython. Due to this, the Knight earned the title \"Hero of Tython.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Simultaneously, a trooper was assigned to Havoc Squad on Ord Mantell. Havoc Squad's commander, Harron Tavus, soon betrayed the Republic and defected with the rest of Havoc Squad except for the new trooper.

The smuggler was immediately betrayed by Skavak and was accidentally involved in the hunt for the lost treasure of Nok Drayen, the legendary pirate and thief. The smuggler eventually claimed Nok's reliquary for themselves and, with Risha Drayen, went on to become a legend in the criminal underworld. Working as a privateer for the Republic, the smuggler eventually exposed Imperial agents in the Senate and defeated the Imperial admiral known as the Voidwolf. By accomplishing that, they gained the name \"Voidhound\" and claimed a massive pirate fleet and criminal empire, continuing to support the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Champions of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time that the heroes of the Republic came to light, four other exceptional individuals aligned with the Empire. Two of them, one a former slave and another a Sith Acolyte, were sent to Korriban and taken under the wings of Darth Zash and Darth Baras, respectively."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The slave was sent into the dark pits of the tombs on Korriban to prove themselves worthy of being Sith. All the while, they dodged several attempts on their life by their overseer, Harkun. After gaining their apprenticeship, they went on to become a powerful Sith Inquisitor and recovered the ancient relics of Tulak Hord. At the same time, they fought many battles for the Empire across the galaxy. After defeating their master, Zash, they were named a Lord of the Sith. They were given the name Lord Kallig, and established their own power base within the Sith Order and Imperial society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the other became a potent Sith Warrior. They served their master in combating his nemesis, Jedi Master Nomen Karr, and tracking down his padawan. They traveled across the Empire and saved their master's network of spies across Republic and Hutt Space. They succeeded in bringing down many Republic allies and Jedi in their mission.

After they departed Dromund Kaas, they spent the Cold War tracking down and eliminating terrorists in the Empire. After defeating all the terrorist cells and their leader, they secured the Empire against further internal attacks and gained prestige. Meanwhile, the bounty hunter became engaged in a bitter contest across the galaxy. All the while, they battled the attempts by a dishonorable Mandalorian named Tarro Blood to sabotage them.
