An act of dominance killing occurred when an inferior disrespected a superior or failed in some capacity, and knelt before his superior, offering his neck for sacrifice. The superior then chose to either slaughter the nitakka with his dew claws or allow him to live despite his failure. This practice was performed unflinchingly on a regular basis. Sacrifice, particularly to provide blood for a birth cask of an important Yevetha, was considered an honor for the family of the deceased Yevetha."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
