Ryoon was stationed aboard the Super Star Destroyer Liberty's Misrule, which had been commandeered by the pirates. He had a tiny mouth, sharp teeth, and bug eyes. While many members of his species chose to wear mechanical suits to compensate for their small physique, he preferred to remain purely organic. Following the Battle of Jakku, Ryoon informed Eleodie that three Imperial II-class Star Destroyers had exited hyperspace and were hailing them. Ryoon complied with Eleodie's orders to attack the Imperial ships in order to curry favor with the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
