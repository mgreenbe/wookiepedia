Led by a Koorivar Sariyah Budan and based on the Sungrazer, the organization received the slaves from The Crucible and forced them to mine Thorilide crystals on the comets. In 3963 BBY Zayne Carrick and Jarael attempted to free the slaves from the Sungrazer by posing as members of the Crucible, but Budan cracked the con and called for Gladiator - an actual Crucible vessel to detain the pretenders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
