The situation generated anti-human sentiments among the Selonian population of Talus and hostile anti-human demonstrations erupted in the city of Nashal. Despite no act of violence against Humans was reported, the local police force and Cluster World Relations issued a travel warning for Nashal. Via Corellia News Service, Marx Grocco explained that this preventive measure was meant to insure the public safety of Talusian human citizens and human travelers for any possible hostile encounters with non-human protestors. During those events, Cluster World Relations worked with officers of the Corellian Security Force in an investigation into any unlicensed dealings with the tribal population of Talus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
