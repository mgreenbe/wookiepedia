Pelf came to adore the pair, and she put them to use as show dogs. Pelf and Fume later embarked on a luxury cruise aboard the liner Salin Mariner, and the two swamp dogs accompanied them on the voyage. During the trip, the Pachoolas and their two dogs were kidnapped by the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka, after he convinced them to accompany him into an escape pod. However, the venture proved to be a financial disaster for Ohnaka, and during their captivity the dogs consumed 10 kilos of food a day, yet he was unable to secure a ransom for the Pachoolas' freedom to cover the cost of feeding their pets. Twiggs, Higgs and their owners eventually regained their freedom after Ohnaka and his gang forced a passing delivery freighter to take the captives off their hands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
