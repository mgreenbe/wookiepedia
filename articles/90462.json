The sprawling caverns began at the Fissure District and were rumored to contain Salovan Fische' Legacy - a treasure trove full of goods and riches hidden in a remote cave. Though the majority of tunnels were unmapped, they attracted a large number of visitor and residents. Anjiliac clan occasionally send groups of Houk thugs to clear the mines, with little effect.
