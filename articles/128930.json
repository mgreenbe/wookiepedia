It was frequented by Alanciari fishermen who plied its waters for seafood. In 2975 BBY, the surviving members of High Lord Edell Vrai's ill-fated mission to Alanciar used the Southern Passage to return to Keshtah Minor by the Sea of Flames. They used the Alanciari harvester Mischance for this journey and also brought the Alanciari signals officer Jogan Halder with them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
