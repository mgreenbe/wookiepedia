It resembled the flesh of the natives of its planet before the Emperor claimed the world. Pale pink in color, it was shot through with scarlet streaks, which slowly bled out after the wood was harvested. Some believed body-wood trees sustained a certain intelligence and they were said to cry when cut down. The wood gave off a pink glow when harvested. Lord Hethrir of the Empire Reborn, was granted exclusive right to harvest it by the Emperor, and made his fortune selling it. Hethrir also used the wood extensively for his own use, paneling his private office on his worldcraft with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
