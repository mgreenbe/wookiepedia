A large amount of blosphi extract was aboard starships stolen by Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit when leaving the Kurost transfer point with components for Project Stardust. Savit had hired criminals led by two Dashades, Maliss and Sorath, to capture the stolen ships and steal vital components from them, and Grand Admiral Thrawn theorized that he was paying the Dashades with blosphi extract."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
