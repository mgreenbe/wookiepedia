Led by a case officer based at sector headquarters, and run by a network leader and various area coordinators, the majority of the cell were natives living as normal citizens with families and jobs by day, and as insurgents by night. In general, members of the cell network are unaware of the identity of others, knowing at best three other members, including the members in the own cell, or the cell above or below them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
