The Scar was formed by the heat from the Burning Wound, a lava rift that lay in the center of the canyon; the Scar was unable to expand further in the east or west directions due to the presence of rock, but the heat from the Wound gradually melted the ice to the north and south, extending the Scar. When the Esh-kha were unleashed from imprisonment during the invasion of Belsavis during the Galactic War, they quickly overtook the Scar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Scar is a subregion of the planet Belsavis in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, linking the Ancient Prison Caverns and the Tomb.
