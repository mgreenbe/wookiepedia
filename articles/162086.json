He was in the process of dealing with Offworld Corporation, behind his son Kad's back, for the stealing of the ship's treasury, along with an operative and spy, a 'no name'. His plan backfired when he and his accomplice (a senate no-name called Tarrence Chenati) were not going to make it out cleanly and the no name mortally wounded him with his blaster.
