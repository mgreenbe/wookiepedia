The suit as a whole had considerable respect in the bounty hunting community due to its versatility. A suit of stalker armor almost universally identified an individual as a bounty hunter; something that could be a benefit to those who used intimidation. The suit came stock with an integrated Tangler Elite 1, DF-D1 Duo-Flechette Rifle, and an ejectable gauntlet blade, all located in the right gauntlet. The armor also came stock with a sensor pod and on board targeting computer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The suit was used extensively by Rodians, as Salus Corporation was a Rodian based company, but the armor also could be custom fit to a variety of species, with a cut down version that offered lesser protection also being available.
