Another unidentified Advozse, wearing different clothes, appears on an earlier page gambling with Figrin D'an. It is possible that writers Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta intended this character to be the same species (or even the same character) as Bom Vimdin. Therefore, the species 'Ganimed' (which is not mentioned anywhere else) could possibly be considered the same as the Advozse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
