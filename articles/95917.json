Although they were genetically identical to baseline Humans, the Necropolitan had a unique culture that set them apart from other Human civilizations.

Centuries before the Civil War, the Necropolitan society was marred with violence. According to legends, a Necropolitan witch called Sycorax claimed to have the power to revive the dead. Other citizens accused her of being a charlatan, and they killed her son, telling her to bring him back to life if she could. Sycorax died of grief, and she was buried along with her offspring."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and politics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the practice of burying had been abandoned by most Human cultures in favor of more efficient methods, the denizens of Necropolis were religiously attached to it.

At the time of the Galactic Civil War, however, such gestures had become more of a habit for most Necropolitans; they still perpetuated the traditions, but without really believing in them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
