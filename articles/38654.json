Gathering a like-minded band of non-humans, Kiph formed the Alien Combine, an anti-Imperial, anti-Human band of Invisec dwellers. They carried out attacks against the Galactic Empire and, quick to judge Humans as bigoted, killed those they felt to be so and sent their bodies back as warnings to the Empire. One such potential victim was Gavin Darklighter, but when Darklighter and his Rogue Squadron companions were brought before Kiph, the Empire raided the Alien Combine's headquarters. Kiph was wounded in the firefight, but the Rogues saved him and he went on to aid them in capturing Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
