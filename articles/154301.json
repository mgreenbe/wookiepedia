The sculpture was blue and white, and the design was elaborate. At some point by 27 BBY, the sculpture\u2014and 12 others like it\u2014 had been stolen by pirates of the Vagaari species. The artwork was placed in the hold of their starship. Later, this vessel came under the control of the Chiss Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo\u2014also known as Thrawn. By analyzing this work of art, along its twelve mates, Thrawn surmised that the Pashvi were humanoid but proportioned differently from Humans or Chiss, and that they had a distant emotional state. This reasoning impressed the smuggler Dubrak Qennto, with whom Thrawn was traveling."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
