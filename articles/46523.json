Designed as an assistant, it was capable of performing full doctor operations when necessary, even though patients often complained about its lack of compassion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The FX-6 was part of a series of droids nicknamed the \"Fixit\" series. The line ultimately included nine models before MedTech closed its doors, and the FX-6 was one of the more versatile models. It was designed during the Clone Wars to act as a mobile, autonomous, skilled medical assistant to field medics, fighting on the front line. The Grand Army of the Republic was even known to drop FX-6 droids into the areas where fighting was planned or already going on to provide additional medical aid to clone trooper forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the first day of the Galactic Empire, an FX-6 droid at the Emperor Palpatine Surgical Reconstruction Center became instrumental in the reconstruction of Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike many others FX-droids who are immobile, FX-6 had a strong sense of balance and could move over almost any reasonable terrain. Though capable of stabilizing a patient and administering a wide range of medical care, the lack of sophisticated personality programming had forever delegated the FX-6 to a medical assistant role. The FX-6 even lacked a vocoder; it instead communicated through readout screens or direct links to other droids and computers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The FX-6's head was lined with sophisticated sensor arrays that gathered vital information about a patient's health. This data was funneled and stored through a complex analysis processor, allowing the mobile FX-6 to keep dynamic records of hundreds of patients, making it a mainstay in crowded hospitals and battlefield RMSUs. This model was eventually replaced with FX-7 and later 2-1B."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As its name implies, the FX-6 droid was modeled after a similar FX-7 droid developed for The Empire Strikes Back. While the FX-7 was built practically and was mostly immobile, the FX-6 was computer-generated, allowing it a greater range of movement and animation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
