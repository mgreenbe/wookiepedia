Taken in by the Ibhaan'I tribe after he was orphaned, Merich was not much of a scout or a hunter. Looking for ways to support the tribe, Merich began dealing in dangerous Trauger gas. Harvesting the gas led to Merich developing deformities on his hands and face and led to him developing a respiratory disorder.
