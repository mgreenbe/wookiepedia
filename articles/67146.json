In the subsequent Battle of Centerpoint Station, Intruder was critically damaged by two robot ramships. Its commander Admiral Hortel Ossilege, and the former Prime Minister of Bakura Gaeriel Captison, activated the ship's self destruct sequence. Although all hands were lost with Intruder, its explosion did manage to destroy a Sacorrian fleet and hold of the remainder of Corellian forces until Admiral Ackbar's fleet could arrive, thus saving the battle for the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
