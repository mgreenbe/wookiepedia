Around 5 ABY, genFries and eleven other TIE pilots took part in a training exercise led by Major Soran Keize in preparation for an attack on New Republic forces. Keize led the other twelve TIE fighter pilots through the icy ring system of a moon and towards the 204th's Imperial II-class Star Destroyer the Edict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the TIEs made an attack run across the Edict's hull, simulating strikes on critical areas of the Star Destroyer, each of the pilots were then given false sensor readings on their scanners by the major to test their reactions. genFries displayed a habit of only firing well after closing range, which was noted by the major, who intended to pass his observations onto the pilot's squadron commander. After, he announced a new exercise, where the goal of genFries and the other pilots was to eliminate him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karli genFries appeared in a fighter in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
