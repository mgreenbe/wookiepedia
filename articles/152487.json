On the morning of the day that Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors infiltrated the outpost, the droid's activities inadvertently set off an alarm in Sector 10 in the base's lower level; it was the third such incident of that month. This incident was the topic of a short conversation between two stormtroopers who were assigned to guard a room that regulated access to other parts of the base. The instigator of the conversation expressed his belief that it would not be the last occurrence of that nature. Shortly after he made this statement, he was killed by Kyle Katarn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
