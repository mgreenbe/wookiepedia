Some beings who have worn ponchos in their lifes were Qui-Gon Jinn, Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker.[source?] They have been worn on several planets, including Tatooine and Endor. After Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa escaped from the Death Star to the Millennium Falcon, Organa draped a poncho over Skywalker's shoulders, for which he was grateful while he was mourning the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, he passed it back to her before leaving the area to man the ship's gun port.. The bounty hunter, Jango Fett, was known to sometimes wear a poncho over his armor. During his quest to restore the Jedi Order, the former Padawan Cal Kestis wore various ponchos found on the planets he visited."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
