They crawled using two appendages to drag themselves on top of stones and areas which had moss and lichen, with which they ate using their cartilaginous teeth. Believed to be non-communicative creatures, they were found to be joining communities of other \"rocks\" to \"sing\". On most planets they inhabited, they were considered as vermin because of their voracious reproduction that threatened to block natural waterways and they helped spread semi-dangerous bacteria."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This creature's name is once misspelled as \"Fetter's rock.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
