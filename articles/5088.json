After the defeat of the Brotherhood of Darkness during the New Sith Wars, the world joined the Republic, remaining loyal over the next millennia until the Clone Wars. Aligning with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the planet was granted membership in the Galactic Empire in exchange for loyalty. Aldivy's capital, Greenton, was the location of the headquarters of Lachany Foods. When the Empire was upended by the New Republic, the city of New Oldtown suffered the wrath of Apwar Trigit, an agent of Warlord Zsinj's empire. Destroying the city, the planet was cast into fear as the Imperials battled for control against the fledgling New Republic. Remaining neutral for a century, the planet was controlled by Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire as of 137 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
