Vowing to cover up the scheme set in motion by Darth Tyranus at the war's beginning, they attempted to terminate Tup. However, Tup's friend Fives, with the help of the medical droid AZI-3, discovered the true cause of Tup's behavior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the inhibitor chip was removed, Tup began to act like his old self, but it was too late to save him.

During this time, the planet Umbara was seceding from the Republic to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the Republic launched a massive invasion to prevent the technologically advanced weapons of the Umbarans from falling into enemy hands.

Krell immediately showed himself to be significantly less compassionate than Skywalker, forcing Tup and the other clones to march without rest for over twelve hours, as well as ordering them into battle following reckless plans that proved very costly to the troops. Later, the 501st managed to capture an Umbaran airbase thanks to the efforts of Captain Rex, ARC trooper CT-5555 \"Fives,\" and \"Hardcase,\" and in spite of Krell's orders, which themselves resulted in numerous clone casualties. Krell's plans and orders were sowing dissent among the troops, including in Tup, who was angered by the General's careless tactics and lack of compassion for the clones."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Mutiny against Krell"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fives later recruited troopers CT-5597 \"Jesse\" and Hardcase in a plan to use commandeered Umbaran fighters to destroy the orbiting Separatist supply ship, in spite of Krell's orders. Tup was not optimistic about the chances of the proposed mission, saying that anyone who tried to fly the ships would be shot down. As they continued to discuss their plan, Jesse alerted them that Dogma had entered the barracks, and when he asked what was going on, Tup responded with \"nothing.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the unauthorized operation was going on, Tup was sleeping in the barracks, but was awoken by his friend \"Dogma,\" who had noticed the absence of Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase. Dogma realized what had happened and confronted Tup, who initially pleaded with Dogma to not report the three rogue clones. However, he was persuaded to accompany Dogma in reporting the incident to General Krell, pointing out that they would be complicit in the renegade troopers' insubordination and court-martialed if they did not do so. However, Tup and Dogma were waylaid by Rex near the entrance to the control tower, as he suspected what they, particularly Dogma, were planning on doing. After being told that they were going to speak to Krell about a \"personal matter,\" Rex suggested that they tell him and then he could tell the general. This dissuaded Dogma from attempting to continue, just as Rex had suspected might happen, a development that Tup was privately relieved about. Dogma and Tup then returned to the barracks, though Tup soon returned to Rex alone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Fives' strategy succeeded thanks to Hardcase's sacrifice; the explosion of the frigate was seen by Rex and Tup on the ground.

However, they all purposefully missed after hearing a speech by Fives, knowing that the execution was wrong, though Dogma was still intent on following Krell's orders in the idea of being a good soldier. The execution was then put on hold when Krell ordered the 501st Legion out to intercept the approaching enemy, who were supposedly disguised as clones. In fact, the \"enemy\" was a platoon of clones from the 212th Attack Battalion, which had received the same orders as the 501st. The clones walked into a trap set up by Krell, wishing to pit them against each other. As the clone troopers neared the coordinates given to them by Krell, Dogma almost tripped on a \"vine,\" but Tup warned him that this was the tentacle of a vixus, which he had seen attack Hardcase earlier, and threw a rock at it to demonstrate the animal's perilous nature. The vixus awoke and thrashed its tentacles around for prey. The battle then began very abruptly, and numerous casualties were incurred on both sides before Rex realized that the \"Umbarans\" were actually troops from the 212th, and got the two units to cease fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tup and the rest of the clones mourned the passing of their fellow brethren, confused and horrified at what had transpired. Meanwhile, Rex, questioning the dying clone trooper \"Waxer,\" the leader of the other platoon, learned that Krell had ordered them to stop the disguised enemy at these coordinates. Realizing what had transpired, Rex gathered the survivors together and announced they were going to arrest Krell for treason against the Republic, though Dogma slipped away. Entering the tower, the clones surrounded Krell, who replied with taunting remarks and forced Tup and the other clones across the room by using the Force before killing several of the clones in the room and escaping out the window into the forest below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Tup and the surviving clones chased after Krell, Dogma stopped them, believing them traitors, pointing his blaster first at Rex and then Tup, who managed to persuade him to lower his weapon.

He came up with an idea and had Rex order the remaining clones to lure Krell towards him and the vixus. As Krell chased the clones, Tup fired at him and taunted him verbally. This lead Krell to run towards Tup and be seized by the vixus' tentacles. Immediately after Krell broke free of the creature's grasp, Tup killed the vixus and stunned Krell, who was then taken back to the brig. Krell later revealed his plans to betray the Republic and join the Sith, as well as his belief that he would be rescued by the Umbarans and that he would get away with it because he thought the clones were inherently inferior. He also voiced his amusement at ordering clones to their deaths."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tup, Jesse, and Fives were present when CC-1119 \"Appo\" reported to Rex that the transmitter had been sabotaged and that the remaining Umbaran forces, driven from the capitol by Obi-Wan Kenobi's forces, were heading towards the airbase. Tup was among those who suggested that Krell was too dangerous to be left alive given the danger of the Umbarans freeing him if they retook the airbase. Rex agreed, and Krell was ultimately executed, although it was done by a confused and betrayed Dogma, who had grabbed one of Fives' pistols when Rex hesitated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after, the Battle of Umbara met with Republic victory, though the surviving clones, including Tup, were left to ponder and mourn the events of the long and bloody campaign."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Biochip conspiracy"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Ringo Vinda"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, Tup fought in the campaign on Ringo Vinda in 19 BBY, in which Republic forces attacked a space station encircling the planet. At one point, he went missing, with his disappearance reported by General Skywalker, though he reappeared five rotations later. Afterwards, Tup and Fives were among several troopers of the 501st assigned by Skywalker to back up General Tiplar during a three-pronged assault on Separatist Admiral Trench's command center, with Skywalker and Tiplar's twin sister Tiplee leading the other assault forces. However, as the group was preparing to move out, Tup began to feel and act strange, feeling animosity towards Tiplar when he looked at her. Fives noticed he was acting slightly off and asked him if he was okay, and Tup, snapped out of his strange mood, dismissed it as a minor headache, ready to fight. Fives offered his encouragement to Tup as the battle commenced."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the attack progressed, Tup's feelings of unease worsened and eventually culminated in him entering a trance-like state and executing Tiplar. This was caused by a malfunction of Tup's decayed behavioral modification biochip, resulting in his involuntary and premature execution of Clone Protocol 66. The execution of Tiplar caused the Republic attack to lose its momentum, forcing Skywalker to order a retreat. As the retreat progressed, Fives took Tup into custody and was ordered to return him to base for questioning. Once back at a Republic command post, Tup initially seemed unaware of what had happened. However, as he was being questioned by Rex, Tup launched himself at Tiplee, though this attack failed, as she used the Force to hold him against a wall. Tup was further examined by clone medic CT-6116 \"Kix\" and it was determined he had suffered some sort of breakdown, though clones had been designed to withstand any kind of stress. It was speculated that it may have been some sort of virus, and Kix suggested taking Tup to Kamino, where additional scans could be completed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tup was sedated and placed on a shuttle for transport to Kamino. However, his actions on the battlefield had been reported to Count Dooku by Trench, and the Sith Lord, recognizing the signs of a premature control chip activation in the Harch's description, ordered that Tup be abducted for study on the orders of his master, Darth Sidious. A Separatist force attacked the shuttle and its escorting starfighters, destroying the fighters and killing everyone onboard the shuttle except for Tup, who was placed in a stasis pod. After the discovery of the attack, Skywalker, Rex, and Fives investigated the wreckage of the shuttle. Deducing when the Separatists were planning on transporting Tup from the Ringo Vinda space station, the three grappled onto the Separatist shuttle, commanded by the super tactical droid Kraken, and rescued Tup.

While Rex was sent back to the front lines, Fives chose to remain with his friend. Believing that something more was going on, Fives performed a brain scan of Tup with the help of medical droid AZI-3, discovering what they believed to be a brain tumor.

Thanks to the information Tano uncovered, she was able to remove Rex's control chip and eventually escape with him. With the execution of Order 66 not long after Tup's death, both the Jedi Order and the Republic met their end, the Galactic Empire was born, and all clone troopers were converted into stormtroopers before eventually being retired entirely. At some point, the clones Commander Wolffe and clone commando Gregor also removed their chips and joined up with Rex. Prior to the execution of Order 66, Kix went on to conduct his own investigation, but, like Fives, was also silenced before he could share his findings. He was abducted and cryo-frozen in stasis by Separatist forces on board a ship which crashed on Ponemah Terminal, where he would eventually be revived roughly fifty years later by pirates.
