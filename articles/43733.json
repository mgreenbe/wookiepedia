Jackson concerning the final fate of her characters Adalric Cessius Brandl, Jaalib Brandl, and Fable Astin. She submitted it originally for the Star Wars Adventure Journal but West End Games stopped producing the Journals before the story could be printed. It was later submitted to the Star Wars Gamer magazines where it was turned down for unknown reasons. Because of this, Patricia Jackson has posted the story online where it is available for all to read."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
