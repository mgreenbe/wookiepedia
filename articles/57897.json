Some were benevolent, like the rain goddess Dobbis or the god of spring water Gobba, while others were malignant, like the master of destruction Mekamok and his cohort Balmtop, god of diseases. Still others could pass beyond the notion of good and evil, like the trickster god Nododo, who liked to play dirty tricks on both the mortals and his fellow deities. Mere mortals being transformed into Guds were not unheard of: the divine lord of war Balam was originally the first Gungan warrior to whom the Guds awarded the gift of immortality after his death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gungans thought that the ancient statues left by the vanished race of the Elders were icons representing the Guds. Such locales as the Gungan Sacred Place in the Lianorm Swamp or the Gungan Caves were originally built by the Elders and contained colossal stone heads that were reinterpreted in the light of the Gungan's beliefs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gungans also thought that the Guds were behind the social institution of life debt and demanded that all such debts be repaid.
