After the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance attacked several Imperial vessels in order to keep enemy pursuers off of their trail after Yavin 4 was abandoned. Several of these vessels lost a great deal of starfighters as a result of these battles with the Rebels, so numerous TIE staging areas were built across the galaxy in order to resupply these ships within a short period of time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the events preceding the creation of Echo Base on Hoth, the Rebel pilot Keyan Farlander was sent to destroy one of these bases near the planet Yunkor IX. He flew the newly-released B-wing starfighter in its first official combat mission against the Empire. Farlander succeeded and destroyed the entire base. Several similar bases were lost before and after this attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
