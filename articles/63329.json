At some point after the Battle of Yavin, he had become a murderer but managed to escape the Royal Naboo Security Forces. Circa 1 ABY, Lieutenant Khartoor of the Violent Crimes Division was tasked to arrest Jarkey. The wanted murderer sought for help among different criminal groups. He first joined the Muskegs but they commanded him to assassinate members of the Naboo human government. Fleeing the Gungans fanatics, he hid for a short time in the Skaak Tipper Compound and in the Mummer bunker. Jarkey eventually recruited a small army of Naboo pirates and fortified a ranch near Theed. Nevertheless, Hunnos Jarkey and all pirates were killed during the final RSF assault."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hunnos Jarkey appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
