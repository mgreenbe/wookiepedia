It emerged after the planet became incapable of supporting life so a giant machine called the House of the Goddess was built to correct this. At some point, two components were removed from the machine causing the disease to afflict the Godoans once more. Outsiders could be protected against the disease by taking radioactive baths but if one already affected took one then their life would only be prolonged a little. It would cause death by asphyxiation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Visiting Godo on a mercy mission, Admiral Ackbar, Bey and Han Solo were taken to the House of the Goddess on the planet where Solo worked out that the House was in fact a machine. After bringing R2-D2 and C-3PO to investigate, they discovered that two key components were missing from the machine; the statues of the Dancing Goddess and the Minstrel. Luke Skywalker deduced that the machine had been built to help support life on Godo by keeping the disease from the atmosphere. The party's guide, Fumiyo was close to death when Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca returned the Dancing Goddess to the House but he recovered when the machine reactivated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to the Alliance fleet in orbit, Calrissian suddenly became clammy and pale\u2014symptoms of the disease. He revealed that he hadn't taken the protective radioactive treatment and Solo threatened to fire upon Godo if Calrissian would not be allowed to return to the House where he would recover from the disease. Fumiyo protested that it wasn't his choice to make before giving in, not wanting anymore deaths. Calrissian was brought to the House where he recovered in a similar fashion to Fumyio."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
