Upon the discovery of Wilk's mutation, his mother abandoned him, leaving him to fend for himself. Wilk was then found by the hermit Bloch, who took him in and taught him how to speak. However, Wilk occasionally chose to conceal his ability of speech when the situation called for it, acting as a simple domesticated pet. Later, Wilk left Endor with his friend El Borak to explore the larger galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wilk, a male wolf, was born on the Forest Moon of Endor in the year 33 BBY, during the height of the Old Republic. His mother was a normal wolf, but Wilk was born with a genetic defect, making him a mutant and unique among the wolves on Endor. As a result, he was abandoned by his mother and eventually discovered by Bloch, a hermit, who taught Wilk how to speak, among other things about the surrounding world. Wilk later paired up with his friend El Borak, and together they traveled throughout the galaxy. At some point, the two friends came into contact with the insane Doctor Ames, who brought them along on a dangerous quest. In another instance, Wilk engaged Imperial TIE fighters in space combat and shot several down, which he believed was a first for his species. Wilk survived until at least the time of the Battle of Yavin, in 0 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wilk was a very large wolf, weighing almost 300 kilograms and growing to a height of 1.3 meters. He was also extremely long-lived for a wolf, having reached the age of thirty-three years old as of 0 BBY. Wilk spoke with a very refined style, and those whom met him were initially shocked by his proper speech. However, Wilk sometimes played the part of a simple animal companion when certain situations called for it. Wilk also had a grasp of technology, overcoming designs ill-suited to his anatomy to destroy several enemy TIE fighters. Wilk was usually friendly with a good sense of humor, but he could become incredibly violent when someone he liked was attacked. In such confrontations, Wilk used his large claws as formidable weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wilk appeared in dossier BXLH: Les mutants dans Star Wars (translated, File BXLH: The mutants in Star Wars), a roleplaying article published in the 1990 French magazine Graal 23.
