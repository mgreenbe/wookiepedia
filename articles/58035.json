While loved by these amphibious peoples, most other species can't abide the bitter-tasting flesh of this fish. This is largely due to the gumfishes' diet - plants in the waterways of Naboo mostly use chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis to produce energy. This process creates a sulfurous taste which is passed on to the gumfish."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
