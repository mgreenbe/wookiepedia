Blackmoon Squadron was made up of E-wing escort starfighters, and crewmembers reshuffled from Green Squadron. The Blackmoons were based on Borleias following the Battle of Coruscant, where they served alongside General Wedge Antilles during the Battle of Borleias. The squadron went on to become one of the elite squadrons of the New Republic/Galactic Alliance military, serving at the Second Battle of Obroa-skai and the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar. The unit was originally named Green Squadron and commanded by Captain Yakown Reth. Following his relief of duty due to battle-stress-induced paranoia, Blackmoon Squadron came under the command of Luke Skywalker, and later Captain Saz, who led the squadron through the rest of the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
