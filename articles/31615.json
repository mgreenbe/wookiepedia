The game was played in two teams. Each team took turns flicking small discs on a hexagonal board which had pegs on it. If a disc did not hit a enemy disc already on the board, it was removed. Points were scored by knocking the enemy team's discs off the board, and also by landing discs in the center of the board."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crokin first appeared in the novel Ahsoka by E.
