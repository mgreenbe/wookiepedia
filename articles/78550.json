The design was originally developed in the frontier systems of Kumauri space, and named after the empire's ruler, Vall Kumauri. The last line in the series of warships was the Cal-class battleship. Although the Kumauri Empire was quickly defeated by the Galactic Republic, the Kumauri Battleship design retained its menace until the development of effective planetary shields, and the ship design was adopted by many other spacefleets, including the Republic Navy itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
