The Lost Tribe of Sith, as the survivors were known, quickly took over the planet, naming the lakes after the deceased Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos. In 4985 BBY, the local Keshiri residents began harvesting a kind of fluorescent algae from the Ragnos Lakes. Lost Tribe leader Yaru Korsin sent one of his advisors, Ravilan Wroth, to the area to discern whether the algae could be used for lighting Sith structures. Wroth, who desired to escape seclusion on Kesh, decided to use the opportunity to convince the Sith to withdraw from Keshiri matters and focus on finding a way off the planet. Using the deadly compound cyanogen silicate, he and several accomplices poisoned the water supply of Tetsubal, killing the entire Keshiri population. However, Wroth's misdeeds were discovered, and Yaru Korsin's wife Seelah conspired to poison the rest of the Ragnos Lakes villages and frame Wroth. Her plan went off without a hitch, and Wroth and the other members of the Sith species on Kesh were systematically purged from Kesh as a result. The Ragnos Lakes region was subsequently abandoned, with its empty settlements regarded as ghost towns\u2014by 3960 BBY, the area was commonly believed to be haunted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ragnos Lakes are mentioned in three eBooks by John Jackson Miller\u2014Lost Tribe of the Sith: Paragon, Purgatory, and Sentinel.
