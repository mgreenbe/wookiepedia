When Anakin and Padm\u00e9 attempt to talk to Lyonie and he refuses to abandon his plans, the two notice that he appears to be not himself. The cause is a mind control necklace which Anakin telekinetically snatches from Lyonie's neck, making him recover, and Lyonie confirms that the necklace was given to him by Rish Loo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Loo is in fact secretly in league with Count Dooku, who has promised him the freedom of his people in exchange for aiding the Separatists in invading Naboo. Lyonie confronts Loo about his treachery, but Rish Loo uses his mystical powers to try and control him once more; when Anakin and Padm\u00e9 come to Lyonie's aid, he unleashes a squad of commando droids on them, stabs Lyonie and escapes the underwater city. With Lyonie lying unconscious, it appears the attack on the Naboo cannot be called off anymore ... not until Jar Jar inadvertently dons Lyonie's crown of office, making Anakin and Padm\u00e9 note a striking resemblance to the Boss. Anakin therefore hatches a plan to make the Gungan army stand off the attack by having Jar Jar pretend to be Lyonie."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the surface, Rish Loo tries to salvage his plans by telling the assembled Gungan warriors that Lyonie is dead. The disguised Jar Jar appears just in time, and although nervous, he makes a good impersonation of Lyonie and denounces Loo as a traitor. Loo manages to escape, however, but as Anakin pursues him, a Separatist troop carrier arrives and the battle droid crew address Jar Jar, since they believe that everything is still according to Dooku's plan. Forced to maintain his role, Jar Jar and General Tarpals board the ship to help in coordinating the attack, only to find out that the leader of the droid army is none other than General Grievous himself!"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flustered and terrified, Jar Jar desperately stalls for time and sends Tarpals out to inform Padm\u00e9 about this development. Padm\u00e9 advises him to try and capture Grievous by shutting down his droid escort before Grievous can note this desperate deception. Grievous eventually becomes highly irritated by the apparent Lyonie's sudden hesitation in conducting the assault and figures out that he is an imposter. Jar Jar escapes to the outside just in time to escape Grievous' rage, and for Grievous to notice that his army has been disabled. The Gungans surround Grievous, who fights back, fatally stabbing Tarpals in the process. With the last of his strength, however, Tarpals shocks Grievous into submission, enabling his capture, before expiring. Upon learning of Grievous' capture, Darth Sidious commands Dooku, hidden in an ancient Naboo structure, to lure Anakin into a trap to take him hostage for a prisoner exchange."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, Anakin chases after Loo, but is slowed by two probe droids who shoot his Kaadu mount. Upon Dooku's command, however, Loo lures Anakin to the structure, where he meets Dooku.
