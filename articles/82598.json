During the year 20 BBY, Lo-Taren, along with guild leader Garnac and three other comrades, was searching for potential hunting prey on the planet Felucia when he came across Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Lo-Taren captured the Togruta and brought her back to Garnac's Trandoshan prisoner ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano was taken to the moon of Wasskah, where she was dropped off on an island along with several other prisoners. Under orders from Garnac, Lo-Taren opened fire with the freighter as soon as the prisoners were free, killing two of them. The next day, Lo-Taren continued the hunt on foot but was nearly killed by the Jedi youngling Kalifa when she used the Force to strangle him out of anger while he was distracted. However, Tano persuaded Kalifa to allow the hunter to live."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lo-Taren and the other guild members later investigated the guild's freighter after the Jedi caused it to crash, before returning to the guild's floating headquarters. When Tano later attacked the floating fortress alongside two other younglings and the Wookiee captive Chewbacca, Lo-Taren and the other Trandoshans attempted to defend the fortress. The hunters were nearly successful, but a rescue mission led by the Wookiee general Tarfful turned the tide.

The guild, which operated on the Mid Rim moon of Wasskah, hunted other sentient beings that would be captured by the guild from across the galaxy. During 20 BBY, Lo-Taren was present on one such kidnapping expedition. Detaining prey on a Trandoshan prisoner ship piloted by Trandoshans Krix and Lagon, Lo-Taren's hunt eventually brought him to the planet Felucia. By this point, the freighter already held the Snivvian Katt Mol, the Terrelian Jango Jumper Lika, the Sakiyan Vadoo, and the Selkath Morgo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of Lo-Taren's arrival, Felucia was hosting a battle between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems as a part of the ongoing Clone Wars. While out in the Felucian jungle, Lo-Taren trailed a squad of Republic clone troopers led by Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Although Tano was aware of Lo-Taren's general presence due to her connection with the Force, she was unable to focus in on her tail. Lo-Taren followed the Republic unit to a Separatist fortress, where the clones began ascending an outer wall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano, however, decided to cover them from the ground, as she still sensed Lo-Taren. Distracted by her hunch, the Trandoshan hunter ambushed Tano with an electrified net gun that rendered the Padawan unconscious with a well-aimed stun net. Lo-Taren dragged an unconscious Tano back to the Trandoshan starship and threw and locked her in a cage before destroying her comlink as she regained consciousness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lo-Taren returned to the ship's bridge to inform Garnac, his son Dar, and the ship's crew that new Jedi prey had been acquired.

Lo-Taren and the other Trandoshans jumped aboard MSP80 Pteropter hover pods and went to the moon's surface. Despite riding down with hunters Ratter and Sochek, Lo-Taren separated from them to hunt by himself on foot. Lo-Taren encountered Ahsoka Tano out in the open who, ironically, was hunting for him. Lo-Taren attempted to shoot Tano, but she disarmed him with the use of the Force. They engaged in hand-to-hand combat in which Lo-Taren successfully wore Tano down. The Trandoshan grabbed his dropped rifle, but before he could kill Tano, he was lifted into the air by Kalifa\u2014a previously captured Jedi youngling\u2014and telekinetically strangled. However, Tano spared Lo-Taren's life in order to stop Kalifa from simply killing out of hatred."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lo-Taren called for backup, which prompted Kalifa's other Jedi youngling companions, O-Mer and Jinx, to attack him and use the Force to throw Lo-Taren into a tree and knock him out. Before running off, Tano grabbed the Trandoshan's blaster rifle. However, the rifle was remotely deactivated so that the Jedi could not make use of it. That night, Lo-Taren was present on Garnac's Ubrikkian floating fortress headquarters for Dar's initiation ceremony, and partook in chanting Dar's name. However, Lo-Taren's inability to kill the Jedi inadvertently led to Dar's death during a scuffle with Tano the next day.

Krix was sent in response."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, the Jedi and Chewbacca launched a surprise attack on the floating fortress using the hover pod they had stolen from Krix when he tried to rendezvous with Smug. After the attackers threw Lagon to his death, Lo-Taren and the other Trandoshans swarmed to the scene at the beckoning of the hunter Ramy. Lo-Taren, alongside fellow hunter Sochek, attempted to take the upper hand by flanking the Jedi. However, O-Mer used the stolen hover pod's blaster cannon to force the two Trandoshans behind cover."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "O-Mer was quickly shot down by Garnac, and the crash halted the Jedi offensive.
