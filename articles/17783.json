A relative of the thud bug, the blast bug was also shaped from a sparkbee. But unlike the thud and razor bugs, the blast bug was the Yuuzhan Vong analog of a guided missile. Upon reaching contact with the target, the blast bug would explode, sending the victim hurling through the air, causing severe burns, and even breaching armor. A Human caught in the explosion without armor had very little chance of survival."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
