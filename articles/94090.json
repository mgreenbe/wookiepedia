Musk was employed as an enforcer for the Hutt Cartel based out of Nar Shaddaa and Nal Hutta. During the war, the Nikto was assigned to escort the Mirialan smuggler Hylo Visz to Corellia. He was accompanied by a Weequay enforcer as well. During the job, Visz became skittish and attempted to bail on the operation, but was incapacitated by the Weequay, who struck the Mirialan in the face with his blaster rifle. Visz later escaped the ship, but the Weequay and Musk completed the job, accepting the corporation's payment in exchange for the ion drives. The two then took Visz's ship, the Crimson Fleece, but were killed when the vessel exploded. The explosion was caused by bombs the Rendili Corporation had planted within their credit payments, in an effort to double-cross Barrga the Hutt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
