They traveled to the Inner Rim world of Jakku to collect the Zabrak bounty hunter Jas Emari. The Black Sun crime boss Gyuti had imposed a bounty on her head for overdue debts and Swift wanted to collect the bounty as revenge for Emari's role in trapping him on Taris. However, Jas managed to escape from Niima the Hutt's temple and stole Swift's Corellian shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jas later returned with her friend Norra Wexley and the B1-series battle droid Mister Bones, Jeeta and her fellow hunters cornered her and Niima. Niima, who had struck a deal with Jas and Norra in return for ferrying her back to her temple, refused to let Swift take Jas. However, Niima was forced to relent when Dengar threatened her with a blaster. After they had recaptured Jas, Jeeta piloted Swift's Corellian shuttle. In the cargo hold, Jas managed to convince Dengar and Embo to switch sides in return for helping her collect a New Republic bounty on Grand Admiral Rae Sloane so that they could secure pardons.

Following the Battle of Jakku and the signing of the Galactic Concordance between the New Republic and the defeated Galactic Empire, Jeeta, Dengar, and Embo received full pardons and money from the New Republic.
