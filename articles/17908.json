Unlike other fungi on the planet, it did not reproduce using spores, but rather their cells divided spontaneously, gradually forming small pods which burst open when fully matured. Some varieties were noticed growing extra stalks. Cal Kestis found a Bleeding Gut seed during his mission to rebuild the Jedi Order and added it to Greez Dritus' terrarium aboard the Stinger Mantis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
