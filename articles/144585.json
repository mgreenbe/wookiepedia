While living on Tatooine, Nadon still honored the Ithorian traditions and tried to adapt large trees from Ithor to the hot dry weather on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Tatooine, just after the Battle of Tatooine, he met Alima, who was searching for the missing droids. Alima threatened to kill his beloved trees if he did not help him find those two droids. The pacifistic Nadon attempted to kill Alima, but because of Nadon's lacking experience with weapons, the attempt failed and Nadon was humiliated by Alima once more. Finally, Nadon discovered the truth when he saw old Ben Kenobi in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. The old man had the wanted droids. Nadon then hid in the background when stormtroopers tried to stop Han Solo's Millennium Falcon from escaping with Kenobi, the droids and a young farm boy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After losing the droids, the Imperial Prefect searched for a scapegoat for this failure. Nadon then appeared on the scene and told the Imperial Prefect that he told Alima about Millennium Falcon and Alima didn't report that information. Nadon was willing to swear under oath and ready to testify that in Imperial court. The officer, taking justice in his own hand, shot Alima, killing him. Nadon was horrified and saddened at what he had done, but a small part of him was glad, for he and his trees were safe. To make up for this, he took two cell samples from Alima's corpse for later cloning. In keeping with the Law of Life, Nadon made two clones, so that Alima would pay his debt to the Ithorians\u2014and Nadon would pay his to Alima."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
