The vessel shared its name with Senator Lexi Dio. In 1 BBY, it fought alongside other Rebel starships, including Captain Juno Eclipse's Salvation, to defend against an Imperial assault on a Rebel fleet hidden near the Itani Nebula. It was the first ship to be destroyed during the battle when seven small vessels attacked the Rebel starships. Lexi Dio was already badly damaged when four of the ships blasted it with missiles, which split it from nose to stern. The instant loss of compression resulted in the deaths of everyone aboard. Captain Eclipse responded to the attack by ordering the fleet to disperse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lexi Dio appeared in the The Force Unleashed II novelization, written by Sean Williams and published in 2010.
