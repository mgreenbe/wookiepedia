The Rebel pilot Paril Ritta was one of four pilots who were transferred from the Atrivis sector to the Profundity to bolster its starfighter forces. By 5 BBY,[source?] the sector was the site of an armed rebellion against the Galactic Empire by the Atrivis Resistance Group and the Liberators. The Liberators seized the garrison on Mantooine, but were soon devastatingly defeated by the Imperial Navy.
