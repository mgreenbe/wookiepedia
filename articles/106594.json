During his time on the Council, Dapatian took on an apprentice that had been one of Qui-Gon Jinn's cr\u00e8che-mates. He was present at some point when Master Eno Cordova and his Padawan, Cere Junda, were assigned to investigate a Temple on Ontotho. In 40 BBY, Dapatian announced that he intended to retire from the Council in a month's time and his place on the Council was offered to Jinn, who requested time to meditate on the offer. He breathed with the aid of a respirator mask. He was considered highly renowned, but became very aged in appearance in his later years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Poli Dapatian first appeared in Master & Apprentice, a 2019 novel written by Claudia Gray.
