Lomus was assigned to Unit Cresh, a unit in the squad LRC077. Lomus was part of a group-training exercise in the Well, a purpose-built training facility, but did not do well. He later was paired for an exercise with Nazhros Oleg, an unpopular cadet, and complained so much that he was given two demerits. During an inspection at Viewing Day, Lomus was criticized for having his tunic buttoned incorrectly. Jai Kell, another cadet, did not think much of Lomus, feeling he was so dumb that he likely would not even make stormtrooper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
