During the war, this group of younglings were deemed to be at the top of their class and, led by Ahsoka Tano, they traveled to Ilum to participate in the Gathering; an ancient Jedi ritual that proved a youngling's readiness to become Padawans.  This particular clan, never identified by name, consisted of Petro (a human male), Ganodi (a Rodian female), Katooni (a Tholothian female), Byph (an Ithorian male), Zatt (a Nautolan male), and Gungi (a Wookiee male)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
