Findsmen were known for their uncanny tracking skills, and when the tradition began to die out on Gand, a Gand known as Zuckuss became one of the first to venture off-world, using his particular talents to become a renowned and highly sought-after bounty hunter. At the time of the Iron Blockade, the findsman Vakk operated in the Anoat sector. Unusual even among his mystically minded peers, Vakk was strictly non-violent, using his skills only to track and discover but never to apprehend or kill."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally appearing unnamed in the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, the findsmen were first identified as such Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back, a 1989 Star Wars Legends supplement written by Michael Stern for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
