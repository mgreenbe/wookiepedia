Yoda reminds Obi-Wan of the neutrality of the planet, telling him that the Jedi cannot send help until the Senate agrees on it.

After Obi-Wan refuses and berates Maul as weak for choosing the dark side, Maul draws and ignites the Darksaber while pulling Satine towards the weapon, impaling the Duchess. Satine falls into the arms of Obi-Wan, and tells him that she has always loved him and always will.

However, Sidious sees that he is being deceived, and tells Maul he has become a rival. They all draw their lightsabers and begin to fight. Sidious proves himself to be too strong for the brothers even combined and he manages to keep Maul out of the fight long enough to impale Savage. He tells Maul that he was an unworthy apprentice and as he dies, the Nightsister magic used to alter him bleeds out of his body, and he returns to his original form. Sidious reminds Maul of the Rule of Two, and tells him that he has been replaced. Maul, filled with anger and grief, draws the Darksaber and his lightsaber, and starts another vicious duel against Sidious. Maul put up a better fight than Opress did but he soon found himself outmatched by Sidious's superior combat skill and experience and his immense power in the Force and is ultimately disarmed and overpowered. As Maul begs for mercy, Sidious reminds him that the Sith refuse to show mercy and then tortures him with Force lightning.
