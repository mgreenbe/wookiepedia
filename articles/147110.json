Once the planet's mines ran dry, Figg Excavations pulled out and abandoned Tokmia, leaving behind a strange cargo cult among the Oku, who, remembering the gifts they had been given, burned huge fires to resemble landing lights in prophesy that the magical starships of the offworlders would one day return."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Search for the Rebel base"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, during the Galactic Civil War, Tokmia briefly attracted the interest of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire.

In addition, Star Wars: Rebellion and its accompanying strategy guide originally placed Tokmia in the Churba sector, but Hoth and the Greater Javin changed its location to the Greater Javin region."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Star Wars: Rebellion cartography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars: Rebellion provides hyperspace travel times between each planet in the game. However, in several instances these times are significantly longer than those in other Star Wars Legends sources, which seems to reflect the Star Wars: Rebellion hyperspace times as game mechanics rather than actual figures. Tokmia's intra-sector hyperspace times and distance from Coruscant according to Star Wars: Rebellion using the game's fastest capital ship hyperdrive are as follows.
