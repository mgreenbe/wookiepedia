Koensayr Manufacturing was in the process of conducting the first tests on the BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber under the Y-wing project helmed by Republic Senator Ask Aak at a facility in orbit, despite the Republic already having a number of BTL-B Y-wings in its arsenal before the outbreak of the war as power projection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi General Anakin Skywalker asked Koensayr for a squadron of the BTL-B bombers, but because Senator Aak resented Skywalker for failing to stop the assassination of Aak's predecessor, Senator Aks Moe, the request was refused. The Y-wing project was considered essential for a successful military campaign by the Republic Military, and General Skywalker decided to seize all the ships he required directly from the workshops in orbit, rather than denounce Senator Aak's decision to higher officials."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
