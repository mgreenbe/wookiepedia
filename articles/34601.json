At one point, Darth Caldoth wrote a book titled The Bestiary of Darth Caldoth, which mentioned various Sith warbeasts such as the veergundark. According to legend, Caldoth eventually gained a Sith apprentice, the Twi'lek Ry Nymbis, and they were considered the two most powerful individuals in the galaxy at one point. Caldoth killed his own apprentice with a Sith ritual that turned the person's body into stone when he felt Nymbis was going to betray him. With the ritual, Nymbis was trapped in an eternal nightmare. There was a legend about Caldoth's search for Force powers leading him into conflict with the Nightsisters of Dathomir, after stealing a pod of a buried Nightsister. The adept coven member Zeldin was chosen to practice magicks in order to seek revenge against Darth Caldoth, reaching out telepathically to influence the Sith Lord, including the encounter with his apprentice Nymbis. Later, when on her final attempt, Zeldin realized that Darth Caldoth was aware of her mental presence, and trapped the Nightsister in a cage in his own mind, occasionally remembering her presence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Caldoth was first mentioned in the 2019 canon audiobook Dooku: Jedi Lost, written by Cavan Scott.
