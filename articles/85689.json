It was a planet shrouded in mystery, and the location of an event known as the Great Scourge of Malachor, which took place thousands of years before the rise of the Empire. The Great Scourge was an ancient battle at Malachor's Sith temple between the Sith and the Jedi Order, which saw a superweapon activated, killing and petrifying all the participants of the battle, remaining for years after."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Jedi Master Yoda told Ezra Bridger, a Padawan, to find Malachor to help him defeat Darth Vader and the Inquisitors.

The planet had a Sith temple located underneath its surface, which resembled an ocean of liquid carbonite that had flash-frozen. Small, pyramidal, solid stone foothills were located equidistant from each other on the surface of the planet.

This temple held a colossal kyber crystal that was used to power the temple. Thousands of years before the brewing war between the First Order and the Resistance, the planet was the location of a massive battle, in which the Jedi Order launched an all-out assault against the Sith when the temple's weapon misfired and petrified everyone on the planet. After these events, Malachor was made forbidden to the Jedi, though stories of what had happened were passed down, forming the basis of many legends. Millennia later, the debris of war still littered the battlefield. Any traces of the planet's existence were erased in the Jedi Archives, in the hopes the Sith secrets could be completely lost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, many spacers claimed to have found the planet and would bring back Sith relics, some obvious frauds but others had genuine connections to the dark side.

There, Sidious showed Maul a vision of the battle between the Sith and the Jedi. Later, both Sith returned to Malachor, where Sidious showed Maul yet another vision, in which Maul became a Jedi but betrayed those he was helping. Sidious used this to teach Maul that Sith must not act without thinking about their actions. The visions were the result of inhaling the ash of dead Force-users. On another occasion, Sidious visited Malachor and brought back a Sith Chalice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to its infamy, Malachor was often invoked as a curse word. While contemplating his strategy for getting himself and his team of astromech droids off the desert world of Abafar, Colonel Meebur Gascon exclaimed that there was \"no way in Malachor\" that he would lead his team on an assault on a Separatist landing field.

He claimed that doing so would give them the knowledge they needed to destroy the Sith. The Inquisitors soon caught up with them. While Kanan and Ahsoka fought with the Inquisitors, Maul sent Ezra to bring the holocron to the top of the temple. Meanwhile, Maul killed the Inquisitors before turning on Kanan and Ahsoka.

Ahsoka arrived and dueled with Vader, while Kanan and Ezra joined forces to remove the holocron. Since the Temple was building up a power charge, the removal of the holocron caused it to implode. Kanan and Ezra managed to escape before the Temple closed in on them.

The world went on to appear as the final location in the sequel, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, revealing that it was a shattered and ruined world consumed by the energies of the Mass Shadow Generator. This event led to a pyrrhic victory for the Republic, destroying many Mandalorian and even Republic forces in the process. In The Sith Lords, Malachor V housed the Trayus Academy, an ancient Sith academy used by the Sith Triumvirate of Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion in the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War.
