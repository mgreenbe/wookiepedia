Klik-Klak hoped Karina would be able to repopulate the Geonosian species, but she was sterile and instead attached a mechanical womb to her body.

To protect the secret of the Death Star, the Empire wiped out the Geonosian people using poison gas and left the planet a barren wasteland. Only one Geonosian, he held in his possession the last known egg containing a Geonosian queen. Klik-Klak knew that the safe hatching of this egg was the only way to repopulate Geonosis, so he fiercely protected it in the hopes of giving his people another chance at life. Klik-Klak felt forced to defend the egg when resistance fighter Saw Gerrera led a team of rebels to investigate intelligence reports pointing to suspicious Imperial activity on the planet\u2014which, though unknown to the fledgling Rebel Alliance, was the remnants of the Death Star project.

The Spectres, particularly the young Jedi Ezra Bridger, convinced Gerrera to back down. After helping the rebels discover the poison gas that was used to wipe out the planet's population, Klik-Klak retreated deeper beneath the planet's surface where, one day, he hoped the egg would hatch safely.

Rather than Geonosians, she produced many B1 droid workers, altered to look like her people.

Once they arrived, they made their way into the Geonosian catacombs, where Karina's droid children tried and failed to stop them from proceeding to her lair. Vader found Karina and used his lightsaber to sever the droid factory from her body. Injured but alive, Karina unleashed her battle droids against the Sith Lord, refusing to allow the future of her reign and all of Geonosis to be taken by an Empire that had already stolen so much from them.

Her successful hatching from an egg some time prior to the Battle of Yavin signified the potential to repopulate the Geonosian species after it was wiped out by the Galactic Empire. That potential was dashed, as Karina was sterile and could not produce offspring by the time Darth Vader encountered her. Instead, she was fitted with a mechanical womb so she could produce battle droid offspring.
