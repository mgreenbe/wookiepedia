When used in a lightsaber, kimber stones produced a nonlethal blade, and as such were initially excluded from lightsabers. However, a few Jedi would eventually come to use the stones in their sabers. After the Jedi Order's fall, the crystals could be bought on the black market for 6,500 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
