Dooku commandeered a HoloNet relay station in the Raxus system and denounced the Galactic Republic as a futile enterprise that was hopelessly burdened by corruption and favoritism toward the Core Worlds. Following the address, Dooku founded the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the ensuing Separatist Crisis would eventually lead to the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Raxus Address was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon, albeit unidentified, in the 2014 novel Tarkin written by James Luceno and published by Del Rey.
