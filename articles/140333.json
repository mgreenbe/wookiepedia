In return, Canderous would help Revan steal the Ebon Hawk, the ship of Canderous's employer Davik Kang, and escape from the planet. Revan purchased a droid named T3-M4 from Janice Nall and used it to break into the base. Once inside, Revan came face-to-face with the Sith Governor, who sensed the Force within Revan. Seeing an opportunity to receive his lightsaber, the Sith Governor attacked Revan, but was soon killed. Revan took the launch codes from the Governor's quarters and brought them to Canderous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This military base was solely seen in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, during the period which Revan and Carth Onasi are stranded on Taris, while in search of Bastila Shan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There is a glitch in the game, where in one of the corridors, a single blaster is seen lying on the floor, however it isn't involved with the plot, nor can any character pick it up or acknowledge it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
