A dignified and distinguished looking man in his fifties, Andra was a career military man who graduated from the Neona Military Academy. He was said to have little patience for fools or snobs. The Andra family had a very ancient lineage, and once belonged to a noble house that was long disbanded when the Freeworlds ceded from the Expanse.
