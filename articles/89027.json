It grew to its climax during the height of the Galactic Empire, when the company hired nonhumans for minimum wage. During the attacks of the Faceless on Imperial operations on Esseles, the nonhumans began to strike because of the Empire's anti-alien bias. These strikes would render MeraStel useless and dependent on a droid workforce until negotiations between Kanno Sebak and Hall President Cambira Ralle ended the strike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
