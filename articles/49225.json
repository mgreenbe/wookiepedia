Under the command of the Nautolan Dark Jedi Bengel Morr, the Flesh Raiders became more bold in their attacks against the Jedi, who had returned to their Order's ancestral homeworld in the aftermath of the Sacking of Coruscant and the end of the Great Galactic War. Morr, who had been driven insane by the devastation during the fall of the Jedi Temple, blamed the Jedi Order for the defeat and turned to the dark side, taking on the Human Callef as his apprentice and plotting the destruction of the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, Morr set his plans in motion by sending Callef and a Flesh Raider invasion force against the Jedi outpost in the Tythonian Gnarls region. However, Callef was defeated and killed by a young Jedi initiate, who was then taken on as an apprentice by the Human Jedi Master Orgus Din, Morr's former teacher. Together with Din and the astromech droid T7-O1, the apprentice learned of Morr's survival and vendetta against the Order during the course of several missions for both the Jedi and the Twi'lek settlers of Kalikori. Upon discovering that Morr had organized the natives into an army and was training some of them as Force Adepts, the Jedi moved to eliminate the Flesh Raider command base and several other camps in an attempt to put a stop to Morr's planned assault on the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Din and his apprentice were betrayed by the villagers when Morr made a deal with the Twi'leks, trading protection from the Flesh Raiders in exchange for the life of his former Master and Din's new Padawan. While Morr took his unconscious mentor to the ancient machine known as the Forge, the villagers attempted to kill Din's apprentice and T7-O1 as part of an altered deal, but the Padawan managed to escape without bloodshed and pursued Morr through the Tythan wilderness. Fighting through the Flesh Raider army occupying the ruins of an ancient city, the Padawan and T7-O1 found Morr waiting before the Forge. In a fierce duel, the young apprentice defeated the deranged Morr and rescued Din from his former student. For the Padawan's bravery and actions, Din ordered his apprentice to construct a lightsaber and return to the Jedi Temple, where Morr was healed of his insanity and the apprentice elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight. Along with T7-O1, the Knight's first assignment soon spiraled into war as the Sith Lord Darth Angral launched a campaign against the Republic, and the young Jedi played a pivotal role in the conflict by ultimately defeating the Sith in a battle above Tython."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The origins of the Flesh Raiders' uprising could be traced back to the Great Galactic War, a lengthy conflict between the resurgent Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. The war's end occurred in 3653 BBY, when the Empire used sham peace negotiations on the Core World of Alderaan to stage an attack on the Republic capital of Coruscant, a battle that would become known as the Sacking of Coruscant. In order to force the Republic to submit and to bring an end to the conflict between the two galactic powers, the Empire held the planet captive while the Treaty of Coruscant was signed on Alderaan. As the first part of the Sith assault, a strike team decimated the Jedi Temple, killing the building's defenders and finally destroying it with explosives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bengel Morr, the Nautolan apprentice of the Human Jedi Master Orgus Din, was present in the Temple during the assault, but he fled into the ruins of the structure when the Sith collapsed the Jedi Order's headquarters. His gentle personality shattered, the Nautolan retreated into the depths of the city-planet and was assumed dead by his comrades when his body was not recovered. Morr blamed the Jedi Order for the destruction of the Temple, believing that their weakness had allowed the Sith to win the war. He decided that for the Sith to be defeated, the Order had to be destroyed and rebuilt from its ashes. Turning to the dark side and becoming a Dark Jedi, Morr spent the next decade plotting the destruction of the Order. During this time, he recruited the Force-sensitive Human Callef as his apprentice, training the young man in the ways of the dark side."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Resettling on Tython"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the signing of the Treaty, the devastation of Coruscant and the Empire's victory turned public opinion against the Jedi, and the Galactic Senate\u2014looking for someone to blame for the disaster\u2014decided to delay the reconstruction of the Jedi Temple indefinitely. Realizing that the capital was no longer the best place for its headquarters, the Order relocated to its ancestral homeworld of Tython, which had been discovered only a year earlier by a Jedi Knight named Satele Shan. There, they established a new Jedi Temple and began to explore the ancient ruins left by their precursors, the Je'daii Order. Construction on the new Temple began about three years after the fall of the Temple on Coruscant, just over a year since the Order had rediscovered Tython and established a permanent settlement on the planet, and it took almost three years to complete."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the next decade or so, the Jedi recovered from the devastating losses that they incurred during the war and slowly rebuilt their ranks. Not long after the Order arrived on the planet, a group of Pilgrims petitioned the Senate for permission to settle on Tython, as they had fled religious persecution on their homeworld of Ryloth. However, as Tython was still largely unexplored, the Senate refused their request. In direct defiance of the decree, the Pilgrims established a small settlement in a valley above the Jedi Temple, just on the edge of the Tythos Ridge mountain range. That camp grew into the settlement of Kalikori Village, with a villager named Sumari in the role of Matriarch by the time of the war with the Flesh Raiders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 3643 BBY, Callef and Morr followed the Order to Tython. There, hiding from the Order in the widely unexplored regions of the planet, the two Dark Jedi began to marshal the Flesh Raiders, Tython's native sentient species, into an army. Finding some of the violent species to be Force-sensitive, Morr trained them to be Force Adepts and eventually commanded a significant fighting force under the leadership of the Flesh Raiders' Grand Chieftain Keshk. Before Morr's arrival, the natives had been largely unorganized, but they had launched periodic raids upon both the Jedi and Kalikori Village throughout the last decade with varying amounts of success."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force-wielding Jedi Order easily repelled the natives' attacks, losing only young and inexperienced Jedi to groups of Flesh Raiders, but the Twi'lek villagers fared far worse. Largely unprepared for the attacks and outmatched by the natives' ferocity, Kalikori suffered heavy losses throughout their time on the planet, and the Jedi Order's adherence to the Senate's request to refuse them aid fostered intense resentment of the Jedi in the people of Kalikori. Matters only worsened for the villagers when the Flesh Raiders became more organized under Morr's leadership, and the natives began to attack more frequently and in greater numbers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early encounters"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the Flesh Raider attacks killed a village patrol, including a Twi'lek named Poronth Ghon, and Poronth's son Tazonthe enlisted the aid of a Jedi to find his father. The Jedi discovered the elder Ghon's remains and returned his datapad to Tazonthe, but the man was furious that the Jedi refused to slaughter the Flesh Raiders in revenge. The villager Bahlea was aided by a member of the Order when a Jedi retrieved manka cat teeth for a medical remedy, completing her fallen husband's mission and saving her daughter Rusa. Vederiat Ayon, one of the village's healers, learned from a injured village warrior that the Flesh Raiders were experimenting with elixirs and had succeeding in creating one that drove the natives into a primal fury. She asked a visiting Jedi to destroy the elixir, and sent the Jedi to the guard captain Odumis Mer in order to learn the location of the elixir vats. Mer asked the Jedi to bring the elixir back so that the villagers could use it, but they refused and traveled into the Tythos Ridge to destroy the elixir before informing Ayon of Mer's request. The healer realized that the Captain's mind had been addled by encounters with the natives, so she relieved him of duty so that he could be healed and appointed Bashenn in his place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Order's encounters with the natives often had more success than those of the Twi'leks, such as the repeated attempts to destroy the Jedi outpost in the Tythonian Gnarls region. A group of Padawans\u2014Avitla, Mennaus, and Jerridan\u2014were ambushed by Flesh Raiders in the Gnarls, injuring Jerridan and worrying Master Relnex when they did not return. The Padawans were rescued by another Jedi, though Flesh Raiders continued to stage attacks and kidnap inexperienced apprentices, imprisoning them in cages throughout the Gnarls. Another Jedi discovered a Flesh Raider infant in the mountains near the Temple, and delivered the child to Master Quilb, who often took in orphaned animals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Through the efforts of various members of the Order, the Jedi gained insight into the natives' culture and even recruited the Flesh Raider Fashk into the Order itself. Masters Kalisa Gehnso and Meeb Wix enlisted the aid of another Jedi to investigate the Flesh Raiders' religious idols\u2014the Bone Idol, Flesh Idol, and Salvage Idol\u2014in an attempt to learn what inspired the natives' aggressive behavior, and the Twi'lek villager Trea Kobbeth asked a Jedi to rescue her son Viyo from the Tythos Ridge. The Jedi discovered that Viyo had been captured by Fashk to serve as a translator, and that the Force-sensitive Flesh Raider wished to be trained as a Jedi. Fashk's surprising request was approved by Master Strayen, the Master in charge of administrating the new recruits on Tython, and Viyo was released by the Flesh Raider before Fashk traveled to the Jedi Temple to be trained. Strayen hoped to temper Fashk's violent nature and show him the ways of the light side, since without Jedi training the Flesh Raider would likely succumb to the dark side."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tensions rise"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the months leading up to Morr's assault, a minor conflict broke out over the mystical Fount of Rajivari, a lost repository of knowledge left by the ancient Jedi. One of the Twi'lek villagers, a Force-sensitive named Nalen Raloch, was seduced to the dark side by the teachings of Rajivari, one of the first fallen Jedi who had played a major role in the Force Wars of ancient times. Furious that the Order refused to help his people against the Flesh Raiders, Raloch uncovered the Fount\u2014which was in fact Rajivari's own Force ghost\u2014and, with his new powers, attempted to destroy the ancient machine known as the Forge. The Forge was a device built by the Je'daii to construct lightsabers, and the Jedi Order had continued to send their Padawans there upon as part of the Jedi Trials upon their return to Tython. Raloch was stopped, however, by the apprentice of Jedi Master Yuon Par in a duel, and was successfully cured of his insanity. Raloch would be trained as a Jedi by the Order in an attempt to improve relations with Kalikori, but the village still harbored intense resentment because of the Order's continued refusal of aid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The uprising"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A dark encounter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, the Flesh Raiders captured T7-O1, one of twenty reconnaissance droids sent out by the Jedi Order, and placed the droid with a restraining bolt in the Upper Hollows cave system in the Tythos Ridge.

The natives' main command base was located high in the Tythos Ridge, protected by a shield generator on a nearby mountain, and from there Morr's subordinates coordinated the Flesh Raider army. One of the smaller bases was located in the cave network known as the Forsaken Den, in the cliffs near the ruins of Kaleth, and Flesh Raiders had been learning from a holocron at a nearby shrine. An ancient temple-city of the Jedi's predecessors, the Je'daii Order, Kaleth had been the site of several battles during the devastating Force Wars, and the Jedi Order had been cautiously investigating the outer ruins since their return\u2014making it a perfect place for Flesh Raiders to pass relatively unnoticed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just as Callef led his forces through the tunnel and into the Gnarls, a young Jedi initiate arrived on Tython to take the Jedi Trials.

Weller planned to send the young Jedi to the Temple to meet with the Masters, but at that moment Callef's forces reached the Gnarls Outpost and began to attack the Jedi there. A Bith apprentice by the name of Unaw Aharo witnessed the Flesh Raiders coming through the cave, but by the time he contacted Weller via holocomm, the Flesh Raiders were already at the Jedi outpost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alarmed, Weller immediately ordered the Knights present at the Masters' Retreat across the lake separating the structure from the Gnarls, where they mounted a defense of the Gnarls Outpost against the natives. As the base was relatively undermanned, Weller sent the newly arrived apprentice into the Gnarls, since the learner was remarkably skilled in combat. During the course of the fight, Weller was injured, and he contacted the apprentice before taking a shuttle back to the Temple medcenter.

However, Matriarch Sumari was displeased that the Jedi were only reaching out when their own safety was threatened, and only agreed to share her information if the apprentice would help protect the village. As she had recently fallen ill, Sumari was forced to retire early, but the Padawan continued to speak with Sumari's daughter Ranna Tao'Ven and the village's Scout Chief Moorint.

The uprising represents the in-universe events of the Jedi Knight class storyline during the first half of the Prelude, when the player arrives on Tython and is forced to defend the Jedi outpost in the Gnarls from Flesh Raider attacks. The class storyline consists of six missions overall, with multiple objectives within each mission and several bonus missions. The six missions can be split into a total of seven individual events, with the mission \"The Face of the Enemy\" consisting of a raid on a shield generator and a fight in Kalikori's crop fields."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the exact timeframe of The Old Republic is uncertain, the chronology of many of the class storylines is not precisely known. However, several statements made during the course of the game indicate that the Consular storyline on Tython occurs before the Jedi Knight storyline. Jedi Master Bela Kiwiiks is not present during the Consular storyline, as she and Kira Carsen are on a mission off-world until early in the Jedi Knight storyline. Ranna Tao'Ven is also referred to as the Matriarch's daughter throughout the Consular's storyline, since she only becomes Matriarch when her mother Sumari dies during the Jedi Knight class storyline. Therefore, the Consular storyline must precede the Jedi Knight's storyline, and the Consular missions are not considered part of the uprising. The optional world missions, which are available to both classes, are assumed to precede the Knight's storyline because the Flesh Raider army dissolves after the battle with Bengel Morr, and Kalikori forms an alliance with the Order against the Flesh Raiders. As the side missions are available to both Jedi Knight and Consular players, the identities of the individuals who completed the side missions are unclear due to game mechanics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Jedi Knight is a Republic character, this article assumes that only light side options are chosen, and that the optional game mechanics aspects of the story are completed. The canonical species, gender, and names of the eight player characters are unknown, so this article also refrains from mentioning anything about the Knight's identity or gender. Several missions present alignment options that may result in slightly different events during the course of the Prelude, but the overall storyline remains the same. The major alignment choice in the Prelude appears in the final mission, \"Weapon of the Jedi.\" Sparing Bengel Morr, whether by allowing him to leave or knocking him unconscious, results in the player encountering him on Corellia during Act III. If the player chooses the dark side option of letting him leave, he or she is forced to fight Morr again and potentially kill him, while knocking him out results in his redemption and assignment to Corellia under the Knight's command."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
