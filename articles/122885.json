According to Count Dooku, Head of State of the Confederacy, the Droid Army, at the start of the conflict in 22 BBY, outnumbered the Republic's Clone Army one hundred to one.

The secret droid army was discovered by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose capture triggered an attack by the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic's new Grand Army of the Republic, which had been commissioned by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas.

In 2 BBY, he encountered the former Clone Captain Rex, the Jedi Purge survivor Kanan Jarrus, and his Padawan Ezra Bridger. Still refusing the way the Clone Wars had ended, Kalani organized a final battle with his prisoners.

Following its last orders, JF-86 sought to destroy the Galactic Senate of the Republic, unaware of the events in the galaxy and the transformation of the Republic into the Empire.
