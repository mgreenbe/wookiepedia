Designed by Brian Matyas, the then-unnamed \"Mini-Astromech\" was originally intended to be owned by Riley but instead became a potential crew member that the Smuggler, the player's in-game avatar, can obtain. M2-D8 was first revealed on the pre-registration screen of Star Wars: Uprising's official website as an \"Astromech Crew Member\" that pre-registrants could vote to receive as an exclusive in-game reward, though the now-named unique five-star crew member was ultimately made available as a Stamp Sheet reward for players who logged in 20 days during the month of February 2016.
