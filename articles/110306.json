Falsely obtaining funding from a Republic endowment for disease research and treatment development, the group instead worked on developing experimental adrenals. Doctor Rahser Poth received encrypted communications fron an anonymous scientist that allowed him to develop RAK-5 serum, which in turn was refined into the RS-33 adrenal. The adrenal greatly enhanced subject's strength and agility at the expense of mental faculties, but the fact that both RAK-5 and RS-33 were derived from the rakghoul plague put them into highly unstable state."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eternal Alliance operatives under Theron Shan eventually discovered Semhess and her project and a strike team was dispatched to X7-Cratus to stop RS-33 from becoming a galactic threat. Semhess attempted to use RS-33 enhanced subjects to stop the invaders, but during their fight with Marlon Fenn the station's containment systems were damaged and RAK-5 serum started leaking into the atmosphere. It soon turned both RS-33 test subjects and station personnel into rakghouls. After killing Alirra Semhess, the Eternal Alliance secured the station's containment systems and put an end to the project."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
