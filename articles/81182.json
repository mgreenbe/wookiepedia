It had a long neck, a large nasal horn, and padded feet which, when planted firmly on the ground, made it nearly immovable. Because of this trait, and because of its motionless stance, aided by its large tail as a counterbalance, the Gungan military found it useful as a mobile mount for a cannon. Properly domesticated and trained, the lerraa would stand firm in the face of incoming blaster fire, while its large cannons targeted enemy vehicles, such as Armored Assault Tanks or Multi-Troop Transports, with high-yield boomas. Lerraas were very similar in appearance to zalaacas, another species domesticated by the Gungans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
