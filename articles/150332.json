The position of Tusken King was created sometime afterwards, at least in name. A number of Tusken Kings were known to rule during the time of the Galactic Civil War following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. One, and perhaps the most famous example, included the Tusken King who launched an invasion of Mos Espa, but died in the ensuing battle. This Tusken King wore a krayt dragon skull rucksack, and clothing radically different than most Tusken Raiders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, other Tusken Raiders were known to assume the rank of King around this same time period. A Tusken King and a group of fellow Sand People overtook a village on Tatooine. However, the escaped citizen Tolan Nokkar employed a spacer who liberated the village by wiping out the Tuskens and their King."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another Tusken King led a group of Sand People to overtake an Imperial bunker on the planet. However, they too were wiped out by intrepid spacers exploring the world. Unlike the Tusken King who fought in the Battle of Mos Espa, these two Kings wore garbs indistinguishable from other Tusken Raiders. During more ancient times, a Tusken King plagued Bestine's first settlers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
