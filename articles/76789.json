The pair hired the Tholothian mercenary Ty Yorrick to protect them as they attended the Republic Fair on the planet Valo. En route to the fair, Klerin displayed attraction towards Yorrick while toying with the large bangle she wore on one wrist. Though it appeared to be jewelry, it was actually a four-seven nullifier, a device that disrupted energy weapons such as blasters and lightsabers, powered by the illegal substance recainium. Though Klerin had invented it, her mother posed as the true inventor when meeting with Sullustan Senator Tia Toon to discuss selling it for his Defense Force Program. Toon refused to buy the device, and had Mantessa and Yorrick imprisoned for bringing recainium onto the world. The two managed to escape and got separated when Nihil marauders attacked the Valo Republic Fair, but soon after the mother and daughter were reunited, Mantessa was killed by a hragscythe that had escaped from the Lonisa City Zoo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
