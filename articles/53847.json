Upon arriving, he was reprimanded for having food with him, as the calorie intake of recruits was strictly measured. However, f'Tuhns was able to hide a bag of food from the inspectors, despite a warning that he would receive severe punishment if caught with food again. After this incident, f'Tuhns met his new roommates, Davin Felth and Mychael Ologat. F'tuhns offered to share his food with Felth, although Felth declined the offer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately afterward, a stormtrooper drill instructor approached their barracks. F'Tuhns panicked and tried to hide his illegal food but ended up slipping and dropping it in the center of the room. When the instructor entered, he demanded to know who had been eating the food, which he claimed was contraband. Before f'Tuhns could own up, Felth confessed to having brought it in, as he had not yet been warned about such an infraction, unlike f'Tuhns. Felth was given just a warning, and f'Tuhns was left with a great sense of relief."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next six months, f'Tuhns adjusted to the routine on Carida, in which recruits were pushed to the limit in their training. They slept little and took part in countless physical exercises. After the first six months, Felth, as one of the best in the class, was selected to receive AT-AT pilot training, and would end up being sent off Carida for service a short time later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Geoff f'Tuhns was tall with wild red hair, and his big-boned physique did not appear as though it could fit in stormtrooper armor.
