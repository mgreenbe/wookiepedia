They were squat and rectangular in shape, with eight legs. They could be fitted with a variety of equipment, including acid, personal explosives, electrical disruptors and even smaller droids. Their small size allowed them to access locations that organic beings and larger droids could not reach. Upon locating a targeted enemy position, they would use their weapons to cause havoc."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The primary production facility of the crawl-carrier was located on the planet Dagro, and was destroyed by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker two years after the First Battle of Geonosis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
