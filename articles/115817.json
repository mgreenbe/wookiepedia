Before leaving Geonosis to go to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Rikoo asked to play hide-and-seek with a Jedi that was deployed there. After the Jedi agreed, Rikoo hid behind a crashed Republic Gunship in Petranaki Arena, but was found quickly. To try to make finding him more difficult, Rikoo hid on an outside platform.
