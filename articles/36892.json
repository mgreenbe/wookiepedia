Dendis co-owned the Dobo Brothers' Emporium with his brother, Samhan; the two shared a module but often disagreed over the ethics of their business. Dendis preferred not to sell weapons, but was not shy about selling pazaak cards. He was so glad that Surik exposed his brother's corruption and black market dealings that he gave her a discount for helping Lieutenant Dol Grenn and the Telos Security Force arrest Samhan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
