The Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi escaped from the Trade Federation battleship Saak'ak aboard this craft. He was ordered by his Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn, to disable the craft's communications to prevent the craft from warning the rest of the invasion force of the stowaway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi engaged the B1-Series battle droids droids guarding the communication gears. In the fighting, the equipment recessed under protective covers. With the droids gone, he hit switches to expose the gear. With a slash of his lightsaber, he disabled the gear. The loss of communications attracted the attention of the other droids onboard. Battle droid squad 8313 was sent to investigate. Kenobi destroyed those droids then continued through the ship, ending up in the first Armored Assault Tank storage bay. He cut through the droids stationed there and went through the second Armored Assault Tank storage bay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn contacted Kenobi again and told him to go to the engine room or the main control room to disable the craft and force it to land. Kenobi went to the atmospheric turbine room, destroyed the two droids guarding it, and operated both sets of controls to shut down the turbines. Droid 8557 was sent to carry out an investigation, but this was cut short by a sweep of Kenobi's lightsaber. Kenobi then went through the door 8557 had unlocked and ended up in the navigation room. The young Jedi destroyed all the present droids and disabled the hologram of Naboo, allowing him to access the platform under the hologram emitter. Kenobi followed the path and ended up on the upper catwalk of the Multi-Troop Transport bay. He descended to the main floor and went to the airlock, where he engaged a new type of assassin droid armed with a cortosis blade. After defeating it, Jinn ordered Kenobi to find cover until the ship landed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once on the planet Kenobi jumped out of the craft and fled into the swamps of Naboo to rejoin Master Jinn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 1999 video game Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game shows Kenobi infiltrating a C-9979 landing craft in a cutscene. Kenobi can be seen jumping out of the craft in the 1999 comic book Episode I: Obi-Wan Kenobi. The craft's appearance in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Obi-Wan during the mission Stowaway contradicts the internal layout of the C-9979 landing craft seen in Star Wars: Complete Cross-Sections. In the game, the player assumes the role of Kenobi, and the player can use his lightsaber or Force powers to proceed through the enemy droids, or avoid them altogether. The path under the navigation room is an option, and the player may take a longer route to the MTT storage bay. The player must open the hangar door, then take the elevator down to the bay. This article assumes the player took the shortcut."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
