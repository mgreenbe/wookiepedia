Although they were designed as astromech droids, A-LTs were often adapted for more menial tasks. For example, some had their domes removed, which exposed their cranial circuitry but allowed them to serve food and drinks on a tray. During the Galactic Civil War, both the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic used modified A-LTs to bypass walls and overload the circuitry of enemy turrets on the battlefield."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The dome of an A-LT was compatible with the body of an R-series astromech droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
