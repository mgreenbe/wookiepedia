Meeting fellow criminal Fliry Vorru while working in the mines, both prisoners, along with fourteen others, were released by the New Republic and sent to Coruscant following the capital planet's liberation from the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic's strategy, developed by war hero Wedge Antilles, was to release the prisoners into Imperial City and have them to wreak havoc for any remaining Imperials that were hiding out or trying to control parts of the city. While the plan was deemed a success, the prisoners remained free and dangerous long after the last Imperials were driven off. Working closely with his ally Fliry Vorru, the last of the line of criminal Underlords, Acib set to work on reestablishing the power of the infamous crime syndicate Black Sun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of the Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn's death, Acib succeeded in mustering the strength of the Undercity's meanest criminals and Black Sun was revived.

At Grappa's urging, Acib planned to clone Carivus and replace him, the other councilmen none the wiser. Assembling the clones on Ord Cantrell, the Imperials discovered the deception and had all of the clones executed.
