Eventually, the site was seized from the Sith by the Untamed, who were not deterred by the presence of the dark side of the Force on the proving grounds. The Untamed used the site to host trials for Beast Riders interested in becoming Beast-Lords. Due to Untamed Beast-Lord Akoru's neglect of the site, the planet's noble families also used the site as a vacation retreat. Oftentimes, nobles returned from the retreat with claims to have accomplished noble feats, but very little evidence supported these statements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
