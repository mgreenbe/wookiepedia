The statues, shaped as a humanoid warrior queen, an avian figure, a crowned insectoid, and an amphibian, were arranged at the centre of the station's central globe, around a dais with a throne-like structure. Possibly placed by the Sith, the statues were discovered by several Jedi stranded at the station after the Great Hyperspace Disaster, who misidentified their purpose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The statues sat in a circle in the middle of the Amaxine space station's central globe, and were overgrown with vegetation when they were first encountered. Each statue was a different figure, and they stood around a central dias. The dias had a throne-like structure in the middle of it, and at the foot of the statues was writing that was indecipherable by the time of the High Republic. It was possibly similar to Old Alderaanian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each statue figure was different, though the first figure seen was the most distinct. She was a defiant humanoid queen wearing a headdress, with a highly angular face and her weaponry at her feet. The other statues were an individual from an unknown avian species, a crowned individual from an unknown insectoid species, and an individual from an unknown amphibian species. They all shared building materials, being carved of sandstone and gilded with copious precious stones and metals, only slightly burnished by time. Each figure also had a magnificancent halo behind their heads, and shackles around their wrists. The design style on them was similar to the ancient Kubaz."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The binding statues were likely created by the Sith centuries before the High Republic, when they were more numerous. The statues were turned into Force dampeners by the Sith, and were used to trap a group of Drengir on board of an Amaxine space station in an unknown star system. This trap was successful, and the statues remained in the abandoned space station for centuries until the arrival of the Vessel and its passengers. They were rediscovered at this time, and were initially assumed to be images of gods, mythological figures, or great rulers. However, Jedi Knight Orla Jareni realized that the statues represented defeated individuals, as indicated by the bands around each state's arms which were restraints. The statue were eventually removed from the station after being wrapped in a Force shield by Jedi Knights Jareni, Cohmac Vitus and Padawan Reath Silas due to a belief that they were responsible for a shadow in the Force that was routinely disturbing the Jedi. They were taken to the Shrine in the Depths under the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to be purified, but after the Force shield was dispelled, the truth of the statues was revealed. Realizing that they had allowed an evil to be unleashed on board the abandoned station, the Vessel and its passengers returned to make things right. Jedi Knights Jareni and Vitus were eventually able to reposition the statues and put the Drengir back to sleep, but the arrival of a large group of Nihil forced the Jedi to damage the statues in order to unleash the Drengir. This caused enough chaos for the Jedi and their allies to escape. A decompression on board the station during this process likely sucked pieces of the statues into space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
