Eons before 43 ABY, Shadda expanded into a red giant, releasing gases that created the Shadda Nebula. It then began cooling into a white dwarf during a long drawn out explosion.

Without the life-giving radiation of their star, the species, despite the efforts of the Refugee Relief Movement, dwindled into extinction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
