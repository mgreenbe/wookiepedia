It was designed to engage enemy starships in orbit and prevent them from moving into position to begin an orbital bombardment. It was large and hard to conceal, but was capable of inflicting massive amounts of damage on attacking fleets by firing hundreds of torpedoes into orbit. The weapon required a crew of four to operate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
