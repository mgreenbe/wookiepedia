When meeting Jedi General Anakin Skywalker on Batuu, Mitth'raw'nuruodo of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet suggested using his core name of Thrawn. Core names were also used among Chiss in all but the most formal settings, and were even used in some formal settings after initial introductions with one's full name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most Chiss names were multi-syllabic and consisted of three distinct parts, as in \"Mitth'raw'nuruodo\". The first part, before the first apostrophe, represented the Chiss family to which the name's bearer belonged. The second part, between the two apostrophes, was the person's given name. The third part of the name, after the final apostrophe, represented other social factors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Core names were composed of the final part of one's family name, all of one's given name, and the beginning of one's social factor suffix, without interleaved apostrophes. Because a Chiss's family name formed part of their core name, individuals' core names would change upon their rematching into a new family. The sky-walker navigators and flag officers of the Chiss Defense Force did not belong to any one Chiss family, but rather to the \"family\" of the Chiss Ascendancy.

Eventually, some time after being promoted to Senior Commander of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet, Mitth'raw'nuru became Mitth'raw'nuruodo, but his core name of \"Thrawn\" was unchanged.
