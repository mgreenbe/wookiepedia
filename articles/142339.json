However, the planet had a system of underground lakes and rivers which were a home to a rare species of fungi with life-saving properties known as the Zilbra fungi. In 18 ABY, the planet was home to an outpost of 13,000 settlers including the former smuggler Thanta Zilbra and his extended family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 8 ABY, the smuggler Thanta Zilbra was on the run from a debtor who had extensive ties to the underworld. He and his crew crashed-landed on the-then uncharted planet and discovered that the native fungus in the planet's caves had therapeutic properties. After fixing his ship, Zilbra and his crew left Thanta Zilbra and sought out a sponsor for this lucrative business venture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a deal was struck with the New Republic to ship the harvested Zilbra fungus to a number of selected biomedical facilities, Zilbra established an outpost on Thanta Zilbra and managed to make a reasonable profit from the deal.

In a mad race against time, the New Republic task force was only able to save 1,263 inhabitants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among those who perished was the outpost's founder Zilbra himself, who forced his four sons and two daughters to leave the planet with their families in his old ship while he stayed behind. A number of casualties were not caused by the destruction of the planet itself, but because of chaotic space traffic. Thanta Zilbra was destroyed along with its two moons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
