The station called for any Imperial ships to assist which the Nebulon-B2 frigate Archon arrived. By that time however, the prisoners were rescued and the Dreadnaught was destroyed by a bomb left behind by the Rebel Commandos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
