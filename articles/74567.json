It was difficult to maneuver through, as it consisted of a dense accretion of nebulaic material. It was home to both the Aing-Tii monks, who were able to easily navigate through it, and the DarkStryder. It was believed to be a construct of the Celestials, although another source had it as the result of a launch gate explosion caused by the Dark Jedi Halbret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rift was known to induce hallucinations in those who traveled within the vicinity, with the effect often amplified in Force-sensitive beings.
