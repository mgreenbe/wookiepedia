As a young child, her very presence brought fear in those around her. This ability occurred as a natural defense mechanism, causing people to feel sick in her presence. Due to this ability, she made few friends and eventually ran from her home. She continued to flee across the galaxy in order to avoid others. However, during her travels she began to gain control over her abilities and, with her newfound powers, Dotyk could attack others and ward off potential threats. While continuing to develop her powers, she was able to paralyze or cripple those that confronted her, causing at least one individual to bleed from her nose. Despite gaining control over her powers, Dotyk continued to attack those around her, believing that it was her destiny to continue her family's evil."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dotyk weighed 58 kg and was quite hostile towards those that approached her.
