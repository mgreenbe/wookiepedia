The based consisted of two alloy depots and two credit vaults enclosed by a square wall and protected by two autoturrets and a central deflector shield generator. Between the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Hoth during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance, the Alliance asked a group of mercenaries to aid them in recovering medical supplies from the den. The mercenaries accepted, and during the mission the Rebel Han Solo passed through the shield and destroyed the generator, allowing a group of ten Rebel troopers to destroy the rest of the den and recover the supplies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The den first appeared as a map in Star Wars: Commander, a mobile strategy game released in 2014 by Disney Interactive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
