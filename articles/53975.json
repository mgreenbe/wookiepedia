In 0 BBY, the MSE-6 series repair droid designated MSE-6-G735Y was stationed on the Death Star with the Imperial stormtrooper TK-421, and it conducted location geosyncs with the DS-1OBS Network as part of its self-diagnostics. Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin invoked Imperial Protocol Alpha One to order the mouse droid to route its geosync data, along with other identifying information, to his personal ephemeradata-neurocloud before wiping it so no records would exist regarding his interactions with TK-421."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
