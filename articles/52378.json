During the planet's occupation by the Trade Federation in 32 BBY, the university's dormitories were transformed into prison camps. However, the Trade Federation's droid army, assuming that all Naboo university students were artists or philosophers, failed to scan the dormitories properly. This allowed those imprisoned there, including Royal Naboo Security Forces member Gregar Typho, who had returned home on leave just before the invasion, to quickly find a working transmitter they used to monitor communications channels. Typho was on duty watching the transmitter in the early morning hours when news came that Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala had finally returned to Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
