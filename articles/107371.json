During an Emergence of the Great Hyperspace Disaster in the Trymant system, a fragment of the Legacy Run's main hull struck Praknat 3, misaligning the gravitational balance of the entire star system. Trymant IV was tilted closer to the system's second sun as a result, causing an environmental catastrophe as all of its aboveground water sources were vapourized."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
