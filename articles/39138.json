What made Domain Jamaane unique was that it was one of the few Domains which was not confined to a single caste of Yuuzhan Vong society. They had proficient Shapers and Priests, and numerous Warriors. The clan produced an above-average number of Supreme Commanders, and also three Warmasters. But the most famous member of the family was an Intendant by birth: Shimrra Jamaane. Shimrra was a candidate for Supreme Overlord, and he strongly disagreed with Supreme Overlord Quoreal's decision about not invading the galaxy. Domain Jamaane was not considered aggressive, but the opportunity for invasion was too great. Gathering other loyal domains, Domain Jamaane launched the Jamaane coup, which overthrew Quoreal and installed Shimrra as the Supreme Overlord of the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
