In the year 0 ABY, he was present at one of the Ktath'atn queen's receptions when the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker was presented to her by the archaeologist Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra. Hoping to feed on the Jedi, the queen invited the pair to stay, and then had Bombinax and her other servants Vespinax and Varroa harvest from the hive to prepare her for fighting Skywalker if necessary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, Bombinax set out to eliminate the Wookiee Black Krrsantan, who had arrived on Ktath'atn with Aphra but was then placed in quarantine because of the queen's alergy. Enroute he killed Lord Hossferin, a late guest to the reception who was demanding to see the queen. Upon reaching the quarantine he attacked the Wookiee, but before he could kill his target, Skywalker's allies from the Alliance to Restore the Republic intervened and infected the Wookiee with a symbiote.

There the queen ordered that the other three collect the harvest from the other subjects of the hive, which the trio did by inhaling red particulates released from the mouths of the other hive members.

Bombinax then proceeded to the quarantine and attacked the Wookiee, but before he could kill the bounty hunter, several of Aphra's temporary allies from the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the droids 0-0-0 and BT-1 arrived to save Krrsantan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Princess Leia Organa distracted Bombinax by firing at him with a blaster pistol while 0-0-0 and Sana Starros dragged Krrsantan to safety. The lieutenant charged at his attacker, but was blown back by a shot from BT-1's blaster cannon. This brought the Rebels time to seal one of the quarantine doorways between them and Bombinax which bought them time to infect their Wookiee ally with a Abersyn symbiote. Bombinax then smashed his way through the door, but was horrified to find the infected Wookiee inside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Black Krrsantan smashed Bombinax's helmet and chest armor with his bare hands and then lifted the lieutenant over his head, hurling him to his death over a cliff edge outside the quarantine.

The art shows the lieutenant as having burns covering the entire left side of his face from the cheek up, as well as a bald head, pupiless white eyes and a black beard. The artist explained in an interview that aside from the dark colors of their armor, he wanted to make them menacing by giving them no irises and cadaveric skin, although this is never visible for Bombinax outside of the concept art."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
