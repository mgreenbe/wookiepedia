Vilia Calimondra, a Sith Lord and the matriarch of the family, acquired many husbands, expanding her empire. She mothered seven children, each of whom claimed the right to be Vilia's sole heir. In 1066 BBY, Vilia initiated the Charge Matrica, a contest whose winner would be determined by which of Vilia's children could expand her empire the greatest. Vilia's empire expanded even farther; however, her children eventually went to war with one another. Chagras eventually defeated his rival siblings, but died suddenly in 1040 BBY. Vilia was left with several grandchildren, each claiming right to her legacy. Vilia initiated a Second Charge Matrica, but, again, Vilia's potential heirs descended into war with each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On occasion, the members of the Calimondra would meet holographically during an event known as The Bequest. During The Bequest, Vilia would dole out rewards for her grandchildren's efforts.
