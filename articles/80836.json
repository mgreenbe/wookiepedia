I saw no reason to keep it and it was on a computer that I have long since retired. My story is that I had only a limited window of time in which to write that book, as I had other book commitments at the time. I handed in the book, but the people at Lucasfilm kept changing their minds about what they wanted and having me do rewrite after rewrite. At last I told them time was up, this was getting too frustrating and I moved on.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
