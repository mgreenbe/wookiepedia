Suspecting there was a dangerous substance in their drinks, the Jedi switched the cups with others. This Nikto, unknown his drink had been switched, drank it, and collapsed, most likely from the substance. He was one of the few members of the gang who was not a Weequay; other known pirates who were not Weequay are an Ishi Tib and several other Nikto, as well as Bith and Jawas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
