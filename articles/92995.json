One such Mordageen was Bendix Fust, a smuggler working for the Dug crime lord Sebolto in his death stick operation. However, the Mordageen was captured by the Republic Security Force in a sting operation on a transfer station in the Gazzari system. In exchange for a reduced prison sentence, the Mordageen told the Security Forces all he knew of the Sebolto's drug cartel. He was then placed in a maximum security prison on the asteroid Oovo IV, a complex known as Desolation Alley. Wanting revenge, Sebolto placed a bounty on his former employee's head. Independently of each other, two bounty hunters, the Clawdite Zam Wesell and the Mandalorian Jango Fett, broke into the prison to retrieve Fust. They eventually worked together to break him out, and handed him over to Sebolto on Malastare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mordageen first appeared in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, a video game produced by LucasArts in 2002 and released for the PlayStation 2 and the GameCube platforms.
