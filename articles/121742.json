Leading the fleet, was the Helmsman, a Praetor Mark II-class battlecruiser commanded by Giel himself, and also the location of the Teezl's transport cage. At least one vessel of similar design was also part of the fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When gathered at an undisclosed location near the galaxy's edge, the fleet numbered enough ships to be noted as the biggest in Imperial history, even eclipsing similar units like Darth Vader's Death Squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, a bizarre creature known as the Teezl was discovered in a remote region of the galaxy. The creature had the unique ability to send instantanous messages across vast distances of space, and the Galactic Empire soon realized the enormous potential of using the creature as a communications hub for Imperial forces spread throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To protect the creature on its journey to Imperial Center, an Imperial decree went out, authorizing the secret assembly of a gigantic fleet to transport and protect it.

With specially charged laser shots, the fighters would sow confusion amongst the ships of the fleet, allowing them to slip past the defenses in the ensuing chaos and firefights and destroy the Teezl with an extra-powerful blast."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Operation Earplug went reasonably well.
