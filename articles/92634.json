Following the liberation of the planet Kal'Shebbol in 8 ABY, Monjai was appointed to the post of Governor since it was felt that she would better relate to the large non-Human population on the planet. Monjai's assignment was welcomed by the world's alien community, and she immediately set about rebuilding the damaged infrastructure and crafting some sort of local defense force to ensure the planet's security. Several months later, Monjai greeted the returning crew of the CR90 corvette FarStar after their lengthy mission to track down the former Imperial ruler of Kal'Shebbol, Moff Kentor Sarne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 8 ABY, the Elomin female Monjai was serving the New Republic, and was installed as the new governor of Kal'Shebbol, a planet located in the Kathol sector of the Outer Rim Territories, after the world was successfully liberated. The planet had been under the control of Moff Kentor Sarne, who had quietly removed the Kathol sector from the Galactic Empire following the death of Emperor Palpatine during the Battle of Endor four years previously. A New Republic task force was dispatched to the planet, along with elements of Page's Commandos, to free the world and capture the Moff. Despite their efforts, Sarne was able to escape from the New Republic along with the majority of his forces and flee into the Kathol sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Monjai's first order of business was to stop Kal'Shebbol from descending into chaos following the battle to free the planet. During his time on the planet, Moff Sarne had alienated the large non-Human population by not respecting their traditional clan and city-state societal structure, and installed Imperial Prefects over local community leaders. As a result, most of the non-Human population was ill-disposed toward Humans in general. It was hoped that Monjai, as an Elomin, would serve to reassure the various alien species that called Kal'Shebbol home of the New Republic's good intentions. The decision proved to be a worthwhile one, and the alien communities accepted her appointment, allowing her to spend time building good will among the population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Republic task force that had been assigned to assault Kal'Shebbol left the planet three days after the liberation, heading to Bozhnee sector to join up with another fleet group under the command of Captain Sarin Virgilio. This left the planet virtually undefended, although the New Republic had promised to deploy a defense force to the planet inside three months. In the meantime, Monjai was forced to scour the planet and attempt to cobble together a military force out of whatever had not been destroyed during the battle for the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the New Republic task force left the planet, the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar, in orbit of Kal'Shebbol preparing to set out into the Kathol sector to track down Moff Sarne, intercepted a distress signal from the nearby planet of Kolatill. In the wake of the New Republic's liberation of Kal'Shebbol, the people of Kolatill had followed suit and overthrown their Imperial governor. In retaliation, Moff Sarne had ordered an attack on the planet's capital city of Domaz, which had been conducted by the Ton-Falk-class escort carrier Kathol Protector. While the FarStar headed to the planet to assist in recovery operations, Monjai promised to send medical relief ships as soon as she could, although it would take two days to prep them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months after the FarStar left Kal'Shebbol, a New Republic force departed from the planet to assist the corvette after receiving progress updates through the Lifeline Project. The Lifeline Project was a communications link set up by the FarStar's crew to maintain contact with the New Republic as they passed through the volatile and unstable Kathol Rift. However, due to the distance between Kal'Shebbol and the FarStar's location at the planet Kathol, it would take several weeks for the force to get there, and several weeks to return. When the force returned with the victorious survivors of the FarStar's crew\u2014the corvette had been lost during the Battle of Kathol, but Moff Sarne had been defeated\u2014Monjai greeted them enthusiastically."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Monjai was a competent administrator and organizer which led to her appointment to Kal'Shebbol, a planet that was forced to rebuild in the wake of Sarne's departure and the New Republic's liberation. Monjai also had a grasp of politics, and realized that the way to win over the population of Kal'Shebbol was to appear in public and forge good relations with the various communities. She also saw that supplying medical aid to Kolatill would increase the New Republic's standing in the sector, and help victims of Imperial oppression. Although Elomin were noted for their logical disposition, Monjai was not immune to displaying emotion as she enthusiastically greeted the returning crew of the FarStar after their months-long mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Monjai was created as a background character for West End Games' 1995 publication The DarkStryder Campaign, the first installment in the multi-book adventure of the same name to flesh out the post-Sarne situation on Kal'Shebbol.
