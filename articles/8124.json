It dominated the planet's main continent and surrounded the Ragnook Mountains on all sides. Rathleek, the Whiphid Spearmaster, hunted game in the forest along with his clan members. Their base of operations was located in the forest, at a broken-down smelting plant that Raynor Mining Enterprises had left behind many years prior. The Arblis Forest composed of Gankto trees and was home to several creatures, including the burrowing reptilians known as Myntors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
