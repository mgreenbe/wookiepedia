The Chubbits began their activities after the Empire erected the Iron Tower, a massive structure that overcame atmospheric anomalies in Aridus to allow Imperial mining equipment to function but which also crippled the Chubbit nervous system and could even lead to death. Alliance to Restore the Republic operatives aided the Chubbit resistance. Luke Skywalker joined an exhibition that destroyed the Iron Tower in 0 ABY, for instance. Meanwhile, the Human smuggler Wrenga Jixton befriended the Chubbits and made a deal with Darth Vader to convince the Empire to abandon its operations on Aridus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
