If Danenberger ignores the unusual activity at the Montalvia spaceport, the Jedi enthusiast soon visits a cantina and eventually gets involved in a brawl. The situation can result in Danenberger either getting killed, ending up in the local jail, or succeeding in leaving the cantina. The latter two outcomes lead to the discovery that the Rebel delegation is no longer at its lodgings, and all three outcomes serve as endings for the adventure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If Danenberger investigates the landings at the spaceport, the youth can then either stealthily approach the area where the grain transports are landing or do so openly. A stealth-based approach leads to Danenberger discovering that the transports are carrying Imperial stormtroopers. At that moment, a stormtrooper may notice Danenberger, which may lead to the youth's incarceration or death. If Danenberger successfully leaves the spaceport for the Rebel lodgings, the youth then informs the delegation's commander of the developments at the spaceport, after which the Rebels, guided by Danenberger, evade Imperial capture. The Rebels and Danenberger then enter a firefight with stormtroopers at the spaceport in order to escape the planet aboard the delegation's starship, after which the adventure ends."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Approaching the landing site of the Imperial transports openly leads to an encounter with the area's security guard, which can result in an attack on Danenberger and possible incarceration. Again, upon successfully leaving the spaceport, Danenberger heads to the Rebel lodgings, where the youth then has to convince the Rebel commander of the suspicious nature of the transport landings. Success leads to both Danenberger and the Rebels witnessing the stormtroopers at the spaceport, followed by the aforementioned firefight. Failure may result in either incarceration due to the actions of a Kyrouaquian official in league with the Empire or a return to the spaceport and the stealth approach to the landing site."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
