Among Terebin's contributions was the study of resonator technology on the planet Filata. During her studies, Terebin created crystalline resonators attuned to the Force from blasters she unearthed at Site-145. The internal resonators she created were used to power and test the effectiveness of other ancient tech she unearthed. Only capable of being used by Forceful individuals, Terebin recorded in detail her findings on resonator technology and submitted her research to the Archives on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
