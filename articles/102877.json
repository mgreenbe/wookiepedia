The company was a division of Sienar Fleet Systems, but the company was sold when the Emperor was killed over Endor. When Warlord Zsinj reached the height of his power, he took over the company under the alias of Oan Pakkerd. Zsinj used the business as a way to hide his intentions of producing a new squad of TIE/LN starfighters and assigning them to the Implacable before the New Republic could shut down the business. With the aid of the captured Night Caller, Wraith Squadron was able to destroy the Pakkerd plant and Zsinj's reinforcements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
