The mining inspector Lemuel Tharsa worked for the Guild before succumbing to Shilmer's syndrome and later reinventing himself as the management guru Count Denetrius Vidian. About four years before the fall of the Galactic Republic, Vidian purchased the mining consulting firm Minerax Consulting and issued a report claiming that Gorse had exhausted all its thorilide reserves. This damaged the interests of the Interstellar Thorilide Guild."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
