It was a part of the Rakatan Archipelago, a fragmented group of planets settled by tribes of the Rakata species after the collapse of the Rakatan Infinite Empire around 25,200 BBY. Fitomp was also home to another sentient species that already inhabited it before the arrival of the Rakata."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the subsequent tens of millennia, the Rakatan tribe that colonized Fitomp regressed to a technologically primitive and barbarous state. Similarly to the Rakata that inhabited Hilak, another world of the Rakatan Archipelago, the Fitomp tribe came to believe that their adopted homeworld constituted the entirety of creation. In addition, the Rakata on Fitomp engaged in warfare against the other sentient species of the planet. The state of the Fitomp and Hilak Rakata contrasted with the tribes inhabiting the worlds of Makatak and Tulpaa, which had rediscovered the technology of interstellar spaceflight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fitomp was introduced in the 2010 Wizards of the Coast sourcebook The Unknown Regions, published for use with the Star Wars Roleplaying Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
