Darth Vader, Lekauf, and Lekauf's clones fought their way through to the hatch that Sheyvan and his men sealed off. In a tense battle, Vader killed all of the Sa Cuis clones while Lekauf was left injured with severe burns from a flamethrower. Sheyvan explained to Vader that the Emperor was using everyone and asked him to help overthrow the elder Sith Lord. Vader, though tempted to claim the galaxy for himself, refused and after a quick lightsaber duel, Sheyvan was killed. However, despite holding back fire and surviving smoke, Sheyvan was a still formidable fighter, and Vader admired this. He genuinely regretted the final stroke that sliced Sheyvan shoulder to hip and left him for dead on the deck."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
