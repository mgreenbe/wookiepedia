As indicated by the title, it was meant to be an alternate take on the series which had the player controlling the military forces of the Galactic Empire and crushing the Rebel Alliance, similar to Star Wars: TIE Fighter in comparison to Star Wars: X-Wing and Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance. The roots for the game could in fact be found within Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader, specifically two bonus levels depicting an alternate take of the Battle of Yavin where Darth Vader successfully stopped the Rebels from destroying the Death Star, and another level called Revenge of the Empire that involved Vader and the other Imperial forces descending onto Yavin to take out the Rebel base. The game was ultimately cancelled due to LucasArts passing it over in favor for another game that also would ultimately be cancelled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
