By the War, Caros used a repulsorlift platform to move around as he lacked legs. His cantina was operated mostly by droids and served water-down drinks to its customers. At one stage during the war, while Caros was working at the cantina a pair of patrons working for the droid manufacturer Cybot Galactica attempted to plant a datacard belonging to their employer's rival, Industrial Automaton, onto another patron at the bar. A pair of Industrial Automaton security personnel then arrived looking for the card and a fight ensued. During the fight one of the Cybot Galactica employees, Brom, shot a sleeping Ronto outside the cantina, which then when on rampage, causing significant damage to Caros's building."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Duff Caros first appeared in \"A Quick Stopover\" an adventure module in the 2014 Suns of Fortune sourcebook for the Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system.
