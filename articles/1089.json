During a Separatist boarding of the vessel to free Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray from Republic capture, 327-T was assigned to patrol duty in the reactor room by two members of Green Company, who mistakenly referred to the droid by his nickname, 327, much to his annoyance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, Count Dooku's Dark Side assassin Asajj Ventress infiltrated Tranquility's reactor room and planted numerous time-delayed thermal detonators while stealthily evading 327-T's notice, after which she successfully escaped the room through its ventilation ducts. A short while later, Ventress remotely detonated the bombs, prompting 327-T to attempt to avoid the explosion in a panic.

Initially presuming him to be Ventress, Luminara freed the droid and immediately held him at bay with her lightsaber before realizing her mistake. She then righted 327-T on the ground before continuing pursuit of Ventress.
