The foils were locked in the closed position in normal flight, but when engaged in combat the foils spread open into an attack position. Notable models to have S-foils were the T-65B X-wing starfighter manufactured by Incom Corporation, the T-70, and T-85 X-wing starfighters manufactured by Incom-FreiTek Corporation. The distinctive X shape when the S-foils were locked in attack position gave the laser cannons mounted on each wing a wider field of fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
