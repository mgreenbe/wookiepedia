The starship needed at least one person to operate it, and had a cargo bay equipped with life support systems. Around the year 3743 BBY, Hetuu used the ship's cargo bay to hold a live k'lor'slug queen that he had captured for a Hutt who intended to use the beast in a yearly gladiatorial tournament. He flew his ship to the planet Hutta, where the Hutt was located, but the worm-like k'lor'slug had laid eggs in the cargo bay that quickly hatched into nearly four hundred k'lorslugs. When the Hutt arrived at the ship, Hetuu opened the cargo bay to present the Hutt with his prize. However, the hoard of k'lorslugs swarmed out and devoured both Hetuu and his Hutt client."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Riegenn Hetuu's starship was indirectly mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 MMORPG produced by BioWare.
