Some notable residents included Wick Cooper, Becky Smoochenbacher and Furlac. Following the Battle of Hoth, Kordi Freemaker and Leia Organa fled into the Upper Ring to escape several stormtroopers, who were hunting for the rebel leader Organa. Leia managed to gain access to the Upper Ring by using a House of Alderaan card. After helping themselves to refreshments and hiding at Cooper's house, the two were forced to flee when Cooper recognized Leia and alerted the Imperial authorities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
