The squadron of clones along with Mundi had been shot down by the Geonosian resistance, which caused the clones to crash, resulting in heavy casualties. The clones were later fighting off the Geonosians in one of the caves in which the Geonosians were hidden. As the clones almost broke through the Geonosian crossfire, Mundi summoned the flame troopers to burn the rest of the Geonosians so Republic forces could move in to assist Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi at the landing zone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
