During the year 3 ABY, shortly before the discovery of the Death Star II, Aeron Azzameen discovered that a Rebel Alliance shipyard in the Vergesso Asteroids was in desperate need of supplies, and so she commissioned a fleet of transports to steal supplies from a Viraxo facility that harbored these particular supplies. This operation would result in a significant payoff from the Rebel Alliance that would assist the financially-deprived Azzameen family. However, it was to be conducted in secret and without the knowledge of Antan Azzameen, who had little desire to help the Rebels. Aeron and her brother Ace arrived at Bilbringi on board the Otana, where they linked up with six cargo ferries from Juno Group and two Modular conveyors from Lara Group. The task force then set out to raid the Viraxo facility where the targeted supplies were being stored."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
