Before the catastrophe it had been a planet with lush grasslands and forests. Following the Battle of Atollon, Thrawn, now a Grand Admiral in the navy of the Galactic Empire, and Skywalker, now the Sith Lord Darth Vader, were sent to investigate a disturbance in the Force felt by Emperor Palpatine. By that time, there was only lifeless plains and deserts across a great swath of the surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grysks used their advanced technology to move four of the planet's moons out of orbit and into the path of hyperlanes by this time.

Dooku dispatched Duke Solha, as well as his brother and sister, to Mokivj, to mine and process the metal. The Separatists kept the planet on lockdown. The residents could not leave their encampments and the areas around the settlements were patrolled by droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Duja, former handmaiden to Padm\u00e9 Amidala, went to investigate and discovered the Separatist occupation. Duja was killed by orders of Solha. Her corpse was discarded outside Oga's Cantina, on Batuu. Before being killed, Duja sent a message to Padm\u00e9 in time. Padm\u00e9, upon receiving the message, eventually traveled to do her own investigation and headed to Batuu, then eventually Mokivj. During this mission she disappeared from the Galactic Republic for several months. It wasn't until Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker undertook his own mission to find out where his wife was. Skywalker's search led him above Batuu, where he met an unidentified starship. This ship was under the command of Chiss Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo of the Defense Fleet of Ascendancy. Their search would led them down to Batuu, much like Padm\u00e9's search did. They eventually found her on Mokivj and proceeded to destroy the take down the Separatist cortosis mine, but the destruction of this mine proved to be catastrophic for the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mokivj first appeared in the 2018 novel Thrawn: Alliances, written by Timothy Zahn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
