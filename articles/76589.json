The planet occupied the fifth orbital position around its star, Y'Toub, and lay on the junction of four hyperlanes called the Oktos Route, the Ootmian Pabol, the Pabol Hutta, and the Shag Pabol. The Oktos Route connected Kiskua to the planet of Kleeva while the Ootmian Pabol linked the planet to the world of Du Hutta. In addition to that, the routes of Pabol Hutta and Shag Pabol joined Kiskua with the planets of Hosko and Rorak 4, respectively. One of Kiskua's natural satellites had a stormy atmosphere and seas on its surface, and it was devoid of any life-forms until the year 3643 BBY, when microbial life was discovered in the moon's seas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kiskua was first pictured in the entry for the planet of Nal Hutta in The Holonet feature of the official website for Star Wars: The Old Republic\u2014a 2011 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by BioWare.

Since its establishment in 2008, The Old Republic's website has gone through a number of changes, resulting in the removal of some of the features and images that were originally located there, including the aforementioned schematic.
