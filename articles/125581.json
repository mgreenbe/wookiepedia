He befriended the Ewok Princess Kneesaa so that he could eventually kidnap her for his mistress, Jadru, who planned to ransom the princess for the Ewoks' Sunstar. When in his fake form, he had a beautiful unicorn-like appearance; but his true form was a fearsome monster that had long sharp teeth, large black eyes, and green scaly skin. Silky also had a pair of small wings to either fly or to hold his captured victims, as he did with Kneesaa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
