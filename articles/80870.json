One day, at the age of 13, Dooku and his friend, Lorian Nod, went into Dooku's new master's room. In there, the two found an ancient Sith holocron belonging to Cerulian. Nod attempted to convince Dooku to open it, but the young apprentice refused. As Lorian continued to try and convince Dooku, Jedi Oppo Rancisis walked into the room. He found the two friends with the holocron and told them that he would tell the Council about the Sith holocron. The next day, Dooku, joined in on a special challenge, held by Yoda and Rancisis. The challenge was to get fruit from the market in Coruscant and bring it back. Whoever was tagged with a lightsaber was out, and the team who brought back the fruit would be the winner. Dooku became leader of the Blue Team, and Lorian the leader of the Gold Team. There was a large duel and clash, and the remaining Padawans were Nod and Dooku. The two dueled each other harshly until Yoda broke it up, as he saw how serious the duel became. Nod was afterwards expelled from the Order, because of his anger. A few years after the incident, now a full-pledged Jedi, Dooku began to train young Qui-Gon Jinn. Dooku picked Jinn when he strolled by Yoda's class. Dooku and Jinn were assigned to protect Senator Blix Annon. A pirate, later revealed to be Dooku's childhood friend, Lorian Nod, attempted to kidnap the Senator, just to later sell him back to the Republic. However, his attempt failed, as the Senator died of a heart attack as soon as he was kidnapped, and Nod was arrested."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After facing his own Jedi Trials, Jinn received his own Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Nod accepted, but only to redeem himself for the Jedi Order, as he told the location and time of the meeting.

Dooku attempted to escape, but Nod quickly caught up to him, while Kenobi and Skywalker were busy with the other Separatist leaders. Nod tried to stop Dooku, but failed and was killed by Dooku, who then escaped. Most of the Separatist leaders also successfully escaped, and Kenobi and Skywalker traveled back to Coruscant to report what had occurred."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two sections of the book set in Dooku's childhood are set in 89 BBY. There are two sections during the apprenticeship of Qui-Gon Jinn, one set in 76 BBY and one set significantly later, when Qui-Gon is ready to take the Jedi Trials. One of the Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi sections is set after the death of Xanatos in 44 BBY, with the other taking place directly before the mission to Naboo in 32 BBY.

However, other Legends writings, specifically the Jedi Apprentice series (also by Jude Watson), state that at the age of thirteen, an apprentice is sent out of the temple, being too old to continue training without a master. This rule may have changed in the intervening years, or it may have exceptions, as with the rules and penalties against attachments and marriage. The Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader novel supports this latter hypothesis, where Olee Starstone is a Jedi \"hopeful\" who is exempted from the thirteen-year rule due to her specialization in archival work. If left without a master, she was to become a Temple Acolyte but not a Jedi knight. The meaning of the Temple Acolyte designation seems to be a technical Jedi, as Jedi Agricultural Specialist are."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
