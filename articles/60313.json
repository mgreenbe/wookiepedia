Efforts by the Yuuzhan Vong to restore the devastated world's ecosystems eleven years prior had been sabotaged by agents of the One Sith, and as a result, flora and fauna infected with the Vongspawn virus mutated into violent and hostile creatures. Included in their number were amphistaffs\u2014serpentine beings often employed by Yuuzhan Vong warriors as quarterstaffs\u2014and in 137 ABY, one such creature discovered the Humans Jariah Syn and Fionah Ti inside of a damutek structure. As it reared to attack them, Syn began to speak to it in the Yuuzhan Vong. He had been taught the ways of the warrior caste by a Yuuzhan Vong warrior in his youth and was accordingly able to calm the amphistaff down. Syn named the creature \"Heartstriker\" and implored it to submit to his will. Heartstriker immediately acquiesced and coiled around its new master's waist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Syn would later use Heartstriker to kill Zenoc Quah.
