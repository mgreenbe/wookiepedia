They were equipped with repulsor generators and laser arrays and they could collapse themselves into small units, roughly a meter in length. The droids could also assume a stealth posture, in which they resembled harvester beetles. Parts from an N-101 Nemesis droid were stored in the armory of the resistance base Mountain Home on the planet Toprawa and in about 18 BBY, the Rodian mech-tech Geri used them to augment the defenses of the droid I-5YQ."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
