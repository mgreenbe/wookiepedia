They had muscular build, powerful claws and sharp teeth that allowed them to hunt prey. They also had two ear stalks on the top of the head, between the eyes and neck. Vanxes relied on strength and ferocity rather than stealth, attempting to encircle individual targets after charging into a fray. Their speed combined with their numbers made them extremely dangerous to encounter in open territory. A vanx pack consisted of 5 to 20 members, led by a male or female alpha."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
