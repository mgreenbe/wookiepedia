The Millennial Celebration Invitation was drafted to welcome beings to the event, with the layout and concept outlined by Naveela Betuine, a junior Senate official for Valorum, and the final execution done by the painter and sculptor Dashira Dobeq. The invitation went through at least 250 iterations as Valorum, worried about his declining public image, rejected earlier versions out of fear that they were overly warm, cold, directionless, or exclusive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unable to settle upon a design, Valorum instead tasked his friend Senator Sheev Palpatine of Naboo with overseeing the invitation. Palpatine's suggestions were implemented into what became the invitation's near-final design, which notably added to the center of the poster a statue of the ancient lawgiver Sistros Nevet, who had contributed to the constitution of the Galactic Republic following the Jedi-Sith War. The faceless aspect of Nevet's depiction on the invitation, Palpatine stated, served as a representation of the galaxy's many humanoids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, the Millennial Celebration Invitation never saw distribution.
