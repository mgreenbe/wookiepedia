Because of the fungi's blue coloration, most of the Narquois' physical features were of the same color to serve as camouflage. Seeing the natives as little more than cheap labor, the Neimoidians occupied Narq and treated the Narquois as virtual serfs for centuries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
