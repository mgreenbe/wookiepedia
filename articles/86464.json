Eventually, his success as a bounty hunter caught the attention of Count Dooku who wanted him to compete with other bounty hunters in the Box, a death machine designed by Moralo Eval, on Serenno to win the honor of kidnapping Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. He witnessed Cad Bane murder another bounty hunter Bulduga to get his hat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, Dooku briefed everyone on the challenge the bounty hunters had to face including telling them about The Box. They were all deprived of their weapons and soon they entered The Box."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their first challenge was to escape a room that was filling with dioxis gas. Platforms began to rise from the ground and all the bounty hunters including Mantu climbed on top of them. Another bounty hunter, Rako Hardeen who was actually Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in disguise found a secret tunnel underneath the ground. All the hunters followed him through the tunnel, thus surviving the first round.\nIn the second round, ledges began to slide out of the walls with a sword resembling a lightsaber swinging around on its front. Bulduga's brother Onca quickly fell prey to the blades. As before, Hardeen saw an open tunnel on the ceiling. Using the ledges, he and Bane hopped to the top towards the tunnel with the other bounty hunters following behind. Bounty hunters Kiera Swan and Sinrich were killed as well but Mantu got out of the challenge along with the remaining bounty hunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The third challenge involved the whole room being ray-shielded and the walls closing in. The switch to deactivate the shields was located in shaft in the wall behind a smaller ray-shield. Eval provided a special serum that, if injected can provide the person temporary immunity to the ray-shields."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Platforms began to rise out of the center of the ground. Jakoli was instantly electrocuted as well when the floor he stood became ray-shielded. Derrown was able to inject the serum due to his anatomy of being immune to such serums. During his attempt to get to the button, Mantu was slightly shocked by the shield that was closing in on them. He lost his balance and nearly fell but grabbed onto the platform and hung on. After being used as a bridge by Embo, the platform that his feet were on descended, and he was electrocuted again causing him to let go of the platform and fell to his death below."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mantu was created for the TV series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and appeared in the episode \"The Box\".
