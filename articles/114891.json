In 17 BBY,[source?] the ship's Koorivar captain and two Sy Myrthian crew acquired the ship from an information broker on Lantillies named Knotts, who was an associate of the insurgent Berch Teller. In 14 BBY, Teller initiated a hit and run campaign against the Empire after stealing Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's ship Carrion Spike. Following the Battle in the Phindar system, Teller realized the Empire was tracking the Carrion Spike using a paralight tracker. To mislead his Imperial pursuers, Teller got Knotts to send a decoy ship the Obroa-skai system in the place of the stolen Carrion Spike, a corvette that belonged to his nemesis, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knotts hired the Koorivar captain and his crew to pick up replacement parts for a fleet of Sephi flyers at Thustra and then travel to an Obroa-skai emergency medvac center. Knotts gave the Reticent's crew the coordinates transmitted by the Carrion Spike. The Reticent was subsequently caught up in a massive hyperspace accident in the Obroa-skai system when one of Tarkin's interdictor vessels malfunctioned. The Reticent and her crew survived the accident but were tractor beamed aboard the Imperial Star Destroyer Executrix."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sergeant Crest and other stormtroopers inspected the Reticent while Tarkin and Darth Vader interrogated the Koorivar captain and Sy Myrthian crew.
