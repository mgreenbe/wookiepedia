He was married, and, in 1026 BBY, his wife gave birth to Hurst's son, who was named Dessel. Hurst's wife died giving birth to Dessel, and Hurst was left to raise the child on his own. He subsequently blamed Dessel for all his troubles: his wife's death and being stuck working in the cortosis mine on Apatros. Hurst referred to his son as \"Bane,\" for he considered Dessel to be the bane of his existence. Hurst was a heavy drinker after his wife's death and often beat Dessel while intoxicated. His son began working in the cortosis mine at the age of thirteen, and other miners, including Hurst's good friend Gerd, often tormented and bullied Dessel. Hurst spent more time gambling and drinking than actually working, and often had to borrow credits from Outer Rim Oreworks to pay for his monthly room and board. The interest rate on the loans piled up year after year, and Hurst accumulated great debt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1008 BBY, Hurst died of a massive heart attack after beating his son heavily in a drunken rage. After his death, Dessel was stuck with his father's debt. Dessel surmised that Hurst, who resented his son, would be happy that he was stuck with the bill. However, Dessel eventually escaped Apatros, joining the Sith army during the New Sith Wars against the Galactic Republic. After serving with distinction, Dessel's Force-sensitivity was discovered and he became Darth Bane, one of the most important and influential Dark Lords of the Sith in galactic history. Darth Bane named himself after the nickname \"Bane\" given to him by Hurst.
