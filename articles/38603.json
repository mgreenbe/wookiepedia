Each die had several different symbols on them. The object of the game was to throw the die in such a way so that the same symbol would appear right side up on all the die. The more die with the same symbol right side up, the more points would be received. Lando Calrissian was known to be a very good divot player, as well as the Jokhalli from the Tertiary Moon of Blimph. Calrissian once won his freedom from the Jokhalli by besting them in a game of divot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
