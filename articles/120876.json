However, Haka double-crossed them and attempted to steal the oubliette from Heren. However, Haka's second in command, Lumbra, had plans of his own and took what he believed to be the oubliette. Haka, soon discovered that Heren had not actually brought the oubliette with him, and the actual oubliette was still at large.

At this point, however, Bomo did not trust Heren to be able to sell the package. Once they reached an unidentified planet, Darth Vader and a group of clone troopers surrounded the crew and took the oubliette from them. Once they were tied up, Vader proceeded to open the oubliette and discovered ancient Jedi Celeste Morne inside. When she awoke she discovered that the Sith had conquered the galaxy and began dueling Vader. During that time Heren managed to break free and released the rest of the crew and ran towards the Uhumele attempting to escape before Vader noticed they were gone. However, just as they were about to reach the Uhumele, fellow crew member Crys Taanzer became infected with the rakghoul disease and soon turned into a rakghoul.

As they made the acquaintance of the local militia, Heren was more or less convinced of their peaceful intent. There, he met a man named Fish, who assured them that Jennir was in fact here and added that the Jedi was now in the company of a woman named Ember Chankeli. Heren and his crew had no choice but to follow the new track to find the Jedi. According to Imperial records that Beyghor, Bomo, Meekerdin and Vakier recovered from a broadcast center, Heren found out that Jennir and his companions were on Prine, where they crashed their ship during an attack from the Harvester.
