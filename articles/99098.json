The droids played pivotal roles as pilots, saboteurs, and mechanics in tightly contested skirmishes of major battles such as the Battle of Kashyyyk and the Battle of Coruscant. They were also deployed in space battles to man turrets, carry ammunition, and monitor the decks and hangars for breaches and boarding parties. Overall, they weren't part of a separate branch but instead shared by the army and navy. During the Clone Wars, OOM pilot battle droids were part of the crew of Munificent-class star frigates and took orders from organic and OOM droid commanders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOM pilot droids were deployed on battlefields and equipped with weaponry to push the assault forward. The pilot droids utilized RD-4 grenade launchers or carried SE-14C blaster pistols. Serving as mainly support units, they often brought with them extra ammunition canisters for fellow allies, along with F-187 fusioncutter for repairs or to cut into enemy-controlled vehicles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most pilot droids were, however, used on-board capital ships and cruisers. Some of them were armed with variants of the standard SE-14 blaster, which fires more rapidly and carries greater firepower. During boarding operations against enemy starships, they used TB-47 time bombs to sabotage enemy starships. When not armed, pilot droids executed only the most basic melee attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOM pilot battle droids first appeared with the release of the Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace film.
