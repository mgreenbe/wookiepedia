The project took the best and most loyal Knights and enhanced them with biological and cybernetic upgrades, creating the \"perfect\" Knights. Each Exarch was given command of a Star Fortress, a Zakuulan battle station placed in orbit above a conquered world, which in turn essentially made them the ruler of the targeted world. Answering only to Emperor Arcann himself, the Exarchs adopted iconography related to the Old Gods of Zakuul, becoming quasi-religious leaders to their followers. Each Exarch carried personal shields and lightsaber pikes, and their armor was adapted to allow them to draw power from the Sun Generators that charged their respective Star Fortress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
