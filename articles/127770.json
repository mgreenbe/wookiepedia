These characteristics often led sentients to view smookas as cute, however, these creatures could potentially be very dangerous. Despite their appearance, no smooka has ever been domesticated, and their painful teeth could bite through the bars of many cages, and through most types of armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Smookas were one of the few creatures that frequented both the lower swamps of Dagobah and the upper canopies of the trees. Roosting in numbers well into the hundreds, smookas dwelt in caves and in hollow cavities of dead gnarltrees. Smookas had a carnivorous diet, and feasted on young rodents, insects, and eggs. Smookas were often prey for much larger predators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Smookas were first mentioned in the Fantasy Flight Games sourcebook Nexus of Power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
