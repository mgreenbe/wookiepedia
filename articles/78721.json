It was dominated by the saurian Kwa species of Dathomir whom had mastered the Force which they called the Power of the Cosmos. Travel across the empire was facilitated by the Infinity Gates which enabled near-instant travel and could double as superweapons since they were modelled on Celestial concepts. Around 100,000 BBY, the Kwa Holdings encountered the Gree Empire, leading to border disputes between them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the ascendancy of the Rakatan Infinite Empire, the Kwa Holdings declined in political influence. The Infinite Empire waged war on the Kwa and annexed the empire, exterminating the Kwa around the galaxy, though the original inhabitants of Dathomir remained and eventually evolved\u2014or rather degenerated\u2014into the Kwi by 8 ABY. All that remained of the Kwa Holdings were the Infinity Gates and Star Temples which were protected by bio-engineered giant whuffa worms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
