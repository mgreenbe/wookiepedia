Karath, who was presented in flashbacks in the issue, was drawn by Andrea Mutti."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The quote that is attributed to Karath in his entry in the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide was originally a line cut from the twenty-first issue of the Knights of the Old Republic comic series. The series' writer, John Jackson Miller, decided to use the quote when writing Karath's entry. As he wrote for Karath's character, Miller used historic military figures that he studied as an example. Miller stated that while Karath's underlings did not entirely share his point of view on situations, his determination and will was enough to see him promoted, making him an example for recruits and characters such as Dallan Morvis. There are inconsistencies about the date of Karath's destruction of Telos IV. In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, when asked by the player, Carth Onasi answers that Karath destroyed Telos IV \"four years ago.\" The game takes place in the year 3,956 BBY, and The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia's entry on Telos also states that Karath destroyed the planet in that same year. However, both the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide and the New Essential Chronology contend that Karath razed the planet in 3,958 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
