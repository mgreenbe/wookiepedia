Descended from slaves liberated by the Jedi, Nora wished to put an end to the oppression of the Argazdan Redoubt in the Kanz sector, and bring about a decisive conclusion to the centuries-old Kanz Disorders, under which the Lorrdians suffered continuously as slaves. Despite the new emergence of the Sith, the Galactic Senate granted Nora's wishes, and she led a team of Jedi Knights and Republic soldiers against the Argazdans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Argazdans fought bitterly for their holdings, Nora's forces proved superior, and achieved victory in 3670 BBY.

Although she could not detect anything through the Force, the Jedi suspected that a great evil lurked within.

The planet had been under the oppression of the Argazdan Redoubt since the beginning of the Kanz Disorders three hundred years prior.

She teamed up with several other Jedi, as well as the Republic Army, and waged a bitter campaign against the Argazdan Redoubt. Although the Argazdans fought bitterly to hold their territories and their slaves, Nora and her allies emerged victorious in 3670 BBY. During the final battle on Lorrd, the Argazdans beat a hasty retreat into the gargantuan Slave Pits, and then mysteriously vanished. Jedi and soldiers were dispatched to flush out the Argazdans, but did not return. Although she could not sense anything, Nora believed that something sinister was lurking in the Slave Pits. To contain it, she ordered that the Pits be filled in, and that their existence be hidden. The Kanz Disorders were finally over, having claimed over five billion lives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of the conflict, she became the Jedi Watchman of the Kanz sector. Nora was eventually slain by slavers on Noremac. The Jedi Knight's body was brought to Lorrd, where it was buried in the Crypt of Martyrs, located in Qatamer. The Crypt was reserved for all those who had devoted their lives to combating slavery, and Nora's memorial was accompanied by both a biographical hologram, relaying the events of her life, and a recording of the Jedi Knight herself in the wake of the liberation of Lorrd. Mari-Elan Nora's memorial was visited by the young Human Tash Arranda, who along with her brother, Zak, explored the Slave Pits and discovered what lurked inside\u2014a gargantuan monster of alien origin.

In that game, it is stated that Lorrdians were rescued from Argazdans by Jedi\u2014an event that was not supposed to have happened at that point in the fictional history. Tolliver intended that Nora's ancestors would be an allusion to these earlier liberated Lorrdians, in an attempt to resolve the discrepancy in The Sith Lords.
