However, due to a bug, many of the NPCs in Naberrie's quests were not properly sequenced. For instance, in the quest to deliver a datadisc to Jumis, players actually encountered an individual known as Turon Adala, who was supposed to appear in the following quest. The character model for Jumis likewise erroneously spawned for Naberrie's second quest, in which the player was supposed to encounter an individual named Herosk Bal'far. According to the game files, a datadisc could not be properly delivered to Jumis, as the character (in this case Turon Adala) was not designated as a \"deliver\" NPC. Nevertheless, it was possible for the player to complete the mission and advance to the next quest. This article assumes that the content of Naberrie's quest dialogue is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity, and that Jumis, not Turon Adala, actually appeared during her third quest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Furthermore, because Jumis spawned under the generic \"commoner\" template, Jumis' appearance was randomized under one of a 120 possible depictions. Species Jumis could appear as included Aqualish, Bothans, Bith, Humans, Rodians, Trandoshans, Twi'leks, and Zabrak of either gender, and Devaronians, Ishi Tib, Nikto, and Sullustans of the male gender. Because the quest dialogue made no mention of Jumis' physical characteristics, the canonical species and gender cannot be definitively determined in the Star Wars Legends continuity.
