He flew a T-65 X-wing starfighter and was known as \"Hotshot Hesoc\" due to his skills in the cockpit. During the Matacorn campaign, Hesoc achieved an impressive tally of twenty-two confirmed kills before being caught by a TIE interceptor during a Tallon Roll maneuver. His X-wing was badly damaged, but he managed to return to base. His right leg had been injured when the fighter was hit, and it had to be removed and replaced with a cybernetic prosthesis. Officially grounded due to injury, Hesoc refused to accept a training post and appealed directly to his Sector Commander, General Lesilk, to be reinstated to flight status. He claimed that, due to only having one leg, his reaction time to a scramble alert would be faster than other pilots, as he would already have one sock and boot on.
