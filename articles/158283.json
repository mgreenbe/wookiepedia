At some point during the time of the Galactic Empire, Han Solo and Chewbacca hung around the bar while the Millennium Falcon was docked on the planet for a week, hoping to pick up some jobs before they left. Alinka Aloo and her team of bodyguards approached the smugglers at the bar and, after asking a few questions, gave Solo a card with her address and directed them to come to her home that evening, under the pretence of offering them a job. Urrett's Marque served fried nerf nuggets and after the encounter with Aloo, Chewbacca ordered some, fearing if the job went sour, he might not get another good meal for some time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Urrett's Marque first appeared in the junior novel The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!, which was written by Tom Angleberger and published in 2018.
