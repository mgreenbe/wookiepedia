It is unclear whether 'Storm Unit' referred to the commandos it carried (see here), and merely the call sign of the vessel (perhaps there were multiple 'Storm Unit' vessels) or whether the ship was actually/additionally named 'Storm Unit'. Going by naming convention of XWA, the ship was definitely called Storm Unit, it is still unclear though whether the name applied to both."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
