In order to breed, an early form, hatched from an egg, would attack a viable host, such as a Human, and hijack the host body's systems to create a new xenomorph based on the host DNA. Over the span of several standard hours, the embryo would begin to grow and the facilitating form would die. When gestation was complete, the newly-produced xenomorph would burst out of its host, killing it in the process. Within a matter of hours, the embryo developed into a full-grown xenomorph."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fully-developed xenomorphs possess formidable physical abilities which far exceed that of the host, along with exceptional durability, senses, claws, blades, and highly corrosive blood to discourage an opponent from injuring one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xenomorph society existed as a hive, controlled by one queen.
