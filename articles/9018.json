Prior to the Battle of Endor, Rowan, his siblings Zander and Kordi, and their B1-series battle droid Roger undertook a quest to obtain the various parts needed to build the Arrowhead. After being built on Jakku, the Arrowhead was destroyed during a skirmish over Shantipole but some of its parts were incorporated into the Freemakers' starship StarScavenger just in time for the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Arrowhead was an arrowhead\u2013shaped starship. It was equipped with various accessories including a pair of embersteel blades, a Farium fusion conduit, a proton suspension housing, an energy matrix activator, and a large kyber crystal.

After climbing to the top of the Tower of Alistan Nor, Rowan experienced another Force vision of the Arrowhead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After escaping an attack by the Imperial hunter droid M-OC, Rowan assembled a model of the Arrowhead. Quarrie estimated that they needed several items including embersteel blades, a Farium fusion conduit, a proton suspension housing, an energy matrix activator, and a bantha\u2013sized kyber crystal.

Kordi's plan was to sneak into their former home at night to recover it. However, their mission was complicated by Roger's run-in with several Ranats and the arrival of Graballa the Hutt and his bounty hunters, who wanted to hand over Rowan to Darth Vader.

Estoc's Star Destroyer tried to trap the Arrowhead but Valeria disabled the Star Destroyer's tractor beam projector.
