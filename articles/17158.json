They were essentially micro-computers that were implanted inside the body of the user and monitored the circulatory system. Undesirable contents in the blood were removed by way of a complex algorithm in the implant, allowing the implant to maintain the user's body stability. This same system allowed the implant to detect drops or surges in nerve transmission rates within the body. The bio-stabilizer implant also stored and transmitted basic knowledge of various poisons and toxins into the mind of its user, teaching the brain to synthesize antidotes. The user of a bio-stabilizer implant was essentially immune to poison."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
