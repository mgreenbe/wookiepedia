After the Imperial Governor of Haidoral Prime, Everi Chalis, surrendered herself to the Alliance to Restore the Republic's 61st Mobile Infantry in order to defect, she presented the senior staff of the company with a bottle of brandy and figs produced locally on Haidoral Prime. To prove the drink was not poisoned she took a swig herself, directly from the bottle, after which the Rebels shared the drink between themselves as they discussed how Chalis might be an asset to the Alliance. Before the bottle was finished, Chalis knocked it from a table to the floor when she leaned swiftly across to whisper in the ear of Captain Micha Evon, commanding officer of the company. Jogan fruit brandy was a type of brandy made using jogan fruit which the ex-Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus attempted to order at the Alcazar cantina on the planet Akiva shortly before the Rebellion on Akiva; however, the establishment did not stock such fancy drinks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Savareen brandy was a popular brand produced on the planet Savareen.

The line referring to the beverage is not included in the film, and as it conflicts with the script from a scene in the film it is not considered canon.
