Harmon calls Den Siva to report success, then proceeds to a rendezvous point. Han and Lando feel hopeless at the exchange. Den ends communication and turns to the Tofs who have captured him, Princess Leia Organa, and Dani. They taunt Dani with a threat of torture and look forward to \"catching up\" with the Nagai. Leia's attach\u00e9s are dragged to Den's room, but break free and fight. The Tof chief orders their deaths but Leia exaggerates their importance in the war against the Nagai. Impressed, he takes them to a shuttle for interrogation, then tells Den to reveal the rendezvous spot. He refuses until the Tof threatens to kill Dani.

Enraged, the leader threatens to kill the Hiromi, who cowardly blame Luke. Suddenly, Luke is free of his bonds and surrounded by angry Hoojibs. As Tofs rush him, Luke floats the Tof to himself, kills him, and retrieves both 'sabers. He and the Hoojibs attack en masse, but several Tofs chase them to the room holding Leia and Dani, who lash out and trip the Tofs. They open fire but nothing happens, for the Hoojibs drained their blasters earlier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke and the Hiromi arrive and the Tofs are quickly beaten.

Hookyr, Hirog, and other Hiromi cheer wildly at the victory, then stop short when Luke recruits them to help attack the Tof command ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
