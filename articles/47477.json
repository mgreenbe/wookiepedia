The bounty hunter Boba Fett captured him for the governor after she put a bounty of 50,000 credits on him. Okor lost an arm in the process. When Fett brought Okor to Isis's office, he demanded 100,000 credits for the pirate, and when Isis refused, Fett activated a thermal detonator. Fett continued to increase the price of the bounty and eventually Isis agreed to pay 150,000 credits for Feldrall Okor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
