The Flesh Raiders had recently attacked a nearby Jedi outpost before being driven out of the area, and another group of Flesh Raiders chose to attack Kalikori after a young Jedi departed to retrieve a Flesh Raider weapons cache nearby for the villagers. During the attack, the wife of a villager named Saylew was killed before the villagers could drive the Flesh Raiders away, and Saylew's grief drove him to interrupt a meeting between several Jedi and the village's Scout Chief Moorint while they were planning a scouting mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack was first mentioned in the Jedi Knight class mission \"High-Tech Savages\" in the 2011 BioWare massively multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.
