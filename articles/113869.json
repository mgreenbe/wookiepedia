When the player was tasked with investigating the Canopy Bandits' camp, they would discover the dead bodies of two of the three researchers, a Human man and woman. The woman was clearly implied to be Jillian, however it is unknown if the man was Rengar, or the other male colleague named Bathoz. Therefore, while Rengar was implied to be a male in the quest dialogue, it cannot be said with absolute certainty if he was the dead Human seen in the game.
