Once more on the nomination of Taa, Palpatine, despite being independent of any Senate political grouping, was the Rim faction's nominee for Chancellor. It is possible that because of his neutrality, a rogue section of the Rim faction backed Ainlee Teem for Chancellor. However, Palpatine won."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taa's hope that Palpatine could be controlled, or at least counted on to not be a nuisance, were eventually realized as false when he ensured the Core faction's attachment to him. During the Separatist Crisis and Clone Wars, a large number of the Rim faction's membership became Separatists and either left or were expelled from the Senate. Other senators, such as Taa, Aks Moe, and Onaconda Farr, supported the Military Creation Act vigorously. Despite the continued loyalty of Taa and Amedda, this combined with Palpatine's courting of the Core faction resulted in great weakening of the Rim faction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Members"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
