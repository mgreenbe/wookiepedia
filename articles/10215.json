The Galactic Alliance chose to reopen negotiations in a neutral setting, following Admiral Matric Klauskin's capture of Tralus. Before hostilities escalated further Cal Omas, Grand Master Skywalker, Gilad Pellaeon and Cha Niathal devised a plan in which the Alliance would be able to negotiate a withdrawal from Tralus, allowing both the Corellian state and the Alliance to save face and end the conflict. However certain parties had no wish for matters to end peacefully."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The location chosen was Toryaz Station, an Kuati orbital station commonly used for interplanetary negotiations. A large area of the station was cleared, and made safe. On the first evening, following long talks, a dance took place. Afterward, the guests retired to their respective rooms. Supreme Commander Pellaeon was representing the Alliance, and Prime Minister Aidel Saxan represented the Corellian system. Master Skywalker and contingent of Jedi were also present, along with Han and Leia Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The attack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the first day of negotiations, Lumiya arrived disguised as a Kuati mercantile princess with a team of drugged commandos provided by Sal-Solo. Using her powers, she convinced Captain Siron Tawaler to provide navigation details to the delegation's chambers, and then promptly disposed of Tawaler by influencing him into stepping through an airlock. The rabid commandos struck at each delegation, and succeeded in killing Prime Minister Saxan. Pellaeon's double was also killed, but not the Supreme Commander himself, as he had changed quarters without informing the operators of Toryaz Station. Through the combative skill of those present, more possible casualties were prevented, although several security operatives were killed. Every commando died during the mission; some at the hands of the Jedi, others due to the terminal illnesses they had."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The talks were a failure; Aidel Saxan's former husband Denjax Teppler stepped in to replace her, fully aware that he would not last long in the position. The only clues to the forces which had masterminded the assassination were the frozen body of Captain Tawaler, and a piece of cloth representing a variety of Force-based cultures, including the Sith, planted presumably by Lumiya in a successful attempt to lure Jacen Solo to her home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Participants"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Alliance"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Corellia"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Other"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
