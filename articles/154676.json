Around four years before the Battle of Yavin, a squad of Imperial stormtroopers arrived at the village searching for a group of kyber crystal thieves who were thought to be hiding there. After arriving in the village, the captain of the stormtroopers grabbed the Rodian by the throat and dragged him to the town center of the village, where he put his blaster to the shopkeeper's head and threatened to shoot the Rodian if the thieves did not reveal themselves within three seconds. When the thieves failed to appear, the captain killed the Rodian and then grabbed a nearby human female and began counting down again, but was interrupted when a blaster fight erupted between his men and the other villagers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rodian first appeared in the short story \"TK-462\", which was written by Sylvain Neuvel and published in Star Wars Insider 166 in 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
