Rusting metal towers patrolled by armed guards looked out over the killing field as a security measure to keep intruders away. The interior of the complex was filled with piles of sorted scrap, which was tended to by fifty slaves. During the Galactic Civil War, a Houk named Gerk was the supervisor of the facility. Gerk had overseen a raid on Redlake village where the slaves were acquired. Illo Vandin wished to have a package of tyrru delivered to the camp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
