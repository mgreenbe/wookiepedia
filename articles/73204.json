Born on the planet of Kamino, Kaddak was bred to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic, and received training in combat by a Mandalorian member of the Cuy'val Dar. Learning of Mandalorian history and culture, the clone soldier took the name Kaddak for himself from the destroyer god of Mandalorian mythology, Kad Ha'rangir, creating a palindrome of the ancient deity's first name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time, Kaddak came to feel that the clones of the Republic's Grand Army were slaves, and his relationship with his Cuy'val Dar trainer grew contentious, until finally the two fought and Kaddak killed the Mandalorian instructor with his bare hands. As a result, Kaddak was imprisoned on Kamino and deemed a failure by his Kaminoan superiors, who sought to study him and determine why he had deviated from their behavioral standards. While incarcerated, Kaddak exercised furiously, and had his self-given name tattooed repeatedly across his body. In an effort to differentiate himself from the other clones who looked like him, Kaddak deliberately scarred his face, and kept his head shaved bare. When the Kaminoan tests were completed, rumors told that Kaddak had been put to death, while others insisted that he had escaped his captors and fled. This was proven true when Kaddak resurfaced on planet Ostor allied with the local Separatist holdouts. He later explained to fellow clone trooper Hock that he wanted to create a more equal society on that planet. Kaddak tried to convince Hock to join him, but Hock used this opportunity to help Imperial stormtroopers penetrate the Ostor's capital city. For this betrayal, Kaddak attacked Hock, but was killed in the fighting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaddak first appeared in the second issue of the comic book series Star Wars: Darth Vader and the Cry of Shadows, authored by Tim Siedell and published January 14, 2013."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
