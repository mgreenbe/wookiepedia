The Malice exited hyperspace and launched a single squadron's worth of TIE/LN starfighters and TIE/sa bombers before returning to its original mission. The Imperial fighters were engaged by three defending Rebel fighters, a T-65 X-wing starfighter, a BTL Y-wing starfighter and an R-22 Spearhead who, despite being outnumbered, were able to stop the Imperial attack and save the shuttle. By the time the Malice returned the Rebels had left the area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance later recreated the mission as a simulation for training new pilots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
