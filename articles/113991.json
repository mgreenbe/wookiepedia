On board, Omega reads a datapad while lying against Gonky. Hunter enters the hold, and remarks that it doesn't look comfortable for either of them, but Omega assures him they are fine, and Hunter says \"Chow time\" and hands her a ration bar. Wrecker slides down a ladder, exclaims \"About time\", and devours his bar instantly. He asks for another, but Hunter says rations are low. Omega offers Wrecker her bar, and as he reaches for it, Hunter reproaches him, saying she doesn't even have somewhere to sleep. Wrecker understands, and tells Omega to keep it, which she happily does."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lights flicker for a moment, and Hunter yells to Echo that he thought he had fixed them. Echo tells him to add it to the list, explaining to Tech that the ship got hit hard when they left Saleucami, and that systems have been glitching since then. Echo points out to Tech that repairs would be quicker with his help, but Tech insists his priority is to build a scanner to test the functionality of their inhibitor chips and determine why they failed. As Tech says no critical systems were compromised, the ship shudders and drops out of hyperspace above a moon.

With an alert blaring, the ship enters the atmosphere of the nearby moon and slides to a rough landing on the crater-strewn landscape. Echo reports that the storm is disrupting their comms, and is getting worse. Tech determines that one of the ship's capacitors was damaged in the skirmish on Saleucami, and will need to be replaced before they can take off. The inventory shows they have one spare, and Omega pulls down a case asking if this is it. The team looks at the case sadly, and Hunter tells her that is Crosshair's weapons kit. Wrecker sighs, and admits he misses Crosshair, but is reminded by Echo that Crosshair shot him. Tech suggests that Crosshair's betrayal could be due to his inhibitor chip, but Hunter tells them the debate won't fix the ship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Special forces"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Kamino, CT-9904 undergoes a medical scan, and AZI-3 informs him his vitals are at optimum levels.

Outside, a creature crawls across the hull and pulls out the capacitor, plunging the cabin into darkness. Omega sees the creature as it runs across the viewport, holding the capacitor.

ES-01 intervenes, saying that Gerrera's fighters are dead and they should bring the civilians in. Crosshair says they weren't the orders they were given, and ES-01 replies that those orders were wrong and the squad won't obey them as they are soldiers, not an execution squad. ES-01 refuses Crosshair's last offer to comply with the orders and tells the rest of the team to ignore the clone, and take the prisoners in for questioning. Crosshair asks if ES-01 knows why they put him in charge\u2014because he is willing to do what needs to be done.
