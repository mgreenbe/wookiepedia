The YT-XC arose from research and development that had gone into the failed freight-loading external rover project. The vessel developed huge demand, but in response to concerns from Imperial Customs, CEC marketed it only at relief organizations, scientific foundations and licensed industrial prospectors. However, a number of YT-XCs were obtained by pirates and smugglers, who modified them and used them as miniature starfighters. For some time, Han Solo and Chewbacca operated one aboard the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The YT-XC was designed to be housed within the YT-1300, concealed behind a hatch that outwardly appeared to be a docking ring.
