Imperial agents aboard the cruiser learned of the Ambassador's identity, and sent word to Grand Moff Rycus Kilran. His ship, one of the largest warships in the entire Sith fleet, attacked the Esseles during its journey. Claiming that the Ambassador was a terrorist, the Sith boarded the ship in an attempt to arrest her. When the troops aboard the ship fought back, the Sith under the leadership of the ruthless Mandalorian mercenary Ironfist seized the bridge and put the ship under a security lockdown. After cancelling the lockdown, the ships' troops managed to retake the bridge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the ship was secured, a group of Republic operatives who had been traveling aboard the Esseles at the time boarded Kilran's vessel in order to disable the tractor beams and allow the ship to escape.

There are two possible ways to bypass the security lockdown. The dark side way uses a reactor reset which kills everyone on the engineering deck.
