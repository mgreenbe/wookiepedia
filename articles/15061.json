After Imperial Grand Moff Octavian Grant chased the resistance's leader, Customs Vizier Marath Vooro, down the Five Veils Route hyperlane from Farstine to the nebula, his forces managed to capture Vooro during the battle. The arrest ended the Five Veils Campaign, an Imperial campaign against Federation holdouts led by Vooro, who had refused to acknowledge a treaty that handed over the Federation's assets to the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was first mentioned in The Essential Guide to Warfare, an extensive guide dedicated to the conflicts in the galaxy, written by Jason Fry and Paul R.
