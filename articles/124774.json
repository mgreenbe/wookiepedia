Capable of quickly numbing and paralyzing exposed skin, shockstun mist was most effective when inhaled; resulting in paralysis that could last for hours. The chemical was best known for being introduced in the GRS-1 snare rifle, which had the ability to fire shockstun mist to a distance of about 150 meters. Immediately following the mist was a liquid spraynet which hardened after exposure to the air and helped restrict all movement of the paralyzed target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A shockstun mist canister for the GRS-1 cost 75 credits and could fire up to twelve shots before the cartridge must be replaced."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
