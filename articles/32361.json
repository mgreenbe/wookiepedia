Prosthetic replacements were connected to organic tissue via a complex synth-net neural interface, which provided the recipient with control and sensation. External replacements were often covered by synthflesh to emulate actual organic tissue. An individual with cybernetic replacements was known as a cyborg."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The galaxy had centuries of advanced technology at its disposal. Among them were the ability to replace and, for a price, modify and enhance the body. Cloning was expensive and, given the horrors of the Clone Wars, illegal on most planets after the era. Some limited regeneration of limbs was considered acceptable but there were medical dangers involved with a science that had, for obvious reasons, not seen much development in later decades after the Clone Wars. For the majority of galactic citizens, cybernetic replacements were the cheap, effective, legal, and safe solution to unfortunate and severe physical injuries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For those willing to make the sacrifice of flesh and expense, the body could be \"upgraded\" to allow for additional skills and abilities. Some were very innocuous, the Shepherd chip issued to military service members for instance. Others involved modifying the limbs and internal systems of the potential patient. As with everything in the galaxy, this came at a potential price, in credits and in the potential loss of self. Someone could easily go too far in attempting to be \"more human than human.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When flesh failed\u2014and sometimes even before that\u2014cybernetics took over. Prosthetic limbs and replacement organs powered by batteries and controlled by electrical impulses were the low end of these procedures with sophisticated cybernetic hardware designed to improve or augment the recipient's body and mind at the high end of the scale."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Artificial organs could be implanted by droids such as the DD-13 medical assistant droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cybernetic types"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two major kinds of cybernetic attachments existed in the galaxy: replacements and enhancements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Subjects of cybernetic replacements/enhancements"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many beings had prosthetic replacements throughout galactic history. Several beings were well known for employing unique or extensive prostheses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Alternatives to cybernetics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This area of medical technology was spurred by the carnage of the Clone Wars, and the replacement of body parts with lifelike replicas reached a high level of refinement during the Galactic Civil War. Not all prostheses, however, were designed with replicating the real body part in mind. The prosthetic arm of Arden Lyn, a Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si master, was conspicuously disproportionate to her body and was in fact a modified droid arm. Similarly, Darth Maul, the former Sith apprentice to Darth Sidious, after narrowly surviving his fight with Obi-Wan Kenobi with his lower half lost, had created a crude substitute for his lower half via a prosthetic that more resembled an arachnid than an actual Dathomirian Nightbrother lower half, although it was later replaced with a pelvis and legs more closely resembling his original ones when he was recovered by his half-brother, Savage Opress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although prostheses were widely available, not all candidates accepted the replacement limbs offered to them. The Jedi Tenel Ka lost an arm during a practice lightsaber duel with Jacen Solo but chose to shun the offer of a replacement, instead choosing to focus upon her own physical and Force-based abilities to compensate for the loss. Wolf Sazen also kept his arm from being replaced after Darth Nihl cut it off until later in 137 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also, the arrival of the Yuuzhan Vong, who wielded advanced biotechnology, opened new avenues for the replacement of lost limbs. After being captured by the Yuuzhan Vong, A'Sharad Hett's synthetic arm was replaced with a grown organic replacement. Decades later, Hett, now Darth Krayt, would order that a similarly organic replacement be given to Darth Nihl after the Nagai lost his right arm to Cade Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
