Alliance Intelligence had a branch dedicated to interrogation, and Alliance Special Forces also maintained a cadre of interrogators. Alliance interrogators relied on subtle methods of interrogation, such as intimidation, perception manipulation, sleep deprivation, and telepathic probing if available. Horteks serving in SpecForce were generally employed as interrogators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike Alliance Intelligence interrogators, who had time and facilities to work with, SpecForce interrogators were generally dropped into a location and given a short amount of time to get information from a prisoner. Among SpecForce interrogators tricks was the use of \"acceleration,\" by making the prisoner believe that a longer period of time had elapsed. This was achieved by having a series of interviews, followed by a short sleep, followed by an early breakfast and morning interview. Interrogators maintained the illusion by using a wash-up kit and portable uniform fresher to appear freshly groomed. To the prisoner, it would seem as if a period of twenty-four to thirty-six hours had passed, when in reality, only twelve hours had elapsed. Another method was simulated torture, where the prisoner was made to believe that another captive was being tortured in the adjoining room. The interrogator would cultivate a sense of false camaraderie with the prisoner in order to draw out information in exchange for safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
