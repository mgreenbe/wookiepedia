Its citizens used expansive hand gestures. In 19 ABY, Imperial Intelligence agent Drend Navett impersonated a native of Fedje in order to infiltrate the Bothan homeworld of Bothawui during the Caamas Document Crisis. Making use of the expansive hand gestures typical of Betreasley inhabitants to make his performance more convincing, he posed as an exotic pet salesman as a cover for sabotage activities. He was trying to incite violence against the Bothans after it had been discovered that an unidentified group of them had been involved in the orbital bombardment of Caamas decades earlier. Navett later died while sabotaging a power generator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
