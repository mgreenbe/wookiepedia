The immense, empty structure of Xim the Despot's treasure chambers housed the main branch, located on the southernmost of the planet's three continents. Being a poor society, the bank had very few tenants and operated on a primitive level compared to the financial organizations found on more advanced worlds, and was one of the few offices occupying the vaults.
