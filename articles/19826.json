After the Battle of Yavin, he lived in Coronet City and served as a henchman for Ames Miss'd, along with Anita B'ath. Around 1 ABY, Box O'Rox and his associates used to harass new recruits of the rival Meatlump gang. Angered by this situation, a food supply clerk of the Meatlumps tasked a spacer affiliated with the Meatlumps to teach the Ragtags a lesson. The spacer therefore met Ames Miss'd outside Coronet. The former attempted to intimidate the Ragtag but Miss'd was not scared and ordered Anita and Box to attack the spacer. Eventually, the spacer managed to kill them both. Unable to defend himself, Ames Miss'd surrendered and accepted to live the Meatlumps alone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Box O'Rox appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
