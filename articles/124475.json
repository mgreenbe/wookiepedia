They had large tubes and fins designed to vent the heat generated by the star.

The Shieldship had an advanced slave circuit system for taking control of the ships behind it, making a quick 1 hour hyperspace jump to Nkllon. Without a slaving system, then the trip to Nkllon would have to be made at sublight speeds which would take up to 10 hours."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Lando Calrissian's Nomad City controlled Nkllon, it was profiting with nearly 10 million credits a year. The Shieldship was designed by Lando Calrissian himself, who was inspired after witnessing Cronal's actions during the Battle of Mindor, and was constructed by Republic Engineering Corporation. Lando purchased twelve of the Shieldships, which allowed for up to three visits to Nkllon per day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Grand Admiral Thrawn attacked Nkllon, stole Lando Calrissian's mining machines, disabled every shieldship, and disrupted communications.

The Shieldships took orbit around the enemy planet and reflected the condensation of the planet back towards itself, and froze the planet to near absolute zero. The yammosk, or war coordinator, was stopped, and the Yuuzhan Vong were utterly destroyed without the joining power of the yammosk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
