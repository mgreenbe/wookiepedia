Then the demon flowed into the body of its victim, who turned translucent, then transparent, and finally faded away.

The demon summoned by Kharys eliminated the female smuggler Katya M'Buele while she was sleeping aboard the Millennium Falcon, with others standing guard. However, the demon was not able to escape, as he was impaled by Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, which harmed the creature whereas blaster bolts did not.
