The three Imperial escorts each attempted to intercept the Republic fleet and suffered heavy damage doing so. The squadron member continued attacking Mark VI Supremacy-class starfighters and the escorts while nearing the warship. The hero was tasked with damaging four shield generators and twelve Laser cannons on the capital ship that guided the Imperial fleet, as well as eliminating 30 interceptors if the opportunity arose. As the battle commenced three additional Terminus-class destroyers came to the aid of the capital ship, one of which was destroyed directly after assisting.
