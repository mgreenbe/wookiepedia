He was a megalomaniac, running his own illegal operations from his fortress, including theft and hijacking. He was also an expert in political intrigue. Throughout his final months of life he was constantly thwarted in his efforts to gain the favor of the Galactic Empire and Admiral Terrinald Screed by the merchant Mungo Baobab and his droids C-3PO and R2-D2."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point prior to 15 BBY Koong along with his lieutenant Gaff seized control of Roon with his personal army and made himself de facto Governor of the Tawntoom province. He then proceeded to amass a small fortune after he took control of one of the lightstations in the Cloak of the Sith, purposely crashing ships that tried to travel through the dust cloud and recovering the debris to extract valuables to be sold on the black market; such as ship parts, Nergon-14, and Mupple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eager to become allied with the Empire, Koong made a deal with Admiral Terrinald Screed to supply the Empire with valuable Roonstones in return to maintain his strong financial position and semi-autonomy over Roon. When Koong salvaged the Caravel, a ship belonging to Mungo Baobab, he believed the merchant was one of Screed's lieutenants and proceeded to show him the workings of his operations. Only when Screed himself arrived to observe Koong's operation, did Koong realize he had been tricked and Baobab and his droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, were arrested. Baobab managed to escape, inflicting damage to the lightstation and causing it to crash into an asteroid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Desperate to prove himself to the Empire after the failure of his previous scheme, Koong determined to crush resistance in the Umboo Province.
