While moving through the area, the hull of Grievous's frigate was struck by one of the asteroids, which prompted the general to order his crew to direct all power to the vessel's forward shields. As the frigates came into range of the Republic fleet, Grievous ordered them to open fire on the Star Destroyers, disabling one of them in the process. Thus, Skywalker, who was leading a squadron of V-19 Torrent starfighters, was forced to engage the Separatist fleet."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, despite the loss of only two of his fighters, Skywalker ordered his squadron to take evasive action, resulting in numerous All Terrain Tactical Enforcers positioned throughout the asteroid field to be revealed at the Jedi's behest.
