They spit out a fireball from their mouth that was hot enough to scorch a Durasteel hull. Their first demonstration of the ability occurred by accident when he and Gorc, after having an immense brunch and downing a barrel of Gamorrean hooch, burned their clan-rival Scumbo in the snout while doing a bro-fist. Thok would later use it to great effect while acting as a student of Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si under the teachings of Emperor's Hand Arden Lyn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fireball Belch was one of Thok's moves in the fighting game Star Wars: Masters of Teras Kasi.
