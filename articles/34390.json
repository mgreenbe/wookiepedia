But the assault is hampered by the planet's natural murkiness and foggy conditions, as well as the local wildlife, one of which nearly claims the lives of Fives and Hardcase, though Fives manages to kill it with a thermal detonator. When Anakin Skywalker and his clones take a break before preparing for their mission, the Umbarans execute a sneak attack forcing them to retreat. An airstrike by Master Krell saves them just in time, but Krell then approaches Anakin with a disconcerting message: Anakin is to return to Coruscant and meet with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, for reasons unknown. Reluctant to leave his troops in the midst of battle, Anakin nevertheless is forced to relinquish command over his troops to Master Krell and make the journey back to the Republic capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As soon as Skywalker departs, however, Krell adopts a very derisive, condescending stance towards the clone troopers, showing them no respect or consideration. His harsh determination to complete the mission at all costs, no matter what, gradually raises the ire of the clone troopers. When they reach the capital, Krell insists on a change in the attack plan, opting on a full frontal assault on the capital's main road instead of a series of preemptive surprise attacks against the enemy's defenses \u2013 a course which would expose them to heavy enemy attack - and, as Rex feared, the battalion begins to run into enemy traps, with mines on the main road and an all-out ambush which claims the lives of many troopers. Rex orders his troopers to retreat in order to attain a more advantageous fighting position. Though frustrated by the clones' retreat, Krell ordered additional troopers and AT-RT drivers to save Rex and his men. After they manage to repel the natives, Krell immediately begins to criticize Rex for retreating and compromising his plans. Rex and Fives stand up to him, voicing their protests and pointing out that, while they are aware of the importance of their mission, they are also concerned about the welfare of their men. Krell eventually gives Rex a dubious compliment, but before Rex and Fives have the time to contemplate Krell's words more thoroughly, the Umbarans launch a counter-attack, forcing them to refocus on the battle..."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the episode, when General Krell addresses Captain Rex, he refers to him as \"CT-7567,\" even though Rex is a captain and holds the designation CC-7567, per many sources.
