Consisting of little more than a powerful hyperdrive and a sublight engine housed in a protective shield packed with sensors, such pods were designed to come down rapidly, mimicking a crashing meteorite in order to avoid detection. Cushioned snugly inside the pod with its arms retracted, the probe droid used an umbilical to monitor the status and location of its transport. To prevent damage to the droid, said umbilical was withdrawn right before landing. X3-13s were specialized hyperdrive pods used to deploy E-XD-series infiltrator droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
