They used it to train Sith assassins and spies. These initiates had a greater aptitude in the Force than their brethren in the academies on Honoghr, Gentes, and Gamorr. Here recruits learned to use the dark side for secrecy, deception, and manipulation. Those who survived the rigorous training became deadly assassins, preferring use of the dark side to kill rather than with physical force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
