They were fast swimmers and could rip apart their enemies with their teeth. They swam with their legs crossed, resembling a shark's vertical tailfin. The Karkarodon Riff Tamson managed two blaster shots to the chest without showing any signs of injury. The species was most comfortable underwater, and preferred to be immersed in liquid.

During the Clone Wars, the Karkarodon commander Riff Tamson was sent by Count Dooku to help occupy the planet Mon Cala for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. After capturing the planet and its prince, Lee-Char, he declared himself ruler of the Mon Cala, having Karkarodon enforcers occupy the capital. His rule was short lived, however, when the Quarren senator Nossor Ri betrayed him. Lee-Char was able to kill Tamson shortly after. A Karkarodon was among the many prisoners detained in the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center. One day, he confronted the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, disguised as bounty hunter Rako Hardeen, who responded by stabbing his hand with a fork, threatening to eat him.
