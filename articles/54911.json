It has been widely lauded to give a temporary telepathic boost, but many, such as Corran Horn, felt that the increased abilities were merely imagined by the spiced users. Others, such as Han Solo, felt their effects firsthand and knew the telepathic powers to be true. Excessive use, however, degenerated the nerves in the brain, resulting in loss of sight, twitching, nervousness, and paranoia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glitterstim played a key role in convincing Bria Tharen to abandon her religious life on Ylesia. She was given a vial of the drug by Han Solo, who suggested she use it to read his surface thoughts and verify he was telling the truth about the fraudulent nature of the Ylesian priesthood. Instead, Bria ingested the spice during the Exultation ceremony; despite being bombarded by the induced pleasures of every worshiper around her, she read the mind of the t'landa Til priest Teroenza and found there no religious belief at all, but the thoughts of a swindler. Teroenza reacted to the telepathic presence, and Bria fled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glitterstim users frequently overdosed on the spice, sometimes resulting in death.
