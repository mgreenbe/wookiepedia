He took a young man as his Sith apprentice, training him in the ways of the dark side. Finn and his apprentice eventually traveled to a world and planted a bomb in a building. After concluding business with an individual, Finn and his pupil departed and detonated the bomb, which destroyed the building. As Finn and his apprentice made their way to their starship, they encountered the Toydarian slave master Lod and his slave, a young woman named Marka. When Lod ordered the woman to impress Finn and his apprentice, she refused, and he struck her. Finn's apprentice helped her from the ground and told Lod that he would not strike Marka again. When Lod called the apprentice a slave while talking to Finn, the man killed the Toydarian. Finn expressed his disappointment to the apprentice; he rebuked him for helping Marka and punched him, knocking the young man to the ground.
