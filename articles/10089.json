The aim was to destroy deadly droids that had overrun the world long before the Imperial Era. The droids had rebuilt themselves to be more dangerous than regular security droids. Ahr sent out a stormtrooper patrol, but all of them perished, so instead of sending out more to die for nothing, the Governor sent out Darth Vader. The Sith Lord destroyed all of the droids in the vicinity, surprising Ahr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
