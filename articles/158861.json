Vader decides that he shall train the Smuggler in the ways of The Force as he will need this knowledge in order to survive the path ahead. They make there way to the entrance of the inner sanctum where The Smuggler learns from  Vader that his ancestor, Lady Corvax, was force-sensitive during her time which explains why he can use The Force as well, but she was weak and broken by her sentiment and softness as he must take note through Vader so the Smuggler will not make the same mistake his ancestor has done years ago. Vader demonstrates the power of The Force on a nearby destroyed statue of Lady Corvax herself and explains to the Smuggler that The Force is more powerful beyond anything he could ever imagine as it discloses the enigmas that will cause the fragile and broken to turn away in horror and agitation, also if the Force is truly someone's servant they will understand the secrets of life and death both. As Lady Corvax's machines and devices can only be controlled by her or her descendants, the Smuggler's bloodline makes the latter powerful but will need to know the ways of the Force to continue. Vader then initiates the Smuggler's training of the Force and grabs a nearby activation stone as the Smuggler's first test. The latter is instructed to use the Force to take control of the stone, where he does so as Vader explains that the Force is responding to the Smuggler's bloodline and proceeds to place the stone into one of the two pedestals ahead, causing a ceiling key machine to be awoken as it returns to its proper use. Vader then hands the Smuggler the other activation stone to finish what he started, which he proceeds to do so and the machine releases a pulse of light and in turn causes the gateway to open. Both the Smuggler and Vader move ahead into a long passageway, as Vader explains that the Smuggler has still much to learn and he quickly engages the second test of the Force, using it to defend yourself. After succeeding in the test, the Smuggler learns that he has only viewed a small portion of the Force as he will be instructed later, but first he follows Vader who then goes to show him a special blocked message left to him by Lady Corvax who tells her descendant to proceed with caution into the area ahead, and reveals how her husband was strucken down in battle and she was desperate to save him, which is why she created the Aeon Engine, a device that has the capability on harnessing the energy and power from the Bright Star, but her plan failed as Mustafar and the Mustafarians paid the price for her transgressions, leaving the planet the way it is now. She explains that before she passed away, she has hidden the Bright Star in a hidden chamber near her husband's tomb as it will give a chance to unlock the preservation for Mustafar and its people, who then ends by begging her descendant to help. Vader then explicated to the Smuggler that Lady Corvax had absolutely no idea on what she has created and with the power of the Aeon Engine, the Sith Lord himself will become unstoppable. The two then tread down the pathway and come across a large room populated by nests of Lava nymphs, Vader then initiates the Smuggler's third test of the Force, to tap into the dark side and exterminate the vermin. The Smuggler does so but is then criticized by Vader as his abilities are accepting but lacking. He moves towards a central pedestal and watches as a configurement key similar to the one given to him by Vader before shoots out of the pedestal and floats in mid-air, where he is instructed by the Sith Lord to grab the key with the Force and activate the pedestal. The Smuggler does so and which causes a large portion of the floor to break apart, but is caught by Vader using the Force and then tells the Smuggler to control his fear and before he can say anything else, a darkghast attacks the two, forcing him to let go to fight the creature, causing the Smuggler to fall thousands of feet into the planet before being knocked unconscious. He witnesses a vision of the Black Bishop telling him to heed his advice, as Vader is searching for the Bright Star he must never lay one hand on it. Black Bishop has before glimpsed a terrible future as if Vader has the power of the Bright Star, hundreds of worlds and galaxies will crumble apart in his grasp, and that the fate of these lost lives are now in the Smuggler's hands. He also explains that he is objected to find the Bright Star before Vader and give it back to the Mustafarians, as they can use it to heal the damage done to Mustafar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After regaining conscious, the Smuggler is told by Black Bishop that he must climb the caverns to reach his tomb where he can find the Bright Star.
