As one anecdote goes, Aragon\u00e9s was once left alone in a room by his parents with a box of crayons. His parents returned sometime later to find that he had covered the wall in hundreds upon hundreds of drawings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aragon\u00e9s emigrated with his family due to the Spanish Civil War and settled in Mexico. He made his first professional sale in 1954 but continued to doodle humorous cartoons while studying architecture at the University of Mexico, and also learning pantomime under the direction of Alejandro Jodorowsky."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1962, Aragon\u00e9s moved to the United States. According to the artist, he arrived in New York with nothing but 20 dollars and his portfolio of drawings. After working odd jobs around the city, Aragon\u00e9s went to Mad's offices in Madison Avenue hoping to sell some of his cartoons. Since his knowledge of English wasn't very extensive, he asked for the only Mad artist he knew of that spoke his language, Cuban-born artist Antonio Prohias, creator of the popular Spy vs. Spy. Aragon\u00e9s hoped Prohias could serve as a translator between him and the Mad editors. According to Aragon\u00e9s, this proved to be a mistake, since Prohias knew even less English than he. Prohias did receive Aragon\u00e9s very enthusiastically and, with difficulty, introduced the young artist to the Mad editors as his \"brother.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mad editor Al Feldstein and publisher Bill Gaines liked what they saw, and Aragon\u00e9s became a contributor to the magazine in 1963. Aragon\u00e9s became famous for his wordless \"drawn-out dramas\" or \"marginals\" which were inserted into the margins and between panels of the magazine. The drawings are both horizontal and vertical, and occasionally extend around corners. Prior to Aragon\u00e9s' arrival at Mad, the magazine had sometimes filled its margins with text jokes under the catch-all heading \"Marginal Thinking.\" According to Aragon\u00e9s the staff of Mad enjoyed his marginals, but expected him to only last one or two issues. They did not expect him to be able to maintain the steady stream of small cartoons needed for each issue. However, Aragon\u00e9s has provided marginals for every issue of Mad since 1963 except one (his contributions to that issue were lost by the Post Office)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aragon\u00e9s is a very prolific artist; Al Jaffee once said, \"Sergio has, quite literally, drawn more cartoons on napkins in restaurants than most cartoonists draw in their entire careers.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1967 he began illustrating full stories for DC Comics under such titles as Plop! He also wrote or plotted stories that were illustrated by other artists, including the Western series Bat Lash and stories for various horror anthology titles. Aragon\u00e9s claims that he originally looked for work in the comic-book industry and was warned off. He was told that he would be better paid working for Mad Magazine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the late 1970s he created the humorous barbarian comic book Groo the Wanderer with Mark Evanier. Evanier's role originally was as something of a translator, as Aragon\u00e9s was still somewhat shaky at expressing his ideas in English. Eventually the two began collaborating on story ideas, and there have been several Groo stories in which Evanier is credited as the sole writer. Aragon\u00e9s is currently fluent in English. As a creator-owned book, Groo has survived the bankruptcy of a number of publishers, a fact which led to the popular joke that publishing the series was a precursor to a publisher's demise. The book was initially published by Pacific Comics, briefly by Eclipse Comics, then Marvel Comics under their since-discontinued Epic Comics imprint, then Image Comics, and currently Dark Horse Comics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His Star Wars\u2013themed comics include Sergio Aragon\u00e9s Stomps Star Wars, \"Spare Parts\", and \"Junkheap Hero\".
