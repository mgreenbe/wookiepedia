However, the weapon never saw use against the Jedi killer and it later came to be located within the Five Masters Academy, a martial arts school that was situated on the planet Cularin. Shortly after the end of the Clone Wars, a shadowy being attacked the Academy and massacred the students and instructors. Barnab Chistor, a pupil of the Academy who had been absent during the early stages of the attack, witnessed the assailant engaging the Master in Violet, the one member of the Academy's staff who was left alive, so he seized the experimental handgun and fired it at the being. A rocket from the device then struck the being, which forced the attacker to retreat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
