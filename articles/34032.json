These creatures were of large size, equaling most humans in height. Its favorite meals were eaten raw and were cooked as a part of the digestion process. Because of its immense internal heat, Darellian fire crabs are often hungry, eating whenever they are able, and gorging themselves when the chance presented itself. If a crab was starving, as was fairly common, it might resort to the eating of plants, but while this temporarily sustained the crab, it would often give it severe indigestion. Darellian fire crabs are most known for their defensive method, in which they would revert a massive amount of heat to their underbelly and face. This process turned the crab fiery red, and would severely burn anything that touched its skin. Thus, the phrase 'blush like a Darellian fire crab' was coined. In 22 BBY, the Gungan Jar Jar Binks blushed like a Darellian fire crab while in the presence of the Human Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
