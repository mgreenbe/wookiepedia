They were made out of wood or metal, depending on the era or purpose. As such, some destroyed ships had their remains sink to the bottom of the body of water. While many in the galaxy needed to travel between the stars, those living solely in one place on their home planets required less sophisticated varieties of transport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The boats of Somov Rit varied in size, but seemed to follow similar, simple designs. The people of Somov Rit used long poles to push the boats through the marshy waters. The elder Governor Quarg of Drexel exiled a number of technos on the boat to be left adrift, thinking they would perish at sea; instead, they became the first Dragon Lords. On Naboo, both Gungans and the Human colonists developed a variety of sophisticated aquatic vehicles. Nevertheless, simple fishing rigs were still used by the fishermen, such as ones in the Solleu River in Theed. Simple wind-blown boats and canoes were also used by people of Cerea, as well as Ewoks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fishermen of the Rebel Alliance safe world colony Sanctuary used steam-driven wooden seafaring vessels to catch fish in the planet's deep oceans. During the Galactic Civil War, the self-styled Governor Quarg and his ship-dwellers lived in the Great Ship, a reconverted aquatic vessel that served as a floating habitat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
