However, the Imperials had been caught unaware of the plot, and the Sardis was unable to perform to its peak efficiency either because it was unmanned, or its systems were not yet operational. The research ship was designated a primary target, and it gave no apparent defensive fire as a squadron of B-wings led by Ace Azzameen destroyed it and the station, effectively ending the program."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
