She was the daughter of the Dantooine delegates to the Imperial Senate, who were friends with Bail Prestor Organa. When she was 21 years old, she left to join the Rebel Alliance. She became a spy early on for the Alliance and spent most of her time away, without contact with Organa. In 3 ABY though, Organa received a message from Song telling here to meet at the wildlife preserve planet Oaka Prime. When Song arrived, she was ambushed by the notorious droid bounty hunter IG-88. She was saved when Organa, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca arrived and rescued her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
