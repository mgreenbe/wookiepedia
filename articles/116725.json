He held a great dislike\u2014if not hatred\u2014for the Jedi. During the infiltration of Nickel One, his brother died aboard a Tra'kad that had been hit with several mines during a run against the asteroid. After the attempt to kill off the entire Moff Council failed due to Darth Caedus's rescue, Roegr made an attempt to kill Caedus in one-on-one combat only to have Caedus shatter his armor by using the presumed-lost art of shatterpoints. He was then impaled through the chest by Caedus's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
