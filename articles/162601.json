The twenty two and a half meter armored wall was capable of physically stopping a walker from simply walking through it - due to its fortification - and was also strong enough that shooting through it would take time as well. Additionally, on the inner side of the wall were deep armored pits, designed to trip, trap, or impede a walkers progress. For good measure, a high intensity power fence is often mounted on the top of the barrier, and is electrified by a heavy power generator with enough energy to instantly kill a sentient foolish enough to touch it; additionally, mounted on each of the power fences posts are sensor pods, allowing operators to keep a watchful eye on the perimeter of the barrier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Walker barriers were often used in conjunction with pit traps and high-gravity traps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
