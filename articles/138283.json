It had an open cab, light armor, and a mounted double-barreled energy canon; was powered by four repulsorlifts; and had a five-ton payload. Cadets at the Imperial Academy were certified in T-4 use during their second year. All T-4s, like most Imperial military vehicles, were locked with a keypad tuned to a four-digit code. The factory setting was 0000, and most soldiers kept it that way, as it was easier than ensuring that all soldiers memorized the new code."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the year 5 ABY, Kyle Katarn and WeeGee used a T-4 to escape Jerec's Imperial forces and Grave Tusken mercenaries, when trying to get away from the Katarn house on the moon Sulon.
