It was captured by Moff Yittreas and Strike force Alpha around 1 BBY, but the Rebel staff escaped to the nearby Le'Roche island. The Imperials established a base of their own there, which consisted of a Command center at least two troop centers, a war center, and a gate along with some remnants of the Rebel base. The Imperials, after creating their base, protected the base with laser turrets. A Rebel strike force, led by Leia Organa and Echuu Shen-Jon later retook the base and drove the Imperials out. Sandov then contacted Organa and sent transports to bring her to Le'Roche."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ghost Base appears in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds during the Leia Organa campaign.
