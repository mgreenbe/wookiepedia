The Younglings are taught a basic combination of lightsaber moves. Then they use the Force to open the doors to the Temple. Apparitions of Darth Vader and the Seventh Sister then appear, apparently representing the Jedi's fears. Half of the Younglings fight Vader, while the others fight the Seventh Sister. After they have been defeated, they are Force-pushed back into the Temple after the Younglings are told to put their lightsabers down. However, one of the Padawans worries that her worst fear, Darth Maul, will come out next; right at that moment, an apparition of Darth Maul appears and engages the Padawan in a lightsaber duel. She defeats him and is about to kill him before being stopped by the Younglings. Yoda, whose voice is heard through the Force, senses fear in all of the Jedi. Maul retreats back into the Temple, but after an expression of frustration for not finishing Maul off, he immediately emerges again, only to be Force pushed back in by the Younglings. Celebrating their victory, everyone poses for a photograph in front of the Temple, then returns their lightsabers and robes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Update: Rather than Darth Maul, the final apparition (at WDW Hollywood Studios and Hong Kong Disneyland) is currently Kylo Ren."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
