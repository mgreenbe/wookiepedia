Unfortunately, Turk Falso decides to go behind Hondo's back, since he thinks dealing with the Separatists would have been more profitable, and has his men shoot down the shuttle to sack the ransom for himself.

Jar Jar has the clones jump into a geyser, making the Weequays decide to let the acid kill them. Jar Jar is extremely confident, as the local fauna's behavior determines when a geyser is about to erupt, which ultimately saves the group's lives. Returning to the wreckage of the shuttle, they find that the spice ransom is gone. Though the clones think of waiting for reinforcements, Jar Jar plans to go after the pirates, riding the skalders to catch up. They intercept and defeat the pirates, and with the spice back in hand, they follow a series of power supply lines straight to the pirate base. Meanwhile, Hondo becomes increasingly annoyed at the Jedis' attempts to escape and tortures Anakin and Obi-Wan with electricity, while Dooku remains locked in his cell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon his return to the base, Turk lies to Hondo, saying that the Republic brought an army, and dispatches tanks after the clones and Jar Jar. Commander Stone sends Jar Jar to \"negotiate,\" knowing that the Gungan's ineptitude will be useful. As the pirates take him hostage, Jar Jar accidentally rams one tank into another and subsequently shuts down the power grid. The Weequays attempt to kill him, only for the clones to hold them at gunpoint."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the blackout hits the base, the Jedi and Dooku make their escape and go their separate ways: Dooku kills Turk and takes off in a ship; Anakin and Obi-Wan take Hondo hostage before meeting Jar Jar outside.
