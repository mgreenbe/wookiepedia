The grenade, when detonated, created a lethal blast that would shatter structures and kill targets nearly instantaneously at the blast point. Following a botched operation to apprehend the Dug criminal Gronson Takkaro, the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk hurled a concussion grenade into Ake's Tavern in an effort to escape Imperial stormtroopers.
