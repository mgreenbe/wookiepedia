The pirate revealed to the authorities while in captivity that there was an assault being planned on the planet of Parcovey Minor. The tip off allowed the Belasco Free Volunteers to rush to the planet's defense and defeat the raid which was backed by the Hutt Utoradii kajidic. The Jilruan's role in revealing the assault was recorded in a report which was then stored in a government archive on Belasco. The report would later be rediscovered in 5 ABY, leading Thunys Albegron, an Academician of Popular Studies, to mention the Jilruan at the 6 ABY Conference on Popular Entertainment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jilruan was first mentioned in the 2014 fifth entry in the Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut series of posts by Jason Fry on the StarWars.com blog.
