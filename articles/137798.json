After a conversation with the spirit of the long dead Sith Lord, he correctly decided which sword was the correct one. After doing this, Revan showed Pall the way back to the light side, finally calming his tortured soul. Before leaving, however, Pall warned Revan about the corruption within the sword. He told Revan that if he was wise, he would not keep the sword, in order to avoid a similar fate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Revan and his companions left the tomb, they were accosted by another Sith hopeful, Shaardan. He had planned to let someone else reach the sword after going through the deadly traps, and then purloin the sword for himself.

Revan returned the blade to Uthar Wynn, and upon recounting the events of the brief skirmish with his rival, he gained quite a bit of prestige in the eyes of the Sith Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Meetra Surik arrived on Korriban five years later, Kreia retold Revan's tale to Surik.
