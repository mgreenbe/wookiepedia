A significant drawback to any jammer was that while it concealed a ships's exact position in space, the jammer also emitted energy that effectively broadcast the ship's general location to other vessel's sensors. To get around this, Han Solo linked one of these devices to a 29L electromagnetic countermeasures package on the Millennium Falcon, to expand and scatter the jammer's broadcast, making it more difficult for enemy ships to pinpoint the Falcon's position. The first time it was used, it generated such a powerful pulse that it jammed the Falcon's own internal communications."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
