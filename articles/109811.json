The creature could penetrate the surface of an enemy ship or space station and suck out all beings aboard. Alternatively, this dread weapon could be used to puncture a planetary surface, as on Helska IV when the first Yuuzhan Vong worldship landed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
