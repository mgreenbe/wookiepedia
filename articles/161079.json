The Empire briefly invaded Vilosoria, establishing a garrison of troops on the planet, with support provided by the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Fireclaw. Prior to the Battle of Yavin, R2z-DL, an R2z Starship Maintenance Droid working as an agent of the Rebel Alliance, intercepted information on the Imperial supply lines in Lifh sector, along with the Fireclaw's patrol routes and maintenance record. R2z-DL passed this information on to Rebel agent Koedi Raef, together with information on the seasonal cycles of the Vilosorians. With that information, Raef coordinated a delay in the Fireclaw's arrival to the Vilosoria system with that of the planet's warm season.
