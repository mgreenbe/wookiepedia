Due to the heavy volcanic activity and evershifting landmasses, the wreck was buried underneath layers of lava, rock and ash."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thousands of years later, a huge earthquake brought the remains of the cruiser back to light. It was the time of the Clone Wars and the planet was under the control of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. When the wreck was discovered, the Neimoidians immediately closely examined it. They were very protective of the crash site and did not allow any Mustafarian engineers the chance to examine the wreckage. No records of the crash were found aboard the ship and no engineer who had examined it could explain why it crashed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the wreckage, the Neimoidians found the deactivated body of an very old assassin droid. When they reactivated the droid, it went on a rampage, killing several Neimoidians and the battle droids that were supposed to protect them. The droid turned out to be none other than HK-47, a rogue assassin droid that had once served Revan and Meetra Surik thousands of years earlier. The Separatist experts were amazed by the technology used in this droid, but were unable to perform a memory wipe due to its incomprehensible thought matrix. As a solution, the engineers transferred HK-47's memory and thought patterns into a functioning sub-system of the crashed cruiser and took the empty chassis with them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Separatist scientists studied HK-47's body, the droid's AI managed to meld with the ship and took over its operational systems, forcing the scientists to seal up the ship and disconnect the uplink to the droid factory. The cruiser was left abandonded, leaving valuable salvage behind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of the Galactic Civil War, a gang of Salvage bandits had moved onto the site to claim any valuable piece of technology for their own. They were very intent upon keeping everyone else away from their prize. More than 20 years after the defeat of the Separatists, circa 1.5 ABY, HK-47 used the systems in the Hammerhead-class cruiser and contacted a group of spacers. HK-47 instructed the spacers to aid in transferring his artificial intelligence from the ship to an abandoned research facility nearby."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The wreckage of this ship appeared in Trials of Obi-Wan, the third expansion for Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to the games closure on December 15, 2011. It could be found on the central island near the Central volcano and was surrounded by many Salvage Bandits. It was part of a quest surrounding the assassin droid HK-47. During this quest, the player entered the ship and accessed the ship's computers to talk to HK-47 and transfer him to the droid factory where he was eventually reunited with his body."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
