The marmaw was a huge-mouthed shore dweller, with teeth that formed in 20 to 30 bud rows throughout its mouth and throat and developed as they migrated toward the edge of its mouth. Outer marmaw teeth were frequently lost, and were quickly replaced by teeth growing in behind them. The blade-shaped final teeth were large enough to grasp its prey, which included land and sea creatures. Marmaws had both lungs and gills, although they had to spend at least three hours per day in water to avoid dehydration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
