It was situated on a hyperspace route between the planets Batuu and Yakorki. Many individuals visited Umme to hunt, most of whom were able to afford their own safari guides who dealt with mobile accommodations, droid porters, game tracking, and field taxidermy; however, the planet offered its own guide services that provided big-game blasters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, Umme was included in the datafiles of the Separatist Alliance freighter Larkrer, along with other locations on the route between Batuu and the planet Cermau. Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Chiss Ascendancy Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo investigated the freighter's datafiles to find out the location of a Separatist base that the vessel had helping to supply, with Skywalker remarking that the descriptions of Umme and the other locations sounded like they were copied from a travel brochure. The planet was listed in the book Traveler's Guide to Batuu, written by the author and historian Eloc Throno, who recommended Umme as a possible destination from Batuu that could be reached in a short flight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Umme was first mentioned in the 2018 novel Thrawn: Alliances, written by Timothy Zahn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
