As part of his security preparations, Captain Quarsh Panaka of the Royal Naboo Security Forces had one installed in Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala's quarters. The first time the device activated, it was because Eirta\u00e9, one of Amidala's handmaidens, had pricked her finger with a sewing needle. The second time the device activated led to Panaka and his wife, Mariek, discovering that the Queen and most of her handmaidens had snuck out of Theed Royal Palace to attend a concert. Sach\u00e9, the youngest handmaiden, had stayed behind to sleep due to feeling unwell, and the alarm had activated because her first period had caused bleeding in the bed. Afterwards, Mariek demanded that Panaka remove the sensor, as a period-induced activation should have been expected given that the sensor had been installed in an apartment inhabited by teenage girls."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
