After Vader sensed that an archway was rigged with explosives, CC-4816 had several engineers in the unit sweep the area, eventually finding and disarming the explosives. However, they were then drenched with engine fuel by the entrance to The Lucky Twi'lek Hotel, which acted as makeshift floodgates, with Vader jumping to a nearby cliff for safety due to sensing the danger at the last second. He then tried to call a retreat, seeing the danger in remaining while the engine fuel remained, as well as calling in the Venator-class Star Destroyer Hound reporting the incident. However, before they could retreat, a flare was thrown out, causing a blaze and CC-4816's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
