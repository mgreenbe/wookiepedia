The original plan was for the troopers to be picked up by the enormous warship, the Eye of Palpatine; however, when the ship was sabotaged by Jedi intervention, the stormtroopers became stranded on Pzob. Over the years, most of the soldiers were killed by either skirmishes with the local Gamorrean clans or infighting. The sole survivor was Triv Pothman, who remained in the ruined base until 12 ABY, when the reactivated Eye of Palpatine retrieved him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
