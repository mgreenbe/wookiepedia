They looted the artificial world the Xaxax had created, stealing all they could. The Guardians also split up the power core of the Xaxax's space station, using one of the pieces to power their largest ship. They used the space station as a center of study, as well as a vault to keep their stolen artifacts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A small number of Guardians secretly rebelled against the organization's greed, wishing it would go back to its founding ideals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
