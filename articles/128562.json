As Sise's right-hand man, Sonko was assigned to a transport raid but botched it. He was imprisoned on the planet Umax but later freed by his father, only to be locked up in the dungeons of Sise Fromm's own palace on Annoo so that Sise could hear him wail in agony. Sonko's fate became widely known as a tale of Sise Fromm's temper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The existence of an elder brother to Tig Fromm was first implied in text written on a collector's coin that came packaged with Kenner Toys' 1985 Tig Fromm action figure: \"TIG FROMM is the younger son of SISE FROMM.\" The tale of Sonko Fromm and his imprisonment on Umax were soon afterward told in a children's book, simply titled Droids, that was published by Plaza Joven and released exclusively in Spain. After the book was discovered by author Abel G. Pe\u00f1a, he brought the tale into Star Wars Legends in a StarWars.com blog entry entitled \"The Droids Re-Animated.\" He was glad to be able to combine it with the Kenner reference and add credibility to the ruthlessness of Sise Fromm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
