In the ensuing skirmish, Paataatus warships aimed their spectrum lasers at the ships of Thrawn's Picket Force Six. However, the Paataatus forces' spectrum lasers were configured to deal no damage, even though spectrum lasers were designed to shift their energy frequencies to maximize damage to whatever material they were targeted on. This led Thrawn to discover the Paataatus were subjugated to remnants of the Nikardun Destiny's military. Thrawn's first officer Mid Captain Ufsa'mak'ro remarked that the Paataatus were putting on a \"light show\" rather than attacking the Chiss. The Prince Militaire of the Hiveborn was in fact covertly requesting Thrawn's help to free his people from the Nikardun. In the ensuing skirmish above Nettehi, Thrawn targeted Nikardun blockade frigates effectively holding Nettehi hostage, and the Paataatus leader thanked Thrawn for his assistance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Watith Captain Fsir later used the tactic by having his own remotely-piloted gunboats attack his freighter during a skirmish meant to lead Thrawn to believe they were under attack by Vagaari pirates. Thrawn captured and appropriated the Watith gunboats and the Saltbarrel, which he would in turn use for a light show of his own. At the Skirmish above Hoxim, Thrawn sought to foil a scheme to draw the Ascendancy into a civil war. There, Thrawn had members of three Great Families target their family fleets' warships with \"maximum ferocity but minimal actual damage\" using the remote-controlled ships he had claimed from the treacherous Watith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Light shows first appeared as a naval tactic in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good by Timothy Zahn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
