The SEPI framework was developed by members of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, who drew from centuries of bounty hunting experience when formulating the principle, and the SEPI approach was outlined with the Bounty Hunters Guild Handbook, in a chapter written by the veteran hunter Ro-San Borokki. The principle stressed that there were four stages to a successful hunt: selection, evaluation, preparation and implementation, directing bounty hunters to only pursue suitable targets, seek sufficient information to perform a proper evaluation of their target's situation, apply proper planning as to the method of capture of the target, then apply sufficient resources when ultimately attempting to take down the target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
