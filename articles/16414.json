Their notable traits were being more aggressive, violent and vicious to the point that they actively targeted armed convoys in order to feast on organic sentients or infect them with the rakghoul plague."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their existence came to light to the Sith Empire when researcher Eton Vok observed their activities while studying rakghoul migration patterns and behavior.
