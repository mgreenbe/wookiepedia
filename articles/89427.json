It was published on the Wizards of the Coast website on June 17, 2004 and took the form of a broadcast by Thurm Loogg of the Metatheran Cartel to every home in the Cularin system. While his speech ranged over a number of occurrences in the system in the preceding three years, Loogg concluded by saying that the Cartel would not help the Cularin people in their war against the Navy of Thaere. While this was worded as a compliment as to their ability to defend themselves, Loogg made numerous threats and insinuations as to the strength of the Cularin resistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
