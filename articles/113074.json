The post-nova star transmitted radiation which transmuted materials within the broken planets that formed the building blocks of hypermatter. During the final days of the Galactic Republic, stations operated by skeleton crews collected these materials using scavenging drones.

The raid lured in the support of an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser which forced the rebels to hasten their withdrawal from the heavy freighter.
