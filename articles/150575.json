Like Troigs, they were one of the few lifeforms found in the Core Worlds with two brains. Multiple species existed, having adapted to numerous environments, from dry land to ocean depths. Like many reptiles, their lifespans could span over a century. While they lacked natural predators, they were a favored food of the sapient locals, and were vulnerable to hunting, since they were slow and traveled in large groups that made them easy to find, yet lacked the aggression to defend themselves to any great extent. Governmental attempts to outlaw their slaughter did not meet with success."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
