The Blessing was one of the ways Voss were able to hold at bay the darkness of the Nightmare Lands, the other was the ritual of Ki-Da. The Emperor's Voice received the blessing before entering the Dark Heart, of which the hermit Madaga-Ru was aware. Around 3640 BBY Madaga-Ru sent the Emperor's Wrath to Mystic Vana-Xo so that she could bestow the Blessing of Oneness upon the Sith as well. Vana-Xo tried to ask the Sith for a measure of the life force that could be used to heal the injured. The Wrath refused the offer, but received the Blessing nonetheless and was able to go into Oneness in the Dark Heart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
