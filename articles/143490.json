The once self-contained world has long since been co-opted by unscrupulous offworlders, whose plunder of a vital natural resource has enabled the rise of a powerful corporation that controls the economy. Ord Cestus's native population, the X'Ting, are now mere second-class citizens in their own society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Enter the Jedi Knight, with news that a legal technicality has turned the tables\u2014and the corrupt forces with a stranglehold on Ord Cestus are now at the mercy of the X'Ting.
