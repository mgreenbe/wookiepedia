Following Palpatine's reorganization of the Republic into the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, Aloo continued to serve the new Emperor as his senior political advisor in the Emperor's Inner Circle for the duration of the Imperial era.

Within the throne room, Aloo and fellow Inner Circle member Janus Greejatus met with the Emperor, a conference briefly interrupted by the Sith Lord Darth Vader and Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod, commander of the Death Star. Plotting to destroy the Rebel Alliance, Palpatine leaked the information of his own presence aboard the battlestation to the Alliance as bait, drawing them into a trap. The Alliance launched a full-scale attack on the construction site, but, contrary to Palpatine's expectations of an easy Imperial victory, the battle culminated with the destruction of the battlestation and Aloo's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Republic bureaucrat"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sim Aloo was a Force-sensitive Human male from Coruscant, the capital planet of the Galactic Republic. Before the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, he came to be an ally of Naboo Senator Palpatine, who was secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Aloo continued to serve as an advisor to Palpatine upon the latter's ascension to the position of Supreme Chancellor, becoming one of the many beings comprising the Office of the Supreme Chancellor. In 19 BBY, Aloo was present among other consultants, including fellow advisors Janus Greejatus and Sate Pestage, in a meeting with the Chancellor. Together, they held up a group of delegates from the Loyalist Committee\u2014led by Senators Bail Organa of Alderaan, Mon Mothma of Chandrila, and Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo\u2014who had previously scheduled an appointment with Palpatine.

The transition had little effect on Aloo, who remained as an advisor in Palpatine's Inner Circle, a group of ministers and governors who had secured Palpatine's favor. Aloo was one of a select group of consultants who were allowed to privately discuss matters with the Emperor. Noted for his wisdom and patience, he became the Emperor's senior political advisor and served on the Imperial Security Council. At one point, Aloo and Greejatus were featured in an advertisement for BlasTech Industries' latest blaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aloo and his fellow dignitaries held considerable power within the command structure of the Empire. They were loyal to the Emperor, but the collective group of advisors, hundreds in all, was internally divided. The Emperor promoted this competition and managed to control the members of his inner circle through a web of fear and uncertainty. To further divide the advisors, the Emperor deliberately only met with up to a dozen at a time. Aloo, as the Emperor's senior political consultant, was one of the select few advisors who continually met with Palpatine, making lesser individuals feel insecure. Additionally, he was one of many Inner Circle members to receive training in the ways of the dark side of the Force as Palpatine's Dark Side Adepts; the Emperor planned to replace the various Moffs and governors with the Adepts as he consolidated his control over the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, as the second Death Star neared completion above the Forest Moon of Endor, Palpatine journeyed to the battlestation as part of an elaborate ploy to destroy the Rebel Alliance. Aloo and a cadre of advisors accompanied the Emperor on this trip. Upon their arrival in one of the Death Star's massive hangars, they were greeted by an assemblage of Imperial personnel and soldiers as they disembarked from the Emperor's shuttle.

Upon Vader's arrival, the dignitaries watched silently as the Sith Lord disembarked from the turbolift. Vader made no effort to acknowledge either Aloo or Greejatus, ignoring them as he moved to discuss matters with his master. During the meeting, the Emperor instructed Vader to move the Imperial Fleet to the far side of Endor, where it would remain until the Rebels launched their attack. Though Vader voiced his concerns of the Rebel Fleet massing near the planet Sullust, the Emperor shrugged them off, confident that his trap would successfully see the end of the Rebellion. Vader and Jerjerrod departed, leaving the Emperor and his two advisors to resume their interrupted gathering. The Alliance soon launched its assault, but the Battle of Endor ended differently than the Emperor had planned. In the end, Vader, redeemed by his son, Luke Skywalker, killed Palpatine, and the Alliance destroyed the Death Star.

Aloo wore lavish clothing, including Coruscanti headwear, that was representative of his homeworld's history.
