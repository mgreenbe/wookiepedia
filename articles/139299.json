After her husband was killed during a fight against the Gormaks, Tala-Reh swore to avenge him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3640 BBY, she encountered the Hero of Tython when he arrived on Voss to stop Sith Lord Fulminiss' plan to destroy the planet. After Tala-Reh explained that she was in search of the Mystic Valen-Da, who had left the Shrine of Healing to follow Fulminiss, the Hero suggested they team up to stop Fulminiss. Tala-Reh was hesitant to ally with the Jedi, fearing that harm would come to Valen-Da as a result. But before either of them could react, they were attacked by a trio of Sith apprentices, apparently driven mad. After killing their attackers, Tala-Reh finds a holorecorder on one of the bodies, revealing that Fulminiss created a madness plague on his own apprentices. Tala-Reh then told the Jedi to meet her at the Pilgrim Retreat, a supply camp nearby, so that they could continue their search in earnest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later meeting at the camp, Tala-Reh told the Hero that she could not enter the Shrine of Healing. The Hero later returned, explaining that Fulminiss had corrupted a Voss healing ritual to intensify his madness plague. He then passed Tala-Reh a holocommunicator left by Valen-Da that would only work for her. The message explained that Fulminiss was going to the Dark Heart in the Nightmare Lands and he wanted both the Hero and Tala-Reh to find him. The problem for the duo was that the only existing maps of the Nightmare Lands were in Gormak hands. Thus, the Hero went to Gorma-Koss to retrieve the maps before rendezvousing with Tala-Reh in the Nightmare Lands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hero and Tala-Reh fought their way into the Dark Heart, where they confronted Fulminiss and killed him in battle. As the dust settled, Valen-Da explained his reasons for accompanying Fulminiss: to bring Tala-Reh to the Dark Heart. He explained that he had a vision where Tala-Reh would sacrifice herself to destroy the dark side entity called Sel-Makor, thus ending the war with the Gormak and ensuring an era of peace on Voss. However, Sel-Makor raged, refusing to die. He tried to bribe the Hero with promises of power if the Jedi threw Valen-Da into his maw. The Hero refused as Tala-Reh descended into the steps of the maw and vanished in a golden white light, destroying Sel-Makor forever. Saddened by her loss, the Hero made Valen-Da promise to ensure that Tala-Reh's sacrifice would not be forgotten."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the player is male, it's possible to start a love story with Tala-Reh.
