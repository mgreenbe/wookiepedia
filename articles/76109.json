It was the largest city on the planet, containing over half a million people. It was also the location of an astrocartographic research station that was connected to the city by a skyhook. The station was devoted to exploring Wild Space, but had slowly become obsolete as other stations had been built further from its location. Academics who did not want to fight over the use of the newer stations would sometimes come to Kikorie Port to use their telescopes instead. During the search for the Alsakan Tessent, Dr. Follnor Callat set up shop at the Lon Heights, the academic center of the city, using it as a staging point to search the wreckage of Ast Kikorie Station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
