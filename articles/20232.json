The maneuver was utilized as soon as the pilot detected an enemy starfighter bearing down upon them, and consisted of a sharp turn taken in the direction of the incoming attack run. Ideally, this would then cause the enemy fighter to overshoot, thus putting them out of position for an effective follow-through."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, there was still the possibility of the enemy achieving a snap shot\u2014a shot taken in haste as a target passed quickly by one's front. There were other dangers, too, as the breaking craft could, in executing the maneuver, inadvertently put themselves into the sights of the attacking starfighter's wingmate; in addition, breaking too soon or too late also put the pilot at greater risk of being shot down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
