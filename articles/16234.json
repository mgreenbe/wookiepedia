He excelled in every goal he set for himself and was known for being a likeable sportsman who \"always got the girl\". Almost immediately, his superiors considered him for officer material, but Academy protocols required that he served a tour of duty in the stormtrooper corps. It was only a matter of time before Bens would be considered for enlistment as a member of the Emperor's Royal Guard. Bens didn't live long enough to receive such a recommendation, however. In 3 ABY, Princess Leia Organa led a Rebel attack on Golrath Station and incapacitated trooper Figgs. He was present inside the facility when the entire plant exploded as the result of a power core breach."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
