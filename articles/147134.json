Taking the rank of General within the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, Skorr was seduced to the dark side of the Force early in the conflict and he joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, becoming one of Count Dooku's Dark Acolytes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early Life and Seduction to the Dark Side"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Discovered to be Force-sensitive at an early age, Tol Skorr was delivered to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for training in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. Passing through the Temple's academy, Skorr went on to complete formal training when he succeeded in his Trials of Knighthood and was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council. Beginning his independent studies, Skorr was sent on missions by the High Council and became a good lightsaber duelist. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems in 22 BBY, Jedi Skorr reported to Coruscant where he received the rank of General within the newly created Grand Army of the Republic. On an early mission, Jedi Skorr was sent to track a band of pirates over Korriban. His starfighter was shot down in a dogfight and the man was nearly killed by a Tuk'ata. As Skorr lay injured, he was rescued by Confederacy leader Count Dooku; to whom Skorr pledged his life. Seduced to the dark side of the Force by Dooku, who was in fact the elusive Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Tyranus, Skorr abandoned the Jedi Order and his role in the war, becoming one of Dooku's deputies alongside fellow fallen Jedi Kadrian Sey and Sora Bulq. Constructing a red-bladed lightsaber, Skorr's new allegiance was made known to the High Council. Rivaling Sey as Dooku's most favored, the two joined together to attack Quinlan Vos, a seemingly turncoat Jedi who wished to join Dooku's army. Engaging Vos, the two Acolytes were soundly defeated and Sora Bulq escorted Vos into the Count's chambers. Shortly after Vos was admitted into Dooku's retinue of Dark Acolytes, the group traveled to Tibrin to overthrow the pro-Republic dictator and take the planet for the Confederacy. Standing by Dooku's side, Skorr watched in silence as the planet's ruler, Suribran Tu, was decapitated by the Sith Lord's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dark Acolyte of the Confederacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon thereafter, the group ventured to Kiffu where Dooku confronted Sheyf Tint\u00e9 Vos within her palace. When Dooku announced his intentions to depose the Sheyf, she ordered her guards to capture or kill the assassins. Skorr engaged the Guardians along with the others, slaying them one by one as they attacked in force. Competing with Sey to reach the Sheyf first, Vos leaped over both and abducted the old ruler. Slaying Sey on his way out of the chamber, Dooku ordered Skorr to remain to kill the rest of the Guardians while he found Vos. Quickly departing Kiffu once the Sheyf was murdered, Dooku sent Skorr and Vos on a mission to Korriban to fuel the competition between the two. Ordered to retrieve the Holocron of Heresies, the ancient holocron of Darth Andeddu, the pair set out to scour the tombs of the ancient Sith Lords. Lying in wait as Vos retrieved the artifact, Skorr challenged the Kiffar for possession of the ancient data crystal. Dueling briefly with Vos, Skorr came face-to-face once more with the Tuk'ata that had scarred his face when he first crashed on Korriban. Escaping together, Skorr fell short as he leaped for Dooku's shuttle; however the Count rescued him with the Force. Journeying to Dooku's base of operations on Bakura and then to Coruscant, Skorr waited with Dooku in The Works district as Vos assassinated Senator Viento on behalf of the Confederacy. After receiving Vos' report, Dooku and Skorr departed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hunting Quinlan Vos"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fourteen months later, Dooku was displeased with Vos' repeated failures and assigned Skorr to partner with Sith assassin Asajj Ventress to kill the Kiffar Dark Acolyte. Tracking Vos, the pair managed to trap him aboard the ruined Intergalactic Zoological Society's ship, the Titavian IV and pitted him against several deadly droids. When Vos managed to activate his beacon transceiver, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi located the ship and helped Vos counter the droids. When Ventress' Morp droids led the two Jedi into Skorr's trap, the Nightsister attacked Kenobi while Skorr beat Vos in hand to hand combat. Distracted by a rancor released by Kenobi, the Jedi were able to flee to the hangar deck where Vos boarded the Skorp-Ion. As Ventress and Kenobi fought, Skorr piloted a starfighter to chase Vos but was ultimately gunned down inside the hangar. Surviving the wreck, Ventress and Skorr regrouped as the Jedi escaped. When General Grievous answered the Dark Jedi's distress beacon, Ventress ordered Skorr to go with the cyborg and report to Dooku while she dealt with unfinished business between Kenobi and Vos."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Final battle and death at the hands of Quinlan Vos"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the end of the war, Skorr accompanied Dooku to the world of Saleucami to oversee the development of a Morgukai Shadow Army by the Anzat Rath Kelkko. As the Confederacy began to lay siege to the planet, Skorr went into the seedy regions of the world to meet with Khaleen Hentz, Vos' lover. Threatening her by strangling her with the Force briefly, Skorr attempted to create a schism between Hentz and Vos, in order to cause his long time rival to make mistakes. Leading Morgukai in battle against the Republic, Skorr encountered Vos on the battlefield and engaged him, leading him deep into a cave. Once out of sight from the battling armies, the two disengaged each other and met with Dooku and Bulq in the underground labs of the Anzati. While Dooku assigned Vos to hunt down Jedi Master Tholme who had successfully sabotaged parts of the Morgukai project, Skorr continued his role as leader of the armies on the surface. Operating under the call name Red Tide, Skorr was instrumental in giving the all clear to Master Bulq to continue with his plan to assassinate Jedi Master Oppo Rancisis, leader of the Republic's war effort on the planet. As Bulq murdered Rancisis, Skorr engaged Jedi K'Kruhk, Sian Jeisel, and A'Sharad Hett in battle to arouse suspicion that Vos had killed the Thisspiasian Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the battle continued, Vos reported to Dooku the death of Tholme, which Vos believed he had caused. Dooku decided to test Vos' allegiance once more by asking him to kill Khaleen Hentz, who Skorr had recovered from the surface and dragged down into the underground facility. Refusing to kill the woman, Vos disavowed any feigned allegiance to Dooku and attacked Bulq, Skorr, and the Morgukai guards. Joined by Tholme, who indeed had survived the early duel with Vos, the Kiffar Jedi engaged Skorr one-on-one and battled each other into a chamber overlooking a lava pit. As Skorr taunted Vos and his belief in the so-called \"Second Sith,\" a being Skorr claimed Dooku made up to control Vos, the Jedi became more and more enraged, knocking the lightsaber out of Skorr's hand. As Skorr stood defeated on the cliff reaching over the lava pit, Vos shoved the Dark Acolyte over the edge, where he plummeted to his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While trained as a Jedi, Tol Skorr was quick to forsake his oaths to the Jedi Order when Count Dooku rescued him from Korriban early during the Clone Wars. Displaying an extreme sense of loyalty to the Count, Skorr was willing to unquestionably follow the Sith Lord's orders without hesitation. Constantly plying for Dooku's affection, Skorr eagerly played into Dooku's plot to keep his acolytes fighting each other; secretly pitting Skorr against first Kadrian Sey, then Quinlan Vos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trained as a Jedi Knight, Tol Skorr demonstrated all of the Force techniques and skills with a lightsaber that all Jedi would have possessed. Having fallen to the dark side, Skorr had been taught certain forbidden techniques by Count Dooku, including a form of telekinesis known as a Force Choke. While a competent lightsaber duelist, Skorr was significantly less skilled than former Jedi lightsaber instructor Sora Bulq, or the Sith assassin Asajj Ventress. Skorr was able to survive two encounters with a Tuk'ata, an impressive feat, even for a trained Force-sensitive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While trained to pilot basic craft and starfighters, Skorr habitually showed weakness as a pilot, getting shot down over Korriban and in the hangar of the Titavian IV by pirates and Quinlan Vos respectively."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
