He challenged Corran to a fight but Ganner stood in front of him. However Mushkil, a Noghri, stood in front of Ganner and Krag Val killed him. Ganner tried to engage Krag Val and he cut him in the face with his Amphistaff leaving a scar. Jacen attacked him and managed to slash him across the chest and knee, disabling him until Corran arrived.
