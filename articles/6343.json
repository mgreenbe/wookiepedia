Under the leadership of the crystallographer Galen Erso, Uravan and his colleagues worked to turn kyber crystals into a viable energy source for the Death Star's superlaser, giving it the capability to destroy entire planets.

While on Eadu, Uravan's duties included overseeing the shipments of kyber crystal fragments from the Mid Rim moon Jedha. Using a phase-shifting grafting technique, he fused the fragments together synthetically, taking care to preserve their delicate qualities.

Uravan was terrified at the prospect of death when confronted by Krennic's death troopers and was relieved when Erso stepped in to save his team, though it proved a futile gesture.
