It saw the Galactic Alliance retake the vital Fondor Shipyards that had fallen into Yuuzhan Vong hands. In order to draw off Yuuzhan Vong reinforcements from Fondor, the Alliance staged a decoy attack on Duro at the same time. The commander at Duro requested reinforcements from the Fondor commander, Zhat Lah, who complied, leaving his station relatively undefended. When he saw the ruse, Lah attempt to recall his fleet from Duro, but was incapable due to the Alliance interdictors. When the situation became hopeless, Lah recalled the remainder of his forces: two ro'ik chuun m'arh and a miid ro'ik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although it served its objectives, and the Alliance took Fondor, the move was extremely opposed by Duros soldiers and civilians afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
