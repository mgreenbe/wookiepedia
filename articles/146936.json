However, Leia demanded to talk to Dengar, and the plan was thwarted. Tobbi was imprisoned by the Suprema, Ampotem Za, who displayed his Mandalorian armor in a trophy case. He was later freed by Fenn Shysa and Leia Organa, but was shot in the chest during their escape by Za. Despite being fatally wounded, Tobbi managed to grab Za's weapon, allowing the others to escape the slavers' office."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the ensuing chase, Tobbi managed to close the base's blast doors as a group of airspeeders launched to chase after Shysa and Organa.
