That year, during which the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems raged, the attack was recalled by Republic Senator Lott Dod of the Trade Federation in a meeting with fellow senators Nix Card and Gume Saam."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The senators hoped to trigger a vote in the Galactic Senate for the deregulation of banks to earn money for the Federation and the Banking Clan. When Card suggested that an attack closer to home could change the minds of some senators to vote for deregulation, Dod realized he was referring to an attack on Coruscant, and responded that Coruscant had not been attacked in over a millennium. Card insisted that fact gave Coruscant's inhabitants a false confidence in their safety and, with Separatist aid, the group went on to successfully orchestrate a bombing that ensured the Senate voted for deregulation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on Coruscant was alluded to in \"Heroes on Both Sides,\" the tenth episode of the third season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars.
