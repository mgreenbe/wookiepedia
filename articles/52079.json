Gnost-Dural was asked by the Council to trace the conflict between the Sith and the Jedi Order to shed some light on the origins of the war between the resurgent Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. The Kel Dor recorded his findings in these logs, which could be accessed from the Jedi Archives. Gnost-Dural created nineteen recordings, dating from as far back as the first recorded discovery of the Force on Tython, up to the Treaty of Coruscant itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
