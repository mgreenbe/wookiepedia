An Imperial unit under the command of Nahdonnis Praji, a Human officer of the Empire, participated in the subjugation of Almak's native sentient species, the Leffingites. The Imperials used All Terrain walkers to great effect during the battle and were able to defeat the Leffingite resistance. Praji viewed the walkers as brutish and without grace but nonetheless found them effective in the battle. In 104 ABY, the historian Dr. Gabrel Treon mentioned the battle in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji: A Cartel of Genes, an article he wrote about the House Praji family, which he published in the Byblos Journal of Historical Science."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first and only mention of the Battle of Almak was in Nathan O'Keefe's Hyperspace-exclusive in-universe history article titled Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji, which was published on February 5, 2009."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
