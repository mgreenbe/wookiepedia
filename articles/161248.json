During the Clone Wars, the Vipers fought for the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the end of the conflict they were stranded on the planet Cato Neimoidia. To avoid arrest by the Galactic Empire, the Vipers went into hiding and reformed theemselves into a swoop gang, and they seized control of the streets of the city Zarra. Unknown to the rest of the gang, Kessra also began working for the Hutt crime lord Darga Jiramma Mionne and she used the gang as a means by which to achieve Darga's goals in Zarra. In about 17 BBY, a group of Alderaanian Resistance agents traveled to Zarra and the Vipers subsequently surrounded the agents starship, the Baudo-class star yacht Banshee, and claimed that the agents had not paid the Vipers a landing fee and thus each owed the gang 1,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
