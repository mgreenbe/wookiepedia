A large task force was sent to destroy the base, with V-19 Torrent starfighters of the Gold Squadron, Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptors of Jedi Master Plo Koon and Saesee Tiin and Skywalker's Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor prototype occupying attention of the enemy starfighters, while Venator-class Star Destroyers bombarded the station. During the battle the Valahari activated a transmission which replicated a nesting neebray brood mother. This led the local neebrays to attack the Republic forces. However, the BTL-B Y-wing starfighters of the Shadow Squadron managed to destroy the station and thus disable the transmission. The leader of the Tofen's Raiders Tofen Vane was killed in a dogfight against Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
