Rather than developing new and potentially illegal weaponry for use on the Virago, the MandalMotors design team focused their energies on making existing weapon systems more effective. Their final design combined the very advanced St2x with an experimental laser sighting system. Once installed, the package was capable of providing targeting information to the pilot even while undergoing complex maneuvers. The system was so advanced that virtually any weapon systems installed on the Virago would perform at levels far higher than their manufacturer's specifications."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
