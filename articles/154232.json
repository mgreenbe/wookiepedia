When CT-9904's elite squad hunted down and destroyed the Partisans camp, he asked the refugees for information. The refugee told him he that he had no information. Before CT-9904 could execute the refugees, ES-01 stopped him from doing so. After CT-9904 killed ES-01, he ordered the other soldiers from the squad to execute the refugees. They complied, executing the Onderonian refugee and all the others."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
