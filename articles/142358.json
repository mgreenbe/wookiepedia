Situated inside a mountain, it survived the Great Cleansing. It beamed a signal to the Deathmoon base three times a day which was a \"doomsday clock\" countdown to launch hundreds of atomic missiles. The shaman of the Roh tribe traveled to the installation every six month to reset the countdown through a ceremonial procedure of pushing buttons and pulling levers, although they had no idea what they were actually doing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
