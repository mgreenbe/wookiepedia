The bipedal beasts stood over two meters in height with shaggy white fur constantly stained with the gore of slaughtered prey. Wampas were armed with jagged yellow teeth and deadly claws. Primarily solitary hunters, wampas occasionally hunted in packs, preferring to ambush their prey from the camouflage of Hoth's snow banks and blizzards. Stunned victims were carried back to the creatures' lairs, typically large ice caves, where the wampas ate at their leisure. The planet's omnivorous tauntauns formed the bulk of the wampas' prey, although they would attack anything they encountered. The Alliance to Restore the Republic's Echo Base on Hoth came under constant wampa assaults in 3 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While rarely seen away from their remote homeworld, wampas were known to have participated in illegal gladiatorial combat venues. They were highly valued among big-game hunters for the challenge that came with hunting the creatures, as well as for their pelts, stuffed heads, and other miscellaneous souvenirs that commanded high prices on the black market. Wampas were later protected under legislation to prevent endangered species from falling into extinction by the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Covered with shaggy white fur, standing at heights of up to three meters, and weighing an average of 150 kilograms, Hoth's wampa ice creatures were lethal predatory beasts. They possessed long, powerful arms, razor-sharp claws capable of carving layers out of ice, and a fanged maw. Aided by an acute sense of smell and a well-camouflaged coat of thick fur, the carnivorous wampas roamed Hoth's icy plains preying on near-helpless animals. Wampas ranged in height from 2.2 to three meters, with an average height of 2.5 meters, weighed up to and occasionally exceeding 200 kilograms, and had eerie yellow eyes. Adult wampas possessed short, jagged, curving horns, which were an indication of age. The horns began to appear at the onset of puberty and continued to grow larger as the wampa aged. Wampas' horns were similar to those of Hoth's native tauntauns, though the two species were entirely unrelated. Wampas had a single heart within their thoracic cavity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wampas were classified officially as reptomammals, creatures combining the best defensive characteristics of reptiles with the more adaptable physiologies of mammals\u2014specifically, they were linked to primates. The species shared multiple physiological traits with the similarly named trompa, and most xeno-biologists speculated the two species were cousins. The wampa physiology was well adapted to conserving heat in the extreme cold. Beneath their protective fur was a layer of blubber for greater insulation. They were also physiologically equipped with a self-regulating metabolism. Wampas comprised 11 percent of Hoth's total indigenous animal population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The wampa reigned at the top of the Hoth food chain as the planet's most violent alpha predator. With their strong sense of smell, coat of thick white fur, which blended in perfectly with the icy landscape of Hoth, and brute strength, wampas made excellent natural hunters. A single powerful blow from a wampa's forearm was enough to neutralize the largest prey, while the creature's bite was deadly. Very rarely were wampas themselves the victims of predators\u2014in fact, the creatures had no natural enemies except for other wampas. Wampas typically traveled on two or four legs, preferring four except during an attack. The creatures stalked their prey until reaching close enough proximity to make a rush attack. A wampa would take a final sighting of its target by rising on its hind legs and then springing forward in a deadly pounce with claws outstretched, though it could only swing one claw at a time due to their massive size."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In terms of the creature's diet, wampas subsisted primarily on Hoth's many varieties of omnivorous tauntauns, although they also hunted lumbering icetromper herd beasts, antlered mammals called rayboo, and other, smaller unwary creatures\u2014as well as attacking anyone or anything else they encountered that might seem to be a source of food if particularly hungry. The powerful wampa required large amounts of food to sustain itself, and a single tauntaun was enough to nourish one wampa for a considerable period. Wampa family groups, in particular, required a substantial supply of meat, since a female wampa could birth up to three cubs at once. However, the competition among wampas for Hoth's relatively small number of prey animals formed a limit to the numbers of the creatures existing on Hoth, keeping the wampa relatively scarce."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wampas were particularly sensitive to high-pitched noises, sounds that were similar to those made by a female in search of a mate. While wampas were naturally well-insulated against the Hoth elements, as a result of their dense fur, they were made almost invisible to most standard life-form sensor scans, which is how they managed to avoid detection by Republic xeno-biologists for so long."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wampas were even said to possess, at least in one case, the capacity to retain long-term memory. During the Rebel Alliance occupation of Hoth during the Galactic Civil War, Jedi Luke Skywalker was attacked by a wampa while patrolling the planet's ice wastes, but he escaped the creature's clutches after slicing off its arm with his lightsaber. Almost a decade later, during a return visit to Hoth, Skywalker re-encountered the same wampa whose arm he severed years before. Skywalker claimed that the one-armed beast remembered both him and his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One male wampa, named Ku-Kak, had a rare, natural affinity for the Force. Another, the giant wampa Unkajo, towered at a height much greater than the species' average height of 2.5 meters. Still another giant wampa creature, larger than ordinary wampas, lived on Hoth during the early portion of the Galactic Civil War. This giant wampa possessed a freezing breath as a natural weapon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Subspecies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Subspecies of wampa were found on other worlds, clearly transplanted there from Hoth, though scientists were unable to determine the exact method by which this occurred.

Though the exact nature of the swamp wampa's development was unclear, it nevertheless indicated a strong adaptability of the wampa species. There also existed Tatooine Howlers, colloquially named \"desert wampas\" for their strong resemblance to wampas. Although their appearance, with heavy fur and tusks, was similar, genetic testing proved no relation between the Howler and the wampa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior and intelligence"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hunting patterns and ice cave habitat"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wampas were typically solitary hunters. They wandered the frozen wastelands of Hoth in search of food, often stalking their prey for some time before finally taking the victim by stealth and surprise due to their natural white-fur camouflage. Wampas hunted both by day and, at shorter range, during Hoth's bitterly cold night. Although the tauntaun, a wampa's primary source of food, was relatively plentiful on Hoth, the scarcity of available wildlife on the planet meant that a single wampa had to cover a territory of more than a hundred kilometers when seeking prey. However, wampas learned to adapt to this necessity. They emitted a very faint scent, preventing tauntauns from detecting a wampa's approach. Their white fur, blending perfectly with their environment, enabled wampas to attack their prey without prior detection. As such, wampas rarely engaged in extended chases. Icetrompers, however, proved something of an exception\u2014their multiple set of eyes made sneaking up on the giant herd beasts a difficult proposition for even the stealthiest wampas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The comfort zone for a wampa seeking prey was limited to Hoth's frozen plains and the cooler regions of the planet's subterranean caves. Often, Hoth's scaly tauntauns would gather among warmer cave areas heated by bubbling pools as a defensive measure, areas that wampas found to be uncomfortably hot. Nevertheless, if hungry enough, wampas were known to ignore their extreme discomfort by venturing deep into these cave systems at night and during Hoth's blizzards. They would utilize cunning methods to draw the scaly tauntauns out of their sanctuaries, sometimes rushing into the heated areas to scare their prey out into the cold where they might be cornered. Other times, wampas would simply stalk their prey by waiting in the colder regions between these heated tunnels until the tauntauns ran from one tunnel to another."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wampas rarely killed their prey outright and never hunted when they were hungry. Because they preferred fresh meat, wampas instead always tried to stun their prey, keeping their victims unconscious, but alive, until ready to feed. After disabling their prey, wampas hauled the still-breathing victims back to their cave dwellings and, through different methods, secured them in the ice for later consumption. For some, wampas used their hot breath to melt the ice around a victim's legs and then coated parts of the body in saliva, placing them against the ice ceiling of their caves so they would freeze in place. The saliva also served as an anesthetic in the victims, which helped to keep prey comatose until the wampa was ready to eat. Alternatively, for larger creatures, such as the tauntaun, wampas frequently impaled them through the ankles on overhanging icicles or stalactites to keep them immobile. At times, several fresh victims were stored in this manner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hanging their still-living victims from the cave's ice ceiling allowed wampas to keep their food in good condition and then snack at their leisure\u2014tales existed of victims taking some days to die as the wampa slowly devoured them. This storage method also allowed wampas to return to the ice fields to continue hunting while the hostile Hoth weather held. Wampa lairs often housed huge amounts of food, a testament to how deadly a single beast could be."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The creatures typically made their homes in one or more ice caverns, created by digging out a huge lair beneath Hoth's ice surface large enough to nest and store food in. Still, wampas rarely wasted their own energy hollowing out their own caves. Instead, they usually found a pre-existing lair or former tauntaun-dug site to occupy, sometimes ejecting the original inhabitant. Wampas would also sometimes make enlargements to these caves, especially when raising young. Nesting wampas typically shed their guard fur, which was gathered and used to line their caverns with, though opinion was divided among zoologists whether this actually amounted to intelligent behavior or merely animal instinct. The dense guard fur lining made wampa caves almost invisible to standard scans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wampas, solitary by nature, were nomadic in the sense that they rarely stayed in one cave for very long, unless they were with young. They regularly relocated to new lairs both out of the need to follow migrating tauntaun herds, and of the necessity to find cleaner dwellings. Wampas, males in particular, were remarkably messy animals, and their caves were constantly scattered with half-eaten corpses, decomposing entrails, and other bloody, rotting remains. Even nursing females, aside from their fur-lined nests in which cubs were born, lived in gore-filled caves. This rotting mess quickly made wampa caves uninhabitable, forcing the creatures to find new abodes."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Reproduction method and societal characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wampas mated during the warmer months of the Hoth yearly cycle, during which time they gathered in regions where game was plentiful, to search for companionship. While the females remained together and waited, the males would go off in search of prey. After making a kill, the male wampa would commonly smear the blood of his victim across his chest and return with the dead animal to show the females, thus demonstrating his ability to care for a mate. Sometimes the males would spar with one another for a particular female's companionship. The winners of these bouts chose their preferred mates. They were then considered the alpha males of that region until the following mating season."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In terms of their reproduction methods, wampas could be considered marsupials. Their cubs were born live, but very underdeveloped, closely resembling a miniature worm small enough to fit on a caf spoon. After mating, female wampas would birth up to three cubs per litter. These infants, after birth, would crawl to their mothers' pouches, where they nursed, grew, and developed over a period of roughly three months\u2014after which time they left the pouch with a full set of teeth, needle-sharp claws, and an innate attitude of invincibility. Mothers would produce milk to nurse their young until the cubs were able to sustain themselves on meat alone. Wampa mothers were extremely protective of their offspring, and during the nursing period even males didn't risk the consequences of coming between a mother and her cubs. As they grew, young wampas were taught how to hunt, survive in the cold, and how to care for game from their mothers and fathers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wampas were extremely territorial creatures, fiercely guarding their hunting grounds against any invaders to their domain, and often engaging in bouts to the death with other wampas encroaching on their land. The scarcity of Hoth's wildlife meant that a single wampa required a large hunting ground in order to survive, which was believed to be the primary reason why the creatures lived alone or in small family-based groups. Because of the substantial amounts of food required to sustain a wampa, they often extended their territory over enormous areas. Upon reaching maturity, younger wampas set out to claim territory of their own, competing with other wampas, including members of their own family, for territorial control, which contributed to keeping the species relatively scarce."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the cutthroat intra-family competition that existed among wampas for territorial control, the creatures nevertheless possessed a strong affinity for kinship. Galactic scientists discovered that wampas were very protective of their own and mourned their dead with great intensity. In the instance one was slain, the creatures would fly into destructive rages directed at the killer. If the death was natural, wampas would instead vent their rage on their surroundings, sometimes smashing cave walls or ripping apart anyone or anything within reach. Reports told of some wampas, in their bouts of hysteria, unwittingly causing avalanches and underground cave-ins, causing only more deaths. When the grieving wampas' energy finally subsided, they would bury their dead in the snow, keeping guard over it for several days to make sure nothing ate the remains. If a wampa was injured, the rest of its pack would band together to repel the threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although they primarily hunted alone, some wampas occasionally hunted in packs, banding together to attack a threat to the local wampa community, such as a Human settlement. During the Cold War, for example, amidst the combined Galactic Republic\u2013Sith Empire occupation of Hoth, many wampas of all ages gathered in different series of subterranean ice caves. Many years later, during the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance occupation of Hoth drove many wampas to convene in and inhabit a large secluded valley surrounded by rocks and ice. The valley floor was littered with the remains of creatures who ventured into the wampas' home, never to escape. Outside of mating season, however, the detection of a common threat was the only time wampas grouped together. By coordinating their hunting actions, wampas demonstrated a rudimentary level of intelligence and cunning, particularly in the capability to scout and determine their enemies' location and strength before formulating an attack. The wampas' aptitude for massively coordinated attacks made the species one of the most cunning killers in the galaxy. However, despite wampas demonstrating some intelligence and social development, most respected scientists nevertheless doubted the species' sentience."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wampas were capable of emitting a terrifying hunting roar that could compete with Hoth's howling winds. Their howl was one of their greatest natural gifts, for it could blend in almost imperceptibly with the winds. Only the creatures themselves could tell the two sounds apart. Thus, the howl provided wampas with a highly efficient form of communication that often proved lethal to disoriented prey. In one unique instance, the Force-sensitive wampa Ku-Kak was trained to naturally understand the Chevin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Republic occupation of Hoth in the Cold War, a group of Talz established a supply cache in a large cave that many wampas had overrun.

Within the ice caverns, the wampas impede Starkiller's approach by hurling giant balls of ice at him, as well as delivering powerful blows with their claws. Starkiller must also battle his way through several more wampas within the interior of Echo Base itself, where the creatures find themselves the targets of the base's defending Rebel troops as well. The climax of the Echo Base level features a lightsaber duel between Starkiller and Luke Skywalker. At one point during the duel, Skywalker, having fallen to the ground, uses the Force to break open the sealed door to one of the base's wampa pens, unleashing three of the creatures on Starkiller as a quick diversion.
