A blockade of Carreras starfighters was set up on the orders of Darth Wredd, who was posing as the Imperial Knight Yalta Val and was attempting to prevent any departure or arrival into the Carreras system until the construction of the Carreras G51 communications array was complete.

Soon after, Imperial Knight Jao Assam was detained aboard the blockade on the Sith's orders, but he escaped to Carreras Minor after the Shifala tried to arrest him.

All save for Solo were severely injured, and she commandeered Assam's starfighter to follow Wredd to the planet Mala. There, she helped set Yalta Val free; she then returned to the array and rescued her friends in AG-37's freighter before the communications array crashed into Mala and was destroyed. On Mala's surface, Val dueled Wredd in a repeat of their last duel, but Wredd fled before the array could crash into them.

The new Galactic Empress Marasiah Fel embarked on an ambitious communications infrastructure project, known as the G51 communications array, to improve communications between the Outer Rim Territories and the rest of the galaxy. The remote Carreras system in the Outer Rim was selected as a location for one of the G51 communications array's component stations. In 138 ABY, Empress Fel dispatched the Imperial Knight Yalta Val on a mission to supervise the final stages of the Carreras communication array's construction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While traveling through the perilous Surd Nebula, Yalta Val's starship was ambushed and attacked by a Sith master and his apprentice Darth Wredd. Following the death of Darth Krayt, the One Sith had been driven underground but had regrouped with a new strategy of infiltrating all galactic governments and corporations to restore their \"golden age.\" During the ambush, Darth Wredd convinced his master to open fire on Yalta Val's starship, causing it to crash-land on the floating world of Mala. There, Yalta Val's crew and stormtroopers were killed by the Sith master. Before the Sith master could finish Val off, he was killed by his own apprentice Darth Wredd, who announced that his apprenticeship was over. He disarmed and took Yalta Val captive, impersonating the Imperial Knight and stealing his armor. Despite his success, Darth Wredd was unable to recover Val's lightsaber, which had been picked up and retrieved by his comm droid. The comm droid was later recovered by a young Human junk dealer named Ania Solo, a distant descendant of Han Solo, and her Mon Calamari friend Sauk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A week later, the Sith impostor Darth Wredd was picked by Governor Biala's security forces. Under the pretext that there was a Sith presence in the Carreras system, the false \"Yalta Val\" coerced Biala into handing over personal control of her security forces to him. In reality, Darth Wredd intended to recover Yalta Val's lightsaber. While combing through the streets of Carreras Major, the homeworld of the simian Shifala species, the Carreras security forces found that Yalta Val's lightsaber had fallen into the hands of Ania and Sauk. During the recovery attempt, Ania killed a Carreras security officer. She and Sauk then escaped in a speeder led the Carreras security forces on a pursuit, which killed four security officers. They then escaped to Ania Solo's junkyard on the moon of the backwater planet of Carreras Minor.

Their reunion was interrupted by the arrival of the false \"Yalta Val\" who demanded that Ania returned \"his\" lightsaber to him. Ania refused on the grounds that she had found it first and dispatched her security droid SD to deal with the intruder. However, the Sith impostor merely used the Force to levitate the lightsaber out of Ania's hands and slice SD across the torso. Whether out of blood lust or a desire to hide his tracks, Wredd then ordered his security guards to kill Ania and Sauk. Following a pursuit through the junkyard,the Carreras security guards were killed by AG-37, who opened fire on them with two blaster rifles. In response to the alleged threat of Ania, Darth Wredd took the opportunity to mobilize all of Governor Biala's troops for active duty and to impose a blockade of the Carreras system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ania and her companions fled aboard AG-37's freighter into space, bringing along the damaged comm droid.

After receiving no contact from Master Yalta Val, the Imperial Knight Jao Assam traveled to the Carreras system to investigate delays in the Carreras communications array project and to ascertain the whereabouts of Val. Upon arriving outside the Surd Nebula, Jao encountered a Shifala naval blockade. After narrowly escaping arrest at the hands of the Carreras security forces, Jao traced Val's comm droid's locator signal to Carreras Minor. There, he saved Ania and her companions from being devoured by a giant tentacled monster. After Ania, Jao, Sauk, and AG-37 learnt from the comm droid that Yalta Val had been replaced by a Sith impostor, the four companions agreed to join forces in order to rescue the Imperial Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jao and Ania's companions departed in AG-37's freighter for the dark planet of Mala, which was reported to be located in the heart of the Surd Nebula.

Meanwhile, relations between the false \"Yalta Val\" and Governor Biala deteriorated. Following delays in starting up the Carreras communications array, Yalta Val almost Force choked a Shifala engineer. However, the final straw came when the Sith impostor demanded the execution of Jao's companions. After monitoring a conversation between Jao and the Sith impostor, Governor Biala released Jao and his companions and sent them to stop the Sith impostor.

Knowing that he and his friends alone could not defeat a Sith without the aid of another Force-user, Jao advised sneaking back aboard AG-37's freighter and then tracking Yalta Val's location. However, Ania wanted to take out the Sith impostor once and for all. Against Jao's advice, she fired upon the thruster engine of Darth Wredd's shuttle, causing the starship to explode into flames. However, Darth Wredd survived the explosion due to his mastery of the Force and Force choked Ania. Jao, Sauk and AG-37 quickly came to rescue. However, Darth Wredd sliced AG-37 in half with his lightsaber and used the Force to knock Sauk unconscious. During a brief lightsaber duel, Jao managed to blind Wredd's right eye.

Meanwhile, Governor Biala gave orders for her subordinates to shut down the Carreras communications array.

During his broadcast, Darth Wredd presented the captive Yalta Val and mocked the Galactic Federation Triumvirate in an attempt to sow doubt and fear among its citizens. The broadcast was witnessed by many across the galaxy including Governor Biala, Empress Fel, the Imperial Knight Antares Draco, and the Ithorian crew aboard the substation in the Ottega system.

Back on Mala, Yalta Val managed to destroy Darth Wredd's lightsaber but the rogue Sith managed to escape in a get-away starship. Before the space station collided with Mala, Ania succeeded in rescuing Yalta Val. AG-37 then piloted the freighter through the Surd Nebula.

In response, Galactic Empress Marasiah Fel sent a Star Destroyer Animus to pick up Ania and her companions. Following their rescue and recovery, Yalta Val and Jao Assam were reassigned to the galactic capital Coruscant to supervise the recruitment and training of new Imperial Knight cadets. After encountering a Force vision of Darth Wredd attacking Empress Fel, Jao decided to abandon his assignment and embark on a manhunt for Darth Wredd. He managed to convince Ania to accompany him and the pair traveled to Nalyd, the homeworld of Wredd's henchman Dieben in the hope of discovering the rogue Sith's whereabouts.
