According to the myths, the Great Hyperspace War was initiated when the Sith Empire invaded the planet Empress Teta, formerly Koros Major, which had recently been conquered by Empress Teta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the outbreak of the Great Hyperspace War, Teta supposedly worked alongside the Jedi Order to fight against the Sith, successfully driving back the Sith Lord Naga Sadow and scattering the Sith forces across the galaxy. The Jedi Master Ooroo was involved in the Great Hyperspace War, perishing at some point during the conflict. While the inhabitants of Empress Teta presented the events of the Qel-Droma Epics, including the Great Hyperspace War, as historical fact, archaeological expeditions failed to verify the legends."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Great Hyperspace War was first canonically mentioned in the 2016 roleplaying sourcebook Nexus of Power. The 2014 novel Tarkin mentions a war waged against the Sith during the age of the Old Republic where the Sith managed to invade Coruscant, as in the Legends depiction of the conflict. However, as Nexus of Power references the conflict in the matter of the in-universe mythological Qel-Droma Epics, any correlation between the canon Great Hyperspace War and the war from Tarkin are currently unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
