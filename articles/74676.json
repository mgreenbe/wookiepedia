M1-4X infiltrated and added himself to the fourteen candidates looking to earn Kavos' favor on the desert world of Tatooine. Kavos determined that a fight to the death would determine his champion and M1-4X entered the competition. M1-4X hurled a Nikto thug who was liberally using a flamethrower at Lord Kavos causing the Sith's robes to be ignited, thus distracting him. M1-4X followed up by targeting a nearby Mandalorian using a jetpack and as soon as his velocity and vector were pointed correctly, Forex opened fire and sent him barreling at Kavos and the Nikto. All three died in the resulting explosion. The remaining candidates, having been targeted by the Republic Strategic Information Service, were taken out by M1-4X."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
