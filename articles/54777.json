It was present at the Battle of Sepan 8. Where Imperial forces under the command of Admiral Harkov kidnapped Dimok and Ripoblus leaders, in an attempt to pacify the Civil War, only to find the children of both leaders as part of a treaty to join forces against Harkov forces. Meanwhile Imperial Ace Maarek Stele inspected Glaive during the close of the mission to find that the ferry contained Imperial Goods.
