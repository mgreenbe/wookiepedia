During the battle, the Star Destroyer was boarded by New Republic soldiers with the intent of capturing it. After the commandos disabled the ship's ability to self destruct, its commander, Captain Ciena Ree, scuttled the Inflictor by crashing it into the surface of the planet, where its wreckage remained for decades. Eventually, squatters came to live in the Inflictor's conning towers, chasing anybody who might step in their territory. The wreckage could be seen from Niima Outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inflictor was an Imperial-class Star Destroyer. It had four known commanding officers: Captain Ciena Ree, Imperial Security Bureau Commander Brisney, ship systems officer Commander Erisher, and Flight Commander Nash Windrider. The Star Destroyer was equipped with at least seven rear engines which powered the ship's systems including its hyperdrive. According to Captain Ree, the ship could jump into hyperspace if engine two was functioning above 85 percent. To protect the ship from decompression, the Captain could remotely seal the decks from the command bridge. The Inflictor was also equipped with several escape pods. The command bridge could be accessed by the oral password \"look through my eyes,\" a reference to Captain Ree's deceased twin sister Wynnet Ree."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Jakku"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inflictor was in service following the events of the Battle of Endor, which saw the fragmentation of the Galactic Empire and the transformation of the Rebel Alliance into the New Republic. Shortly before the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, Grand Moff Randd commissioned the new Captain Ciena Ree as the commanding officer of the Inflictor. The Star Destroyer was part of the Imperial armada that assembled above Jakku for a massive showdown with the New Republic. Randd hoped that the Empire would defeat the New Republic once and for all."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Jakku, the Inflictor and hundreds of other Imperial warships took part in a concerted, simultaneous exercise that was rigidly controlled by a central command. However, the New Republic Defense Fleet circumvented the Imperial tactics by segmenting their forces and attacking on multiple fronts. Due to the flawed Imperial tactics, the Inflictor soon sustained damage to its engines. Enemy fire also caused an explosive decompression in the aft starboard, which exposed the area to zero gravity space. Captain Ree was forced to remotely seal the affected decks in order to save the rest of the Inflictor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Ree attempted to contact Grand Moff Randd to convince him to split the fleet so that the Imperial ships could attack the New Republic star cruisers from multiple fronts and relieve the beleaguered TIE fighters above Jakku. Before Ensign Perin could open the channel, the Inflictor was breached by four New Republic boarding ships. Seeking to capture the vessel, the New Republic boarders led by Ree's lover Thane Kyrell disconnected the self-destruct system. The Star Destroyer crew put up a fierce resistance against the rebel boarders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Ree tried to initiate the self-destruct mechanism but found that it had been severed. In response, Ree ordered her crew to abandon ship and all TIE fighters to rendezvous with the next nearest Imperial vessel. When Commander Windrider questioned her, Ree revealed that she was planning to crash the Inflictor onto Jakku's surface in order to keep the Star Destroyer out of New Republic hands. Despite Windrider's pleas, Ciena was determined to carry out her plan. Windrider reluctantly obliged and evacuated the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Captain Ree flew the Inflictor into Jakku's surface, Kyrell managed to breach the command bridge.
