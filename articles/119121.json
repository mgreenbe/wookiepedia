Should anyone else drink from it, he or she would be thrown in jail. Luke Skywalker learned it the hard way when he had to replace Princess Leia Organa during a trade summit between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Sarkan people. Seeing the Chalice placed it in front of him on the table, he raised it to propose a toast, before taking a sip of its contents, instead of delivering it to Queen Zil as he was expected to. As it turned out, that tradition was only one week old at the time of the summit, which explained why the protocol droid C-3PO, who accompanied Skywalker, could not warn him about it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
