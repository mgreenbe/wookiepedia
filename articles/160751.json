They were provided to the Mimbanese Liberation Army by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars and the people of Mimban continued to wield the vibro weapon amongst others from the Army for years after, often until they fell apart. The Cloud-Rider Baroosh Pawk also wielded a vibrobayonet attached to his DH-17 blaster pistol. Vibrobayonets were especially useful to those who used blasters with a tendency to fail or short out, such as the Kanjiklub criminal organization whose weapon modifications made their blasters more deadly, but also rendered them prone to shorting-out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
