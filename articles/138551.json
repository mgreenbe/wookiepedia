The TIE phantom was a stark departure from the other starfighters of the TIE line, as its cockpit was a truncated cone that was similar to the ones on Corellian Engineering Corporation YT-series vessels, and was connected to a heavily armored triangular hull which had the starfighter's twin ion engines, power generators, and the cloaking device. The wings consisted of three interceptor-style solar collector arrays in an equilateral formation around the fuselage, which gave the craft a menacing arrowhead profile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE phantom's cloaking device and stealth systems were expensive and innovative. When it was activated, the fighter is completely hidden from sensors and eyesight, and only left a shimmering distortion. Despite having deflector shields, it was not more durable than other TIE craft. A common tactic it used was de-cloaking, firing a barrage from its impressive number of forward-mounted medium laser cannons, and re-cloak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE phantom sported a class 1 hyperdrive and a navigation computer, as well as a short-range sensor. It was crewed by a pilot and co-pilot or gunner, and had consumables for two weeks.
