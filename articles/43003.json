It involved taking a starship from level to a half loop, then a hard roll, and turning the ship so that it could go the other direction entirely. The New Republic pilot Norra Wexley learned the maneuver while doing combat cargo runs for the Alliance. In 5 ABY, Norra used this maneuver during a skirmish near Wild Space with the Imperial Star Destroyer Scythe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
