Cindel's life monitor reveals that her mother Catarine's life is fading, so she goes to investigate. She finds her brother Mace at the side of their dead mother.

She resists at first, but he hugs her and reassures her that he will always be with her. He sees Charal in raven form, who has alerted the Sanyassans.

That night, they make pies with the flowers, and Noa puts Cindel and Wicket to bed in the beds that he made for them. The next morning before he leaves, Noa gives Cindel and Wicket a series of chores that he wants them to do every day.

However, Lucas had viewed the film Heidi with his daughter Amanda prior to the sessions, and told the Wheat brothers that he wanted the film to center around the young girl character of Cindel Towani, who would be orphaned and come into the care of an old man in the woods. Inspired by various adventure films they had seen as children, the Wheat brothers suggested the Marauders as villains, which Lucas felt should be seven feet tall.
