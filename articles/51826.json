However, this assumption is based on a complex inference from canon, and need not be correct, whereas the size of Dodonna directly constrains the size of the Star Defender. As some fans have pointed out, the key line of dialogue stating that the Corellian fleet has \"nothing in the size class of Dodonna\" could be read as indicating that the Strident-class ships are actually larger than the battle carrier. This goes against the sense of the scene, but it could serve as the basis for a retcon. It is also possible that Galactic-class vessels could be the same length as Imperial-class Star Destroyers, but also substantially wider or taller. This would allow the Strident-class vessels to be longer than an Imperial-class Star Destroyer yet still smaller than the Dodonna."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
