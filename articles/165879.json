It was to this temple that former Jedi A'Sharad Hett was summoned by the spirit of XoXaan, and subsequently trained in the ways of the dark side of the Force. Later, after Hett assumed the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith and created his One Sith Order, he had the temple restored to habitable conditions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Krayt was killed by Darth Wyyrlok following the Battle on Had Abbadon, his remains were brought to the temple by Wyyrlok and placed on display in a specialized stasis chamber. The temple also contained healing chambers, which housed Darths Stryfe, Talon, and Maladi, who had all suffered grievous injuries during that same battle on Had Abbadon. To maintain control of the Order, Darth Wyyrlok placed Krayt's body in the Temple's Stasis Room so that other Sith would believe that Krayt still lived, allowing Wyyrlok to act as Krayt's Voice and Regent while secretly controlling both the Order and the Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
