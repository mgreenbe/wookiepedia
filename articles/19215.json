It was very effective against droids and vehicles because the plasma was electrified, and seemed to have the properties of an EMP weapon. It could also burn biological material and leave a trail of plasma \"goo\" upon impact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boomas were made in many different sizes. Small boomas were used by Gungan militiagungs and cavalry, thrown either by bare hands or with the use of weapons such as the cesta or atlatl. Larger ones were launched from falumpaset-towed catapults and launchers attached to the backs of domesticated animals such as the fambaa or lerraa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, Gungans had enjoyed many centuries of peace, and so their weaponry had become more ornamental than practical, though occasionally it was used for security purposes. The Grand Army was sometimes called upon to deter sea creatures from wandering too close to their settlements. During the Battle of Grassy Plains, booma weaponry was used extensively to combat the B1-Series battle droids of the Trade Federation. General Jar Jar Binks' clumsy misuse of a booma during that battle inadvertently took down the pilot of an Armored Assault Tank, causing the vehicle to crash. He also let loose an entire wagon load of boomas during the Gungan retreat, covering the army in part but also resulting in a large amount of damage to the opposition. In addition, they were also used against General Grievous during the Clone Wars to great success, disabling one of his stolen lightsabers and crippling his cyborg body."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boomas first appeared in 1999 with the release of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
