After he fled the Senate Building, Saar was confronted by Jedi Master Cilghal in the Senate Plaza.

They began to duel, and Saar quickly took the offensive, but Cilghal did not fall for his feints or his attempts to get her off-balance. Finding himself overpowered, Saar attempted to back-flip away from her, but the Jedi Master pushed him in midair, slamming him against a nearby building and knocking him unconscious.
