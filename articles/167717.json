The Guardian of the Whills Chirrut \u00cemwe was a master of the art, and when the Rodian Steya moved to Jedha City with her family before the end of the Clone Wars she asked that he teach her. For several years Steya, who was obsessed with martial arts, met with \u00cemwe in the mornings to practice zama-shiwo in front of the Temple of the Kyber. The art was known as \"the inward eye of the outward hand.\" Zama-shiwo allegedly allowed its practitioners to alter their heart rate and oxygen intake, giving them almost supernatural powers. During the events of the Battle of Scarif, Chirrut Imwe made use of the art in his final moments to ensure that he would not experience suffering even as he was losing blood and neared death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zama-shiwo first appeared in the novelization for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was written by Alexander Freed and released on December 1, 2016.
