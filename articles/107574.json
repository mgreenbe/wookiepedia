It had several suites, and the entire floor was done in ornate hand-carved woods and had old-fashioned hinge doors. It was one of the few places that Palpatine left strictly alone when he began to occupy and remodel the palace. He usually reserved it for guests who had fond feelings of days past or could be impressed by such things. At least one suite was done completely in Fijisi wood from Cardooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mara Jade, Ghent, Garm Bel Iblis and Lando Calrissian were all staying on the President's Guests floor prior to Grand Admiral Thrawn's attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
