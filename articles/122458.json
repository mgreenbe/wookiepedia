It was in the Outer Rim Territories near the Tion Hegemony, at the far end of the Perlemian Trade Route."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sembla was located within a star system in the Sertar sector of the Outer Rim Territories region of the galaxy, away from any major trade routes. Its surface was covered with shallow seas and volcanic islands, remaining tectonically active due to the tidal forces exerted by the four moons which orbited the planet. There were vast gardens of coral and valuable crystal in the hottest of Sembla's oceans, and these were often targeted by off-world miners. Due to the nomadic nature of its indigenous species, the Vurks, there were few permanent settlements on Sembla. Ancient subaquatic ruins were known to exist along the planet's equator. These ruins did not appear to be Vurk creations, nor did the Vurks have any memories of having established permanent settlements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sembla, originally known as Utavurk, became part of Xim the Despot's empire at some point between 25,126 and 25,116 BBY.

When the Galactic Empire rose to power at the end of the war, Imperial scientists established a base on the distant world to study the unique properties of the world. Hoping to harness the geothermal energy of the planet and explore the magnetic magma which spewed from the scattered islands, the Imperials oppressed the local Vurks and forced them into hard labor. Because of the substandard working conditions and the damage to the environment, pockets of resistance began to appear across the planet. The Vurks in other regions of the world were slow to react, due to their cultural need to witness crimes first hand, a norm which played to the Imperial advantage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor, Sembla remained politically unaligned and was not very involved in the galactic community.

The primitive nature of the Vurks was belied by the species' highly advanced philosophical traditions, which stressed personal freedom, integrity and honesty in all things. As a species, Vurks were empathetic and serene, and they make exceptional diplomats. Despite their peaceful nature, Vurks were capable combatants who saw self-defense as an aspect of their own personal integrity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
