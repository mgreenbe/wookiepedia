It resolved the question of how to govern the millions of sectors that had Senate representation, which consequently made debate interminably slow and the Republic almost ungovernable. Under the Compromise, the Republic adopted the idea of a seated Senate, whose members had full rights of address, and an unseated Senate, whose members had to petition for such rights."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This made debate manageable, but was soon found to breed corruption: unseated Senators found they had to trade the vast majority of their votes for the chance to be heard about those matters of importance to them. Eventually, the Republic's growing size and population again overwhelmed the effort at efficient representation, which would not be resolved again until the Ruusan Reformation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
