It was to be developed in-house as a sibling to Star Wars Galaxies and was to be console-only as Galaxies was exclusively available for PC. Development began around 2003 and continued four to six months. It was canceled due to challenges and difficulties with the interface, which created an unattractive revenue model. The team were originally creating a project titled Pangea which was to be an MMO for next-gen consoles. When it was canceled the team was moved to the Proteus project, and after its cancellation they moved to develop Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 3 which also was canceled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Gameplay"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Supposedly comparable to other MMOs, the game's presumed playable species included Humans, Quarren and Kel Dor, based on concept artwork.
