Brentaal's economic importance made it a frequent target of military conquests; conflicts such as the New Sith Wars, the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, and the Yuuzhan Vong War all saw the planet become a battleground at least once as various governments and factions fought to control Brentaal's vital hyperspace junction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fourth planet in orbit around the star Brenta in the Brentaal system of the Core Worlds' Bormea sector, Brentaal IV was often called simply Brentaal.

A dry and relatively young planet, Brentaal featured a large number of mountain ranges that had been raised by groundquakes and volcanic activity, and most of the planet's volcanoes were dormant by the time of the Galactic Republic's founding. The planet's weather was largely warm and temperate, though the equatorial band featured deserts and steaming oceans.

A number of variations of kundril existed, with most hunting fish and seagoing mammals in Brentaal's seas, and most of the land-based kundrils were wiped out by the planet's inhabitants over the decades. The large amphibians known as scranges, native to the planet Dagobah, could also be found in Brentaal's sewers.

Around 24,500 BBY, Brentaal was the site of a battle between the Legions of Lettow and the Jedi Order during the Force-using Order's First Great Schism.

During the Manderon Period, Andel Tanner was a prominent inventor who worked on Brentaal IV around 6000 BBY, crafting a pair of slugthrowers that were valued at over 12.4 million credits by the year 0 ABY. Around that same time, the Antarian Rangers, a group of individuals who aided the Jedi Order, established a division on Brentaal.

By 3694 BBY, Kallea had extended the Brentaal-Denon Route all the way to the southern rim of the galaxy, forming the super hyperlane that she named the Hydian Way, after her Duros friend Banu Hydia.

Though the locals protested, Isoto ignored them, believing that his presence in Vuultin made the strategically-worthless city a prime target for the New Republic. Fel disagreed and sent most of his forces to nearby Oradin, as the city's spaceport facilities would aid the New Republic in landing troops on the surface.
