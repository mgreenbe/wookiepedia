It was viewed romantically by many in the Tion Cluster, as it had a famous tradition of leviathan-hunters: for millennia, hunters would take to Spinax's oceans to hunt the planet's immense crustaceans, creatures with minimal but malevolent intelligence and tough, flexible skeletons useful for a range of crafts. However, careless undersea mining polluted Spinax's seas, and the last leviathans died centuries before the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
