Instead of focusing on the slow accumulation of wealth and power, Fa'athra became a nimble strategist where he enjoyed crushing his enemies with unstoppable force. Following the Treaty of Coruscant and the start of the Cold War, Fa'athra assassinated several Hutts in disfavor with the Cartel. Eventually, he became an opponent to Suudaa Nem'ro, hoping to take over his seat on Nal Hutta from his base of operations in a palace in the Eastern Grime.
