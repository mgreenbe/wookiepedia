Jedi Master Mace Windu led the strike force to protect the people of the planet. A space battle took place between the Republic and CIS forces, in which the Confederacy lost at least one Munificent-class star frigate and a Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship. On the ground, the Separatist Droid Army had managed to take the Royal Palace, but was repelled by the force of the Jedi and his clone troopers. The Jedi then learned that Prince Yojan had joined the CIS and used their resources to destroy the Simocadia's agrocite mines with an ancient Ardana Shadex stone giant in order to make both sides of the war lose interest in his planet. Windu confronted him, but the giant was activated anyway and went out of control, not only destroying the mine, but threatening the Royal City as well. The Jedi and the prince worked together to stop it and eventually Yojan sacrificed his life to disable the giant. The Republic subsequently established a garrison on planet to defend the mines and the world's people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
