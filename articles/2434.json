It was used to transport components for the secret Project Stardust from the Kurost transfer point. As part of Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit's scheme to steal components from Project Stardust for his own use, the light freighter was stolen under the pretense of a gralloc attack, and taken to a nearby system where a mobile way station was to collect it.
