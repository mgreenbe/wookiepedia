After becoming frustrated with the number of political bounties he was being assigned by the Empire, he ceased to work within the corrupt bureaucracy and instead became a vigilante. By 10 BBY, Iselo had joined up the Cloud-Riders, a group led by the human Enfys Nest who opposed the Empire and its criminal allies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 10 BBY, Iselo was amongst the Cloud-Riders who accompanied Nest to the planet Savareen in order to find a group of criminals led by the thief Tobias Beckett and associated with the Crimson Dawn syndicate.

Initially Iselo and the other Cloud-Riders kept their weapons aimed at the criminals as Nest addressed them, but after a failed bluff by the criminal Han Solo claiming that there were thirty mercenaries waiting to reinforce them, Nest removed her helmet and lowered her weapon before heading into the cantina for a drink and the Melbu and his allies followed suit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the cantina, Nest explained the Cloud-Riders fight against the Empire and syndicates to Beckett's gang and appealed to them to join forces against Vos.

When Vos arrived on his yacht, the First Light, he dispatched his Hylobon Enforcers led by Aemon Gremm to attack the Cloud-Riders and reclaim the coaxium from them as he had been informed by Beckett that Solo had betrayed him and sided with Nest. The real coaxium however, was with Solo, who boarded the yacht with his allies to meet with Vos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Hylobon surrounded the villagers and reported their apparent success to Vos, they discovered that the false Cloud-Riders did not in fact have the coaxium, at which point Iselo and the other true Cloud-Riders attacked the enforcers.

Once the coaxium was secured on the Cloud-Riders' speeder bikes, Iselo and the others waited by the bikes as Nest exchanged a few final words with Solo. The group then mounted the bikes and waited for Nest to launch first, taking off and leaving the village behind. The Cloud-Riders then traveled to a rendezvous with the leader of the Partisans rebel movement, Saw Gerrera, to whom they gave the coaxium to aid in his fight against the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iselo had amber eyes and mottled green and reddish-brown skin.
