It was developed by equipping a turbolaser with Agrocite, which greatly enhanced its destructive potential. During the Battle of Khorm, Khormai Separatist Warlord Unger Gout used it to its full potential, easily destroying a Venator-class Star Destroyer in one blow. Gout's cannons were destroyed by Jedi Master Kit Fisto, \"Sharp\", and Admiral Wieler near the end of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
