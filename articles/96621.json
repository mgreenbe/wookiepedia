Circa early 2 ABY, Nevar supervised a failed Imperial expedition to capture and conscript the Force-sensitive Dathomiri Nightsister Kyrisa, who had taken refuge on the remote ice planet Hoth. During the unsuccessful operation, the Imperial expedition encountered a Rebel Alliance group setting up an outpost on Hoth, although when word of the Rebel presence reached Nevar, he incredulously deleted the report out of hand.

His career was a triumph of nepotism and sycophantic behavior. Circa early 2 ABY, Nevar found himself overseeing an Imperial mission to the remote Outer Rim Territories ice planet Hoth in search of the rogue Force-sensitive Dathomiri Nightsister Kyrisa, who possessed the Force ability to exert control over wild creatures. Imperial Intelligence Director \"Blackhole\" hoped to capture Kyrisa to take advantage of her powers for the purposes of beast mastery and espionage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial expedition to Hoth, led by Imperial Security Bureau agent Jeffren Brek, ultimately failed to capture Kyrisa. Moreover, in the midst of the search for Kyrisa, elements of the Imperial expedition team encountered and battled a small Rebel Alliance outfit, which was attempting to establish an outpost on Hoth's inhospitable surface. The Rebels annihilated the small Imperial force, and Brek's team failed to obtain any real evidence of the Rebels' presence on Hoth. However, when Brek filed his report with Nevar at the conclusion of the operation from aboard the Imperial Star Destroyer Devastator, Nevar dismissed Brek's claims of the Rebel presence as foolishness and deleted his reports, disbelieving the Rebellion would even be on such a worthless planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "What Nevar did not realize was that Brek had actually stumbled across the earliest traces of Echo Base, the Alliance High Command headquarters.

However, the card does not elaborate under what circumstances Nevar's treachery or assassination take place. According to a Star Wars CCG fan site, Nevar, as well as the Ranat character Nevar Yalnal, was named as an anagram of Decipher employee Cheryl Kallenbach's pet dog, Raven. The first illustration of Nevar was included in the September 2009 The Shadow Syndicate expansion set of the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game, and the character was briefly featured in the game's The Nightsister's Revenge adventure scenario."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nevar was also mentioned in the August 2004 Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy and the subsequent October 2005 compilation book Star Wars: Complete Locations among the texts' \"Battle of Hoth\" geographic layout.

Additionally, Inside the Worlds explains that \"Wedge\u2026[deploys] Rogue 3's harpoon and tow cable against the AT-AT commanded by Brigadier General Nevar,\" suggesting that Nevar is still in command of the AT-AT at that time and thus was assassinated during the battle itself, sometime during or after Antilles' attack on Blizzard 2."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
