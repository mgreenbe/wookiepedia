Made out of synstone, it comprised a large room that was divided into a living room and a raised kitchen, and a bathroom as a separate room. A cellar contained a power generator and water, and could be entered via a trapdoor.

Obi-Wan found it when he began his exile on the desert planet. After riding his eopie in a widening circle around the Lars homestead, he found a small hut close enough to the Lars farm so he could watch over Luke Skywalker, but far enough away so he could be considered a hermit and nobody would take much note of him. He kept books containing information about the Jedi there, as well as the supplies and equipment needed to create new lightsabers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, Jabba the Hutt's beast master Malakili recruited a spacer to explore and search the hut.

In 12 ABY, Luke Skywalker returned to the hut in an unsuccessful attempt to reestablish a connection with his long-dead mentor.
