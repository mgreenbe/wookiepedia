Like all of Phylus Mon's slaves, Vorfren had an injected explosive that would kill him should Phylus Mon die for any reason. Vorfren knew that the explosive in his chest could be deactivated if hit by an ion weapon, but Phylus Mon did not allow any ion weapons into his ship, the Animiasma."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vorfren used a heavy blaster pistol and combat gloves as his personal weapons. Another of Phylus Mon's slave bodyguards, Ku-Kak, provided Vorfren with a green lightsaber that had belonged to Jedi Knight Ish-Bel Tur.

Phylus Mon was analyzing the Staff when it suddenly disappeared. Seconds later, a team opposed to Phylus Mon's interests burst in the throne room. At his master's signal, Vorfren pulled his lightsaber, but did not ignite it. He, along with four Coruscani ogres in Phylus Mon's entourage, tried to protect the dais where the master was sitting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Vorfren really wanted to be free and to kill Phylus Mon.
