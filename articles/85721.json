However after Notron had destroyed the Alashan capital, the Ossians forsook the Krevaaki, believing that because of their abilities they were superior to all others. While yet wearing Krevaaki ceremonial armor, they renounced the Celestials and renamed themselves the Malak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Malak were a dangerous race, not only advanced designers but excellent pilots, they claimed to be the Engineers of the Human Race, a claim believed by some due to the mysterious appearance of humans on places like Notron, Cobal, Terra, Forhilnor, Lundinium, and others. The Malak went about re-terraforming numerous worlds to reflect their black and capricious minds and were it not for the impediment of the Krevaaki, they would have caused much greater harm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They came into conflict with some of the human remnant on New Earth, as well as with the E'Yautja, another arrogant race of hunters, the destruction of the Malak came at the jaws of an aggressive endoparasitoid species with a protective exoskeleton and hive mind that they themselves engineered (and which a human replica model later re-engineered). Its giant empresses were able to survive for millennia, laying thousands of eggs, which gestated through the host bodies of victims of nearly any sentient race. Queens could even influence potential hosts through dreams and nightmares, while telepathically directing their offspring, guardians, warriors and drones. So did the Malak bring about their own end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Malak are a reference to the Engineers from the Prometheus movie series.
