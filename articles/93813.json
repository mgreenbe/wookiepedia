During the battle, Mullinore would bear witness to the destruction of the Star Destroyer Manticore. Following the battle, Mullinore and his vessel retreated to the Cauldron Nebula where Daala began plans for a suicide attack on Coruscant where the Basilisk would ram itself into the planet's surface, piloted by a skeleton crew. Initially, Mullinore did not take news of his ship's destruction well, but eventually agreed to the plan and even volunteered to captain the vessel to its death. Before Daala's plans could be realized, Durron arrived with the Sun Crusher and set the nebula into supernova. The resulting explosion destroyed the Basilisk and all remaining hands onboard, Mullinore among them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
