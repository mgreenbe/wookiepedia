It was known that they regularly ambushed starships near Dathomir that traveled through the nebula and these unfortunate victims were acquired in order to be sacrificed. Their reason for doing so was due to their belief that the sacrifices would assuage the great rage of Dathomir's Vitality which was believed to exist in the depths of the Heart of Dathomir."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
