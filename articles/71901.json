It was separated by a massive bridge; the upper portion of the bridge consisted of residences and other skyscrapers, while the lower portion of the bridge contained run-down buildings and was classified as off-limits and uninhabitable. The lower portion of the bridge was home to the Crimson Kreehawks, a gang loyal to the Whitescar Syndicate, and had a large spice-abuse problem after the Clone Wars. The city was governed by Duke Irbian, who was loyal to the Galactic Empire. Imperial spies and collaborators were everywhere in the city, and would report on anything they saw."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
