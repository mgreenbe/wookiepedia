They were a species known for having a fierce sense of self-determination and an equally dominant need for independence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zabrak were Near-Human, but had a number of significant physical characteristics that set them apart from baseline Humanity. The most striking of these were a series of vestigial horns that crowned the heads of both males and females. These horns grew at puberty in varying patterns and signified that the time of their rite of passage was drawing near."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The horns were one trait shared by the many Zabrak subspecies, which were divided by a number of physical characteristics that differed from subspecies to subspecies. These could include different skin tones (which included peachy white, pure white, yellow, red, tan, brown and black), horn patterns, hair growth (though it should be noted that most Zabraks, unlike Humans, could not grow eyelashes or facial hair \u2013 there were some exceptions, such as Maris Brood and Bao-Dur, who had eyebrows) and eye color (which have certain pigmentations that Humans lack, such as purple, yellow, red, and orange)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another of the traits that made Zabrak instantly recognizable[source?] was their facial tattoos, which were made up of thin lines received during their rite of passage.[source?] These could symbolize many things, including but not limited to family lineage, place of birth, or even a design that reflected their individual personalities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Internally, Zabraks possessed a second heart. They also had great resistance to physical pain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zabraks were capable of breeding with Humans, and a hybrid sub-species evolved on Dathomir called the Dathomirians, formed from the mating of Nightbrother Zabraks and Nightsister Humans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zabrak were often seen by most other species as being single-minded, an observation that was not terribly incorrect. This single-minded determination came from the fact that they were a race with a strong sense of self-assuredness, confident that they were able to accomplish any task that they set out to do. However, this did not lead a Zabrak to develop a sense of prideful superiority towards others of his or her kind. Though it was not uncommon to see competition between colonies, this was not seen as a negative. The Zabraks believed that the various experiences of the different colonies only served to add to the race's overall value throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zabrak were proud, strong, and confident beings. They believed that nothing was truly impossible, and strove to prove skeptics wrong at every turn. Some Zabraks carried themselves with an air of superiority toward other races, frequently discussing the achievements of their people with pride that could border on arrogance. As warriors or adventurers, Zabrak tended to be dedicated, intense, and extremely focused."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zabrak from Iridonia were considered to be more war-like than Zabrak from their colony worlds, most likely due to the rugged terrain that made up their home world. As such, they developed a highly physical style of martial arts, which were a requirement for young Zabrak to learn. It was not uncommon for Zabrak from Iridonia to be among the best hand-to-hand fighters and weaponsmiths in the galaxy. Zabrak from colony worlds also shared that drive for excellence, but encouraged their children to express it in other ways. It was thus not surprising to see that the Zabrak met with success in many fields, ranging from medicine to entertainment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zabrak would commonly take their names from animals native to Iridonia, with many Zabrak families named after the Bukk. Many Zabrak males were named after the Blok, Lok, and Zur. Many Zabrak females were known to take their names from the Triz."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Ashaa, the Mother Machine, the Zabraks were one of her \"children,\" synthetic lifeforms she created under orders from the Infinite Empire, as part of experimentation the Rakata hoped would give them insight into the loss of their connection to the Force. This would place the origins of the species sometime between 30,000 and 25,200 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As one of the earliest spacefaring species in the galaxy, the Zabrak played a major role in galactic affairs. Like the early Humans, the Zabrak established many colonies outside their home system early in their history, such as on the planet Iridia. The Elomin species was believed by some xenoarchaeologists to be descended from Zabrak colonists who settled Elom in the distant past. By the time the Zabrak encountered the Republic, they had a total of eight colonies in five systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Long ago, the Sith had made contacts with the high council of Iridonia in order to hire the services of their most talented mercenaries. This influence remained with the Zabrak people long after the Sith were thought to be wiped out at the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, though it remained more closely associated with the Zabrak of Iridonia than the Zabrak of their colony worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the time following the formation of the Galactic Empire, the natural strong-willed nature of the Zabrak people allowed them to resist Imperial occupation. This defiant spirit continued in the face of various actions that the Empire took against them, including garrisoning all of their worlds, destroying their industrial base, and raising taxes that drove them to near poverty. Many Zabrak men and women joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic to fight back against the Empire. Following the defeat of the Empire at the Battle of Endor, the Zabrak race united as one and joined the fledgling New Republic, determined to never again be put under the oppression they had suffered during the height of the New Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Zabrak in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Old Republic era, Zabrak Bao-Dur served under the Jedi Exile during the Mandalorian Wars. He created the Mass Shadow Generator that was used to destroy Malachor V and help bring an end to the Mandalorian Wars. He then traveled with the Exile in her search for lost Jedi Masters and likely helped rebuild the Jedi Order after her departure. Kao Cen Darach was a Zabrak Master of the Jedi Order during the years preceding the Great Galactic War in 3681 BBY. A legendary Jedi Knight who later held the title Battlemaster, Darach trained a young Jedi Padawan named Satele Shan, and both were present when the Sith Empire, which had been believed destroyed for centuries, launched an assault to retake Korriban. Darach was ultimately killed in battle with the Sith Lord Vindican and his apprentice, Malgus. Because of Darach's sacrifice, Shan was able to escape and warn the Galactic Republic of the Sith Empire's return."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the Sith of later era was Sirak, a male Zabrak who trained as a Sith apprentice at the Academy on Korriban during the New Sith Wars. Sirak was renowned at the Academy for his strength in the dark side and his skills in lightsaber combat. He developed a rival in the fellow apprentice Bane, whom Sirak believed was one of the few students that could eventually challenge his place at the Academy. Allies of Sirak were fellow Zabraks and Sith Apprentices Llokay and his sister Yevra. Together, Sirak, Llokay, and Yevra set a trap to try to eliminate the rival Sith Bane. Their plan did not succeed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Maul was an apprentice of Palpatine who eventually became a Dark Lord of the Sith. Maul was responsible for the death of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, but was seemingly destroyed by Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, Maul managed to survive his defeat at the hands of Kenobi by harnessing the power of hatred and the dark side. He then united with his brother Savage Opress who was trained in the ways of the Sith by Count Dooku. Together, they went on a rampage of destruction to try to lure Kenobi into a final duel so that Maul could finally have his revenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eeth Koth and Agen Kolar were two Zabrak that served on the Jedi High Council in the period leading up to the fall of the Galactic Republic. Koth was a noteworthy addition to the Jedi Order in that he was born on Nar Shaddaa instead of Iridonia or one of the colony worlds and was taken as a youngling at the relatively advanced age of four. The mental and physical disciplines of his natural Zabrak heritage, along with his potential, allowed him to be an exception to the rule that required Jedi initiates to be taken in at infancy. Kolar was killed during the Clone Wars when making an attempt to arrest Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, recently revealed to have been Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maris Brood was a female Zabrak Jedi Padawan, who survived the initial stages of the Great Jedi Purge. She spent many years in hiding with Jedi Master Shaak Ti on the planet Felucia. After her master's death, she was corrupted by the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Legacy era, Zabrak Wolf Sazen served as Jedi Master who was active during the Sith\u2013Imperial War and the subsequent Second Imperial Civil War against Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire. He was Kol Skywalker's Padawan and the Jedi Master of Kol's son, Cade Skywalker. However, Sazen was killed before he could finish Cade Skywalker's training."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The term \"Iridonian\" is sometimes used to refer to Zabraks, and sometimes to a bloodthirsty people also called Iridonians. Whether Iridonians are just another designation of Zabrak species, a separate society and culture within the species (similar to Morgukai warrior caste within Nikto society), or simply another species, also native to Iridonia, remains unclear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zabraks are featured as a playable species for players who select the Jedi Knight, Jedi Consular, Sith Inquisitor, Bounty Hunter, Sith Warrior, Imperial Agent, Smuggler, and Trooper classes in Star Wars: The Old Republic.
