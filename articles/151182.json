Although knowledge of the planet had been lost by the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Imperial sentientologist Obo Rin speculated that conditions there must have been perfect to allow for large, unicellular beings like the Ugors to evolve. It must have had easily obtainable nutrients, for example, and an absence of predatory species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet also had vast natural resources, which the Ugors used to develop new technologies.
