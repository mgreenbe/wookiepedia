It was made from the skin of an ysalamir and was claimed to be able to stop a Jedi from using their powers on the being who wore it. The miriskin was, of course, a hoax made to dupe the gullible out of their cash, since only living ysalamiri could push back the Force. Many examples of miriskin were not even made from the creatures themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
