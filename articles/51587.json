A successor of the G-2A gunship, which was known for razing whole cities on the planet Sullust, the Dustmaker was made to surpass its predecessor's firepower. While its defenses are a bit below the standard base line for gunships and was only able to equip a single rail gun, these weaknesses were curtailed with the ability to carry proton torpedoes and a heavier laser cannon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
