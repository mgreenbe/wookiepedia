Discovered on the planet when Galactic Republic scouts scanned the planet around 1000 BBY, the derelict had been stripped of engines, instruments, bodily remains, and any indication as to who had built or piloted the vessel, leaving a hollowed out hole. The wreck became a popular tourist spot on Spira, with divers exploring the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Possessed of organic-looking lines, the wreck's passages were ribbed and oddly curved. Only one safe entrance, a large break in the hull on the port side, granted entry to the derelict, and several doors had been welded shut to prevent tourists from entering unsafe areas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
