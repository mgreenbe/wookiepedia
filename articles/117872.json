In order to prove himself worthy to settle the conflict, the Muza clan elders insist that Raffaan must first undertake a test of his mettle: he must venture into the ruins of Kabus-Dabeh\u2014a site the Muza consider evil\u2014and recover a leather sack filled with coins.

Other \"incorrect\" paths lead him into a dark cave, where he confronts an intelligent monster called Togarn, into a dark pond, which stains the Jedi's arm gray, and up a pyramidal structure, where he must escape an ancient trap."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
