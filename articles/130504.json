In these cases, Star Dreadnoughts were noted as being the largest Super Star Destroyers. In turn, the lower-case term star dreadnought could be used to describe Super Star Destroyers in general."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Various classes of Star Dreadnoughts were known to have served in the Kuat Drive Yards defense fleets, the Republic Navy, the Imperial Navy, the New Republic Defense Fleet and the Galactic Alliance Defense Fleet. Their sizes eclipsed most conventional warships, peaking with the Executor-class at 19 km in length, and the Eclipse-class, with its unequaled mass and weaponry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Private service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the centuries leading up to the Clone Wars, important and rich galactic sectors were protected by private self-defense forces. The Kuat sector had among its arsenal the eight-kilometer Mandator-class Star Dreadnought, a class that entered service at some point prior to 39 BBY. They were large battleships equipped with heavy firepower, but had a limited range on their hyperdrives. Mandators were primarily used to protect the valuable Kuat Drive Yards, as well as defend the general sector."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars era and beyond"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the start of the Clone Wars, seven of what KDY classified as Star Dreadnoughts were in service: three defended Kuat, while the Azure, Ixtlar, Alsaka and Humbarine sectors had one each."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Clone Wars raged, heavier warships as well as increased loyalty were demanded, and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine pushed through legislation that made all home fleets fall under the centralized command of the restored Republic Navy. The Kuat Drive Yards produced the faster, more heavily-armed and -armored Mandator II during this period. Three new Mandator IIs were built, while three earlier Mandators were uparmored and refitted. All of them saw use in defending the Core Worlds against Separatist incursions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the war's end, the new Imperial Navy began the Sarlacc Project, to build a new huge warship design to serve as a flagship for the entire Navy. This Super Star Destroyer prototype, twelve kilometers in length, was destroyed by early Rebel elements over Byss before its completion. Despite its destruction, it managed to inspire future Star Dreadnaught designs, and the Empire ordered the construction of four new dreadnoughts, each nineteen kilometers in length."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Dreadnought concept was not without opposition in the Imperial Navy. Many traditionalists saw the enormous ships as far too expensive and inefficient in comparison to patrol boats, frigates and cruisers for policing space. Likewise, the Navy's growing number of Star Destroyers carried unmatched firepower should the Imperial Navy fight a fleet battle. To traditionalists, battlecruisers and dreadnoughts, lumped together under the derisive tag \"Super Star Destroyers\" (which later spread to the Rebellion through Imperial defectors), seemed to be egotistical constructions rather than pieces of a coherent military strategy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Galactic Civil War heated up, various new Star Dreadnought designs were shelved mid-production due to countless credits and talented engineers being diverted to the creation of the Death Star, with its destruction being the only reason they were able to continue. Skeptical of superweapons like the Death Star, the Imperial Navy worked hard to come up with reasonable alternatives that could hold their own in the face of massive centralization of power, and reluctantly embraced the Star Dreadnought. With the Death Star's destruction, they became the Empire's mightiest weapons, designed to be so powerful that the mere threat of their deployment would pacify multiple sectors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the achievements of this era was the Executor-class design. By this point, the Star Dreadnought designation was known to Imperial oversight committees as representing extraordinarily large and heavily armed warships. In order to avoid controversy in the Imperial Senate, naval documents simply classified the new Star Dreadnought as a new class of Star Destroyer, understating its size, role and armament. The Star Dreadnoughts were also viewed by the Galactic Empire as useful for psychological warfare purposes, to cow various systems. This made the ships' development worth the expenses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When fielded, these ships gained notoriety as command ships for large-scale forces as well as being heavy weapons platforms, with the lead vessel serving as Darth Vader's personal flagship. These ships were some of the largest in the galaxy, second only to battlestations like the Death Star. Though their sluggish speed, massive size, and poor maneuverability proved to be severe weaknesses, they were unmatched in firepower by any other frontline ship and incredibly resilient to direct assaults.\nAnother design, the Eclipse-class, which began construction around the time of the Executor's early deployment, became dreadful weapons of terror, as each ship was equipped with a superlaser for penetrating planetary shields and pulverizing enemy ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Empire split into warring factions following the Emperor's death, its formidable fleet of Dreadnoughts was divided up between various Warlords. Despite the imposing threat of these classes, most were either destroyed by sabotage or in battle, or captured by the New Republic, leaving few rogue Star Dreadnoughts still active at the end of the Civil War."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Republic counterparts"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Republic initially regarded Star Dreadnoughts as inflexible and inefficient, preferring a combination of smaller-platform capital ships and starfighters for its fleets. Consequently, the New Class Modernization Program did not include new battlecruiser or dreadnought designs. However, the experience of Operation Shadow Hand, where some twelve Star Dreadnoughts led a renewed Imperial assault out of the Deep Core, the Orinda campaign, where they proved to have no counter against the Imperial Remnant's Reaper, Megador and Dominion dreadnoughts, and finally the Black Fleet Crisis, the New Republic realized the need for bigger and stronger capital ships to deter would-be attackers. Running low on captured vessels of this size, new dreadnought classes were designed that were meant to be Republic counterparts to the Star Dreadnoughts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mon Calamari Viscount-class Star Defenders were new directions for Republic ship-building, away from the compact designs of the New Class program.

Others considered the various redesignations and redefinitions contradictory and unnecessary, accepting the use of Super Star Destroyer as a general category. Despite different naval nomenclature being used by various authors, Curtis Saxton was widely seen as responsible for the change in designations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much of the criticism towards the term \"Star Dreadnought\" stem from the belief that it's applying terminology to ship names that were not originally created to fit with the English naval hierarchy and that only recent authors like Saxton have used it in such a fashion. I.e. a Star Destroyer and a Star Cruiser are not analogous to a naval Destroyer and a naval Cruiser and are equivalent in size and role, ships of size comparable to Star Dreadnoughts like the Subjugator-class heavy cruiser lack the description, and the existing Dreadnaught-class ship is smaller than all three. As well, the term Star Dreadnought was initially seen as largely redundant with the pre-existing term Super Star Destroyer, as at the time the term Star Dreadnought was first used, Super Star Destroyers categorized as Star Cruisers and Star Battlecruisers have neither been introduced nor were they specifically identified, leaving Star Dreadnoughts the only category within Super Star Destroyer with any ships in it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
