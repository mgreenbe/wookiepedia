In 3637 BBY it served as the flagship of the Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan during the Battle of Rishi. Initially pitted against the Imperial fleet, the course of the battle turned when Theron Shan and his allies revealed that Dauntless and other ships on both fleets were filled with saboteurs from the Order of Revan. Shan formed a temporary truce with Darth Marr and took Dauntless to Yavin 4 with the rest of her fleet, a move to which Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh later objected."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
