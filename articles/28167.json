He elaborated by saying that he knew the stories of the Mandalorians and how they were renowned for their killing ways. Vanth said that he figured only one of them was walking out of the bar, but when he saw Grogu, he said that maybe he had misjudged the Mandalorian.

He offered his armor to Djarin in exchange for help in taking down the beast, saying later he was more fond of the town than his armor. Vanth and Djarin began to ride to the krayt dragon's lair on speeder bikes.

Whilst sitting at a campfire, Vanth accidentally offended the Tuskens by not drinking a black melon.

The Tusken at the entrance of the cave tied down the bantha and began to yell in an effort to awaken the dragon.

The people accepted this, but Vanth then revealed to them that the sand people were willing to help with the crusade. This set them off, proclaiming that they were monsters. Djarin then gave the case for the Tuskens, saying that although they were indeed raiders, they knew more about the krayt than anyone there, and would keep their word.

A villager named Jo then handed the detonator to Vanth, who told her to stay safe. A trio of Tuskens walked up to the cave and began to yell to wake up the dragon. They ran away as soon as they heard it arise. Vanth watched as the dragon slowly crawled out. The Tuskens fired their arrows, but the dragon started to move back inside the cave.

The group cautiously walked towards the explosion, although Vanth and Djarin did not think it to be dead. The dragon then suddenly burst through the hill above its cave and fired another stream of spit.

Djarin then armed a batch of explosives that were attached to a bantha, and had the dragon swallow the both of then. The dragon then went back underground. Vanth landed awkwardly nearby. The group, including Vanth and Grogu, looked around for the krayt, wondering if Djarin would be alright.
