Some of the clans, including Clans Ordo, Itera, Kelborn, and Cadera, wanted to support the Republic as Mandalore the Preserver had three centuries prior, and Jicoln Cadera led an uprising against the acting Mandalore before the war ended. They were unsuccessful, and Mandalore crushed the faction in his quest to unite the Mandalorian clans under his banner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
