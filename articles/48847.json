They included Corellia, Selonia, Drall, and the Twin Worlds Tralus and Talus. All five planets were believed to have been transported through hyperspace to their orbits by the Celestials, utilizing the ancient Centerpoint Station. Corellia, Selonia, and Drall orbited the system star Corell, while Talus and Tralus orbited the Centerpoint Station like moons, with Centerpoint Station orbiting the star. Five Worlds was later the name given to the independent government of the Corellian system following the Swarm War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
