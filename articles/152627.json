After spotting Resistance operative Finn at the Wayward Comet, Kendoh Gang informed the First Order lieutenant, who promptly informed his superior, Armitage Hux. The latter told him not to waste his time on every little report about any Resistance sightings, right as Supreme Leader Kylo Ren interrupted and told Hux that the First Order would do everything and anything to find the Resistance.
