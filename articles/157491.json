The Starkiller weapon extinguished the star's light completely, but the Resistance Starfighter Corps destroyed the weapon before it could be used to eliminate the Resistance. When the planet imploded, the stored energy created a new star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
