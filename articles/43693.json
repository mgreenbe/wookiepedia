In 3951 BBY, she ascended to the throne of her homeworld and started a decades-long colonization effort to spread her people to new planets. One of her expeditions led to the colonization of fourteen systems, including Renatasia. Circa 3900 BBY, she personally sponsored one of her world's last colonization missions. The fleet for this expedition was led by the Galactic Republic scout Kwilaan and consisted of three ships: Beneficent Tasia, Constant, and Mother Vima. A long time later, Kwilaan and his colonists found a planet named Naboo, where they came into conflict with the world's native Gungans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Daniel Wallace, the retcon of Renatasia as another colony of Grizmallt is a small Easter egg, as Reina Tasia (Queen Tasia in Spanish) could come from Queen Elsinor\u00e9 den Tasia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
