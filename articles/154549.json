The two fought for 45 minutes before they agreed on a truce, though they hardly got along in any friendly capacity. The scout trooper threatened to bring the Rebel trooper in as his prisoner, only when he attempted to subdue the Rebel, he brought not only the Rebel, but himself into a trap created by the native Ewoks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ewoks eventually came back to their trap, tying the scout trooper to a log and giving the Rebel trooper food nourishment. At the request of the scout trooper, the Rebel trooper got the Ewoks to release him upon return to their village. While there, they were both given a peace pipe and the scout trooper admitted that he was a \"broken\" trooper, rethinking his orders. The Rebel trooper then revealed that he had been left behind, saying \"when you have got to go, you have to go\" as the reason, to this, the scout trooper said, \"You're an IDIOT.\" The scout trooper then pulled out a picture of the Death Star shield generator showing it to the Ewoks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ewoks led them to the location of the shield generator\u2026only to discover that it had, in fact, been destroyed. Resigned to being stuck on Endor forever, the scout trooper nearly gave up. The Rebel trooper, however, spotted a left over AT-ST. While the pair checked the leftover vehicle's power cells, a Gorax attacked the Ewoks that had been leading them. The Rebel trooper used the walker's cannons to kill the beast, much to the chagrin of the scout trooper, who wanted to keep the energy in the power cells. During their argument about the \"circle of life\", the Rebel trooper spotted a huge structure on the radar, about the size of a small city and transmitting an Imperial code."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Getting Off Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they arrived at the location of the signal, they discovered that it wasn't a city, but rather an Imperial Star Destroyer that had plummeted to the moon during the battle. The ship had a communication's substation and an operational power plant, and the Rebel trooper managed to contact a passing freighter on a nearby trade route. He also discovered that the signal was an automatic evacuation signal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, the freighter arrived. The scout trooper, however, decided to stay behind, citing that the Rebel trooper was right about people like him not having a place in peaceful society. The two shook hands and said farewell, and the Rebel trooper boarded the freighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
