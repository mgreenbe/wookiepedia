The skirmish resulted in the arrest of Savit, who was stealing components from Project Stardust, by Major Dayja Collerand of the Imperial Security Bureau."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, Faro sent the Third Fleet vessels evidence of Savit's crimes. Four of Grand Admiral Thrawn's death troopers commandeered several of the Firedrake's TIE fighters. Commodore Karyn Faro cited this as evidence of a mutiny against Savit, and urged the other Star Destroyers of the Third Fleet to join and call for Savit's arrest. Captain Gilad Pellaeon of the Harbinger reviewed the evidence sent by Faro and joined her call for an inquiry against Savit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Savit cursed Thrawn and attempted to shoot him with his blaster, but Ronan used his cape to temporarily obscure Savit's vision and caused the Grand Admiral to miss his target. Savit then attempted to shoot Ronan, but ISB Major Dayja Collerand stunned Savit. Dayja ordered Grand Admiral Savit temporarily relieved of duty for violating Imperial Navy regulations that blasters on capital ship bridges must always be set to stun. This left the Firedrake in the temporary command of Captain Boulag. Savit was arrested pending an official inquiry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
