The cantina was situated close to the rundown Formos Spaceport and it attracted a diverse, cosmopolitan range of customers. The establishment was run by the aged Bith Rii Jenks and Jenks paid regular bribes to Imperial agents and local Hutt crime lords to dissuade them from interring with his business, while he also evaded the ire of local smuggler groups by permitting them to make use of the cantina's facilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
