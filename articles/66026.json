Staffed entirely by droids and controlled by a Terreene Brainiac class artificial intelligence named Control, it was capable of extracting and processing six hundred metric tons of alantium per month. The complex was a five hundred meter by five hundred meter platform that hovered above the surface of the planet at a height of twenty meters. The complex sucked up a one hundred-meter-wide section of the surface, extracted the valuable ore, and extruded the remains behind the facility. Reekeene's Roughnecks Green squad was tasked with infiltrating and destroying the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
