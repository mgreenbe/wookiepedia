In 4 ABY, the Eminence served as part of the Imperial Fleet that defended the second Death Star during the final stages of its construction above the Forest Moon of Endor. The Rebel Alliance, having learned of the Death Star's construction and Emperor Palpatine's presence aboard the station, launched an assault on the superweapon with the intent of destroying it. During the battle, as the Imperial Navy clashed with the Alliance Fleet in ship-to-ship combat, the Eminence engaged the gunship Braha'tok, a ship less than one-third the Eminence's size. However, as the Eminence closed in on the Braha'tok, the gunship's sister ship, the Torktarak, attacked the Eminence from behind, destroying the old Imperial vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Eminence was an old Carrack-class cruiser in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance.

Emperor Palpatine, who had purposely let knowledge of the second Death Star fall into the Rebels' hands, made a visit to the incomplete superweapon with the intent of luring the Alliance Fleet into attacking the station. Upon exiting from hyperspace, the Rebels would find themselves trapped between the Imperial Fleet and a fully-operational Death Star, from which the Emperor believed there would be no escape. The Rebels took the bait and arrived in the Endor system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mere moments after the Rebels arrived, the Imperial Fleet, including the Eminence, emerged from the far side of Endor. During the ensuing battle, the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Liberty was destroyed by the Death Star's fully functional superlaser in a move that stunned the Rebels. As Alliance rescue craft attempted to pick up survivors from the Liberty's destruction, the Eminence moved in and attacked the rescue ships. The Rebel Dornean Braha'tok-class gunship Braha'tok, a ship less than one-third the size of the Eminence, was able to hold off the Eminence while the survivors were rescued, taking major damage in the process. With the Eminence focused on the Braha'tok, the gunship's sister ship, the Torktarak, attacked the Eminence from behind. The combined firepower from both Alliance gunships overwhelmed the Eminence and destroyed the aging Imperial vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Eminence was created by \"Ello137\" in his winning entry for the Braha'tok-class gunship in the StarWars.com Hyperspace feature \"What's The Story?,\" which allowed fans to provide backstories for certain aspects of the Star Wars saga.
