Zeto was increasingly frustrated by the five consecutive wins by racer Dooarix Gyll and hired Tal Feint, a Muun investigator to discover if they were cheating. When Feint pointed out that Gyll was using his companion Lisali Mitillan as a spotter, Zeto and his thugs confronted the pair and threatened them with a vibroblade. Mitillan used the Force to throw Zeto against a wall, knocking him unconscious. Geist used his own power of persuasion to send Zeto's hired hands running, though they dragged Zeto out of the garage without prompting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
