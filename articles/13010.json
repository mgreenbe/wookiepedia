Born in 40 BBY to parents she would never again see, Offee was discovered by the Jedi Order during infancy and was brought to the Jedi Temple on the galactic capital of Coruscant. When it came time for her to start training as a Jedi Padawan, she embarked under the tutelage of Jedi Master Luminara Unduli, another Mirialan, who instructed her in the ways of the Force and also in the traditions of their shared heritage. In 22 BBY, during the escalating Separatist Crisis, Offee joined Unduli in helping Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, settle a border dispute on Ansion. Their efforts resulted in an accord between the Unity of Community and the native Alwari tribes, preventing the key backwater world from seceding from the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Offee was thereafter part of the Jedi task force that went to rescue Kenobi, Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from Geonosis, where the Confederacy of Independent Systems had sentenced them to execution. The ensuing Battle of Geonosis sparked the Clone Wars, in which Offee became a Jedi Commander, leading clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic alongside her Master. Besides defending the Jedi Order's Crystal Caves of Ilum and employing her healing skills on New Holstice and Null, Offee formed a friendship with fellow Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the Padawan of Anakin Skywalker, during the Second Battle of Geonosis. That campaign saw Offee and Tano obliterate a major Geonosian battle droid foundry and they quelled a following outbreak of mind-controlling Geonosian brain worms. In 20 BBY, Offee was assigned to the crew of Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7 on Drongar. Despite the growing temptation of the dark side Offee passed the trial and graduated to Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Believing that the Jedi had fallen from the light as a result of their heightened militancy in fighting the Clone Wars, she worked with activist Letta Turmond to orchestrate a bombing of the Jedi Temple as a demonstration of her misgivings. Offee then framed her friend Tano for the bombing, as well as for her subsequent murder of Turmond. Although Offee posed as ex-Separatist bounty hunter Asajj Ventress to further manipulate Tano and ensure her friend's arrest, Skywalker discovered the truth. After Skywalker defeated her, Offee confessed to her crimes at Tano's trial before being taken into Republic custody. At some point near the end of the war, Offee was released and took Zonder as her padawan. While on Felucia, she was leading a squad until she was killed when Order 66 was issued by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, marking her a victim of the Great Jedi Purge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born on a starliner in deep space, Offee was brought to the Jedi Temple, where she would spend her early years in study of the Force.

Unduli made a deal to the Unity: The Jedi would put an end to a conflict between the 'city-folk' and the Alwari natives if Ansion agreed to stay within the Galactic Republic and abide by their rules. The conflict was over land, so Unduli also said that they would get the Alwari to agree to share half or more of their land. The Unity agreed and the Jedi left."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Jedi could set off on their mission, two Alwari named Kyakhta and Bulgan were hired by Soergg to capture one of the Padawans. They caught Offee and held her prisoner, however both the Alwari were mentally impaired and so Offee managed to gain their trust by healing them. After this Kyakhta and Bulgan agreed to act as guides for the Jedi, as to secure the treaty with the Alwari, they would first have to find them\u2014specifically, the Borokii overclan. The Jedi left the city shortly after, riding suubatar. They shortly had more trouble with gairks in a stream but overcame this as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually the Jedi managed to meet with the Yiwa\u2014a lesser though not unimportant clan of the Alwari Qiemo Adrangar tribal faction. At first, the Yiwa were mistrustful of the Jedi, and the Highborn clan leader, Mazong, requested that they each give a performance that would demonstrate that, beyond ability, they also possessed \"inner essence, unlike the representatives of the great but soulless Senate\", and that after this, the Yiwa would decide whether or not to tell the Jedi where the overclan was. Offee gave an acrobatics display of movement and light (using her lightsaber), which greatly impressed the Alwari, as well as Skywalker. After the other Jedi had given their presentationst, the Yiwa told them where the overclan could be found, and they set off again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the Jedi came across a group of Gwurran. After humoring the pygmy-like creatures' intense curiosity concerning the strange \"outlanders,\" the Jedi left, but Tooqui\u2014a Gwurran\u2014came with them. It was shortly after that the Jedi met with a non-traditional clan of traders called the Qulun. The Jedi and their Ansionian guides were offered food and accepted into their camp. The clan leader Baiuntu, however, was working for Soergg, and managed to capture the Jedi. Luckily, Tooqui got away, and shortly after rescued the six of them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi soon came upon the Borokii overclan, to whom they gave their proposal. The Borokii agreed, but only on the grounds that the Jedi settle a conflict that existed between the Borokii and their longtime rival, the Januul, another overclan. The Jedi agreed and ultimately managed to settle the conflict diplomatically. They then returned to the capital city, Cuipernam, where they were again delayed by Soergg, who had hired thugs to dispatch them. However the Jedi managed to make it to the gathering of the Unity, which was in the process of voting on the matter of secession. Due to the fact that the Jedi had settled the border dispute, the Unity voted to stay within the Republic.

Afterward they were buried under a large amount of debris. Worried they would die from lack of air, Tano pulled a power cell apart, activating her comlink so their masters could find them.

Later in the ship, Trap tried to infect them with the worms; Offee was forced to kill him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After discovering the clones upon their ship were being controlled by brain worms, Offee and Tano separated. Offee was heading to the engineering section to disable the ship's engines when she walked into a trap set by the clones. She was unable to resist as the clones exposed her to a brain worm, and then succumbed to the worm's influence. When she found Tano, the two began a duel. Tano tried to convince Offee to resist being controlled, and was ignored as Offee continued the attack. Later on, after Tano released coolant that affected the brain worms' control, Offee confronted her in the cockpit. After having super-cooled air blown onto her face, she was able to regain enough control to beg Tano to kill her, ensuring the worm's death. Tano refused.

Offee, a gifted healer, assisted one of the medical units on the planet. Unknown to her, a spy was sneaking around the camp and several corrupt Republic representatives were shipping off bota illegally for their own profit. Offee also met the deadly martial arts instructor, Phow Ji, who despised the Jedi. Ji tested Offee to her limit, but she did not give in to the dark side.

Offee 'helped' Tano in hiding and was secretly involved with giving her instructions. Tano contacted Offee through a public comlink so that the clones could not track her or Offee. Offee led Tano to a warehouse so that Tano would be able to find out who set her up, when someone with Ventress's lightsabers and mask engaged Tano in a duel, which ended when Tano fell off a balcony and landed near crates of nano-droids\u2014similar to those used in the bombing\u2014and was found by the clones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Tano's trial was taking place, Skywalker found Ventress, who told him that someone other than herself was behind it, someone who took her weapons and mask.

When Offee's group arrived at their site, they saw that the defenders consisted mostly of sentients, rather than droids, and realized they could not simply blast their way into the center. Padawan Drake Lo'gaan, who had accompanied Secura to the planet, enlisted Galle's help for his plan. In order for the Padawans to infiltrate the water plant, Zonder drew the attention of the Gossam Commandos, while Galle and the Padawans attacked, striking down the droids. The Padawans then detached from Galle's squad, moving into position near the center. Lo'gaan commed Galle, ordering him to activate the next phase of the plan, and Galle called for a retreat.

This was proven when she and Ahsoka Tano blew up a droid factory from the inside in the Second Battle of Geonosis, even with the full knowledge that they would probably be destroyed along with it. Fortunately, they both survived because they were inside a heavily armored tank. Offee became friends with Tano during the mission. Shortly after this incident, while escorting a medical frigate, Offee was infected by one of the Geonosian brain worms which had taken over the ship. While dueling Tano, she managed to resist the worm's influence for a moment\u2014only to plead with Tano to kill her as she believed that was the only way to stop the parasites.

After being made a Jedi Knight, Offee was still uncertain if she deserved to be granted this rank, but after resisting the lure of the dark side during a mission on Drongar, she became more confident about her promotion. Offee was known to have an somewhat unorthodox view of the Force as she believed that the light side and the dark side were only words and the Force was neither good nor evil, whereas most Jedi believed the light side was good and the dark side was evil."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, she began to doubt the Jedi Order's role as peacekeepers and eventually came to the conclusion that the Jedi Council only believed in violence. Offee decided that the Council were nothing more than arrogant, violent tyrants, and was determined to bring down the Order since she became convinced that it had become corrupt. However, Offee's change of heart shaped her into a zealot who was prepared to allow her friend Ahsoka Tano to almost be executed, and to kill innocents such as Letta Turmond as well as many clone troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Offee also manipulated and lied to the Order, allowing Tano to be blamed for the bombing. Nevertheless, Offee did confess eventually. When placed on trial, Offee stated defiantly that the Jedi Order were pawns of the dark side.

She also showed an impressive talent for stealth being able to evade the Force senses of both Ahsoka Tano and Asajj Ventress, both of whom had considerable Force senses. Offee was able to stun Ventress, a well known Jedi killer who had previously slain even Jedi Masters, effortlessly by ambushing her and telekinetically hurling debris at her before slamming her over the head with a pipe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like her Master, Offee practiced the Soresu fighting style and her ability with her lightsaber was great enough for her to survive the ferocious battle of Geonosis, even though she wasn't on the gunships that rescued the Jedi.

This could be seen clearly when fighting alongside her Master\u2014together she and Unduli were a formidable team in combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After turning to the dark side, Offee's fighting style grew more ferocious and she seemed to mirror Asajj Ventress' aggressive technique as noted by Ahsoka Tano who thought she was dueling Ventress when Offee attacked her, although this was more because of the fact that Offee was using Ventress' lightsabers rather than her fighting style. However, having dueled Ventress several times, Tano would probably have noticed if Offee was using a different style, so it is heavily implied that Offee was trained in the use of Makashi as well as Soresu.
