When the organization came into possession of the book that would become known as the Smuggler's Guide, the Adarian Twirm served as submister to the syndicate's head Latts Razzi. Razzi demanded that Twirm tell her where book came from and if it was authentic, prompting the submister to inform her of how the syndicate acquired the book. Razzi berated Twirm for providing information she did not care about, instead wishing to know about the origins of the book. Razzi had Twirm executed after he offered her advice on how to run the syndicate, after which she complained at how hard it was to find good help within her line of work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Submister was first used in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide, which was written by Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
