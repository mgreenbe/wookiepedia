Shaardan, hoping to gain favor with Master Uthar Wynn, waited for another student to wander into the tomb of Ajunta Pall and retrieve his sword. Unfortunately for him, the student who recovered it was Revan. Shaardan confronted Revan near the entrance of Pall's tomb. He had hoped to intimidate Revan into giving him the sword. However, Revan refused and an angered Shaardan attacked Revan, but was slain.
