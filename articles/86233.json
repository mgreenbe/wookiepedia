The prisoner, who chose to speak Ryl rather than Basic, was at first reluctant to trust Revan, but eventually complied and told Revan to give him enough truth serum to put him into a catatonic state. Revan did so, slowly putting him into shock. In return, the prisoner gave him the location of his cache, hidden under a trap door in his ship. The prisoner then passed out; the interrogator decided to take him away and dump him somewhere barren, inadvertently allowing him a chance to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, in an ironic twist of events, Uthar Wynn had recently had the prisoner's ship scrapped for parts, assuming it had been thoroughly scanned for the weapons cache.
