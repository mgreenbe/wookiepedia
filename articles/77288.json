Like many Selkath after the Sith Empire's attack on Manaan in the Great Galactic War, the Trade League was sympathetic towards the Republic's campaign against the Sith, and was impressed by the actions of the Barsen'thor on Corellia and Makeb. The League met with Tai Cordan, president of Balmorra, to negotiate kolto rates following the resumption of hostilities during the Galactic War; after learning of the Balmorran's association with the Jedi Master, the Selkath's normally chilly attitude towards offworlders softened and his negotiations became more cordial."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
