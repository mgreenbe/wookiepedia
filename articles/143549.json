It was composed by John Williams and first appeared in the film The Empire Strikes Back. The theme is based on the well known funeral march from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor and on \"Mars, the Bringer of War\" by Gustav Holst."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the best known symphonic movie themes, it is a classic example of a leitmotiv, a recurrent theme associated with characters or events in a drama. \"The Imperial March\" is the theme music that represents the authoritarian Galactic Empire. As Anakin Skywalker is stripped of all individuality, he, in essence, becomes one with the Empire as Darth Vader; hence the reason the march is often associated with him as well. \"The Imperial March\" represents all that is the Empire; therefore, it is nearly equivalent to a galactic anthem. To the Galactic Empire, \"The Imperial March\" represents strength, order, and control. However, to the Rebel Alliance, it is symbolic of tyranny, oppression, and hate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although played by an orchestra on the movie soundtrack, it is often played by brass bands; military bands are particularly effective in delivering the theme's martial stance. \"The Imperial March\" was also played by No Doubt at some of their live concerts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the game Star Wars: Force Commander, the menu music was a \"March\" remix with a rock/metal flavor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On a few occasions, \"The Imperial March\" has been used to introduce Mr. Burns on the television series The Simpsons. Additionally, it has been used as a background musical piece by radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh when discussing subjects relating to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. In some National Hockey League games, the music is used at the beginning of powerplay opportunities. The march is used when an opponent enters the field at a Cleveland Browns, Indians or Cavaliers game. The music is also played at home games of the New York Yankees when announcing the players of the opposing team (in contrast to music heard during the Rebel Alliance's award ceremony in A New Hope being played to announce the home players)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Use"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In the movies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"The Imperial March\" is first heard in The Empire Strikes Back at the beginning of the film when probe droids are sent from an Imperial Star Destroyer down to Hoth. This version is played by flutes and is barely audible. The most familiar rendition of the theme first plays when Darth Vader is re-introduced as Death Squadron assembles. It is played throughout the film nearly every time the Death Squadron or Darth Vader appears, most notably during the track \"The Battle of Hoth\" as the Executor is seen approaching Hoth and as Vader enters Echo Base after the battle. It is then used in the beginning of \"The Asteroid Field\" as the Millennium Falcon tries to evade the attacking Star Destroyers and, in a more powerful form, during \"Han Solo and the Princess\" as the Death Squadron blasts its way through the asteroid field and as the Executor emerges from the asteroids. Later the tune is shortly heard during the end of \"The Training of a Jedi Knight,\" as the bounty hunters assemble on the Executor, \"Yoda and the Force\" when Captain Needa departs the Avenger to apologize to Darth Vader, and \"Imperial Starfleet Deployed\" as the Falcon is seen hanging on the back of the Avenger's command tower. Then, in a more dramatic form, it was played during the duel between Vader and Luke, known as \"The Clash of Lightsabers,\" when Vader uses the Force to throw objects at Luke. It also appears in \"Rescue from Cloud City/Hyperspace\" when Darth Vader reveals to Luke that he is his father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is used in a powerful form in Return of the Jedi, when Emperor Palpatine is seen arriving on the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station. As Luke unmasks Vader at the end of Jedi, the theme is carried somberly by high-range strings; as Vader dies, the tune is heard one last time as a dirge played by the harp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"The Imperial March\" theme appears scarcely in the prequel trilogy, but is often used to hint at Anakin Skywalker's future as Darth Vader. Its usage increases through the trilogy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few notes of \"The Imperial March\" are played in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace in a scene where Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda discuss the future of Anakin Skywalker on Naboo. The main few notes of \"The Imperial March\" are heard in \"The Droid Battle.\" It is also heard at the sinister end to \"Anakin's Theme,\" played during the end credits, along with Darth Vader's breathing, indicating that the prequel trilogy will show how Anakin became Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the next film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, \"The Imperial March\" is played subtly and so faintly that it's barely audible when Yoda senses Anakin's slaughter of the Tusken Raiders. The first notes of the march are heard again, slightly louder this time, after Anakin confesses the deed to Padm\u00e9. At the end of the movie, the full version accompanies the deployment of the Grand Army of the Republic, hinting at the eventual link between clone troopers and stormtroopers, and as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is shown observing the deployment of the Army from a balcony, foreshadowing his becoming the Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, \"The Imperial March\" is first played when Anakin rebukes the Jedi Council for denying him the rank of Jedi Master, although being appointed to the Council. The track can also be heard when Anakin tells Mace Windu about Palpatine's true identity. It is later played when Anakin is dubbed as the Sith Darth Vader, shortly after the death of Mace Windu. \"The Imperial March\" is quoted when Clone Troopers find dead Wookiees on Kashyyyk and when Padm\u00e9 confronts Anakin on Mustafar. A few notes of the \"March\" are played when Vader arrives on Mustafar to kill the Separatists. The piece is played more clearly during the \"Battle of the Heroes\" scene between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader at the movie's climax and in the simultaneous battle between Yoda and Palpatine. It is also played when Darth Vader receives his armor and when he looks up at the first Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film),\"The Imperial March\" is heard when Anakin talks with Jabba the Hutt about what he's done with Ahsoka Tano and Jabba accuses for Anakin coming to his palace to take his life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, \"The Imperial March\" is briefly reprised when Kylo Ren confides his inner conflict to the burnt helmet of Darth Vader aboard the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, \"The Imperial March\" makes a prominent appearance during Vader's meeting with Director Krennic on Mustafar. A fragment of it is played at the end of the movie as well, as Vader watches the Tantive IV escaping from the docking bay of the Profundity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, a brief reprise of the theme is heard as Supreme Leader Snoke discusses with Ren his desire to be like Vader and how he is falling short of that goal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Solo: A Star Wars Story, the theme appears prominently as the film transitions from Han Solo's escape from Corellia to his time as an Imperial infantryman on Mimban. It is also heard as the soundtrack of the advert playing at the shuttle station that encourages Han to join the Imperial forces. This is the first use ever of the Imperial March as diegetic music in a Star Wars movie."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker the theme is present many times: during the appearance of Darth Vader's helmet, the rise of Sith Star Destroyers, the destruction of Kijimi, and in the Death Star's wreckage."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In the Expanded Universe"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The soundtrack to Shadows of the Empire by Joel McNeely samples a small part of \"The Imperial March\" in the \"Night Skies\" theme.
