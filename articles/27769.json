As Groggin goes to melt down the lightsaber, the Sith Lord Darth Vader enters the Smelting Core and demands Groggin to give him the severed hand. Groggin, ignorant as to who he is speaking with, demands 2,000 credits in payment for the hand. Vader proceeds to Force Choke Groggin to death and takes the severed hand, still holding Skywalker's lightsaber. As Vader boards his shuttle to take the hand and weapon to the Emperor, he briefly considers cloning Skywalker from the cells in the severed hand and taking the clone on as his apprentice, but Darth Sidious senses Vader's deception and orders him to take the hand and lightsaber to the storehouse at Mount Tantiss on Wayland."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
