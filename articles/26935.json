During the mission on Hutta, the Agent earned the notice of Darth Jadus, a member of the Dark Council who oversaw Imperial Intelligence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving on Hutta, the Agent rented a room in Poison Pit cantina, located across from Nem'ro's Palace in Jiguuna. The room was secured and used to make a contact with the Keeper on Dromund Kaas. They then met with an Imperial Intelligence contact Jheeg. He provided the Agent with a cover identity of the Red Blade, a notorious pirate. The plan was for the Agent to infiltrate Nem'ro's inner circle by bringing him valuable tributes that Imperial Intelligence sent for this mission. However the tributes were stolen at the docks by thugs working for Nem'ro's rival, Voontara Fa'athra. The Agent tracked down the thieves, recovered the tributes and entered Nem'ro's palace to seek an audience with the Hutt. Nem'ro was pleased by the valuables brought to him and gave the Agent permission to operate around Jiguuna, as well as a private room in his palace as a sign of gratitude. The room was full of hidden surveillance devices which had to be removed before a secured contact with the Keep was made. The plan was made to gain the trust of Karrels Javis, one of Nem'ro's lieutenants, who was seeking to restore his favor in Nem'ro's eyes over that of his Twi'lek rival, Toth'lazhen. On the way to meet with Javis, the Agent encountered a smuggler named Dheno Rey, who claimed that Red Blade owed him some credits. When he was dealt with, the meeting took place. Javis's plan to regain Nem'ro's favor required the Agent to recover ore stolen by the Evocii. To further help Javis, Keeper ordered the Agent to cripple Fa'athra's gas mining operation. However, after the mission Keeper revealed that Javis' sons - out running cargo in Imperial space - had gotten into conflict with a Sith, resulting in one of them dying and the other becoming severely crippled, forcing the Agent to eliminate Javis as he would reject the Empire for the injuries of his children. Offering services to Toth'lazhen, the Agent implicated Fa'athra in Javis' murder. The next step was stealing holo-recordings from Fa'athra's palace and forging them to make it appear like Fa'athra was linked with the Galactic Republic. This false evidence forced Nem'ro to align with the Empire. It was towards the end of this mission that the Agent gained the services of the Rattataki criminal Kaliyo Djannis, one of Nem'ro's enforcers, who was aware of the truth behind Javis' murder. After the mission was completed, the Agent was recalled to the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas. While preparing to leave for Vaiken Spacedock, the Agent and Kaliyo encountered the real Red Blade, and were forced to kill him when the Blade threatened to reveal the deception to Nem'ro."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dromund Kaas"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Dromund Kaas, the Agent met with Keeper and Watcher Two, who would be the Agent's liaison officer for the next several missions. The first missions was to deal with a dissident movement partly linked to the slave uprising on Dromund Kaas. The target was a Rodian slave named Jurithus who was part of the rebellion at the Unfinished colossus. He was owned by an anti-government radical who used him to deliver messages to his fellow dissidents. During this mission, the Agent infiltrated a slave rebellion headquarters in search for rebellion leader.. After defeating the Rebellion leader, they injected him with SLV-16 interrogation serum to extract the information about Jurithus' whereabouts. The drugged leader revealed that Jurithus died in a fight beneath the colossus. The Agent found his body and recovered the datapad where he kept the messages exchanged between the dissidents. The Agent's outstanding performance of the given task caught the attention of Lord Jadus who requested the Agent to meet him in his chambers at the Imperial Citadel. The previously recovered data provided a new lead, an imperial scientist named Theovor Mindak who was working for a rogue Sith Lord Grathan. The Agent was sent to Nexus Room Cantina to search for his daughter, Samara Mindak. The Agent confronted Samara and extracted security codes to the her father's lab. They then proceed to Grathan's estate, infiltrated Mindak's lab, defeated him and downloaded the data from his computer. The gathered information revealed that the dissidents were planning to detonate the power conduits running beneath Kaas City. Keeper wanted to assemble a squad of imperial agents for a mission into the Dark Temple to stop the saboteurs from destroying Kaas City. However, Darth Jadus overruled Keeper and ordered the Agent to do this mission alone in order to reduce the possibility of disturbing the spirits of dead Sith Lords inside the temple. Inside the temple, the Agent eliminated the terrorist cell and disabled their explosives. After defeating the saboteurs on Dromund Kaas, word came that Darth Jadus had been assassinated, along with thousands of dignitaries, Sith and slaves, in the destruction of the Imperial dreadnought Dominator during a tour of Imperial space. Immediately afterwards, a message was transmitted throughout the entire Empire by a terrorist leader known only as \"The Eagle\", a former Imperial starfighter pilot and veteran of the Great Galactic War. The Eagle claimed responsibility for the destruction of the Dominator, accused imperial government of corruption and promised more attacks with a goal to changing the government. After the transmission ended, the Keeper was informed of a terrorist ship trying to flee Kaas city. He sent the Agent to Cargo Port A3 to intercept. They planted a mouse droid on the ship which disabled the hyperdrive and downloaded the data from its computer. For a success in the Dark Temple and in Cargo Port A3, the Agent received a promotion to Cipher Agent, and would now be known as Cipher Nine. Along with the new rank, they were given a X-70B Phantom starship to utilize in the upcoming missions."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The hunt for the Eagle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keeper instructed Cipher Nine to hunt down and destroy the Eagle's major terrorist allies and financial backers.

The Empire faced a fierce resistance on this world which was secretly backed by the Republic. Nine's target was \"Gray Star\", an ally of the Eagle who was aligned with the Balmorran resistance. Watcher Two instructed Nine to contact Security Chief Lekern Renald who was running a intelligence operations on Balmorra. He suggested that the best way to get to Gray Star is to infiltrate the Balmorran terrorist cell. Sanju Pyne, an Imperial infiltrator in the Resistance, aided Nine's effort to infiltrate their ranks by introducing Nine to local cell commander Chemish Or. Sanju stated that Nine was inspired by the Eagle's speech and wanted to join their organization. Suspicious at first, Chemish tested the new recruit by sending Nine to recover shielded power cores for stealth droids inside the Okara Droid Factory which they planned to convert into the stealth bomb. After recovering the case of cores, Nine was contacted by Sanju via comlink. He revealed that the terrorists intend to use the equipment to attack Sobrik and suggested to sabotage the cores. Nine brought the case back to Chemish, who gave Nine another mission which involved recovering data from an old terrorist training camp's computer inside a cave on the Gorinth Plateau. The camp was poisoned by the recent imperial gas bombing of the area which drove the resistance members inside the camp insane. Nine stormed the cave and installed a transmitter into the computer to transfer the data to Sanju who was waiting outside. By inspecting the data it turned out it was a list of Balmorrans who collaborated with the Empire. He suggested giving a copy of the list to the imperial command to protect the people on the list before turning it to Chemish. She was impressed by Nine's abilities and tasked them to deliver a package to a cell member who infiltrated the Republic base in the Balmorran Arms Factory. Inside the factory, Nine was contacted by Sanju once again to inform them that this cell member was in fact Gray Star who was posing as an Republic officer and had been secretly supplying the terrorists with Republic weapons. However, the Republic suspected him of spying and detained him which was the reason Chermish sent the package with maps and instructions how to escape to a safe house. Sanju suggested altering the instructions and send him into a trap which would allow them to manipulate the entire cell. Alternatively, the Gray Star had be eliminated."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Nar Shaddaa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Next mission was to eliminated Eagle's terrorist cell operating on Nar Shaddaa. Nine was sent to investigate an emergence of a powerful new stimulant called \"Cyclone\" that Eagle's agents used to dramatically boost their strength. However, the Cyclone had a lethal side effect. Watcher Two instructed Nine to meet with a former Intelligence operative Watcher X, who was kept inside an imperial prison in Shadow Town. He told Nine that the Cyclone was being sold on Nar Shaddaa streets. He provided a location of augmentation shop in Corellian sector that might sell it. Nine went to the shop and acquired a sample of Cyclone. Watcher X wanted to analyse the sample to determine the manufacturer of the stimulant, but did not possess the proper equipment to do so. He instructed Nine to take the sample to an old medical lab in Duros Sector. They managed to find a working bioscanner to perform the analysis. Watcher X was able to determine that Synchet Industries was involved in the production of the Cyclone. He sent Nine to question Jordel Tlan, a former employee of the corporation, who had been living isolated in his apartment in one of the casinos. To get to him Nine planned to blackmail him by first poisoning him and then offering an antidote. At the entrance of his room, they put the poison into the drink which was delivered to him by a serving droid. The plan worked, and desperate to get the antidote, he let Nine into his apartment where he revealed that an unknown group bought Synchet Industries medical division VerveGen Corporation. In order to infiltrated the VerveGen facilities, Watcher X performed a surgical insertion of several metal parts into Nine's body in order to disguise them as a droid. With the cover Nine infiltrated the VerveGen and found new owners (Raythen Predot, Chorto Rinn and Aphel Jaarn) in a holographic meeting with Eagle. Nine removed the droid cover and engaged Eagle's agents. Realizing that they were in a hopeless situation, some of them used Cyclone during the fight. Still Nine defeated them all. A sole survivor of the fight was a cyborg Aphel Jaarn. Nine connected Watcher X's computer with cyborg's brain, who was to extract information about the location of communication hub used by Eagle's cell operating on Nar Shaddaa. After the eliminating of VerveGen leaders and preventing the distribution of Cyclone to other Eagle's cells, Nine was sent to destroy the communication hub in Network Access area.

Despite Zhorrid's desire for his live capture, Nine killed Yanol, earning a ranting condemnation (including being slapped across the face) by Zhorrid upon the Agent's return to Dromund Kaas."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Tatooine"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to the hunt, Watcher Two showed an intercepted transmission from the Eagle describing \"Eradicators\", techno-organic satellite weapons capable of destruction on a massive scale, and his threat to use them against the Empire. The trail thus led to Tatooine and the \"Ghost cell\", a near-mythical group of assassins that provided training to the Eagle's terror network. Nine was sent to search for a former cell member Mia Hawkins who contacted the Intelligence in attempt to defect. Upon arriving in Mos Ila, she contacted Nine via public holotransmitter. To prevent Ghost cell member finding her hideout she instructed Nine to first gather imperial security holocams from the droids around Mos Ila and then take them to a local droid seller Datto Wys. There she arranged for Datto to trade a mouse droid for the holocams. When Nine bought the mouse droid, it lead them to the Mia's hideout. The two met and she told Nine that she trained with the cell but was sickened by their brutal methods. In exchange for a way out, she was willing to help Imperial Intelligence dismantle the cell. However, she did not know the exact location of the village, where the cell trained her, since they subdued her whenever they moved her in or out of the village. She suggested that they should identify a smuggler called \"Dragon Eyes\" who secretly supplied the village. Nine went into local cantina, tagged the customers with tracking devices and then publicly inquired about \"Dragon Eyes\". One of the customers run out to warn \"Dragon Eyes\" about someone looking for him. Since Nine made her presence known, Mia feared that they are now being followed by the Ghost cell assassin. In order to get rid of them, they set an ambush inside an abandoned wind farm warehouse. In the meantime it turned out that \"Dragon Eyes\" was a local Exchange member named Milosh Varta. Nine raided his estate and interrogated him about the location of ghost cell's stronghold. He revealed a location of a supply line, before Nine killed him. They then infiltrated the stronghold through a secret supply line by hiding inside a supply crate. Inside the stronghold, Nine put down the Ghost cell and confronted its leader, known only as the Old Man. He revealed that it was his plan to let Mia go and use her as a bait for Nine. In intended to use Nine's identity to infiltrated the Imperial Intelligence ranks as a Cipher Agent. Nine then fought and killed him.

The target was a former nobleman named Denri Ayl, who acted as a mediator between the various houses of Alderaan. Meeting up with Diplomatic Service emissary Vector Hyllus, who had become a Killik Joiner during his time on Alderaan, Nine went to House Cortess, allies of the Empire-backed House Thul. Despite initial hostility, Nine gained an audience with the Cortess leaders, Baron Peyar and Baroness Chay. With Hyllus' aid, Nine entered the stronghold of House Alde to confirm that Ayl was the financial backer of the Eagle's terror network, and then tracked Ayl himself to the House Rist. Searching through Ayl's logs after killing him, however, Nine discovered that Ayl's efforts to gain the services of the Rists, renowned as a family of professional assassins, had been initiated by Baroness Chay herself. The Cortess estate was equipped with enough shielding and weaponry to hold off an attacking army or a Killik swarm, forcing Nine to find another way in. With the aid of Hyllus and his Killik nest, Nine infiltrated the Cortess estate's power generator hidden in the Glarus Valley and used Killik larvae to destroy the generators before assaulting the estate itself. Entering the throne room, Baron Peyar surrendered, and the Baroness was slain by Captain Perovius, head of the Cortess House Guard. Though the actual traitor was dead, Nine condemned the remainder of the House to death, leaving the Cortess estate to Hyllus' Killiks to form a new hive.

The Eagle's computer only had half of the command codes to the Eradicators; the other was in the hands of his Sith patron. If the full code was not transmitted within a certain period, the Eradicators would go ballistic and attack at random, rather than at the designated targets.

While Jadus outlined his plan, Watcher Two secretly spoke over the comm implant; in order to keep Jadus' focus, Nine would have to activate the Eradicators, thus resulting in thousands of deaths, before Jadus could be stopped. After activating the Eradicators, Nine quickly deactivated the jamming signal and sabotaged the ship's shields and hyperdrive, rendering it unable to escape. Watcher Two was able to call for reinforcements, including three members of the Dark Council, leaving Nine to deal with Jadus himself. Despite the fact that Jadus' powers of the Force were second only to that of the Emperor himself, Nine was able to withstand Jadus' fury while diverting necessary power for Watcher Two to encase Jadus in a ray shield, to hold him long enough for the reinforcements to arrive.

The new Keeper leaked a false information about a Cipher Agent trying to defect to SIS and Nine was appointed to take the role of the this agent. Under the guise of defection, Nine first meet SIS Agent Hunter in one of the Nar Shaddaa casinos, who gave them a mission to test the genuineness of their intentions. The mission involved infiltration of an imperial droid factory on Nar Shaddaa that became operational after Nem'ro allied with the Empire. Hunter who was giving the instructions over comlink, ordered Nine to download the cortosis armored droid blueprint and then sabotage the factory. After the mission, Nine met with Kothe and his team in their hideout. Kothe welcomed Nine into his team and assigned them a call-sign \"Legate\".

During the mission Nine was supported by SIS agent \"Chance\" and began by investigating an old laboratory of Republic scientist Nasan Godera. They located the lab with the help of an Imperial communication center led by Lieutenant Needa. Inside the lab Nine found an Imperial Intelligence Fixer agent Doctor Lokin, who claimed to be sent by Watcher Four to search the lab. He provided the next lead in tracking down Ki Sazen - an abandoned bio-research facility that used to be the workplace of a scientist named Doctor Dorant. Unfortunately, Lokin did not know the exact location of the facility and Nine had to use scanners to triangulate its position. There Nine encountered a group of Ki Sazen's Nikto warriors, who revealed that their master obtained an Ultrawave Transmitter, technology developed by Godera that could control the rakghouls of Taris. However, the device was broken. One group of Nikto were tasked to search for a scientist Doctor Ianna Cel, who could fix it, while the other group was sent to collect the data on rakghoul colony movements that would allow Ki Sazen to to position the device. Nine defeated the group of Nikto inside Dorant's lab and met with Lokin back at Godera's lab. Lokin suggested Nine to use the sensor equipment from the Taris settlers to gather the data on rakghoul colony movements. While Nine was using the scanners around the devastated landscape, they were contacted by Chance, who had tracked down Doctor Cel inside the Dynamet General Hospital but got wounded in the process. He used the mind-control code and ordered Nine to come to his rescue. Nine rushed to the given coordinates where they found Chance. He tried to use the mind-control again to instruct Nine to heal him but he faded before he could finish the keyword. Nine then left him to die and searched out Cel. In the meantime, Lokin had infiltrated the hospital using a stealth generator. He suggested that he should pose as Cel's assistant and that she should make a public announcement that her assistant was lost inside the hospital. He would then get captured by Ki Sazen's Nikto warriors and brought to her hideout where he could signal the coordinates. Nine agreed to the plan and went to destroy Republic jamming stations nearby, ensuring that Lokin's signal reached them.

Nine then stormed the base, where the Cipher confronted and eliminated Ki Sazen. Shortly after that, a rakghoul appeared and started to tear the remaining Nikto warriors apart. When approaching Nine, it started to transform into a human who turned out to be Doctor Lokin. Back at the base, Lokin explained that he was not sent by Imperial Intelligence and admitted that he was on a personal mission to develop a reversible rakghoul virus that allowed him to switch between the two forms.

Watcher X reminded Nine that brainwashing of this type was an Imperial tactic, not a Republic one - which meant that Imperial Intelligence had betrayed Nine to the Republic. Secretly entering the archives in Imperial Intelligence HQ back on Dromund Kaas, Nine discovered that the brainwashing had indeed been ordered by Intelligence. Watcher X instructed Nine to disable the power generators inside the archives in order to prevent being monitored. When the power was down Nine started to search through archives for the clues. By searching the first terminal, they found a record of Security Directive 101-3A where the former Keeper, now Minister of Intelligence, approved the Castellan restraints on Cipher Nine. While the Dark Council acknowledged Nine's skill, the Agent had directly opposed a Sith Lord, which was unacceptable to them. To spare Cipher Nine from execution, the former Keeper was forced to approve a mind control program. In the second terminal, Nine found a record of an Imperial scientist, which indicated that a substance called IX serum was being used to perform the brainwashing. It also indicated that the process is irreversible and the only possible solution to disable the conditioning was to use IX serum to reprogram the command codes. Further search through the records revealed that the Empire ran out of IX serum and the chemicals required for it could be found on the poisonous world of Quesh. Upon docking to the Quesh space station, they were greeted by an Imperial traffic control officer who inquired about their business. Nine pretended to be part of a surprise inspection sent to check the Imperial supplies of Quesh chemicals. They were directed to Administrator Kroius, head of the supply depot. Unfortunately, Kroius informed Nine that they run out of the dimalium-6. Nine then attacked the Republic mine and secured a ready supply of the required chemical.

Nine then went to the expedition launch point, where the agent found several Imperials speaking to the admiral over holotransmitter. Nine informed Davos that Intelligence would oversee the expedition and that Nine would join him. However, Davos sought the wreck for himself and ordered his men to attack Nine. After Nine eliminated the attackers, they were contacted by a Chiss sergeant who offered them a refuge. Nine they went to the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force outpost and met with Human female Ensign Raina Temple, who worked for the Chiss. To track down the Admiral, she instructed Nine to investigate the supply caches that were being transported into White Maw territory by Davos' men. The investigation revealed that the caches were given to the pirates in exchange for a safe passage through their territory. Nine then went inside the cave system called the \"Bone Pits\", where Davos' men met with the pirates in order to negotiate the deal.

The dossiers included Kanjon Slyke, an escape artist whose brother was killed trying to break into Ward 23; Ohta, an ex-Mandalorian; Chaney Barrow, an Exchange slicer; and Paarkos, a male Gand with the ability to see through walls. Nine broke into their prisons and rigged the cell doors with explosives, before going to one of the control towers, where the Agent contacted the prisoners and provided them with coordinates to a meeting place. While doing so, Nine was interrupted by the SCORPIO security program for the first time, and it seemed to be able to use the entire prison security network. Nine met the prisoner gang inside a nearby cave. Upon arriving, the Agent was threatened by Ohta. Nine quickly made an example of him by shooting him dead in front of the of the gang. Posing as a fellow prisoner, the Agent persuaded them to help break into Megasecurity Ward 23. However, they would need certain equipment to do so. Chaney suggested raiding the prison medical center. When they entered the facility, they were again interrupted by SCORPIO, which released the SLV-88 mind control aerosol into the air ventilation system. Controlled by the SLV-88, the gang attacked Nine, who had to incapacitate them. After destroying the vents to prevent further intoxication, they grabbed the necessary equipment. However some crucial parts were still missing and Nine had to acquire them from other sections of the prison. These parts were a carbonite trap, a maranium power battery, and anti-radiation serum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next step was to plant a virus into the security droids to disrupt SCORPIO. Nine inserted the virus in numerous warden droids around the prison and destroyed the droid maintenance facility to prevent it from erasing the virus. Nine then infiltrated Megasecurity Ward 23 using the carbonite trap to disguise the Cipher's life readings. Inside, the Agent used the radiation of the maranium power battery to melt the vault doors and anti-radiation serum to neutralize the negative biological effects of the radiation. When Nine entered the main vault, the Agent was attacked by SCORPIO, which turned out to be a droid that was built by conspirators to protect their vault. After defeating SCORPIO, the Agent found the contents of the vault. It contained stasis chambers with past members of the conspiracy organization that Hunter was part of. They spoke with Nine through the holoterminal and revealed that their organization was called the Star Cabal. They claimed they were created after the Great Hyperspace War with the purpose to manipulate the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic in order to prevent devastating wars and suffering caused by the two factions. However, each new generation of the conspirators was more corrupt and deviated from the original goals of the Cabal. On this basis, the contained old members were willing to help Nine dismantle the Star Cabal. They rebuilt SCORPIO and placed it under Nine's command so that the secrets it contained could be used to track down the current conspirators."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Tytun Rings"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Nine boarded the ship, a blast came from the airlock.

Pashon was defeated and when the station security arrived, the Agent ordered them to execute him. Back on ship, Nine was contacted by Watcher Three with a new lead. Intelligence found a record of a meeting between Hunter and other members of the Star Cabal that took place somewhere in the Brema sector around six months ago. However the actual recording was stored somewhere on the Tytun Rings, which served as an archive of all communications sent via the HoloNet. Nine went to the Tytun Rings and managed to find segments of a recording on one of the storage ships there. Back on Dromund Kaas, Keeper and Watcher Three managed to put the segments together and play the entire recording. The recording revealed several members of Star Cabal, yet they could only recognize Hunter. The discussion mentioned events such as Darth Angral's incident, Darth Baras' rise, and the awakening of the Emperor's Children, as well as undisclosed events on the Republic side which would seemingly counterbalance them. While observing the recording, Keeper and two other Watchers from the new eugenics program collapsed. The recording contained a hidden overlay which overwhelmed the genetically enhanced personnel and temporarily shut down their brains. Keeper and the affected Watchers had to be placed on life support, which left Intelligence in shortage of Watchers.

They met with an Imperial agent, who was surgically altered to look like a Voss, in order to infiltrate the isolationist society as a Voss-Ka tea house owner named Bas-Ton. After a discussion, they suspected that a Human named Albathius could have been a potential Star Cabal member. After his arrival to Voss few years ago, he became a legend among the Voss people. The Voss believed he was a part of a prophecy and called him \"the Shining Man\". However, he recently died and was buried under under Voss-Ka with full honors - something that was unusual for an outsider. Nine then went to visit his tomb. To minimize suspicion from Voss the Agent performed some of the rituals along the path leading to the tomb. Inside the tomb, Nine opened the Shining Man's sarcophagus, finding his ashes and a scroll containing his prophecy. The Agent learned that the Shining Man visited the Wellspring of Healing inside the Shrine of Healing. When Nine entered the chambers, they were stopped by a Voss acolyte guarding the sacred place. The acolyte confirmed that the Shining Man came to Wellspring of Healing and that the recording of the event exists. Nine treated the Voss to let them inside the archives where they found the Shining Man's Vitalicron. However, these records were genetically locked and could only be viewed by the person that the record is about. Luckily, Bas-Ton was able to extract genetic sample from the ash collected from the Shining Man's sarcophagus and Nine played the recording. The recording suggested that the Shining Man somehow forged the scroll using ancient materials in the Nightmare Lands and used it to con a Voss Mystic.

Fa'athra reveled that he was seeking a revenge for Agent acting as a \"Red Blade\" and ruining his business on Hutta. When Nine questioned how he managed to track Nine down, Fa'athra said that he was contacted by a man named Hunter who revealed the agent's identity to him. After that, Nine shot Fa'athra. Unfortunately, Bas-Ton was mortally wounded in the fight. He gave final instructions to the Agent before dying. Nine ventured into Nightmare Lands to the Chamber of Ashes, where the Shining Man forged his prophecy. In the Nightmare Lands, they found his ship guarded by a Gormak named Xanar. The Gormak refused to believe that the Shining Man was dead and attacked the Agent when Nine attempted to take his ship's computer. Nine killed him and secured the data. Throughout the mission on Voss, Nine performed deeds that made the Voss believe Nine was also part of the prophecy. This granted the Agent a meeting with the ruling government of Voss - the Three. The conversation reveled that the Shining Man was able to exploit his fake prophecy in order to convince Voss to stay neutral for 3,000 days on behalf of the Star Cabal."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Star Cabal strikes back"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that point, Cipher Nine came close to uncovering Star Cabal.

After obtaining the data and transmitting it to Keeper, she determined that the Empire did not have the sufficient numbers to repel the Republic reinforcements.
