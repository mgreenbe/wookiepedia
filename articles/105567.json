According to the insane ex-surgeon Cornelius Evazan, thousands of years before the Imperial Era a dying princess in the Kingdom of Tion taught her pipe-bird to whistle her favorite song. Other pipe-birds mimicked the princess' song and spread throughout the galaxy. To illustrate a point about immortality to his partner Ponda Baba, Evazan recorded the story of the princess and the pipe-bird in an entry in the Smuggler's Guide logbook while it was in his possession."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
