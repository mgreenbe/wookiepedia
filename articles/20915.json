In order to provide an illustration of a game of pazaak, Kaal-Jhyy, a user on Wookieepedia, an online Star Wars encyclopedia, uploaded a screenshot of the game to that website. This screenshot was later printed in Del Rey's 2008 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, with the removal of an action box declaring that Ters won the fourth round of play. This inclusion of \"Broon Ters\" made the name canonical. Although Doton Het was present on Citadel Station over the planet Telos IV in the game, the location and time of the game between Ters and Het cannot be determined since The Old Republic: Revan, a novel by Drew Karpyshyn released in 2011, confirmed that the Exile's real name was \"Meetra Surik.\" Therefore, Broon Ters must have been a separate character, which also meant that\u2014although the player must be a Human in the game\u2014Ters was not confirmed to be a Human."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
