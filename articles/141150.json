Later Luke asked Baas about the fate of Exar Kun, and the gatekeeper told him that Kun slew his own master, Vodo himself, when the latter tried to bring his apprentice back from the dark side.

The Dark Lord executed Boda as well, and took possession of the Tedryn Holocron. Palpatine used the secrets in the holocron to cheat death with the dark side and cloning technology, and he recorded some of the holocron's secrets in his Book of Anger.

She asked Master Baas about her brother's future, but the gatekeeper answered that he could not tell because Skywalker's future was obscured. He then recounted a prophecy written by his own Master. Moments later, a fleet of Star Destroyers led by the Eclipse dropped out of hyperspace above the Pinnacle Moon. The reborn Emperor demanded that Leia and the Tedryn Holocron be delivered to him; he would discuss a truce if the Rebels complied. Leia accepted his terms, but left the holocron in her chambers. Aboard the Eclipse, she realized that Palpatine's hold over Luke had become too strong, and that the dark side was consuming him.

Skywalker and Solusar traveled to Ossus, where they med Ood Bnar, an hibernating Jedi Master from Exar Kun's time, whose prophecies are stored in the Holocron.
