It was silver-colored and shaped like an upside-down cone. The building, which despite its name had no windows, served as the headquarters of the media and advertising company Transcept Media Solutions, along with its surveillance division, including Myder's Mynocks. By 11 BBY, it was the newest building on the planet. During preparations by the industrialist Denetrius Vidian to destroy Gorse's moon Cynda, the planetary science department on board the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Ultimatum set up a betting pool concerning what destruction the moon's destruction would cause on Gorse, with Lieutenant Kanna Deltic betting World Window Plaza would be destroyed within a year of the event. Deltic later informed the Ultimatum's Captain, Rae Sloane, of her bet on the building and revealed she hoped to spend her winnings on shore leave to the planet Alderaan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "World Window Plaza first appeared in the novel A New Dawn, which was written by John Jackson Miller and released in 2014.
