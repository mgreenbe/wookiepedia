Upon reaching their destination, seven members of the crew mutinied, but were killed by Mabin and those loyal to her. The crewmember Poppy then located the island sinkhole on Moldour 14 where the vault was buried. Fur-Bite then unsealed the vault, but was killed by a trap that fired a saberdart into the pirate's neck. The other traps in the vault failed to fire, and Mabin and the remaining crew claimed the precious meleenium, hyperbarides, and prismatic crystals inside before leaving the moon. Mabin later mentioned Fur-Bite's death while writing in the Smuggler's Guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fur-Bite was mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide, which was written by Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
