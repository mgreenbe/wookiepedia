The largest and strongest thermal wells were located near Soco-Jarel Spaceport, and were used by pilots engaged in the recreational activity of thermal gliding. Using gliders, pilots kept aloft by using the thermal wells to keep themselves aloft. The largest thermal wells were known to have lifted gliders up to fifteen kilometers above the surface of Socorro."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
