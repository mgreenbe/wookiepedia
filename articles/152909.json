As with many other citizens of the Arkadianate, he had been rotated through several different jobs throughout his life due to the Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra's policy of exposing her subjects to different types of work. During the Siege of Calimondretta, he was patrolling Reflection Prospect, a large public square in the city. The Jedi Knight Kerra Holt escaped from the Impound and launched a diversionary attack following a deal with the Bothan spy Narsk Ka'hane, who was working for the rival Sith Lord Vilia Calimondra."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since he had been recently rotated as a Citizen Guard, the Houk was inexperienced and was a poor shooter. In the midst of this pandemonium, an he began firing indiscriminately at the crowd with a blaster, killing the two other Citizen Guards who had been pursuing Kerra. Kerra quickly killed the Houk Citizen Guard with a blaster taken from one of the fallen Guards. This encounter led Kerra to conclude that unlike the other Sith states, the Arkadianate's Citizen Guards were not Sith wannabes but were rather ordinary sentient beings trapped within Arkadia's military-industrial complex."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
