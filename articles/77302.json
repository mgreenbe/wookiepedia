Though highly regarded by her Jedi Master, Count Dooku, the former Padawan fell to the dark side of the Force following her banishment from the Jedi Order. Amassing an army of mindless slaves and assassins, Vosa became a cult leader whose influence reached across the galaxy, allowing her to form connections with powerful crime lords such as the Hutt Cartel or the Dugs of Malastare."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As her criminal empire expanded, Vosa came to the attention of Darth Sidious\u2014the Dark Lord of the Sith who conspired to topple the Republic from within. Viewing the former Jedi as a threat to his own plans for the future, the Sith Lord ordered her termination. The execution of this task was entrusted to Sidious' Sith apprentice, Count Dooku, who adopted the persona of Darth Tyranus after turning away from the light side of the Force. Rather than killing Vosa in person, Tyranus opted to place a bounty on his fallen apprentice. A mercenary who was skilled enough to defeat a warrior trained in the ways of the Force would, as Tyranus reasoned, make an ideal template for the clone army in development on Kamino."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The contest was ultimately won by Jango Fett, one of the bounty hunters whom Tyranus hired to hunt and neutralize Vosa for the reward of five million credits. After tracking Vosa to her citadel on Kohlma, one of the moons of Bogden, Fett defeated the leader of the Bando Gora in spite of her Force powers and lightsaber skills. Tyranus, who witnessed the battle from the shadows, asphyxiated Vosa by way of the Force and subsequently persuaded Fett to be cloned. In the years following Vosa's death, her lightsabers were given to Asajj Ventress, a Separatist assassin who aspired to join the ranks of the Sith with Tyranus as her mentor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Force-sensitive Human female, Komari Vosa was recruited as a young child by the Jedi Order in accordance with tradition during the last century of the Galactic Republic. After completing her studies as a Jedi Initiate, Vosa became the Padawan learner of the Jedi Master Dooku in 50 BBY.

The Jedi virtually annihilated their Mandalorian adversaries in the Battle of Galidraan; Vosa herself demonstrated considerable skill with a lightsaber when she personally killed twenty experienced soldiers in combat. Though the Council later came to regret the massacre on Galidraan, Dooku was impressed by his apprentice's natural talents and believed that Vosa's future was all but secure in the ranks of the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vosa's status as a rising star in the Jedi Order was cut short when her Master barred her from participating in the Jedi Trials. Dooku, along with the members of the Jedi Council, became aware of Vosa's secret infatuation with her legendary Master. This and her aggressive demeanor convinced the Order to end Vosa's training, thus deeming her unfit to become a Jedi Knight. Enraged at what she perceived as a betrayal by her Master and the Council, Vosa fled the Jedi Temple and joined a Jedi task force deployed to stop the Bando Gora's activities on Baltizaar. The mission was a disaster, however. The team was decimated and forced to retreat back to Coruscant; many Jedi lost their lives and others were captured, including Vosa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the Order believed her to be dead, in truth Komari Vosa remained alive and was held as a prisoner by the mysterious cult in a dilapidated citadel on Kohlma, a burial moon orbiting Bogden. Subjected to torture and other forms of cruelty, Vosa was driven both mad and into the dark side of the Force.

Under Vosa's direction, the Bando Gora became a horrific icon of terror and intrigue, especially within the criminal underworld that became essential in her plot to expand the Bando Gora's influence and power. In order to do so, Vosa implanted brainwashing agents into death sticks, intending to use narcotics as a recruiting tool for the Bando Gora. The poisonous substances\u2014mind-altering neurotoxins\u2014were developed and conditioned to suppress individuality and free will, thus enabling Vosa to use her Force abilities to turn drug-addicts into mindless spies and assassins. This form of slavery gradually built her a small army of warriors that Vosa deployed on the enemies of her cult."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The secrecy of the Bando Gora's operation necessitated the use of assets who retained their free will, leading Vosa to recruit criminals such as Gardulla the Hutt, Sebolto, and Groff Haugg; the extent of her influence even infiltrated the ranks of the Galactic Senate, causing the corrupt Senator Connus Trell to serve Vosa as an agent of the Bando Gora. In short, her plan involved shipping the neurotoxic agents to Gardulla on Tatooine to cover her trail. The contraband cargo was then sent to Malastare, where Sebolto processed the poison into the death sticks before delivering the dangerously modified narcotics to Coruscant's underworld leaders, including Haugg, for smuggling."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 33 BBY, Vosa and the Bando Gora were involved with a plot to kill Hego Damask that was masterminded by the King of Naboo, Ars Veruna.

To enable the conspirators, he sent his own apprentice, Darth Maul, to the prison space station Cog Hive Seven, with the mission to contact arms dealer Iram Radique and deliver a nuclear device to the Bando Gora. Maul summoned Vosa to the station using a code provided by former Bando Gora member Artagan Truax."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vosa and her followers arrived on the station as it was being destroyed due to a combination of Maul's actions and an attack by Jabba the Hutt. She encountered a freshly wounded Maul, but she did not know of his intention to aid her, so she attacked him. This proved to be a mistake, as she didn't know that she was going up against a full-fledged Sith Lord. Their duel was interrupted by the Syrox, a monstrous being that inhabited the station. Vosa and Maul killed the Syrox together. Vosa now agreed to work with Maul to take possession of the nuclear device. They escaped the destruction of Cog Hive Seven."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Black Sun and Bando Gora conspirators, taking clandestine flight to the Carrion sector, deployed the newly acquired nuclear device on the moon of Sojourn, targeting Damask's fortress-residence and life-extension laboratories there. However, Jabba, through his spy network, had learned of the attack and was able to warn Damask, helping him to escape by personal rescue in the Hutt's space yacht Star Jewel.

Sidious found Vosa to be a nuisance and was convinced that the demented Dark Jedi was a threat to his own plans for the future of the galaxy. By then, Vosa's former Master Dooku had renounced his allegiance to the Jedi Order and had secretly become Darth Tyranus, the new apprentice of the Dark Lord. While Dooku's decision was solidified by the death of his first apprentice Qui-Gon Jinn, who had helped resolve the Naboo crisis at the cost of his life, the drop which had earlier made the defection vase begin to overflow was when Dooku learned that Vosa was still alive and leading a group that could pose a threat to the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his initial reluctance, Tyranus complied with his Master's order to kill Vosa. In addition to dismantling the Bando Gora, the Sith Lord-in-training was also instructed to locate a suitable genotype that would serve as the basis for a massive army of clone soldiers. Placing a bounty on Vosa in the amount of five million Republic credits, Tyranus intended to accomplish both tasks with a single contest. At Sidious's suggestion, Tyranus hired several of the galaxy's most lethal mercenaries, including two Mandalorian soldiers-turned-bounty hunters Jango Fett and Montross."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Groff Haugg and Senator Trell were both killed when Fett and Montross\u2014working in competition against one another\u2014tracked Komari Vosa's low-level operatives to Coruscant. Her spies relayed the setbacks to their operations on the Republic capital, but the Dark Jedi dismissed the lost assets as irrelevant, insisting that gangsters and corrupt politicians were easily replaceable. She was also unconcerned about the hunters who were tracking her, given that the location of her citadel remained unknown to all but a select few contacts.

He traveled to the dark moon in order to finish the hunt, but was also trailed by Montross who sought to claim Tyranus's reward. After killing numerous Bando Gora assassins, including Montross in a final duel to the death, Fett fought his way to the front entrance of the citadel. Upon entering the fortress however, he was quickly overwhelmed and captured by Vosa's followers. The Bando Gora tortured the bounty hunter in order to discern the identity of his employer, but Fett refused to cooperate in spite of the physical pain he endured. Vosa used a more psychological approach when she took over the interrogation, recalling her achievements against the Mandalorians on Galidraan during her life as a Jedi. Amused at the persistence of Fett's resistance to her methods, Vosa promised to enslave Fett to her will."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fett was ultimately saved by Zam Wesell, a female Clawdite mercenary who followed him to Kohlma in the hopes of claiming the five million credits for herself. Although she killed two Bando Gora guards, Wesell's skills with a blaster were inefficient against Vosa's training in Jar'Kai. Wielding two curved-hilted lightsabers, the fallen Jedi easily parried the blaster shots before redirecting a single stray bolt into Wesell's shoulder.

Outmatched by Vosa's lightsaber skills and Force powers, Fett relied on his JT-12 jetpack and the advanced weaponry of his armor in order to stand a fighting chance against an opponent who was trained in the Jedi arts. He eventually defeated Vosa, but chose to spare her life as the reward was the same whether she was dead or alive upon capture. At that moment, Vosa felt nearby her old Master's presence in the Force.

In addition to the five million credits, he offered to pay even more if the bounty hunter agreed to travel to Kamino to be cloned.

He further complied with Tyranus's request that he personally oversee the clones' development and training to ensure that they became the perfect warriors. However, Fett's consent was based on the condition that he be allowed to claim the first clone for himself; a clone unmodified by genetic tampering and accelerated growth.

Although Dooku overlooked Vosa's characteristic flaws in deference to her remarkable skills as a Jedi, it was ultimately Vosa's growing infatuation with her distinguished Master that led to her banishment from the Jedi Order.

The effects of torture and her broken psyche opened Vosa's mind to the dark side of the Force.
