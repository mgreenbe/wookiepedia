During the Clone Wars, it was stationed on an Outer Rim planet controlled by the Separatists. This B1-Series battle droid was present when the Galactic Republic raided a Separatist factory on the planet. In the midst of the battle, this droid managed to recover data plans for a new model of upgraded battle droid and deliver them to a pair of Neimoidian officers. While its superiors spoke with Count Dooku regarding how this new droid unit would make the standard issue battle droid obsolete, this droid acted out against its superiors, opening fire on the command module containing the upgraded schematics. Initially believing the firing to be a weapons malfunction, further inspection by a Neimoidian guard revealed that the droid's blaster showed no signs of deterioration. With this revelation, Dooku ordered the droid's destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
