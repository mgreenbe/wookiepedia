A government existed on the world, wherein officials took on the title of Magistrate. The symbol of office of the Magistrates was the Crown of Verity, a Force artifact which caused its wearer to become a paragon of truth. The planet was depopulated mysteriously circa 30,000 BBY, and the Crown fell into obscurity until it turned up in the Archives of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
