The image used for the painting came from the art book From Pencil to Pixel: The Art of Star Wars Galaxies. The painting was one of nine paintings given out randomly to players of the game for the game's first anniversary of release in the United States and Europe. The painting was later added to the \"rare loot system\" in Hotfix 17.10 on October 7, 2010. The system allowed players to loot rare items from any enemy in the game. Within the game, the painting was given the subtitle of \"TIE Sentinel\" in parentheses; however, there is no known TIE variant called the Sentinel, and the ship depicted appears to have a combination of features from the TIE Advanced x1 and the TIE Aggressor. The player could use the painting in his or her house as decoration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
