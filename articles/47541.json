The headquarters of the Commerce Guild, its primary agricultural export was the valuable crop nysillin, which was largely farmed by the native Felucian tribes. Its important strategic location along the Perlemian Trade Route made it a major battleground throughout the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Felucia was a remote world in the Felucia system, overrun with thick, colorful, and humid jungle made up by a unique combination of fungi species. The jungle was punctuated with small farming villages populated by the planet's native Felucians, as well as occasional cities such as the capital, Kway Teow. Felucia was governed by the Commerce Guild, who represented the planets corporate interests on the galactic stage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The world was a hotbed of life, and several non-sentient species also inhabited the world, including Gelagrubs,[source?] jungle rancors, and tee-muss. Despite its perceived insignificance, its important location and resources (which included the healing plant nysillin) led to several conflicts both in orbit and on the surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Colonization and Republic Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Felucia was colonized by the Gossam species, whose first expedition arrived around 27,000 BBY, where it was known as Galush up until sometime after the formation of the Galactic Republic. Seeking to exploit the nysillim resources present on the planet, the Gossams pressured the native Felucian tribes into expanding their farming operations by clearing swaths of jungle, claiming that they shared a common ancestor. The Commerce Guild, a massive galactic conglomerate, came to be headquarted just outside the walled city of Kway Teow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Republic Era, Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn faced trials on Felucia.

Location of Commerce Guild headquaters, place where the healing herb of nysillin was farmed, and one of the key planets of the Outer Rim, Felucia became one of the most important planets for republic operations in the sector. At first in 21 BBY, the first battle on the planet saw the Republic forces, led by Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Plo Koon, dislodged by a Separatist onslaught via blockade. Jedi and their armies were forced to retreat, as droid army overwhelmed them using environment to gain advantage. Small groups of battle droids kept moving towards republic tanks that were unable to move in the forest, from every direction. Clone forces and their commanders were able to escape the planet, leaving it to the Separatists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, Separatist forces destroyed the Republic medical station orbiting the planet as their final move to gain full control over the planet, deploying a Vulture droid deployment station to safeguard their hold on the system. Around this time, a nysillin farming community was terrorized by Hondo Ohnaka's Florrum-based pirate gang, who stole the settlers' crop harvest. In order to protect themselves, the farmers hired a group of bounty hunters which consisted of Sugi, Embo, Seripas and Rumi Paramita. This group later grew to include stranded Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano. With their assistance, the farmers were able to fend off the pirate band and protect their village. After that both the jedi and bounty hunters left the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, elements of the Republic Army, led by Generals Koon and Skywalker and Commander Tano fought on the planets surface to take it away from the Confederacy. After days of fighting in the jungles jedi and their troops came close to taking over the droid outpost. General Grievous sent his reinforcements to fortify this position. If he would hold the outpost last efforts of the Republic would prove meaningless, as all they would take away from Confederacy would be dangerous and empty forest. Regardless of that the assault ended with the elimination of the Separatist, outpost opening a way to reatake the rest of Felucia, though it also resulted in Ahsoka Tano's kidnapping by rogue Trandoshan hunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For next months Felucia would see many battles[source?] with units such like Clone Force 99 and finally during the Outer Rim Sieges of 19 BBY 327th Star Corps scrolling through it's forests.

During this period, the Imperial Military maintained a large garrison in the Felucia system. However, the planet was considered to be devastated after the large fighting that occurred during the Clone Wars. Because of this, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin suggested it as a possible target for Berch Teller's insurgents, as a reprisal of sorts for the way the Republic left the planet; however, this possibility was dismissed by Darth Vader, and the rebels would attack Lucazec instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 10 BBY, Lando Calrissian pulled off a hair-raising smuggling run on the planet which helped pay off his debts with Dryden Vos of Crimson Dawn and afterwards was enjoying downtime at the Lodge on Vandor when he was approached by Tobias Beckett and his gang to transport them to Kessel."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First Order\u2013Resistance war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 34 ABY, the planet's inhabitants began trading ingredients with the planet Batuu.
