He was present at the Jedi Order's Hidden Temple when the bounty hunter Cade Skywalker visited it in 137 ABY. Skywalker looked to gain the Jedi Council's help in assassinating Darth Krayt, Dark Lord of the Sith and Emperor of his faction of the Galactic Empire. The Council refused, instead opting to oppose Krayt by allying with the remnants of the Galactic Alliance and the deposed Emperor Roan Fel's forces. Dan, along with Jedi Masters Sayar Dun'La, Te Corso, and Drok, was sent by the Council to meet with Admiral Gar Stazi, the leader of the Galactic Alliance Remnant. After Dan and his fellow Jedi boarded Stazi's flagship, the Alliance, he volunteered to accompany the Imperial Knight Sigel Dare on a mission to retrieve her fellow Imperial Knight Treis Sinde from the world of Dac, which was under siege by the Sith-Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Dan and Dare located Sinde, the Imperial Knight refused to leave Dac since he was assisting the Mon Calamari Rangers, who were fighting against the Sith-Imperials on Dac.

Dan and his companions journeyed to Stazi's flagship, the Alliance, and boarded the ship in their X-83 TwinTail starfighters. After disembarking, Dan and the Jedi were greeted by Stazi and several Alliance officers. During Stazi's ensuing conversation with Corso, the Imperial Knight Sigel Dare, who represented Fel's Empire, interrupted Stazi. She asked the Admiral for permission to take one of his shuttles to the planet Dac in order to retrieve her fellow Imperial Knight Treis Sinde, who was working with the Mon Calamari Rangers against the Sith-Imperial forces on Dac. Dan, who was interested in meeting Sinde, asked Dare if he could accompany her.

The two dressed as Imperial Intelligence officers in order to blend in with the local Imperials. As their shuttle was approaching Dac, Dan was given instructions by Dare yet again, and he reminded her that he was already aware of the plan. After disembarking in New Coral City, Dare used the Force to persuade an Imperial officer that she and Dan were never officially on Dac.

Dan ignited his lightsaber and crossed blades with the Imperial Knights, stating that it was wrong for them to fight. This prompted both Sinde and Dare to attack Dan, who felt it was better for the Imperials to fight him. Dan Force-pushed Dare away from him and asked if he could suggest an alternative to their solution, but Dare continued attacking the Jedi. During the skirmish, Dan told Sinde that he agreed with Dare about him returning to Bastion, stating that if Sinde truly felt that the Imperial Knights were losing their focus, the Force needed Sinde to return to instruct the Imperial Knights. The Jedi Master blocked Dare's attack while Force-pushing Sinde and gained the upper hand by pushing the Imperials into each other. After deactivating his lightsaber, Dan volunteered to take Sinde's place with the Mon Calamari Rangers, and Sinde agreed with Dan.

Three days after the Final Protocol's execution, the Galactic Alliance starfighter squadron known as Rogue Squadron discovered that millions of beings had died, prompting Admiral Stazi to initiate a massive evacuation of the planet. Dan joined the Mon Calamari Rangers in their takeover of the city Heurkea's docks, which served as base for the evacuation efforts. The Galactic Alliance fleet and a number of civilian volunteers managed to evacuate approximately twenty percent of the planet's population.

Later, when Dare used a mind trick on an Imperial officer, Dan mocked her usage of the Force, stating that the Imperial mindset invited mind control.
