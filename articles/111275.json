At some point after the Battle of Yavin, the Zann Consortium took notice of the man's importance and his cache of secrets which they suspected to be \"galaxy wide,\" and assigned a Defiler to put together a squad with the goal of abducting Falan. A Consortium TZ-15 shuttle landed on the planet and began its assault in broad daylight. The Consoritum's's abduction squad consisted of 9 Droideka Mk. IIs, 2 MZ-8 Mobile Pulse Cannons, and was led by IG-88. Although Falan was well-defended at the small military base, IG-88's team routed the defenders and turned Falan over to the Zann Consortium as per his contract. Interrogation droids then went to work on extracting Falan's secrets from his mind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
