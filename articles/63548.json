Prior to the conflict, the Nimbanese discovered the Riileb homeworld at the fringe of Hutt Space and attempted to persuade the Riilebs into voluntary servitude to the Hutts. Nevertheless, the insectoid Riileb refused, leading to the conflict. The Hutt forces were led by a Hutt named Velrugha; they were successfully repelled by the Riileb during each invasion attempt and eventually gave up trying to capture the planet. Velrugha left Riileb to search for easier species to conquer, and the Riileb species retained their independence, making them one of the few Hutt Space species independent of Hutt influence or control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hutt-Riileb conflict was first mentioned in the thirteenth issue of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game series the Star Wars Adventure Journal, published by West End Games in 1997.
