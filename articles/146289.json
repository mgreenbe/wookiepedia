In that year, a series of uprisings were springing up throughout the Yinchorri system, a conflict which drew most of the Jedi High Council away from Coruscant. Stationed at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant at the time, Jedi Nie-Tan was present when a group of Yinchorri infiltrated the Tower of First Knowledge in an attempt to slay the Jedi Initiates housed there. The Jedi in the Temple attacked the raiding party in force, Ne-Tan among their number. While the invaders were repelled, Jedi Nie-Tan lost his life in the fighting; the only casualty aside from him was fellow Jedi Knight Jude Rozess."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Tieren Nie-Tan was created by Randy Stradley for the second issue of the Jedi Council: Acts of War comic book arc.
