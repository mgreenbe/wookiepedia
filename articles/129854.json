The sprays were used on the planet Drongar by Republic forces during the battle thought there. The spray killed spores which attacked shuttles flying in the planets harsh atmosphere and caused large amounts of damage to the vessels as well as potentially giving any occupants Spore Sickness. The chemicals used in the spray however had to be changed about once a month due to the adaptogenic nature which allowed them to develop immunity to the spray quickly. Two Bothan technicians sprayed down the shuttle used to transport Mirialan Jedi padawan Barriss Offee to Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7 upon her arrival at the Republic Mobile Surgical Unit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Spore disinfectant first appeared in MedStar I: Battle Surgeons, the first novel in the MedStar Duology, written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry and published in 2004."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
