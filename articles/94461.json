The four limbed, serpentine Jedi also had crafted a staff imbued with a large crystal at its summit. According to legend, N'Kata Del Gormo was residing on a swamp world when two visitors crossed his path. A young hermit named Yoda and a Human friend had crash landed on the world and came to Del Gormo for assistance. After a couple of days, Master Del Gormo met with the duo and informed them that they were in fact Force-sensitive; offering to train them as his Padawans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The legend continues that sometime later, a Galactic Republic starship landed on the planet, answering the distress call that had been sent from Yoda's ship before the crash. Departing the world, Yoda would go to Coruscant where he would continue his training at the Jedi Temple, eventually ascending to the rank of Grand Master. If those events did happen, their exact dates were lost during the Great Jedi Purge, when the self-anointed Emperor Palpatine exterminated the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although N'Kata Del Gormo went about mostly unclothed, he still wore a leather harness made of two straps that crossed his upper torso.
