He lived at Dee'ja Peak on Naboo. Circa 1 ABY, he won a ring from Vance Groten during a Sabacc game. Pate later gave the ring to Janelle, a smuggler leader, to pay a debt. As the ring was a family heirloom, Groten later tried to pay Pate to recover the ring but it was not in his own anymore. Vance Groten finally dispatched a spacer to find the smuggler leader Janelle and get the ring back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Herman Pate appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
