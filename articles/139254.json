Around 1 ABY, sometime after the Battle of Yavin, Takook borrowed Chatook's spear, Kashyyyk bladestick, and went on a hunting trip to the Rryatt Trail with his friend Lobarorr. During their trek, however, Lobarorr became increasingly jealous of the bladestick, and in a fit of rage, lashed out at Takook.

The spacer decided to honor the Takook's last request and headed off toward the Rryatt Trail to find Lobarorr. The spacer retrieved the spear and returned it to Chatook. Surprised at the spacers honorable handling of events, he thanked the spacer for avenging the death of his son, and paid them 2,500 credits and rewarded the spacer with a replica of the spear, known as the Kashyyyk Bladestick.
