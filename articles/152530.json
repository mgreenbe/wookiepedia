The captain served as the commander of the Dying Sun during an expedition to the planet Nyriaan in the Luire system, which was prompted by a vision Glovoc received earlier. Once the Dying Sun reached its destination, the captain entered Glovoc's chambers, and was surprised when the Sith Lord did not subject him to a slow death for intruding upon his meditation. The Dying Sun was soon fired upon by a Republic fleet and shot down over Nyriaan, where the ship's surviving crew eked out an existence under the leadership of Darth Glovoc."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
