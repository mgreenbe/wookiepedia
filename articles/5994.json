Leaving the Jedi Temple during the last decades of the Temple, Altis and his followers moved about the galaxy serving as relief workers on underdeveloped worlds and backwaters. The Jedi enclave on Bespin was used by Altis as training grounds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, a group of Altisians, including Callista Masana, Geith Eris, and Altis himself were traveling aboard the Wookiee Gunner when they received a distress signal from the Republic Intelligence spy Hallena Devis. Rushing to her aide on JanFathal, they met with Captain Gilad Pellaeon and Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who was unnerved by the unorthodox Jedi. Rescuing Devis, she opted to join the Altisians instead of returning to the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, the Altisians began working more closely with the High Council, taking on missions and helping win victories against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Jedi Masana would encounter Knight Etain Tur-Mukan at a rendezvous on Nerrif where Masana invited a distraught Tur-Mukan to join their group, one that would accept her and her child.

In hiding, Master Altis established connections with fellow Masters Plett and Iri Camas, setting up escape routes for survivors and other allies of the Jedi. Although Camas was killed early on in their operations, more and more Jedi were rescued. Force Adepts, Antarian Rangers, and Ffib nonconformists were helped into refuge. Bardan Jusik, an ex-Jedi assisted in negotiating the transport of his former mentor, Arligan Zey, and Master Kina Ha to the Altisian Jedi's headquarters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
