Jedi employing Concentration focused on one specific task, clearing their mind of all negative thoughts, and felt the Force flow through themselves and the universe. If successful, the task attempted by the Jedi had a better chance of succeeding. However, if the Jedi attempted to do anything else while using this power, the attempt failed. Luke Skywalker used this Force power to steady himself to make the vital shot that destroyed the first Death Star. Jedi that were relaxed and at peace with themselves found entering into a state of Concentration easy; those filled with fear and aggression found it harder and those acting out of negative emotions found it very difficult."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Users"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
