Solo and Chewbacca were fighting off the scorpion droids when Zuckuss informed them that help was on the way. All of the sudden Zuckuss's bounty hunter partner, 4-LOM came to help. He shot down droids from the ground with his heavy blaster rifle. 4-LOM shot down the top of the energy projector where the other three were located, causing them to fall all the way to the ground. Han thanked 4-LOM for the help but the scorpion-droids continued. 4-LOM threw thermal detonators at the droids to cover for their escape. They jumped into the ocean and swam towards Han Solo's starship the Millennium Falcon. But as they were swimming, the scorpion-droids also started to swim to them. Solo and the others managed to get in the Falcon safely."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Betrayal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But then 4-LOM and Zuckuss betrayed Han Solo and Chewbacca so they could bring Han to Rekias Nodo. Solo told Chewbacca it would be the last time he trusts anyone. But Han accidentally flipped a switch when they flew over a dampener field, which caused the Falcon to shut down and begin to plummet towards the surface of the planet again. Han grabbed the anti-grav chutes for him and Chewbacca but Zuckuss shot Han and Chewbacca into a stun net so they could use them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Zuckuss and 4-LOM made their way to the exit on the Falcon, Zuckuss wondered if they had to bring in Han Solo dead or alive. As the bounty hunters they realized that Han Solo had tricked them because their chutes should not be working when they were over the dampener field. Zuckuss was in disbelief that he had been tricked again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han was very proud of himself that he managed to trick the bounty hunters into leaving his ship but the Falcon was still descending towards the surface of the planet. Then, 4-LOM and Zuckuss reappeared and tried to glide toward the Falcon. But at the last second, Han turned the direction of the Falcon and the engines on the ship sent the bounty hunters flying back and towards the planet. Down on the surface a disgruntled 4-LOM and Zuckuss prepared to square off against the remaining scorpion-droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
