The captain was distinguished from his fellow commandos by carrying a vibroblade and bearing a white symbol on his forehead. When the station was contacted by clone troopers Captain Rex and Commander Cody, the droid posed as a clone by wearing a helmet and modulating its voice in an unsuccessful attempt to make them leave. During the clones' fight to retake the station, the droid captain attacked Rex, but Rex instead destroyed the droid by dodging its vibrosword strike, breaking its neck and slamming it face-first into the floor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
