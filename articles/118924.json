During the beginning of the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, he became notorious for using financial and legal actions to gain military advantage for the Separatists. One such use of these tactics was Nalaor's repossession of a remote mining station's defense fleet several weeks in the war, the same fleet that was used to capture the station for the Separatists a month later. During the war a Munificent-class star frigate was named for him. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, fought between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Nalaor was no longer president of the conglomerate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sa Nalaor was first mentioned in 2013 in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
