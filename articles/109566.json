Quest for Quasar fan Groz Niclari, who went by the nickname \"QuasarKing327,\" collected almost 1.5 million signatures on a HoloNet petition to have 1.84-meter-tall actor Harlan Ottekvar replaced in Myris Pictures's holofilm adaption of Quest for Quasar. Some fans pointed out that Baltharog's height came from this source and was therefore not canon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
