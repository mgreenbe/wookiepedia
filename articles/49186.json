Fleet lizards had rib membranes that stretched beneath their arms and when escaping from danger, they would run on their hind legs and spread their membranes, in an attempt to sail away. At some point, the Hutt hunter Parella journeyed to Lowick on a quest to locate the last member of the Gorach species, and he had his droid drones bomb the world's swamps, in an attempt to drive out the creature. A number of fleet lizards subsequently fled from the flames that were ignited by the bombing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
