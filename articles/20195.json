To save his captain, FN-2187 used Bray's flamethrower to kill the animals attacking him, although the trooper burned him in the process. When it seemed like their mission was complete, Bray ordered FN-2187 to clean up the creature's remains and, thinking that the trooper thought himself above the task, threatened to reassign the trooper to be a trash guard if he complained. However, FN-2187 ultimately discovered that the creatures were actually a native species, so the stormtrooper went to Bray and suggested moving the animals. As the Captain believed the animals were worthless and thought FN-2187 was complaining, Bray punished the trooper by ordering him to guard trash heading to the Garbage Moon of Maher.

After one of Starkiller's construction units encountered a so-called \"infestation\" of creatures while working on a flood chamber, Bray and a cleaning crew of stormtroopers were deployed to remedy the situation. The animals had eaten two First Order personnel, leaving only one survivor, but Bray's men were unable to get any information from him. To help Bray's operation, Captain Phasma assigned troopers FN-2187 and FN-3761 to his crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving at Deck Nine, FN-2187 was confused as to why a cleaning crew was made up of troopers, but Bray, while testing his flamethrower, informed him that they were dealing with an infestation capable of eating people. As Bray had no other information for the stormtrooper, he allowed FN-2187 to speak with the only survivor of the creature's attack. By the time Bray called for the crew to go, the survivor had not said anything useful, but he then warned FN-2187 that the \"infestation\" had teeth."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Into the tunnel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before entering the tunnel, Bray informed his stormtroopers that they would be fighting in the dark and rejected FN-3761's idea of using explosives in the tunnel, believing the chamber was worth more to the First Order than the trooper was.

Afterwards, it seemed like the infestation had been cleared out, so Bray ordered for the troopers to withdraw, although he wanted FN-2187 to bring in a trash skiff and clean up the mess. When FN-2187 asked if he had received the job was because he had burned Bray, the Captain perceived the query to mean that the stormtrooper felt like he was above the job. Bray snapped at the trooper and said that nothing was above a task that served the First Order.

FN-2187 reunited with the crew and, despite being warned that the Captain was angry, told Bray that they should save the animals.

When they reached the moon, FN-2187 and Marialew dropped the animals off with some of their own kind, as some creatures were already on-site due to previous excavations.

The flametrooper was a loyal soldier and believed no one was above a task that served the First Order. However, he also believed that the Order's individual stormtroopers were not its most valuable asset, so Bray was fine with bringing them into danger if it meant saving something deemed to be more important.
