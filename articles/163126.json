Its ingredients included water, flesh extracted from the Sleeper, minerals, and tree sap. Brewing the concoction was a rite of passage for a Nightsister. A Nightsister would use her Force abilities to awaken the Sleeper, dominate it, and force it to remove a piece of its body. The body part would be boiled with water from the deep pools of the Nightsister fortress and the other ingredients would be added.
