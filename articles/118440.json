The gardens were inhabited by a race of non-sentient beetles known as drogs, whose population was kept in check by the birdlike skreevs. When the anthropologist Mammon Hoole, along with his charges Zak Arranda and Tash Arranda, visited S'krrr nine months after the Battle of Yavin. However during their time one of the S'krrr killed hundreds of skreevs, this caused the population of the beetles to go out of control, beginning a rampage that was eventually quelled by the Arrandas, along with the help of Captain Thrawn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
