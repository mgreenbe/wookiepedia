It had hangars for starships to land and refuel, along with a market for supplies. Some time after the Battle of Endor, Lando Calrissian and Nien Nunb stopped on the station to refuel the Millennium Falcon, but were unable to take off. The ship was boarded by the bounty hunter Embo, who was attempting to claim a bounty on Calrissian for the destruction of the second Death Star. Calrissian incapacitated Embo, and he and Nunb left him on the station when they departed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
