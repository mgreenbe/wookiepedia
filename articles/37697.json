After the Battle of Endor, he was under the command of Moff Leonia Tavira and often feared that if he failed, he would be punished harshly. Shortly before the liberation on Eiattu, he and another trooper were patrolling the deep swamps near the capital city, searching for the body of the Quarren Rebel pilot, Nrin Vakil.
