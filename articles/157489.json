The ancient star had a core that consisted of kyber, which eventually fractured, resulting in solar flares that covered Lupal with a red light, causing the collapse of the civilization on the moon. The light from the solar flares would corrupt the minds of those who ventured to the moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
