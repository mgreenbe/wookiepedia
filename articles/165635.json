By 3645 BBY, Hracken had taught at the academy for many decades. A short time after the disappearance of the student Wim Nickter from the academy, Hracken stayed up late one night with the student Mnah Ra'at, while Ra'at practiced on the academy's combat simulator. Hracken turned off the lights in the room to test whether Ra'at could face the machine while blind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xat Hracken was a Force-sensitive Human male who lived during the Great Galactic War and the resultant period of political unrest. It was during that time Hracken became allied with the Sith Empire and eventually became both a Master and Lord of the Sith. His service to the Empire was given as a combat instructor, one stationed at the Sith academy on the snow-blanketed world of Odacer-Faustin. The war effort against the Galactic Republic was ended in 3653 BBY with the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, at which point the Imperial war machine chose to accelerate its output of Sith warriors and leaders, rather than decrease it. Master Hracken retained his decades-long position as combat instructor of the Odacer-Faustin Sith academy, and a measure of his skill was imparted to the enrolled learners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hracken survived the initial outbreak caused by Scabrous' experiment and saved Ra'at and his fellow students Hartwig, Maggs, and Kindra by blasting their attackers with Force lightning.
