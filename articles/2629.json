Via the Sarlacc, he makes telepathic contact with the first of its victims, Susejo.

The resulting explosion frees the bounty hunter from the Sarlacc's grasp. He then fires concussion grenades into the wall of the beast, blowing a hole in its interior. Boba Fett escapes the Sarlacc, which like him is badly injured but still alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A year later, Fett returns to the Sarlacc in the Slave II.
