It was found by operatives of the Eternal Alliance in a shaft on Makeb, who reactivated it and loaded it with explosives in order to stop Gethul, an abomination capable of mind control. Though the Cult of Gethul attempted to destroy the droid before it could reach its target, the Alliance forces defended it until it was right on top of the monster. They then detonated the payload, destroying D-5X, but also putting an end to Gethul's threat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "D-5X appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during the \"Destroyer Of Worlds\" Uprising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
