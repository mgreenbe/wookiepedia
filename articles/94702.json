At one time, it was an enormous city thriving with people, complete with an extensive underground network of tunnels which allowed for the preservation of the city's above ground beauty. The city was so large that it was easily visible from space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 36 BBY, a civil war among gangs decimated nearly all structures in the city and forced the inhabitants to live underground. More than a decade later, in 25 BBY, Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker went to Naatan with Jedi Master Yaddle to eridicate the stranglehold that the gangs had on the city and allow the populace to relocate back to the surface. However, the trio soon discovered that a prominent gang leader named Striker was actually Granta Omega, who was plotting to destroy the surface with a radioactive bomb. It was there that Master Yaddle sacrificed herself to save Naatan. After she died, Anakin felt partly responsible of her death because Granta Omega used him to lure her there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
