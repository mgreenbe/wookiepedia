Eventually, Admiral Senn attempted to force a victory by launching an all-out attack, spearheaded by the Vengeance, against the Rebel stronghold in the Nocto system. During the ensuing Battle of Nocto the rebels and their Airam allies rammed three suicidal Dreadnaughts filled with explosives into the Vengeance from the rear. A CR90 corvette, the \"Thunder\" rammed the bridge of the Vengeance completely obliterating it.

The Balance of Power add-on to the X-wing vs. TIE Fighter game, the only source featuring this ship, comes with a campaign for both sides, the Empire and the Rebellion. Both campaigns culminate in the same battle where the Vengeance leads an all-out attack against a Rebel shipyard. When playing the Rebel side, the last mission's objectives are to prevent the destruction of the shipyard and destroy the Vengeance while the Imperial mission objectives are reversed. If the player successfully concludes the Imperial campaign, the shipyard is destroyed while the Vengeance is not."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the destruction of both SSD Vengeance and the Rebel shipyard do not cancel each other out; it could be argued that all missions and cutscenes from Balance of Power are canonical, including the ultimate simultaneous destruction of the shipyard and the SSD Vengeance. This would be the smallest possible tweak to the available information and also fit in with the apparent general consensus that the Empire and the Rebellion achieved a draw in the Airam campaign by essentially wiping out each other's forces.
