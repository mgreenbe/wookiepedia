It was ancient even when the Enclave was built, and its structures bore a strong resemblance to those of a site of Rakatan ruins located nearby. The ancient grove was, from the Enclave, just a short walk across the Matale estate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Padawan Juhani fell to the dark side, mistakenly believing that she had slain her Jedi Master, Quatra, in anger, she fled to the grove. Her dark influence had an effect on the local kath hounds, making them more aggressive than was otherwise normal. Revan, who had had his memory wiped and was engaging in his retraining, was told to cleanse the grove as the final test to be admitted into the Jedi Order as a Padawan. There, he encountered Juhani, and after a short lightsaber duel, convinced the Cathar to return to the light side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Jedi Enclave was destroyed by Darth Malak and the Sith had departed Dantooine, the Khoonda government blocked off access to the ancient grove."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
