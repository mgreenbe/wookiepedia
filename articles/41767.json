In 2 ABY, he was contracted by Raze to find the kidnapped daughter of Orocco's King, Arturo. Unaware of the fact that Princess Mi was in friendly hand of Han Solo and Leia Organa, he followed the Millennium Falcon to Cataalda where he captured both ladies while Han and Chewbacca were busy fighting K1l-R. However, by the time he recognized Leia as the princess of Alderaan, Solo and Chewie arrived to rescue them. K1l-R destroyed Dust's Conqueror-class assault ship, but the Dust found himself attacked by K1l-R as well. Dust's full body armor was damaged in the explosion, which revealed his original blue skin. By the time he destroyed the droid, Solo already returned Princess Mi to her father, so Dust could no longer pursue his bounty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
