During the operations of Task Force Vengeance, it was misfortunate enough to fall prey to Star Destroyer Rage and Interdictor Compellor during the two Imperial vessels' hunt for illicit activity near the Blair Cluster. Upon being ripped from hyperspace, Gilder first attempted flight. However, after its small X-wing starfighter escort was destroyed by Avenger Squadron and Gilder itself suffered damage, it surrendered. Its whole crew and passengers were arrested. Its subsequent fate is unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
