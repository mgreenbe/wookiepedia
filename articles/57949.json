The organization was made up of the leaders of the respective houses and was led by one respected head. During the height of the New Order, the Trandoshan Cradossk was head of the council. The council convened in a large building around a crescent table when making decisions, and the same building was also used for celebrations after such meetings. When the bounty hunter Boba Fett decided to join the guild, Cradossk gathered together the rest of the council to approve Fett's request to join."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Cradossk's death, the Bounty Hunters' Guild fragmented and broke into two separate sects. One faction, known as the True Guild, refused to see Bossk, who was Cradossk's son and murderer, as the legitimate heir after his father's death. This faction was led by Gleed Ontondon, one of the former members of the council and official spokesperson for the True Guild. The other sect was led by Bossk who believed himself to be the new leader of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. Known as the Guild Reform Committee, the group was made up of the younger members of the former guild and backed Bossk as the legitimate successor to Cradossk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known members"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
