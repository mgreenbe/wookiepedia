Balosar was known for its balo mushrooms, exclusive to the planet, which were refined by companies such as BioTech Industries and Fergriss Pharmaceuticals into ixetal cilona, a powerful narcotic used in death sticks and interrogation drugs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was dominated by factories owned by the aforementioned companies, who often engaged in espionage and sabotage against one another, often with the native Balosar involved. Many Balosar on the world lived in poverty due to the companies' stranglehold on the planet, and as such many turned to the Rebel Alliance to survive and fight back against the Galactic Empire, who turned a blind eye to what was occurring on the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
