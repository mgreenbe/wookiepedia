This large cove was located at the end of a series of long and narrow tunnels, at the base of Mount Vorena on the planet Volik. This area was also the final resting place of the Nashuaga, a Dynamic-class freighter that crashed onto the planet at some point in the distant past. It was rumored that the mask of Darth Nihilus, an ancient Sith artifact, was located in the cargo of the freighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
