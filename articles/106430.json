For one, it depicts Poe Dameron as being knocked unconscious during the TIE fighter's descent to Jakku which forces Finn to manually deploy his own ejector seat, whereas the comic instead shows Dameron triggering Finn's ejector seat to save Finn while Dameron then stays fully conscious throughout the rest of the fall until he is torn free from the cockpit. Poe's meeting and overall interaction with the scavenger Naka Iit also consists of a different set of dialogue in the comic as compared to the novelization. Furthermore, in the novelization, Poe stays silent during the ride to Blowback Town until the moment he and Naka Iit are attacked by the Strus Clan, whereas in the comic he regales Naka Iit with tales of his adventures in the Resistance until they are interrupted by the Strus Clan's attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The reference book Poe Dameron: Flight Log states that Ohn Gos gave Dameron a ride to Yavin 4 so he could pick up Black One before he was sent to Takodana, yet the comic shows that Poe arrived on D'Qar in Gos' ship Beloved Bophine and was informed by Leia Organa that BB-8 was on Takodana."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
