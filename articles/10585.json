Its name was a portmanteau of its first two letters, Aurek and Besh. Aurebesh was commonly used by major governments from the Galactic Empire to the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aurebesh was thought to have been derived from the writing system of the Rakatan Infinite Empire, introduced to the galaxy at large during that Empire's reign. It spread during the Alsakan Conflicts approximately 17,000 years before the Battle of Yavin. However, already by 25,793 BBY, Aurebesh was used by the inhabitants of the Settled Worlds, prior to their first contact with the Rakata. When contact was made, the Rakatan Aurebesh was apparently identical to that used in the Settled Worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Generally, Aurebesh was considered to be for the common folk, whereas the High Galactic alphabet was associated with snobbery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker learned to read Aurebesh by the time he was four years old, from a set of old educational datatapes given to him by his aunt Beru."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aurebesh was extraordinarily common throughout the galaxy. Clone troopers used it to mark their LAAT gunships such as Lucky Lekku and Spaceward Ho!, both of which had their names painted on their sides,, or the Crumb Bomber, which \"Laugh this off\" was inscribed on. Private starships also sometimes bore their names in Aurebesh, including the freighter Tecora."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aurebesh text could be seen on the screens of various types of technology, including screens in the cockpits of N-1 starfighters, the Separatist facility known as Skytop Station, and inside macrobinoculars.. Similarly, the Grand Army of the Republic's tactical readouts made heavy use of Aurebesh text. Aurebesh was also used in medical settings and on wanted posters found in the Jedi Archives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone trooper Sketch had a letter senth tattooed across his brow. Kix and the owner of Plop Dribble's also had Aurebesh tattoos. Similarly, the trooper Ponds wrote \"some guys have all the luck\" on his armor.

Words were separated by spaces. Aurebesh could be written mainly left-to-right or up-to-down. All letters are the same relative size, although occasionally symbols were mirror-inverted to denote capital letters. The symbol for the Republic Credit was a Resh (R for Republic) with two vertical lines through the upper half of the symbol. Letters of the alphabet were also used to denote musical keys, such as the key of Cresh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Aurebesh had several glyphs that corresponded to digraphs in the High Galactic alphabet, they were frequently disregarded. For example, the sound \"oo,\" that was properly noted using Orenth, was frequently spelled with a double Osk. Similarly, the letter Thesh was often replaced by a combination of Trill and Herf. Such was also the case for Cherek and Shen, often written respectively with combinations of Cresh and Herf and Senth and Herf."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Letters and numerals"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Evolution"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Aurebesh-like writing that appears in the original trilogy is totally random and it is believed that the filmmakers did not intend to write any meaningful text with it. The letters were first assigned Roman equivalents by Stephen Crane at West End Games in the Star Wars Miniatures Battles Companion (1994), for use with the Star Wars Miniatures Battles game and Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. The Aurebesh was later expanded to include punctuation marks in the Star Wars Miniatures Battles supplement, Imperial Entanglements (1996)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This original Aurebesh is occasionally used in electronic and board games such as Star Wars Monopoly.

While it is possible that these instances represent legitimate in-universe variations of the sound-values for the letters in question, it is more likely that they represent errors on the part of the real-world transliterators (who are understandably more used to employing digraphs than employing single letters to write these sounds)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
