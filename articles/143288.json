Han Solo was able escape using a gravity-shifter that the club used to lighten the gravity and allow its patrons to float. Han Solo turned the gravity on three-times normal gravity while in a protected area. With every patron flattened on the ground from their own intense weight, he and Chewbacca were able to escape through a path unaffected by the change in gravity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded, in its entry about the Free-Flight Dance Dome, sources the information as coming from the novel Han Solo's Revenge while it was really from Han Solo at Stars' End."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
