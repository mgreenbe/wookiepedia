His job was to assist Boba Fett on his quest for the destruction of his father's killer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Castas accompanied Fett and Sing when they went to search for the remains of Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker in the wreckage of Admiral Shoan Kilian's destroyed Venator-class Star Destroyer, Endurance. During this time with the bounty hunter group he showed his cowardly nature and his lack of patience. More than once, he was the one who saw the incoming obstacles sent at them by astromech droid R2-D2 in the ship. In the end, after barely escaping one of the latest of R2's traps, Castas said he had enough and in that moment, Aurra Sing, for the first time, agreed with the Klatooinian about getting out of the collapsing wreckage before anything else could happen to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon returning to Slave I, Castas was present when Aurra received a message from Bossk that there was a Jedi starfighter taking off back at the wreckage. The whole crew of the Slave I, including Castas, got on board right away and went to crash site. There, Castas was the one who described and pointed out that the markings of the starfighter matched those of Windu's fighter. The chase ended when Windu's fighter, in reality piloted by R2 himself, got away into hyperspace. At that moment, Castas was the only member on board who voiced his loud disappointment and sharing his fears that Mace Windu would return to hunt them down. The last comment was quickly discarded by Aurra Sing, who said that wouldn't happen because Jedi were known to not carry grudges against anyone."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Quitting"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, a discussion on board the Slave I broke out. Castas had decided he had enough and that the whole situation had become more complicated than what he had signed on for, pointing out the failed attempts at killing Windu and bringing the Endurance down. Sing, displeased with what turned out to be what she considered a very sad excuse for a bounty hunter, decided that if Castas did not want to go along with the whole situation, he was going to be allowed to walk away at the next stop they make. Sing decided this to be the planet Florrum, where she had an old friend who might be able to take Castas's place in the whole \"kill Windu\" endeavor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Slave I arrived at Florrum, there they were welcomed by none other than Hondo Ohnaka, who turned out to be Sing's old friend and lover. Castas was greeted as not the first one who couldn't handle Sing's leadership. On the projector, Castas decided to talk to Fong Do, a Nautolan bounty hunter on Coruscant. During the conversation, Castas said that he had valuable information for \"the right people\". This secret talk was overheard by Aurra Sing, who spied on Castas with her antenna. Shortly after insulting her as an \"old hag\" and offering information on the failed mission, Sing turned around, pulled out one of her blaster pistols, and when Castas turned around, shot him through his one remaining eye. He snapped round in pain, and hugged the projector, before his corpse slid to the floor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although tough, he was also cowardly and unwilling to stick his neck out, a fact which did not sit well when he signed up with Aurra Sing. His cowardice eventually cost him his life.\nAside from being a coward, Castas was known to have anger issues. Some of which surfaced in the worst possible times like when he almost beat up Boba Fett, for which he was going to be shot by Aurra Sing herself. Castas would also often complain about his work if it started to get dangerous or difficult, which almost caused the fight with Boba when he chastised Castas for complaining about the job when he had done virtually nothing. Castas was not very bright and did not always think his actions all the way through. For example, when he had the idea to sell information on Aurra Sing, he chose to do it within Aurra's hearing range."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time as a bounty hunter, Castas utilized a modified speeder bike with light and dark blue markings. The repulsorcraft was also painted with a row of teeth, the symbol he wore on his outfit, and a line of aurabesh that translated to \"dog faced bounty hunter\". Castas had a particular liking to his model of speeder, as it provided him with powerful front-mounted blasters, and hidden side blasters. He was also equipped with a scoped blaster pistol, and had multiple beige pouches across his chest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Castas was originally created for the 2008 Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, where he first appeared in the season 2 episode, \"R2 Come Home\". Castas would then appear in the follow-up episode, \"Lethal Trackdown\", where he was killed by Aurra Sing. In 2011, Hasbro released an action figure pack apart of their Star Wars The Clone Wars line of toys. This pack contained both Castas, and the speeder bike he utilized during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
