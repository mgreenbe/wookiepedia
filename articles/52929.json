Like Jabba the Hutt, Gardulla employed many Nikto guards, as well as guards of other species. When Pre Vizsla, Darth Maul, and Savage Opress's forces attacked the palace, the many guards stationed at the time failed to prevent the attack, and most were killed. The palace itself contained the Hutt Council Chamber, a large dance hall, many holding cells, and so on. One of these cells was used to hold Ziro the Hutt when he was captured by the Bounty hunter Cad Bane in 21 BBY (he eventually broke free and escaped from the planet with help from Sy Snootles, who later killed him). This citadel was well-guarded by many Gamorreans and Weequays."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
