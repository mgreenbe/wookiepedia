At some point, they established a temple in the Glacial Fissure area of Hoth. The Sadow'een were responsible for killing Sadow's rival Horak-mul at the start of the Great Hyperspace War, though his spirit managed to survive.

Members of the Sith Imperial Reclamation Service did not seriously consider Hoth as a location for the temple until the arrival on the ice planet of Darth Zash's apprentice, Kallig. The Sith Inquisitor, together with Lieutenant Talos Drellik of the Reclamation Service, visited the temple in search of Horak-mul's sarcophagus. The long dead Sith Lord contacted them and offered his power to the Inquisitor on the condition that the latter defile the tomb of the Sadow'een, avenging the Sith Lord's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
