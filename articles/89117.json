The Tritus suffered an engine failure on the way to delivering the cannon parts to Khons, the moon of Lok where the cannon would be installed, so the Mere Tugs had to take them the rest of the journey. The tugs set up the cannon on Khons, where it would be used in the liberation of Lok from the Trade Federation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These tugs appear in the 2002 video game Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter during the game's tenth mission, \"Tug of War.\" The player's objective is to escort the four tugs while they recover the cannon pieces.
