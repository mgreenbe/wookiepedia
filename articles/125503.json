In her early days with the Rebel Alliance, she flew troop transports. Commander Arhul Narra tried to recruit her into a starfighter squadron, back when he made every pilot do simulator runs, but she refused. It was later determined that she didn't want to fly a starfighter because she never wanted to take someone else's life."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "After Hoth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the evacuation of Hoth in 3 ABY, Kott was recruited by Commander Wedge Antilles into the newly reformed Red Squadron. She purposely sabotaged her simulator training, before revealing to Antilles that she never killed anybody in all the years she'd been with the Rebellion and that she wouldn't take someone's life. Antilles explained to her that they \"pulled the trigger\" to help to create a galaxy where no one has to do it, which meant killing people and that the Alliance and her loved ones needed her. She was assigned the callsign Red Three and flew a T-65B X-wing starfighter as Antilles' wingmate, alongside Tomer Darpen, in an attack on a nearby pirate base, that threatened the safety of the Alliance's rendezvous point."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, she participated in a decisive battle at Endor, flying an A-wing interceptor with Red Squadron still under the callsign Red Three.
