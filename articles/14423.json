The battle featured four separate parts and was conceived by Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala upon returning to her planet, after unsuccessfully pleading with the Galactic Senate for help. The plan would be to use the Gungans and their Grand Army to lure the Trade Federation army away from Theed, the capital city, so Amidala and her security forces could infiltrate the palace and capture Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. Meanwhile, a team of starfighter pilots would enter orbit in an assault on the Federation command ship, the destruction of which would disable all Federation battle droids on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the battle began, the Gungans fought the Federation army away from the city at Great Grass Plains, while the queen and her team made their way to the palace. Once inside, and as the starfighter pilots made their way into orbit after being freed, the Naboo were confronted by the Sith Lord Darth Maul. The queen's Jedi protectors, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, fought the Sith Lord throughout the palace while Amidala and her forces made their way to the Viceroy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the battle's end, the Federation control ship had been destroyed by Anakin Skywalker, saving the Gungan army from destruction; Amidala and her security personnel captured Gunray; and Darth Maul was defeated and presumed dead after having killed Jinn in lightsaber combat. The battle liberated Naboo from the Federation, led to Kenobi's promotion to Jedi Knight, and convinced the Jedi Council to accept Skywalker for Jedi training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Naboo was ultimately part of a much larger plot. The invasion itself had been orchestrated by Naboo's Senator Sheev Palpatine, who was secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, in a successful effort to be elected Supreme Chancellor. He later engineered the Clone Wars to amass total control over the Galactic Republic so he could transform it into the Galactic Empire and destroy the Jedi Order. During the war, in which Palpatine achieved his goals, Count Dooku remarked that, despite ten years passing between them, the Clone Wars truly began during the Battle of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ten years before the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation was forced to invade the planet Naboo by its hidden master, Darth Sidious. Over the course of the engagement, the Federation failed to capture the planet's Queen, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, despite the assistance of the Sith Lord Darth Maul. She fled to Coruscant to plead her case to the Galactic Senate, to no avail as many Senators were, as Palpatine put it, \"on the Trade Federation's payroll.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deciding to take action herself, she returned to Naboo and, with the aid of the exiled Gungan Jar Jar Binks, the Queen went to the Gungan sacred place to convince Boss Rugor Nass, leader of the Gungans, to align with the human population of Naboo. The Trade Federation had managed to drive the Gungans to their sacred place after invading their homes. Amidala humbled herself before the Gungans, begging them for their help, and Nass pledged to support to her, forging a historic pact between the Naboo and the Gungans. Once what remained of the Royal Naboo Security Forces had been summoned to their hiding place, the Queen, head of security Captain Panaka, and Nass devised a plan to retake Naboo. By the time Amidala returned to the planet, only one Droid Control Ship was left in orbit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the planning session, Nass made Binks a Bombad General for the upcoming battle. The plan for the Gungan Grand Army was to lure out the main bulk of the Federation's Droid Army onto the Great Grass Plains for the head-to-head assault, allowing Amidala and her strike force, along with the two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi (with Anakin Skywalker tagging along), to attack capital city of Theed and capture the main hangar. Naboo pilots would then attack the Droid Control Ship in hopes of deactivating the Federation Army, and allowing Amidala to capture Viceroy Nute Gunray, and thus regain control of the planet.

The army was encased in at least three enormous energy domes impervious to any bombardment. The Droid Army descended from the hills into the valley, in a formation of Armored Assault Tanks escorting Multi-Troop Transports. Settled into position, facing the massive Grand Army, OOM-9 ordered a preliminary bombardment, firing on the Gungans' shields, with his AATs, to little effect."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a while, OOM-9 ordered the other AATs to hold fire; the Gungans believed the battle to be won. The tanks fell back, and the Federation's MTTs unloaded thousands of battle droids, much to the horror of the Gungans. The B1-series battle droids slowly marched through the Gungan shield and fired on the unprotected soldiers. The Gungans, led by Captain Tarpals and Bombad General Binks (whose kaadu tossed him off early in the battle), fought with personal shields, catapults, boomas, cestas and atlatls, destroying dozens of battle droids. The Gungan energy catapults launched large plasma boomas at the droid ranks, but they could not halt the persistent droid march. A squad of droidekas rolled onto the battleground, further increasing Gungan casualties as the MTTs moved in to trap the Grand Army. At some point, a battle droid, having been severed at the waist, fell onto General Binks, eventually getting him off and he started stomping and kicking it, eventually accidentally getting his foot entangled with the severed wiring. This setback eventually came with an advantage when he took down some droids, including one destroyer droid, due to the wiring causing the droid to fire its blaster when he moved the entangled foot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, the shield generator was destroyed by concentrated droid fire, deactivating the protective dome. OOM-9 immediately called upon all AATs, battle droids, Single Trooper Aerial Platforms, to advance. Tank shells now ripped unobstructed into the Gungan lines, tearing up the previously untouched Great Grass Plains. Gungan ranks fell to the mechanized Trade Federation Army; the two armies engaged each other at close range among several ruins and mounted laser cannons. A retreat was quickly ordered. In the confusion, Binks, running on foot since his kaadu had been lost, jumped onto a cache of boomas carried by falumpaset. The weight of the Gungan opened the door and released the large boomas; one impacted with an AAT, destroying it while others disabled destroyer droids. An explosion then sent the harried Binks flying onto a tank. Tarpals drew up alongside on his kaadu and threw a booma at him to aid Binks, as Binks lacked a booma to take down the tank. However, Binks clumsily deflected it onto the tank's pilot, causing the vehicle to crash. In the end, both Gungan officers were captured by a battle droid squad. Their army defeated, Binks surrendering easily, much to Tarpal's dismay."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Theed"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle in the streets"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sneaking into the city, the Queen's strike team and the remains of the Royal Security force waited for an opening. After exchanging signals with the queen, Panaka's forces opened fire on the droids, destroying an AAT and many B1 units. The destruction of the AAT surprised Gunray, who had expected the final battle to take place elsewhere. Under cover of the confusion, Amidala led her team into the Theed Royal Palace. As the battle raged in Theed, the strike force entered the hangar, but was slowed down down by battle droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Naboo forces cleared out the hangar in short order. During the engagement, the Naboo pilots were able to to take off to attack the Droid Control Ship, although one was shot down by an AAT stationed outside of the hangar. Panaka ordered Red and Blue Groups to regroup, and the strike force moved toward the Palace. As they approached the hanger doors, however, Darth Maul appeared on the other side blocking their way. The two Jedi moved to confront him, while the rest of the Queen's strike force decided to take the longer route to the throne room in order to avoid the imminent duel. They were then pinned down by the Federations reinforcements, a squad of destroyer droids. Anakin Skywalker, taking refuge in a N-1 starfighter cockpit at Qui-Gon's request, while trying to find the fighter's trigger in order to help the security force, accidentally took off, but managed to destroy the droids with the craft's far stronger laser blasts. The fighter's auto-pilot then engaged, and took Skywalker into space to join the assault, with Skywalker telling R2-D2 to try and override the autopilot. Skywalker's fighter, while leaving the hangar, also managed to evade fire from the aforementioned AAT."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi and Sith, meanwhile, engaged in a 2-on-1 lightsaber duel.

However, a squad of destroyer droids surrounded Amidala's soldiers and managed to force their surrender. Amidala ordered Panaka and the others to throw down their weapons, seeing that resistance at this point would be pointless. The destroyer and battle droids brought the Queen's squad to the throne room, then left the area, leaving only around a dozen battle droids to accompany them in the room, where Gunray and Rune Haako waited."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being led to the throne room as captured enemies, the Queen and her protectors were not to be prisoners for long. Sab\u00e9 and her team, responding to Amidala's signal, suddenly appeared and fooled Viceroy Gunray into thinking Sab\u00e9 was the Queen. The battle droids were distracted just long enough for Amidala to open a secret compartment in the throne full of blasters and throw them to her allies. The confused battle droids were quickly shot down and the doors to the throne room jammed, locking the Viceroy and Haako in with Queen Amidala.

Theed had been taken back from Federation control."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Duel on Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul raged on. The trio fought through a pair of blast doors connecting the hangar to the Theed power generator. On a catwalk across the complex, the duel raged for a long time, Maul being a more formidable opponent than either Jedi had ever faced before, wielding his saberstaff with lethal efficiency. Despite Maul's seeming dominance on the battlefield, he continually gave ground over the entire battle, leading the two Jedi into a labyrinth of catwalks. Maul then leapt up to a higher level, with the Jedi following. Maul split the two Jedi apart after he forced Kenobi over the ledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn forced the Sith Lord back down to the central catwalk, which met a hall with laser fields. By the time Obi-Wan caught up to the two combatants, he was kept back by the laser barriers. The laser barriers also separated Jinn from his Sith adversary; the Jedi meditated while Maul paced until the barriers opened. Kenobi did not catch up before the barriers closed again, leaving Qui-Gon to duel alone with Maul. Eventually, Maul slammed the handle of his lightsaber into Qui-Gon's face, stunning the Jedi Master, and the merciless Sith Lord quickly took the moment to stab Qui-Gon in the chest, while Obi-Wan could only watch in horror. The laser fields soon switched off, and Obi-Wan ran through to avenge his master's fatal blow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Overcome with hatred, Obi-Wan lashed out at Maul. He succeeded in slicing the Sith Lord's double-bladed lightsaber hilt in half, leaving Maul with only one blade.

Oli\u00e9 ordered another pilot to attack the bridge. One of the pilots was killed during a strafing run by the battleship's turbolaser cannons, but the Naboo pilots managed to land hits on the Droid Control Ship with their proton torpedoes. The torpedoes were not strong enough, however, to affect the Federation ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the battle raged in space, down on the planet the young Force-sensitive Anakin Skywalker accidentally entered the battle when he accidentally launched his starfighter and took off from the Theed Hangar on autopilot. He asked his astromech droid R2-D2 to disengage the autopilot; Although R2-D2 demanded that Skywalker return to the hangar, Skywalker refused, citing that Qui-Gon had earlier told him to \"stay in the cockpit.\" Skywalker then succeeded in shooting down several droid starfighters before having his own starfighter shot down, and he landed in the battleship's left hangar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the hangar, Skywalker's ship landed on the hangar floor, overheated. He attempted to restart the fighter by fiddling with the controls.

Communications officer Tey How reported the disturbance to Captain Daultay Dofine, who dismissed these reports after claiming that it was impossible for anything to get past the deflector shields. However, the reactor explosion caused by Skywalker managed to create a massive explosion that ripped the ship in half. Shocked over the explosion, Skywalker quickly escaped through the ship's main hangar, also comparing it to podracing.

The only thing he remembered was the reason why he had become what he was now: Kenobi. The only person who knew of Darth Maul's survival was Mother Talzin of the Nightsisters. At the height of the Clone Wars, after having incurred the wrath of Count Dooku, Talzin sent her new servant, Savage Opress, Maul's brother, to find him. Sidious would later learn of Maul's survival during the Clone Wars from Kenobi in person when debriefing him on the events on the Skirmish on Florrum.

He was finally discovered on Malachor, when the Jedi survivors Ahsoka Tano and Kanan Jarrus, as well as Kanan's apprentice Ezra Bridger, arrived on the planet seeking information about how to destroy the Sith. Maul would manipulate the Jedi (particularly Ezra) in assisting him for his own purposes, eventually leading to him discovering that Obi-Wan Kenobi was still alive. After learning that Obi-Wan was hiding on Tatooine, Maul manipulated Ezra to draw Obi-Wan out and then confronted his old enemy on the desert planet.

However, unlike Endor, Great Grass Plains is not won by the protagonists, and they are only saved due to luck, and outside intervention. According to Lucas during the audio commentary, Binks' antics were inspired by Buster Keaton. The battle also had Japanese themes to it.

First, the scene was mapped out by animatics. Then, FX artist Dennis Muren assembled pictures of Earth locations, and these images were distorted by Industrial Light & Magic to appear alien. CGI images of the Trade Federation vehicles and Gungan armies were subsequently inserted into the shot. Animators received horse-riding instructions to illustrate the kaadu realistically. In addition, hundreds of effects such as laser blasts were rendered. Explosions were made on stage in real life, then scanned into the digital compositing system for alterations. The droids, at the suggestion of George Lucas, were made to be pigeon-like, with different actions randomly assigned to individual droids. On the other hand, the space sequence was produced through a combination of computer animation and motion-control model photography."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn against Darth Maul on the Naboo hangar, John Williams wrote and scored \"Duel of the Fates,\" the musical theme ultimately featured as the main theatrical motif for the film. According to Dave Filoni, the use of the musical theme symbolically represents that the duel's outcome will decide the fate of Anakin Skywalker; Qui-Gon Jinn fights for Anakin's future as he knows that he's the father figure Anakin needs after convincing him to leave his mother on Tatooine. In the end, Obi-Wan Kenobi takes Anakin as his Padawan because he promised Qui-Gon to do it rather than for genuine care of Anakin, as while Kenobi comes to see Skywalker as a brother, he doesn't act like a father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
