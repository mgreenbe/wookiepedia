This clone survived Grievous' boarding of Obi-Wan Kenobi's Arquitens-class light cruiser and later attempted with CC-2224 and another surviving clone to capture Grievous while he was fleeing back to his ship by using a grappling hook and tackling him. After Grievous had escaped from them and continued on his way to his own ship. CC-2224 and the other two followed as well to help the Jedi General when they caught up on a bridge connecting the two ships. Grievous escaped after a quick duel with Kenobi and Gallia, and the bridge began to break off. After one of the clones was sucked into space, Gallia was able to get to safety and send a grappling hook to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi, CC-2224 and this clone. All three made it up and the four were told to go to a hangar where Anakin Skywalker would pick them up. This clone boarded onto the ship and escaped right before the two connected ships were destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 \"Grievous Intrigue\" (First appearance)"}]}
