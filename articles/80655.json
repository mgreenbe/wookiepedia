The Mon Calamari then asked Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and her protector Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to assist in the negotiations. The Quarren invited Separatist ambassador, Commander Riff Tamson, to assist them in demanding a Quarren king. Despite Lee-Char's assurances that he was dedicated to serving both the Quarren and Mon Cala people, Tamson believed that Lee-Char had not earned the right to speak. Tamson and the Quarren then left believing that the time for words were over. Ri then expressed his sympathies to Lee-Char about the loss of his father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lee-Char later met with Senator Meena Tills and Gial Ackbar, captain of the Mon Calamari Guard.

However, the Quarren and Separatist forces under Tamson attacked. Lee-Char along with Skywalker and Ackbar went to the battlefield to watch. Despite Skywalker's plea to get Lee-Char to safety, the prince chose stay with his people.

The two of them then took a OMS Devilfish through several tubes. Tamson tried to break through the tube, but he and his forces were forced to retreat. Tills told Lee-Char that he must demand a surrender from the Quarren. However, Tamson and his forces, aided by Hydroid Medusas from Karkaris attacked. Lee-Char and his forces attempted to hold their ground against both the aqua droids and Hydroid Medusas, but Ackbar urged the prince to retreat to the caves.

As Lee-Char, the Jedi, and clones went into hiding, the prince saw how the Separatists and the Quarren had begun to take the Mon Calamari to labor camps. To inspire his people, Lee-Char took a conch shell and blew into it, making a loud sound to communicate to his people that he was still alive and would continue to fight for them. Lee-Char and his company were confronted by the aqua droids, but the droids cut down by the Jedi. The Republic were able to convince the Gungans to send their Grand Army as reinforcements to free the Mon Cala. However, Tamson deployed his reinforcements to counter the Republic's reinforcements. Tamson then deployed his Trident-class assault ship ships and used them to create a vortex that pulled in all the Mon Calamari and Republic forces.

After allowing himself to be captured, the prince demanded an audience with Tamson, where he was able to convince Nossor Ri that the Karkarodon had gone back on his deal with the Quarren to seize the planet's throne. Realizing the error in the decision to aid the Separatists, Ri and the Quarren betrayed Tamson and helped Lee-Char and the Republic free Mon Cala, and the prince killed Tamson one-on-one after the latter confessed to killing Kolina.

Barr told Lee-Char that he had foreseen the Mon Calamari saving the galaxy and began advising Lee-Char's negotiations. Barr did this from his cave refuge where he and his six disciples stayed in hiding. As Lee-Char started turning his back on the Galactic Empire's trade offers, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin came to Mon Cala on the Sovereign and sent down ambassador Telvar to negotiate with Lee-Char. He continued to deny these offers, saying that the Empire would take their resources away until they were in poverty. Despite Telvar telling the King that the Empire would protect them, his advisor, Raddus, told him that the ships they had proved otherwise with Lee-Char telling Raddus to be silent. After Telvar left, Raddus and the King began talking about the idea of seceding from the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Vader and three Inquisitors traveled to Mon Cala to search for Barr and Telvar's shuttle detonated killing Telvar and the rest of the crew.

Before long, Tarkin's forces invaded Mon Cala and battles erupted throughout the surface. A large battle broke out at Dac City where Lee-Char was and Vader and his group quickly took their landing pad and made for the palace. Lee-Char assigned Raddus to the southern end of Mon Cala and Ackbar to the northern. Lee-Char then attempted to negotiate terms with Tarkin about a cease-fire but the man only ordered that he do it first. Lee-Char then asked Barr what to do and the Jedi convinced him, through a mind trick, to take drastic action. Vader and the Inquisitors fought their way into the palace and the Inquisitor Ninth Sister interrogated him for the location of Barr.

As Vader and the Inquisitors marched through Bel City, Vader was contacted by Tarkin who convince him to capture Lee-Char and end the fighting on Mon Cala. Vader agreed and left the Inquisitors to hunt down Barr. The Inquisitors eventually managed to corner him and his last disciple, a force-sensitive named Verla but Barr outsmarted them, using their Jedi past and the not yet activated inhibitor chips in the Inquisitor troopers to turn the clones on their masters.

Lee-Char refused to surrender his forces and Barr arrived to confront Vader. The two fought and Barr revealed that he had assassinated Telvar in order to start the fighting on Mon Cala. Lee-Char was shocked at this and broadcasted an order for all Mon Calamari and Quarren forces to ceasefire. He then contacted Tarkin and told him of his surrender. Tarkin agreed to cease the bombardment once a shuttle arrived to take Lee-Char away. Barr laughed as he fought Vader and Lee-Char asked how he could do so. Barr told him it was part of his plan and that the Mon Calamari starships would eventually be at the forefront of a great rebellion. Lee-Char said billions were dying and Barr said it was billions that would inspire trillions. Vader then slew Barr and took Lee-Char away.
