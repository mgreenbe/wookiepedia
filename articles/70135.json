They would receive and archive knowledge so that others might learn, and in the process expand their own awareness of the galaxy. They would often remain close to the Temple Archives on Coruscant or Ossus, or join the ExplorCorps and travel the galaxy to expand their knowledge. The archivists were responsible for translating, copying, and storing all new texts added to the Temple's collection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi archivists were at their height in times of peace, however, during the events of the Clone Wars, they became few in number.
