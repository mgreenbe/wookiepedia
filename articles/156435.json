Subjected to the Moff's \"entertainments\" during her incarceration, she was eventually deposited in an observation cell. Too shocked to fight back against her captor, the woman cowered against one of the cell's walls, pleading to be told why she was being punished. In response, Moff Sarne\u2014watching the interior of the cell from the transparisteel window above\u2014made strange comments, referencing a \"wraith\" and the need to test the loyalty of his servants. The woman did not understand Sarne; unknown to her, she was not the only occupant of the cell. A Defel named Kl'aal was hidden in the shadows opposite her. Kl'aal was the Moff's personal assassin, who had developed a taste for freshly killed meat after crash landing on a remote planet. Kl'aal had struck a deal with Sarne to serve as his assassin in exchange for the chance to indulge his hunger. Sarne was attempting to goad Kl'aal into killing the woman and eating her for his own amusement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The woman, confused by Sarne's words, asked the Moff what he meant. Sarne told her to shut up, and said he was speaking to the shadows, not her. Kl'aal let out a growl directed toward the Moff, and the woman retreated into the far corner and began to sob. As the woman cowered in the corner, Sarne continued to bait his assassin, telling him that he would starve if he did not eat the woman. Kl'aal remained hidden in the shadows, and refused to participate.
