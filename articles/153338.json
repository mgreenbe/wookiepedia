The officer worked under the command of the planet's Imperial governor, Corwyth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under Corwyth, the smog-and-factory-covered Metalorn was kept isolated from outside influences, which left the local populace unaware of the Rebel movement fighting the rule of the Empire in the Galactic Civil War. In addition, Corwyth designed an elaborate security system centered around the use of tracking devices in electrical equipment and weapons. As such, if an individual ever stole a blaster, the Imperials could easily locate that person due to the tracking device built into the gun."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Renegade princess"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 0 ABY, the Rebel princess from the planet Alderaan, Leia Organa, attempted to infiltrate Metalorn in order to bring the world out of the dark and take the planet's populace to the brink of rebellion. Not long into her mission, Organa encountered a lone stormtrooper, whom she dispatched; unaware of the tracking device in the trooper's blaster, Organa took the weapon for herself and proceeded with her mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial officer was tasked with tracking down the stolen blaster by using the device implanted inside of it, though he was unaware of the identity of the woman who had stolen it. Troopers chased Organa to an ore processing center, where she hopped onto an ore conveyor cart that carried her through the facility to a chamber designated Smelter Bay Five. The officer reached the chamber ahead of her and had his men prepare for her arrival, stationing them along a catwalk above the conveyor. His plan was to blast Organa as soon as she appeared. Meanwhile, the heightened activity was passed along as nothing more than a security test to the curious populace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While riding the conveyor, Organa discovered the security system and its relation to her weapon, and she ditched the moving cart while leaving the blaster behind. When the cart arrived in the officer's secured chamber, the troopers opened fire on his command. Once the smoke dissipated, the Imperials quickly discovered that the princess had escaped, much to the officer's frustration. The officer then reported back to Corwyth, who could only vent his grievances on his radio officer. Ultimately, Organa's mission was a success, persuading her old mentor Arn Horada to help spread a rebel movement through the planet's populace. The officer's failure culminated with Organa's escape from Metalorn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial officer was loyal to the Empire and was able to effectively command stormtroopers.
