Captain Vitala Baize infiltrated a CorSec agent in the Chirq Council and discovered the locations of their secret headquarters. During the subsequent CorSec assault on the Second Elite Council Bunker, Agent Hurley Klakk was tasked to hamper the production of the Chirq Council Mechanized Guardians. Klakk thought that the best way to achieve the objective was to destroy the droids already built. He thus hired an independent spacer who previously worked for the CorSec to help him in his mission. The spacer entered the Second Elite Council Bunker, fought the Mechanized Guardians and successfully destroyed them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chirq Council Mechanized Guardians appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
