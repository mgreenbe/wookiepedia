On most models, the only weapon was a turreted flak pod, capable of firing several types of ordnance. Other versions could be equipped with one or three rocket-launching tubes. Initially the AT-AA had an inability to fire at ground targets. This was partially rectified with the addition of gun ports to allow the crew to fend off infantry attacks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some variation had flak pods replaced with concussion missile launchers.

The walker saw action during the Galactic Civil War, where it was used against aircraft, but was useless against any ground vehicles. Although the troopers aboard could fix blaster rifle mounts on the vehicle, the AT-AA still relied heavily on escorting infantry vehicles, including AT-STs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Kalaan, AT-AA batteries protected the armored columns from airborne enemies, bringing down scores of Alliance T-47 airspeeders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AT-AAs were used even in the time of the New Republic, where they defended the galactic capital from the New Republic Defense Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AT-AA is the only Imperial siege weapon originating from the Expanded Universe to appear in all three of the major Star Wars RTS games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
