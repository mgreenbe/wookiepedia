The front void of the craft held two mammoth docking bays on either side, which were lined with forward docking claws. These gigantic cargo vessels had been built for many years by the Trade Federation to haul cargo between planets and were an important asset to their enterprise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Housed in the stern of the main body were the main reactors, each connected to one of the three main engines, as well as to secondary engines and each other. The central sphere housed its own reactor/power generator assemblies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lining the equatorial bands in batteries of three, were quad turbolaser cannons capable of rotating inwards when not in use. Their limited coverage of the hull made the early battleship models vulnerable, and made them rely more on the massive number of starfighters carried to defend the ships against enemy starfighters. This was, however, rectified with later ships whose armor and shields proved too strong for starfighter firepower, the fact becoming quickly apparent at the Battle of Naboo. The pre\u2013Clone Wars models of the battleships did have major defense flaws, as Anakin Skywalker was able to fly his starfighter into the hangar of a Droid Control Ship and destroy the starboard main reactor by accident. The resulting explosion destroyed the battleship and ensured a Naboo victory."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars\u2013era battleship"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucrehulk-class battleships that fought in the Clone Wars had less trouble with weak spots, as they were augmented with gun batteries and much stronger shielding. Batteries of long guns and heavy guns complemented the additional quad turbolaser batteries added to the Lucrehulk superstructure when the war erupted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each ship was also now so powerful due to the increased amount of power devoted to offensive and defensive systems that a whole flotilla of Republic Star Destroyers was needed just to bring down a Lucrehulk's shields. The Clone Wars refitted models were true battleships and were among the most powerful ships in the Confederate Navy. Due to their firepower and strong shielding and armor, and large starfighter complements, these battleships were often used as command ships and as blockade vessels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Trade Federation began creating its military, the Executive Board realized the need for large cruisers to transport their weapons across the galaxy, battleships to defend against starfighter attacks, and flagships for controlling their vast legions of battle droids. Reluctant to spend the credits necessary to construct and purchase a fleet of military vessels, the Trade Federation began modifying a portion of its many thousands of Lucrehulk-class freighters into warships. Their early navy had about 10% of all Lucrehulks converted to battleships and by the battle of Naboo, it was estimated that 35% of the class had undergone refitting."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Invasion of Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trade Federation used a substantial fleet of Lucrehulk-class battleships to enforce the invasion of Naboo, led by the flagship Saak'ak.\nThe most important vessel in the Trade Federation's blockade was the Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palaa. When the rest of the blockade dispersed after Naboo was successfully occupied, the Neimoidians left the Droid Control Ship in orbit to coordinate their droid forces. The Control Ship was later destroyed by the young Anakin Skywalker, resulting in the deactivation of the Droid Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Invasion of Naboo, the Republic ordered the Trade Federation to disband its military forces. The crafty Trade Federation pretended to comply with this command by apparently disassembling most of its battleships, only to transform their centrispheres into detachable core ships capable of carrying supplies as well as increasing the battleship's armaments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 27 BBY, two of these vessels were used to try to destroy Outbound Flight.

A few battleships kept in Imperial surplus stock were also sold to the Corporate Sector and to wealthy merchants. Other ships were dismantled and sent to garbage dumps like Raxus Prime. Several captured Lucrehulks were pressed into service in the Imperial Navy and used to host flight schools for military fighter pilots. Several Lucrehulks, belonging to an unknown party, were also involved in a skirmish with Rebel forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of several Alliance Lucrehulks, the Fortressa served as a starfighter carrier, carrying a complement of hundreds of T-65 X-wing starfighters.

Doug Chiang achieved this in early concept art by adding the antennae and docking section to one side, and a set of engines to the other.
