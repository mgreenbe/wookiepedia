In 1 BBY, he was one of the twenty-six Rebel resistance fighters that served under Morgan Katarn at the G-Tap; armed with an SLM launcher, he and his companion Jen were part of the missile team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vester's Corellian light freighter approached and Morgan ordered the pair to destroy that assault ship. Jen loaded his tube and Trol attempted to get a lock, hidden behind some boulders. The SLM hit the underside of the ship but Vester, its experienced pilot, returned it to its position. Trot felt anxiety while Jen loaded a second missile; once it was launched, the missile was hit by a laser, and the explosion killed the pair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
