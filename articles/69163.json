While in a cantina there, he witnessed operatives of the Twi'lek crime lord Jor Idrall brawling with some locals. Janson and the soldiers under his command, dressed in civilian garb, intervened to restore order. The brawl was a warning from Idrall directed at spies of the Ithorian crime lord Rethorn; the message being that Tatooine was Idrall's turf and it was protected. Edgewood later reported this incident to the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
