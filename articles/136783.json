He also had an agreement with one of the cantina's regulars, the mercenary Bazine Netal, where he would send work her way in return for Netal acting as an informal bouncer for his establishment and promising not to maim any trouble-makers until she was some distance from the cantina. On one occasion while Netal waited for a client at the cantina, Suli sent Ooda to tell the mercenary that the client was one his way. The \"client\" turned out to be a protocol droid sent as an intermediate for the true individual hiring Netal. The droid was set to self-destruct following its meeting with Netal, but the mercenary hurled it from the second floor of the cantina into the street in order to lessen the damage to Suli's cantina."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suli first appeared in the short story \"The Perfect Weapon,\" which was written by Delilah S.
