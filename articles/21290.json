When war broke out between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems\u2014of which the Techno Union was a member\u2014in 22 BBY, Republic forces initiated a blockade of Foerost, hoping the planet's shipyards would suffer from the lack of Separatist supplies. However, in 20 BBY, almost two years into the conflict, the Sullustan Dua Ningo assumed command of the Bulwark Fleet, an armada of Bulwark Mark I warships, and broke the Republic's blockade. With Ningo commanding from the Unrepentant, the Bulwark Fleet defeated everything that stood in its way during a campaign throughout Coruscant's Sector Zero before being defeated by the Republic Victory Fleet at the Battle of Anaxes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A successor class, the Bulwark Mark II, was also produced for the Confederacy. Following the Clone Wars, TransGalMeg Industries used the Mark I design as inspiration for the Bulwark Mark III battlecruiser, which was utilized by the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. A retrofitted Bulwark Mark I served with the New Republic's Rapid Response Task Force and participated in the Battle of Mindor in 5 ABY. The modified battleship possessed a Class 0.6 hyperdrive, additional shielding, space for at least three starfighter squadrons, and several Jadthu-class landing ships secured to its hull."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bulwark Mark I was introduced in The New Essential Chronology, a 2005 reference book authored by Daniel Wallace.
