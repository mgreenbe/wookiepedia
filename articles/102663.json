It was considered a medium-sized starship, and was consistent with the standard Paataatus heavy warship designs, as it was wide and flat, heavily armored with minimal top point defenses, main lasers positioned on the leading edge, and missile tubes added underneath the bow. The heavy frigate's design was considered unusual among the various alien designs met by the Chiss Ascendancy, but was considered to fit well with the Paataatus strategy of approaching an opponent with lasers firing, then pitching up to fire the missiles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One heavy frigate was surrounded by six enhanced cruisers, five of which were controlled by the fellow Paataatus, while another was under the control of a remnant of the Nikardun Destiny, and held the others hostage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
