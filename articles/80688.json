She and the rest of the league were trapped within the Anoat sector during the Galactic Civil War when the Galactic Empire created the Iron Blockade around the sector following the death of Galactic Emperor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the blockade, Pali and two of Shortpaw's other advisor; Ndaya and Onn Iria, met with Shortpaw at his junk stall in Longstar Marketplace on the planet Burnin Konn. There, Shortpaw introduced them to a young smuggler who had been working for the crime lord Happy Dapp, an associate of the league. Shortpaw and Pali then explained the issues the league were facing with getting starships through the blockade and how they planned to try and bring a ship into the Mataou system."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Missions to Mataou"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group's plan was to have the smuggler head to the planet Mataou and probe the Imperial sensor network there using old Hutt equipment on the world. Pali warned the smuggler that the equipment would be heavily guarded by old Hutt security droids and after Shortpaw promised to lend smuggler a hazmat scow for the mission, the mission began."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The smuggler successfully fought through the Hutt security droids in a graveyard on Mataou and activated the old scanning equipment three then contacted Shortpaw to report the success.

At the market once again, Shortpaw and Pali briefed the smuggler on the next step of the plan: creating a distraction on Mataou so that the ship could slip through undetected. They sent both the smuggler and Dapp to create the distraction, and after the pair successfully fought their way through an Imperial garrison, Pali contacted the smuggler to report that the ship had successfully entered the sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pali and Shortpaw congratulated the smuggler once the three were reunited at LongStar Marketplace, but refused to reveal any further information about what the ship they had smuggled in had been carrying.

She wore green Mirialan tattoos across her face. She was initially unhappy with hiring a smuggler with no ship, but was impressed by the criminal's work for the league.
