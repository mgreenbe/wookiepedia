He used his ship, Starkiller, as a freight-hauling front for his criminal activity. He was one of many people who attempted to capture Jedi Knight Roni von Wasaki but, along with his companion Gammid and droid XT-8, was the only one to successfully do so. He and Gammid distracted Wasaki, an act that got Gammid killed, while XT-8 sneaked up behind Wasaki and stunned him. This confirmed what Drobo thought, that Jedi mind tricks had no affect on droids. Drobo and XT-8 then froze Wasaki in carbonite and loaded him onto the Starkiller to be transported to collect his 100,000 credit reward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the flight, however, Wasaki reached out with his mind and managed to convince Drobo to free him from the carbonite. XT-8 discovered this and confronted Drobo in the engine room, killing him outright but also damaging the hyperdrive engines. Drobo's body lay there for over 20,000 years while XT-8 attempted to get to the crime boss offering the reward on their remaining sublight drives. When a group of Rebels entered the ship they discovered his dead body and, upon touching it, it crumbled revealing Drobo's hold-out blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
