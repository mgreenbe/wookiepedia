The blaster had a slim barrel, and a sniper scope attachment at the top. It had a high firing rate, similar to that of the WESTAR-34 blaster pistol used by Jango Fett. Both had the same alloy that prevented overheating of the blaster barrel from excess firing. This allowed the user to fire in a fast but sustained volley."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cham Syndulla used this model when leading the attack on Twi'lek capital Lessu.
