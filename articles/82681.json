He feared Caedus, but informed him of the destruction of the minelayers outside of Fondor shortly before the Second Battle of Fondor. When Daala and her Maw Irregular Fleet dropped out of hyperspace at the end of the battle, Loccin was the one who told Caedus. Since Loccin and Duv-Horlo, another junior officer, were also able to see the fleet, not just Caedus, he realized that Jedi Master Luke Skywalker must have been pulling off a larger Fallanassi illusion than the one he had experienced earlier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
