A Master Shaper, Dal was assigned to oversee the grafting of Warmaster Tsavong Lah's new radank forearm. However, the arm continued to rot, and Dal could supply no reason for this. In truth, he was sabotaging the arm, so that he and High Priest Takhaff Uul could control the Warmaster. Tsavong Lah, however, was already suspicious thanks to Viqi Shesh, and when Nen Yim discovered that the arm was sabotaged, Lah decided to take vengeance. On the shaper vessel Fu'ulanh, Dal was killed by rancors that Tsavong Lah unleashed into the vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
