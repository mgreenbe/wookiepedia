She had dark skin and platinum blonde hair. During the waning years of the Galactic Republic, the inhabitants of Iol, a planet that Tangan Industries owned in the Unknown Regions, were on the verge of revolution, and Tangan appointed Nis'tar to act as the new administrator of the city Haven. The company executives hoped that Nis'tar would act only as a figurehead and that she would put the needs of Tangan first. However, Nis'tar acted responsible and prioritized the welfare of the world's colonists over those of the company, which earned her the favor of both the colonists and her husband, forcing the Tangan executive board to allow her to run the colony as she saw fit. Nis'tar continued to act as the administrator of Haven until the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
