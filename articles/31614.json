After some factions unleashed Lugubraa mercenaries upon their foes, the insatiable soldiers not only wrought havoc on their targets' worlds, but also those of their employers. The Croke petitioned the Kaminoans to clone a new strain of Lugubraa to fight back their mainline cousins. This new batch consisted of Lugubraa known as blind berserkers; however, it proved just as dangerous and uncontrollable. The Croke found themselves fighting to avoid extinction against the new force, which the Croke Reach natives called the Leech Legion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A civil war erupted amongst factions of the Croke species, who inhabited the Croke Reach of the Unknown Regions. During these hostilities, some Croke groups utilized Lugubraa mercenaries against their enemies, hoping the ravenous marauders would decimate their targets' planets. The technique backfired, as the Lugubraa proved even more successful than had been intended and turned on their masters' worlds as well. After several generations, the Croke, regardless of their side in the civil war, found themselves fighting the Lugubraa to secure their very survival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Croke turned to the cloners of the planet Kamino for help against the Lugubraa menace.

Among the Croke planets affected by the Lugubraa was Explume Minor, where the Shell Conjurer Firtha ordered the cloaking of Croke nestlings\u2014using the species' inherent illusion-casting ability\u2014and their subsequent evacuation.
