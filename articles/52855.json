A tall, broad-shouldered man, Garault bore a scar on his chin that he received while fighting the Empire. He was the second in command of Master Surro, who led a small group of Jedi that adopted a sixth line to the Jedi Code\u2014\"There is no contemplation, there is only duty.\" The team served as the Galactic Republic's scouts on the planet Balmorra after Grand Marshal Cheketta's defeat at the Balmorran Arms Factory, and Garault nearly succumbed to the dark side of the Force when one of their number, Danak, was killed by Imperials after being exposed by a Twi'lek named Ivo. Years later, the group\u2014now officially known as the Sixth Line and in the employ of the Republic Strategic Information Service\u2014was deployed on the planet Ziost by Theron Shan, but Garault and the others fell under the control of the former Sith Emperor Vitiate. Garault was grievously wounded in battle, and moments before his death, Garault was released from Vitiate's control. During the final confrontation with Tenebrae, Garault was among the spirits witnessing his final death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Garault was first introduced in the short story The Sixth Line, released shortly before Game Update 3.2: Rise of the Emperor was added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic; Garault appears in the update as the first member of the Sixth Line encountered by players."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
