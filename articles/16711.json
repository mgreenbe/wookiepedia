Built strong enough to support the weight of an adult Human male, with a removable counterbalance weight located at the end opposite to the pointed tip, a bevii'ragir could function as both a dangerous weapon and a supportive walking stick."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 19 BBY, the clone commando deserter, Fi Skirata, was given a bevii'ragir by his girlfriend Parja Bralor, during his time living on the planet Mandalore. Skirata had suffered brain damage during an operation on Gaftikar while he was still in the service of the Galactic Republic, and used the bevii'ragir to support himself when he walked in public. He believed using the hunting spear afforded him a more dignified appearance than crutches or a cane."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bevii'ragir was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the Republic Commando novel Order 66, authored by Karen Traviss and published September 16, 2008."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The novel also mentions an ancient bronzium spear worn by the Mandalorian Cuy'val Dar sergeant Wad'e Tay'haai on the back of his armor.
