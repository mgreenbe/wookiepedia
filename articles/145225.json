He achieved the rank of captain, and during the Cold War between the Republic and the Sith Empire, Theraguin worked in the Black Sun territory of Coruscant. After the Sacking of Coruscant, the CSF struggled to maintain order and eventually called for Republic Military support. However, large areas of the planet were lost to gangs who consolidated into the Black Sun criminal syndicate. Claiming sectors as their own, mostly in Coruscant's lower levels, Black Sun sought to impose its own order. The CSF, having sustained casualties both during the Sacking and the years after, all but abandoned the area as they drew back to police vital government and commerce districts. Theraguin was one of the few officers who stayed behind to help as best as he could, although CSF could do little more than build blockades and keep the street battles contained to certain areas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3643 BBY, Black Sun developed a new way of terrorizing the locals and refugees. Its members stole crates of Republic supplies and then placed them in public areas, but not before rigging them with explosives. When refugees went to open them, the crates exploded and killed all in the immediate area. Theraguin did not originally believe the stories about the \"game\" until he witnessed a woman blown to pieces by one of the explosive crates. He tried to defuse the crates, but there was little he could do without being killed himself by Black Sun thugs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that time a Republic individual offered to defuse the explosives. Theraguin accepted the offer, and the individual proceeded to disarm the rigged crates, in the process also killing the Black Sun thugs who were behind the terror.

Theraguin was thankful for the individual's assistance and continued his work in the Black Sun Territory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Theraguin was a large, older man with dark skin, brown eyes, and graying hair. A veteran police officer, Theraguin was one of the few, if not the only, cop who continued to work in the Black Sun Territory, which most officers, including his superior, had abandoned. Determined to do what he could to relieve the suffering of the locals, Theraguin defied Black Sun's thugs and went beyond the CSF's barricades into the territory. He went so far as to risk his life to diffuse explosives if it would save lives. However, the violence and hopelessness of the Black Sun Territory left Theraguin frustrated.

The years after the Sacking of Coruscant, however, brought with them a brutal urban warfare\u2014something for which Theraguin and the CSF were not trained.
