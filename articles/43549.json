Since there was no use of names in this passage, it can imply that either Kalen was Elliar's fianc\u00e9 (which is a continuity error) or that Kalen also had a fianc\u00e9e who was murdered by Ta'a Chume (which is possible, since next to nothing is known about him). This would also make sense, if like Elliar, she felt this woman too weak to be her successor as dictated by Hapan law."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
