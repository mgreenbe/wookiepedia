There it docked with a Goff, a deep-space supply platform whose owner's clan had agreed to service Rebel ships. Unfortunately for Omicron 2 the Empire had scheduled an attack-and-capture mission with the platform as its target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Omicron 2's last run began when the Imperial strike force demanded its surrender. Bravely, although also foolishly, the Rebel starship refused and instead launched a salvo of torpedoes. Imperial starfighters then showered it with weapon fire, badly damaging it. Faced with imminent destruction, Omicron 2 agreed to power down and be boarded. All those aboard were captured."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
