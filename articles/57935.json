They were most effective at ranges less than a kilometer and followed deliberately swerving, evasive trajectories. The IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank was equipped with two racks of missile launcher pods on either side of its head, each carrying 15 guided missile warheads that left behind a trail of black exhaust when fired."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
