The Harrower-class dreadnought ferried the Dread Masters between battles, and the Sith wielded their power in Sith magic and battle meditation to induce crippling fear in the crews of enemy vessels. In 3668 BBY, the Jedi Knight Jaric Kaedan stole security codes for the heavily-guarded ship and, along with Special Forces strike team, boarded the dreadnaught using a stolen yacht and captured the Dread Masters. After securing the ship's databanks and setting the vessel to self-destruct, the strike team departed the dreadnaught with their captives. With the ship's destruction, the Empire believed the Dread Masters to be dead, though they were imprisoned on Belsavis; the Empire responded by attacking Alderaan in 3667 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
