Alongside Tione Zrar and Velai, Athantras attempted to protect a village led by Thissa Somori from a group of pirates. When the pirates landed to collect payments from the villagers, Athantras and her companions stood in their way, bringing the villagers into diplomatic negotiations with the pirates.
