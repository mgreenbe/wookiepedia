It could be equipped onto certain types of melee weapons, such as vibroblades. In order to be integrated, it required a high quality weapon and a workbench with adequate tools. When added to the weapon, it acted to stabilize the blade, allowing it to more reliably hit and damage targets. It also made the blade slightly unwieldly and difficult to use, a weakness that was improved in later models."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It saw use during the Jedi Civil War, where it was utilized by both the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire. The device was also carried by some Jedi. It could be purchased from many vendors throughout the galaxy. The energy cell was still in use during the First Jedi Purge, by which time several upgraded models had been developed. These included Mark II, III, and IV versions. Each subsequent model improved the performance of the device, while reducing the effect on wielding difficulty. These models were able to be crafted with the right components and tools, but required additional skill and materials for the better versions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vibration cells first appeared as an upgrade item in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.
