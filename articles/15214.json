Acting without Confederate support, Five World Prime Minister Sadras Koyan and Corellia's Minister of Information Denjax Teppler worked to render Centerpoint Station, an ancient superweapon that hung in the Corellian system, reactivated and operational. As technicians worked on the station, Koyan contacted the Alliance and requested a meeting with Solo at a deep-space rendezvous point, where a supposed defection of Corellia from the Confederation to the Alliance could be discussed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo arrived at rendezvous point in his flagship, the Anakin Solo, accompanied by elements of the Galactic Alliance Second Fleet. There, he met a Corellian Decoy fleet composed of decommissioned and nearly derelict vessels. Before negotiations began, he was contacted by his mother Leia Organa Solo, onboard the SoroSuub 2400 yacht Love Commander. The yacht docked in one of the Anakin Solo's hangar bays, and Organa Solo joined her son on the bridge to give him a stern talking-to. Meanwhile, her husband, daughter, and two friends, who were hidden aboard the yacht, infiltrated the ship to commit sabotage. When they returned, they briefly did battle with the Force phantom of the renegade Dark Jedi Alema Rar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo began to negotiate with Corellian Captain Hoclaw via holocam. When he realized that his mother was gone, he suspected she had planted a bomb somewhere, and he boarded a TIE Reconnaissance Fighter with his daughter Allana and left the vessel. The Jedi Coalition's Red Sword Flight, who were working in tandem with the crew of the Love Commander, arrived on scene in StealthXs and began to battle him. They held off making kill shots when they sensed a child's presence in his starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corellian reinforcements arrived and a battle began. The Decoy fleet took a beating from the Alliance Second Fleet, but, anticipating an attack from Centerpoint Station, kept their distance. Koyan, Teppler, and Corellian Admiral Genna Delpin were concurrently aboard Centerpoint with a group of technicians and authorized them to fire. The station's repulsor weapon destroyed the Decoy Fleet and much of the Second Fleet, but the Chief of State and the Anakin Solo escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Turr Phennir, the Supreme Commander of the Confederation military, was angered that Corellia had acted alone, and cut the planet off from all Confederation aid. When Teppler privately appealed to him, he affirmed that Corellia would only be welcomed back in to the Confederate fold if Koyan were removed from power. The Alliance became aware that Centerpoint was operational and later launched an attack on it; during the attack, Teppler maneuvered Koyan to his death in order to secure Confederate reinforcements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
