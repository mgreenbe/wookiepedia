It was crewed by the parents of Affie Hollow, who were indentured to Guild leader Scover Byne. When Hollow was a child, her parents were killed and the Kestrel's Dive destroyed when they attempted to refuel their ship using dangerous helix rings at the Amaxine station. Hollow did not discover the truth behind her parents' deaths until after she discovered the existence of the space station in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
