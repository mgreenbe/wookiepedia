Sometime during the Imperial Period, Negastrike Platoon of the Stormtrooper Corps' 501st Legion was deployed to the Arakka waterway to remove Trandoshan colonists in preparation for Imperial settlement. Negastrike Platoon destroyed a Trandoshan settlement at the mouth of the waterway before deploying incinerator stormtroopers to clear Trandoshans who had taken cover beneath the river's algae mats. At least one hundred Trandoshans were burned to death in the operation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
