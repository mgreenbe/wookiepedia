Maarek Stele was assigned to lead a new strike force to capture the plant.

Due to the fact that ZA-13 was not entirely loyal to Zaarin, the factory did not need to be disabled. There were also no craft defending the station. Once the capture operation began, however, some Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wings arrived, and began harassing Stele and his wingmen. Soon after the arrival of the Gunboats, CR90 corvettes from Caplure group arrived, to provide heavy fire support. As Stele's flight group had been armed with proton rockets, however, they proved no threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the Corvettes were dispatched, the Carrack-class light cruiser Jumimi entered the battle zone.
