Along with her associate, Romina Foss, and a hired crew, Tucat led an expedition to the abandoned moon of Lupal, despite the perilous results of all previous explorers who visited the moon. The warnings proved to be correct when the red light emitted by the solar flares of Lupal's star turned the Shistavanen Kordus Vrak into a feral creature and drove him to kill the other crew members. While attempting to escape with Foss, Tucat was attacked and killed by Vrak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
