Yrica Quell, a resident on the Gavana Orbital space station, and her family once owned a female felinx, which eventually became sick. Quell's parents, sure that the animal was in pain, had the felinx put down as a result, though Quell refused to witness the creature's death. While Everi Chalis was governor of the planet Haidoral Prime, she believed that too many felinx in the planet's capital city, Haidoral Administrative Center One, were turning feral and harming the city's appearance. Consequently, she ordered a culling of the creatures, which resulted in the death of one owned by the civilian Corbo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, after the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry attacked Haidoral Prime, Corbo joined the company.

While the governor was held in a makeshift brig aboard the company's CR90 corvette, the Thunderstrike, Corbo attempted to confront her about his dead felinx, carrying a galley knife with him. His attempt to visit Chalis failed, and he explained the death of his felinx to First Sergeant Hazram Namir when questioned about his intentions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 5 ABY, Quell, who was a New Republic pilot at that time, mentioned her felinx's death in a conversation with the IT-O Interrogation Unit IT-O while the two were stranded on a planetoid in the Cerberon system.
