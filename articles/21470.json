They were native to Kaisa, a planet located in the Corva sector of the Outer Rim Territories. The Buro had no presence offworld, but their homeworld did receive some visitors, among them a Human-crewed, geological survey starship. The survey crew negligently destroyed a forest on Kaisa, and the destruction of this habitat led to the extinction of the Buro species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 24 ABY, the Diversity Alliance, an anti-Human organization, became aware of the extinction of the Buro and the role played by the survey crew. The Alliance's leader, Nolaa Tarkona, tasked the Chironian operative Lusa with wiping clean the navigation computers of the survey crew's starship; their next jump into hyperspace would see them emerge in uncharted territory. Lusa, however, was not prepared to go through with the act, and confessed her sabotage to the geologists before their departure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kevin J.
