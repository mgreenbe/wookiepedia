He was stationed aboard the bridge of the company's CR90 corvette, the Thunderstrike, serving under Commander Paonu, who led ship operations. In 3 ABY, the Thunderstrike and its escort, the Braha'tok-class gunship Apailana's Promise, rendezvoused with an Alliance flotilla in the Elochar sector for repairs. However, some Imperial spies were able to infiltrate the corvette by posing as survivors from a damaged freighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lieutenant Sairgon attempted to contain them from the bridge by locking the Thunderstrike down, and when the spies reached the bridge, the lieutenant prompted the rest of the flotilla to flee before being killed.

After the rebel soldier Brand entered the bridge and fired at the spies, the ensign and the other surviving bridge crew wrestled their captors. The bridge crew defeated multiple infiltrators, who fired back at her, while Brand killed the others.
