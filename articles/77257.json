She originally had aspirations of becoming an architect, but she believed that she lacked the motivation to actually learn how to be one. Instead, she settled on becoming an artist who simply created paintings of buildings, a pastime she found to be satisfying. By the time following the Battle of Yavin, cerca 1 ABY, Zteht set up shop near the theater in Mos Entha, a city on the Outer Rim Territories planet of Tatooine. While there, she created two paintings, one simply titled Residential House, which depicted a small home, and another titled Blue Leaf Temple, which depicted the Temple of the Blueleaf Cluster on Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, in Tatooine's Imperial capital of Bestine, curator Lilas Dinhint oversaw the Museum of Tatooine, which served as the planet's only museum. Dinhint sought to enhance the museum's collection by offering visitors something new. To that end, the museum selected a small number of artists who would be approached for an opportunity to have their art featured in Bestine. Kolka Zteht was one of the artists to be considered, along with Vanvi Hotne, Giaal Itotr, Klepa Laeel, Kahfr Oladi, and Boulo Siesi. In order to have her paintings featured in Bestine, however, Zteht required enough votes to win over her fellow artists. Lilas Dinhint held a Bestine Museum art competition every thirty days, allowing for a period of fifteen days in between in which individuals could vote for their favorite artist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the course of her artistry career, Zteht was approached by a number of spacers, many of whom voted for her as their artist of choice. Zteht won the art competitions at various times, allowing her the opportunity to display her paintings in Bestine's museum for a period of thirty days. During the time her paintings were displayed, the corrupt curator Dinhint offered schematics of the artworks in exchange for a \"modest donation\" of 48,000 credits. This allowed the opportunity for architecturally-inclined furniture makers and traders to mass-produce copies of Zteht's paintings so that they could be purchased, collected, or displayed for personal use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kolka Zteht had blue skin, auburn hair, and purple-colored eyes. Although she was a capable artist, Zteht lacked the motivation to pursue her original goal of becoming an architect. However, she found the act of simply painting buildings to be enough of a satisfying pursuit. Zteht had a friendly demeanor, and leisurely outlook on life, at times encouraging passersby to slow down and enjoy the day, or to sit down with her and have a drink. Zteht strove to be humble, but she had never felt prouder than when her artwork was put up for display in Bestine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her time as an artist in Mos Entha, Zteht wore a blue frock with a white belt, and a pair of blue women's shoes.

She was added to the game on February 11, 2004 as part of Publish 6 The Imperial Crackdown. The update featured a new Bestine Museum event, in which players could vote for a number of NPC artists in order to have one of their paintings put up for display in the museum. Kolka Zteht was one of these artists, and players who chose to vote for her were required to first converse with her in Mos Entha. If Zteht got the most votes, one of her paintings, either Residential House or Blue Leaf Temple, would be displayed for about a one month period, and players could purchase schematics of the paintings during a two week period for a fee of 48,000 credits. The winning artist depended on the player's input, however as the competitions were held monthly, this article assumes 100% game completion, and that Kolka Zteht won the right to display both of her paintings on at least several occasions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
