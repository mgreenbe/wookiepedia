His cell was responsible for supplying other Rebel cells with materials and provisions and he continued to serve it when the Alliance reorganized itself and became the New Republic. In 6 ABY, Felean defected to the Galactic Empire during an Imperial attack on a Republic supply convoy, and the Republic believed that he had been killed. Felean gave the Imperials information about Republic supply routes, resulting in Imperial attacks on seven Republic convoys. New Republic Intelligence eventually learned of Felean's defection and they placed a bounty of 20,000 credits on him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
