The Jedi, who had exiled herself in hopes of keeping the even-more ancient Sith Lord Karness Muur prisoner, used the power of the Muur Talisman to transform the ship's crew into rakghouls, Sithspawn bound to her will via the Muur Talisman. The vessel, derelict and adrift, remained there for ten years, until it was \"rediscovered\" by Cade Skywalker and the crew of the Mynock in 137 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This was, in fact, organized by Morne, who used the Star Destroyer to pull the Mynock from hyperspace. Upon landing to investigate, Skywalker, along with Shado Vao, Jariah Syn, Deliah Blue, and Imperial Knights Antares Draco, Ganner Krieg and Azlyn Rae were confronted and separated by Morne and her rakghouls. It was from there that the Jedi and Imperials organized the luring of Darth Krayt into a trap meant to end the Sith Lord's life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
