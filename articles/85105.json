Separatist terrorist agents would plant the program into droids on Galactic Republic worlds. Once inserted, the madware would override the standard programming and cause the droids to commit deadly and destructive actions. Worlds that supported the Republic would find massive quantities of droids turning against them, causing wide-scale damage to property as well as numerous deaths."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
