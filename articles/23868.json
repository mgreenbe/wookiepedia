Members of the organization wore helmets and armor, and had a reputation for engaging in summary killings. The security force was nominally under the commander of Governor Biala. That year, the Sith impostor Darth Wredd, who had assumed the identity of the Imperial Knight Yalta Val, took control of the security force under the pretext of dealing with the Sith presence in the Carreras system. Members of the security force were involved in a manhunt for Yalta Val's missing lightsaber. Four members of the security force were killed during a confrontation with the junk dealer Ania Solo and her Mon Calamari friend Sauk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
