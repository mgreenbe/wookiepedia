When Ray, having been disillusioned, broke into the Rebellion's Sunspot Prison in order to kill all the Galactic Empire prisoners present, the droid was stationed in the prison's control room. As Princess Leia Organa of the Rebellion attempted to retake the control room alongside the smuggler Sana Starros and the prisoner Doctor Chelli Aphra, the droid ordered rebel droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to stand by the control room's door in order to block incoming blaster fire. However, R2-D2 pushed C-3PO on top of Ray's droid, and Organa entered the room to find the droid struggling to escape. Organa questioned the droid on the identity of its master, but the droid only mocked her. Ultimately, Organa managed to defeat Ray and put a stop to his assault on the prison."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
