They used blasters instead of hand-crafted weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Balawai sided with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, mainly due to the fact that at the start of the war there was a Judicial Department investigation into whether the Balawai government had been infringing upon the rights of the Korunnai. After the Battle of Haruun Kal, the Summertime Wars were ended, and the Galactic Republic negotiated a peace between the Korunnai and the Balawai."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The name Balawai was a nomenclature meaning downfolk, coined by the Korunnai and used only by the Korunnai.
