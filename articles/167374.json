The Heavy-95s were equipped with cross-body strakes that provided better heat dissipation via redistributing the heat dissipation of the strakes through a wider area; this also allowed for more weight to be carried, giving them the nickname Heavy-95. In large part due to the success of the Heavy-95s production, the Alliance also developed the T-65 Advanced X-wing starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
