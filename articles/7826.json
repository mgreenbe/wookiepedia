Although it was not Alderaan's highest mountain, its silhouette featured on the flag of the capital region. Many Alderaanian fairy tales began with a spirit flying away from its home on the mountain to choose an adventurer, and religious pilgrims claimed it was possible to commune with the Force at its summit. The climb to the mountain's summit was considered relatively easy, and hundreds made the trek every year. It was traditional for the heir to the Alderaanian throne to climb the mountain solo for their Challenge of the Body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Queen Breha Organa, during her Challenge of the Body, was severely injured in a fall while descending the mountain.
