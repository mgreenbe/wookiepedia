Around 20 BBY, Toggs was wanted dead or alive for 75,000 credits for racketeering and extortion. Together with others, his bounty was listed in the Mos Eisley Cantina on the planet Tatooine, where several bounty hunters discussed their next target. However, they deemed Toggs as uninteresting because his bounty was too low."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The image of Omar Toggs first appeared on a building on Tatooine in \"Bounty\", an episode of the fourth season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series.
