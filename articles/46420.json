He was taught by Captain Cardinal aboard the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Absolution. Cardinal noted that FB-0007 was a serious child who would have liked nothing more than to supplant FE-1211, who had always scored the highest marks in intelligence testing, but wasn't able to outfox her. On the day Cardinal was to attend a meeting on the Absolution with individuals such as Kylo Ren, General Armitage Hux and Captain Phasma, FB-0007 along with FE-1211 and FM-0676 spoke briefly with Cardinal whilst he sat in the vessel's cafeteria. FB-0007 asked if Cardinal had slept well to which he replied that he had. Before returning to his quarters, Cardinal told the group he would be checking their scores after his meeting. After being excluded from the meeting, Cardinal returned to the cafeteria where he learned that he was right about FB-0007, that the boy had done well once FE-1211 was out of the picture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
