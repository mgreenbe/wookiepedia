A member of the school's Drama Club, Oophanoe's dark robes led some, such as Victor Starspeeder, to believe that he was secretly training to become a Sith Lord. This mistaken belief was compounded by Oophanoe's carrying of a cooler containing his allergy medications, producing a cold air around him similar to the feeling of the dark side of the Force. In actuality, Oophanoe was a studious pupil and a helpful friend. He and Starspeeder became friends after Starspeeder joined the Drama Club and he saved Starspeeder from a gorax on Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
