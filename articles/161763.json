All were lost except for the warrior, Arbeloa, who despite not having contact with other sentient species, attempted to warn others of the impending invasion. After he transmitted this warning into space, he was taken prisoner. This same battle fleet then attacked Artorias in the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet remained unnamed until the release of the The Essential Guide to Warfare.
