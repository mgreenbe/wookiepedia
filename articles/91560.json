Xiono was assigned to the Colossus platform on the planet Castilon where he was given the mission of finding out who was supplying fuel to the First Order, a remnant of the \"Old Empire\". To maintain his cover, Xiono worked as a mechanic for Jarek Yeager, a former racer and veteran of the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his second mission to Doza Tower, Kaz obtained information about an agreement between Captain Imanuel Doza and the First Order's emissary Commander Pyre. Kaz and BB-8 traveled on the Fireball into space and rendezvoused with a Resistance CR90 corvette. There, Kaz and Poe attended a briefing with General Leia Organa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Based on Kaz's intelligence reports, the Resistance had been able to calculate a possible flight path into the Unknown Regions. General Organa believed that it could lead to a First Order base and tasked Poe and Kaz with investigating the coordinates. Organa also warned Poe not to engage the enemy. For the mission, Poe and Kaz were accompanied by CB-23 and BB-8. Since the Fireball lacked a stabilizer, Kaz flew a T-70 X-wing starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Exploring the station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Poe and Kaz traveled on their X-wings to the coordinates which brought them to an asteroid field. They discovered that the system was the site of a First Order dedlanite mining station called Station Theta Black. After navigating through asteroids and sensor buoys, the two managed to land their starfighters inside the station's hangar. While Poe, Kaz, and BB-8 disembarked, CB-23 flew the X-wings remotely into the asteroid field to hide under Poe's orders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three managed to travel down a turbolift into a corridor. There, BB-8 accessed a computer terminal and discovered that Station Theta Black was being prepared for demolition. The three were also attacked by a hidden First Order sentry droid. Poe managed to shoot the droid but not before it sent a distress signal back to Starkiller Base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response to the intruders, Captain Phasma and Major Elrik Vonreg decided to accompany the demolition party to Station Theta Black. Meanwhile, Poe insisted on finding out the purpose of the asteroid station despite Kaz and BB-8's misgivings. While the two explored the station, CB-23 sighted a First Order convoy consisting of an Upsilon-class command shuttle, a red TIE interceptor, and three TIE/sf space superiority fighters.

She also ordered the troopers to keep an eye out for intruders. Despite the First Order presence, Poe, Kaz, and BB-8 persisted with their mission to find the station's control room. BB-8 eventually located the control room in Level Two and discovered that Station Theta Black was a former dedlanite mining and processing station. Dedlanite was used to manufacture blasters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before they could leave the control room, the Resistance pilots and BB-8 were cornered by four stormtroopers. Following a verbal exchange, Poe goaded the stormtroopers into firefight, which caused their explosives to explode.

However, Phasma was alerted to the presence of intruders in Level Two and dispatched stormtroopers after them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While fleeing through the maze-like corridors, Poe, Kaz, and BB-8 managed to trap their pursuers behind blast doors. In the process, Kaz was separated from his comrades. Poe and BB-8 reached the hangar only to be attacked by Captain Phasma and her stormtroopers.

Poe managed to shoot down one of the pursuing TIEs but Kaz's X-wing took some damage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Major Vonreg could eliminate the two Resistance starfighters, Captain Phasma ordered him and his fellow pilots to disengage and to leave the system since she had set Station Theta Black to blow up. The First Order convoy departed the system before Station Theta Black blew up. Unable to jump into hyperspace due to the presence of asteroids, Poe and Kaz's X-wings were caught in the explosive wave unleashed by the exploding station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaz managed to survive the explosion by hiding his fighter under as an asteroid.
