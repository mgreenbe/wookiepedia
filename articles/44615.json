Because the open ground on Ensolica consisted entirely of coniferous forest and tundra, which was an entirely unworkable soil, Ensos became experts at hydroponics and constructing vast greenhouses in the ice. Because of their expertise in this field, Ensolica attracted the attention of corporations such as Alderaan Biotics and Tusus Comestibles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
