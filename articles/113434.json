When heavy weapons expert and fellow rookie CT-782 \"Hevy\" complained about the lack of combat on the moon, Echo revealed he enjoyed their station's peace, citing that it allowed him to catch up on the manuals. The comment confused Hevy, who rebutted by saying their purpose was to fight against the Separatist Droid Army.
