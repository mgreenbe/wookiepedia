In 43.5 ABY, when several Jedi Knights began to develop a mysterious psychosis, the Galactic Alliance decided to encase all of the affected Jedi in carbonite. The New Jedi Order resented this and hid as many of the psychotic Jedi as possible in the New Jedi Temple on Coruscant, but to prevent Galactic Alliance Security from discovering them there, they decided to transport these Jedi offworld. Captain Han Solo, whose task was to distract Galactic Alliance forces in orbit over Coruscant, flew in the Millennium Falcon, breaking every procedure for departing the planet. He was confronted by two Nargi-class frigates and eventually faked a proton torpedo explosion off the Millennium Falcon's stern, spiraling toward one of the frigates and declaring an out-of-control emergency. While the pursuit frigates and other orbital forces were sidetracked, Solo's wife, Leia Organa Solo, smuggled the psychotic Jedi offworld."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Notable vessels"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several Nargi-class pursuit frigates served the Galactic Alliance in orbit over Coruscant around 43 ABY.
