However, Tul'kar's warship Devourer was severely damaged upon arrival in the Tython system, and Tul'kar was slain in the chaos by his own Hound, who stole Tul'kar's personal escape pod and escaped the crash."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Rakata, Tul'kar rose to the rank of Predor within the Infinite Empire well before the year 25,793 BBY. While surveying the slaves whom the Rakata used to power their machines, Tul'kar sensed great power in the Force within a young Human boy designated Xesh, and he freed the boy from the machines in order to train him as a Force Hound\u2014Force-sensitive warriors whom the Infinite Empire used to locate Force-rich planets across the galaxy. Under Tul'kar's tutelage, Xesh became a powerful Force Hound, and during his training, Tul'kar pitted Xesh against one of his broodmates, a girl named Trill, for his amusement. Xesh emerged victorious in their fight as Tul'kar watched, and Tul'kar handed Xesh a Forcesaber\u2014a Rakatan weapon\u2014to kill the fallen Trill. However, Xesh instead proposed that Trill be given as a Force Hound to Skal'nas, Tul'kar's superior, and Tul'kar accepted the proposal in amusement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after this, a battle in the arena on the planet Byss was arranged between Xesh and Skal'nas's Force Hound Isk, and Tul'kar and Skal'nas made wagers on the outcome of the fight. Xesh ultimately emerged victorious, and Tul'kar gloated over Xesh's victory and lack of mercy as Skal'nas ordered Isk to be prepared for their table. As Tul'kar's Force Hound, Xesh led his master to Force-rich worlds such as Sriluur, home of the Weequay species, and determined the strongest of the Force-sensitives among the planets' populations.

Sensing Ore'mun's lust for his command, Tul'kar reached out with the Force and gripped Ore'mun by the throat, choking him and then electrocuting to death.

When questioned by Skal'nas, Xesh admitted that he could find the world, but his words angered Trill and Tul'kar watched as the two Force Hounds began to battle each other\u2014a battle that saw Xesh victorious and about to kill Trill before Skal'nas intervened.

Furious, Tul'kar demanded to know who was responsible, only for Xesh\u2014under the mental control of Skal'nas\u2014to stab the Predor through the chest with his Forcesaber. Leaving his dead master aboard the ship, Xesh took the escape pod while the Devourer crashed on Tython's surface.
