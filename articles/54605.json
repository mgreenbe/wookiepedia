In the final stages of the conflict, Lesl led Republic forces in the battle for Dantooine, during which she employed a bounty hunter to work on behalf of the Republic. When the war came to an end with the Treaty of Coruscant, the bounty hunter, Braden, refused to follow Commander Lesl's withdrawal orders, forcing her to order an assault on him with a concussive ordnance. Gin Lesl left Dantooine shortly thereafter and traveled to Coruscant, where she planned to meet with the Grand Master of the Jedi Order, Zym, after receiving an urgent message from him. However, the meeting turned out to be a set-up orchestrated by Braden, who killed Lesl in revenge for her actions against him on Dantooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As captain of the Republic warship Envoy, Gin ordered an orbital bombardment of the bounty hunter Braden's because he refused her order to pull out of Dantooine under the terms of the Treaty of Coruscant which made an unequal peace between the Republic and the Sith Empire. While she obeyed orders from Coruscant to withdraw from Dantooine, her troops refused to stand down their operations and continue engaging Sith forces on the planet. After Braden escaped from Sith captivity, he made his way to the galactic capital Coruscant with the intentions of informing the Jedi and Republic authorities of the true nature of Jedi Master Dar'Nala's murder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, he also intended to seek revenge against both the Sith-aligned Wookiee bounty hunter Dalborra and Lesl for betraying him into the hands of the Sith. He dispatched a message to both the Jedi Master Zym and Gin Lesl, telling each other to meet at the ruins of the Jedi Temple with an important message. When they arrived, Lesl was baffled when the Kel Dor Jedi told her that he had received her message."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were then interrupted by the arrival of Braden who informed them that he had the important message. He asked her if she remembered who he was and if she remembered that she had wounded him on Dantooine. Lesl responded that Braden was the bounty hunter she had made the mistake of hiring on Dantooine. Still mystified, she asked why he had followed her all the way to Coruscant. Braden replied that she should have used something stronger than concussion ordnance before shooting her dead with his blaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Facing Zym, he told him that he had a message from one of his former colleagues\u2014the Togruta Master Dar'nala. However, Zym responded by telling Braden he was only willing to converse with him if he put down his weapon and submitted to Jedi custody. Braden killed Zym in self defense, and the Grand Master's opportunity of finding out that an unknown Sith Lord had ordered the attack on the Envoy had been wasted. Meanwhile, a bomb planted by Sith agents damaged a significant part of the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
