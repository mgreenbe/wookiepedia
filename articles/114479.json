They were used to scoop up food from the seas, separate it, preserve it, and package it for sale. Repulsorlift harvesters were used on planets such as Ando and Kaal. Ubrikkian Industries manufactured the HV6 Harvester Factory, and one such unit, the Bountiful, operated on Ando during the Galactic Civil War. During the reign of the New Republic, Tirgee Benyalle operated a number of repulsorlift harvesters, including the Sea Sprite."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
