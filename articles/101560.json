After being relieved of her active duty within Phoenix Squadron, Cadet Kay Karno traveled to Orra with the intent of becoming a bounty hunter. Once he was informed that Karno had stolen a ship and had potentially put the fleet at risk, Fenn Rau went to Orra to reconcile with Karno and bring her back to the fleet. Rau, however, was stunned and captured by bounty hunters who recognized that Rau had a bounty of 30,000 credits on his head and set off to an Imperial outpost to collect the bounty.
