During the Master's final days, he traveled to the planet Vaklin, where he died without telling any of the local population his name. The locals commemorated the Jedi by building a statue of him in a public square in the city of Vaklin Zenith. In the year 19 BBY, following the rise of the Galactic Empire and the dissolution of the Jedi Order, an insurgency against the Empire took place on Vaklin, and the memorial was destroyed. It was destroyed by the Empire in an attempt at wiping out all memory of the Order's existence on Vaklin, which they hoped would reduce the populations support for the Jedi-led insurgency.
