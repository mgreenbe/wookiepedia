Due to the amount of raids and their devastation, the Republic counterattacked Separatist forces on Boz Pity, which resulted in a siege that became one of the most intense of the war, drawing in major leaders and fighters from both sides. After the Siege of Saleucami, Jedi General Quinlan Vos moved his forces to Boz Pity, where they emerged victorious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
