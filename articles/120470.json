Believing that change was Mandalore's only hope for a future, she longed to move Mandalore and its people past its violent warrior history. Her goals mired her in controversy throughout her leadership, and she faced opposition from conservative Mandalorian groups who rejected her peaceful ideology. As the Republic's stability became threatened by the pan-galactic Clone Wars, Kryze attempted in vain to keep Mandalore out of the conflict. One of the primary and most vocal opponents of the war, Kryze fought against the rising militarism and nationalism in the Republic that threatened her people. The burden of peace cost Kryze nearly everything as the war continued, and she ultimately fell victim to the forces that conspired to take her down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A major proponent of the New Mandalorian movement in her youth, Kryze became the leader of Mandalore following the Mandalorian Civil War between the pacifist New Mandalorians and the Mandalorian warriors of tradition. The war cost an immense loss of life, and Kryze led Mandalore through reconstruction, helping the planet rebuild into a peaceful society. Her actions continued to face opposition from insurgent groups, most actively the terrorist group Death Watch, among whose members was Kryze's estranged sister Bo-Katan. While Mandalore maintained its peace and prospered under Kryze, the Republic began to fracture and entered war with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Kryze chose not to choose a side in the conflict, making sure that Mandalore was neutral and becoming the leader of the Council of Neutral Systems. This move earned Kryze criticism from both the Republic and Confederacy, both of whom considered Mandalore to be a crucial asset to their war efforts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Clone Wars tested Kryze's leadership to its limit, with her planet facing supply shortages and an increase in terrorist activity by Death Watch. The threat of Death Watch led the Republic to consider occupying Mandalore, but Kryze knew that the Republic had, in reality, wanted access to the system and that an occupation would only bring the war with it. Despite political setbacks, assassination attempts, and even an arrest warrant being levied against her, Kryze managed to appeal to the Republic Senate and halt the occupation before it could begin. Kryze's efforts also brought about the end of the Death Watch threat for a time. Mandalore continued to face issues as the war continued, with the growing presence of a black market on the planet and corruption among Kryze's fellow leaders. Kryze's defense of neutrality alienated her from the Republic and, although not many, she managed to find allies to help her deal with the crises, including her close friend, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, with whom she had a complicated past."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the war raged on, Death Watch became affiliated with the rogue Sith Lord Maul, who brought together several crime families to aid them in defeating Kryze once and for all. Known as the Shadow Collective, Maul led Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla and their militia to Mandalore's capital, tearing through the city and causing chaos. Kryze was deposed and arrested, though infighting among Death Watch brought about the death of Vizsla by Maul's hand as well as the defection of Bo-Katan. Bo-Katan freed Kryze from prison, and the two reconciled in order to find a way to rid Mandalore of Maul. The rescue was short-lived, though before her recapture Kryze was able to contact Kenobi on Coruscant. Maul, having a lust for revenge against Kenobi for an incident from years earlier, murdered the captive Kryze in front of the Jedi. Kryze died in Kenobi's arms, proclaiming her love for her friend as her government lay in ruin and Mandalore's era of peace and pacifism ended."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Satine Kryze was a Mandalorian female human born to Duke Adonai Kryze on the Outer Rim world of Kalevala, into Clan Kryze under House Kryze. Satine was the sister of Bo-Katan, and the two shared a nephew named Korkie, with whom Satine was very close. Kryze spent her childhood living on Mandalore, the homeworld of the Mandalorian people. Mandalore was a planet with a long and violent history of warring factions both internal and external, and by Kryze's time there was a rising group known as the New Mandalorians birthed in the Mandalore city of Sundari who sought to channel the best aspects of Mandalorian society to rebuild their culture into a nonviolent and peaceful one. Kryze was a major proponent of the New Mandalorians and eventually became the de facto leader of the movement. Kryze's ideology was in stark opposition to more conservative-minded individuals on Mandalore who sought to preserve the old ways and continue the Mandalorian custom of waging war for the glory of their world. The New Mandalorians realized that this expertise in warfare was of no lasting benefit to the majority of Mandalorians and gradually began to grow in strength in order to eventually challenge the minority of  traditional warriors. These traditionalists used violence to hold on to power as Kryze, recognized by her title of nobility as Duchess, spearheaded the growing movement. Kryze's goals and aspirations estranged her from Bo-Katan, who believed in embracing Mandalore's martial past."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mandalorian Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 42 BBY, as the New Mandalorians increased in strength and became a major political and ideological force on Mandalore, a civil war broke out between the reformist movement and the traditional Mandalorian warriors for control of the planet. The war decimated the already-damaged surface of Mandalore, and the capital city of Keldabe was devastated. Among the many casualties of the war was Satine's father. The conflict grew so large that it eventually required the intervention of the Jedi Order. The Jedi Council sent Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Mandalore to protect the young duchess from her enemies. The insurgents sent bounty hunters after Satine to eliminate her, forcing the two Jedi to remove the duchess from Mandalore for her own protection. They remained on the run with no certainties about what the next day would bring for nearly a year. At some point, they were attacked by a swarm of venom-mites on Draboon, and Obi-Wan carried Satine to safety. Unfortunately, the chivalric act was tarnished somewhat as the Padawan accidentally fell and dropped her unceremoniously, leaving her with a permanent scar from the fall. During this time, Satine and Obi-Wan began to fall in love and develop feelings for one another."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the New Mandalorians managed to defeat the martial traditionalists, and Satine was allowed to return to Mandalore. The death toll wrought by the war was immense, and the young duchess was left with the difficult task of rebuilding her world. Obi-Wan's commitment to the Order ended their relationship, and he left to continue his Jedi training despite his feelings for her. Both were left heartbroken by their separation, and Kenobi later admitted that, had Satine asked him to stay, he would have left the Jedi Order for her. Kenobi's master Jinn later brought up his relationship with Satine in the months prior to the Invasion of Naboo, while the two were reading over taxation bills submitted to the Galactic Senate as Jinn was suspicious that something was going on with them."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Reconstruction and the Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Kenobi and Jinn left Mandalore, Satine began work on the challenging task of rebuilding following the damages caused by the war. The considerable number of deaths had left Satine with a fierce hatred of violence, and she became a staunch pacifist. The surviving traditionalists were exiled to the Mandalorian moon of Concordia, where infighting for dominance led many to believe that they had died out. Sundari became the new capital  of Mandalore and a memorial to those who died during the war was established at Peace Park. Kryze reformed the government of Mandalore into a cabinet of ministers known as the Ruling Council, who were each charged with governing different aspects of the planet. Although Kryze oversaw the workings of the ministry, the body itself was chaired by a Prime Minister. By the time of the Clone Wars, the position was occupied by Almec. While Mandalore was under the direct jurisdiction of the Ruling Council, the other planets and moons of the Mandalore Sector became provinces and were led by various acting governors. Kryze outlawed many ancient Mandalorian weaponry and practices, such as the use of mobile vaults as a form of imprisonment. One of few martial practices to see continued use under the New Mandalorians was the tradition of the Protectors, a group of elite warriors who were charged with the protection of the Mandalorian ruler. As such, they formed the personal guard of Duchess Satine. Under her rule, Mandalore prospered and turned into a modern and peaceful society. However, Satine's reforms were actively opposed by a group of conservatives known as the Death Watch, which formed from the last remaining insurgents of the civil war. Despite their banishment and infighting, remnants of the traditionalists secretly rebuilt their strength to overthrow the duchess and reclaim Mandalore. The Death Watch considered Kryze and her pacifist ideals unworthy to rule Mandalore, especially in the wake of her father's death. They used fear tactics to recruit individuals from throughout the Mandalore Sector to their cause. Death Watch's attacks on Satine's government has limited success in swaying public opinion however, and throughout much of her reign the duchess and her ideals were popular among the people of Mandalore. Aware of the Death Watch's activities, Satine assigned several officials she trusted, such as Prime Minister Almec and Concordia Governor Pre Vizsla, to investigate and root out the movement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under Duchess Satine's rule, Mandalore continued to prosper despite the Galactic Republic's increasingly fragile state. Several members of the Republic absconded from the government and joined the nascent Confederacy of Independent Systems, prompting a militarized response from the Republic that led to the outbreak of full-scale war with the Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY. Early into the war, trade and supply routes became a point of contention and Kryze introduced rationing policies to her world. Despite being officially a member of the Republic, Kryze was adamant in keeping Mandalore out of the conflict and declared neutrality for her planet and her people. With the support of her people, Kryze became the head of the Council of Neutral Systems, a group of 1,500 star systems that wished to stay neutral. As the designated regent of the organization, Satine was a leading advocate for their position of neutrality as well as the primary representative in negotiations with the Republic Senate. Her choice to declare neutrality drew the ire of both the Republic and the Confederacy. Many in the Republic saw the Mandalore Sector as a key component in the war effort given its location between the Republic capital Coruscant and the Outer Rim along the Hydian Way. Both the New Mandalorians under Kryze and the Death Watch opposed a Republic presence on Mandalore, and as Death Watch began targeting Republic forces, rumors started circulating that Satine was building an army for the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Maintaining neutrality"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Duchess and the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rumors of Kryze building an army for the Confederacy emboldened following a terrorist attack on a Republic cruiser. The terrorist in question was seen by holographic feed wearing Mandalorian armor. The Jedi High Council was concerned about the incident and sent Obi-Wan Kenobi, now a Jedi Master, to meet the duchess and investigate the situation. Kenobi arrived at the Royal Palace, where he was greeted by Prime Minister Almec. Almec explained to Kenobi that Mandalore's warrior past was behind them, emphasizing that Kryze valued peace more than her own life. Satine entered the throne room and quipped about how Kenobi was once again on Mandalore to help her. Kenobi complimented her beauty, but Kryze rebutted his kind words and called him out for accusing her of treachery. Kenobi told Kryze that he wouldn't personally believe she could commit wrongdoing and showed her the hologram of the Mandalorian terrorist. Kryze, Almec, and Kalevala Senator Tal Merrik, one of Satine's oldest friends, again asserted that there were no Mandalorians in their government who would commit such an atrocity. When asked what happened to the perpetrator, Kenobi informed them that he had committed suicide to avoid arrest. Kryze expressed her belief that Kenobi's mission had been authorized by the Senate to intervene in Mandalore's affairs, but was corrected by the Jedi Master that the Jedi Council had sent him. Kryze invited Kenobi to join her on a stroll around the city, which he accepted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kryze and Kenobi traveled to Peace Park, where Kryze told the Jedi that she was glad to see him again. Kenobi complimented her leadership of Mandalore, telling the duchess that her pacifism had paid off in the long run. Kryze told Kenobi that despite Mandalore's peaceful efforts, there were groups who continued to oppose her rule, specifically Death Watch. Kryze believed that they might be who Kenobi was looking for. She assured Kenobi that she had officials working to root out the criminals in an ongoing investigation, but refuted him when he asked how widespread the Death Watch movement was. Satine told Obi-Wan that Death Watch was just a group of vandalists, adding that her investigations had tracked them to the Mandalorian moon Concordia. Kryze and Kenobi's conversation gradually shifted to one about ideology. Kenobi stated that the job of a peacekeeper was to be on the front lines of conflict to solve the issue first hand. Satine disagreed, instead suggesting that the work of a peacekeeper was to ensure that conflict didn't have the chance to arise. Kenobi commented that her belief was noble, but not entirely realistic. Satine took aim at the Jedi Order's insincere justifications for promoting violence in the name of peace, suggesting that the \"reality\" Kenobi believed in was what made the Jedi abandon their ideals in the name of political convenience."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Kryze and Kenobi approached the Civil War memorial, the shrine exploded. The blast knocked down several civilian bystanders and destroyed part of the shrine. Kenobi asked Kryze if she was alright, but she brushed off her safety and ran to aid the injured. Kenobi followed her and told her that a group of vandalists was incapable of arranging an attack of that scale. Kryze suggested that it must have been an offworlder, but a hologram marker at the scene of the explosion showing the sign of Death Watch proved her wrong. Kenobi decided to take charge, ordering the Protectors to take Satine back to the palace and that all civilians present be kept at the scene for interviewing. As Kenobi helped Satine to her guard, one bystander broke from the crowd and began running. Kenobi chased after the fleeing man, and Satine followed him. Obi-Wan cornered the man on a balcony in the park. Once Kryze arrived, the man yelled in Concordian and jumped from the ledge and onto the glass below. Kryze ran to the balcony edge and looked over, wincing at the sight of the man writhing on the cracked floor. Accompanied by Obi-Wan, Satine descended to the level below, where she approached the dying man and held his hand.

Kenobi's plan was for him to accompany the body as it was sent to the moon, but Kryze pointed out that Concordia was a province and that she would have to accompany him to set up a meeting with Governor Vizsla. The two set up a transport and left Sundari for Concordia. En route to the moon, Kenobi questioned whether or not it was an agricultural world, as he believed it to be. Kryze explained to him that before the Civil War, the moon had been converted to a mining-based economy at the cost of the native forests, which had recently begun growing back as the mining facilities were shut down. Once their ship landed on the planet, they were met by Governor Vizsla. Kryze introduced Kenobi to the Governor, who Kryze also identified as one of the leading officials in the investigation of Death Watch. With the body of the terrorist unloaded, Vizsla left to tend to the body. Kryze was stopped from following him by Kenobi, who asked that the duchess keep Vizsla occupied during their scheduled dinner. Kryze asked where he planned on going, and he replied that he was interested in looking at the mining facilities in private.

Kryze lied to Vizsla that Kenobi would join them later on because he needed to meditate. As they had drinks before dinner, Kryze questioned what purpose the Republic or Confederacy had for spreading rumors that she was amassing an army. Vizsla simply replied that it was Death Watch, but Kryze believed that an external force was behind Death Watch's recent campaigns. Vizsla believed that it would have to be a leader of the Confederacy and told her that as the leader of the Council of Neutral Systems, she was a major hindrance to the Separatists' plans. Meanwhile, Kenobi had located one of the defunct mines and found it to be completely operational and developing weapons and armor similar to that of the terrorist who attacked the Republic Cruiser. As he searched the mine he was attacked by a member of Death Watch and taken hostage. As he was held in suspension on a production line, he contacted Kryze through her earpiece. Kryze responded to him in conjunction with Vizsla to keep herself inconspicuous. Kenobi instructed her to follow the tracking beacon on his comlink. Vizsla noticed something was off, but Satine managed to leave the room by suggesting that fresh air would do her good. Once out of the room, Kryze ran to the hangar and took a bike.

She asked him where he was, and he sarcastically responded that she had to listen to the loud machinery of the production line to find him. Kryze took out her earpiece and left it on a control box, which she activated to set off a disturbance alarm. The duchess snuck into the room Kenobi was being held in as the Death Watch guards left to find out what had tripped the alarm. Kryze found Kenobi on the production line, about to be crushed by the machinery. The two sarcastically argued as Satine deactivated it before he could be crushed. The two Death Watch members returned and grabbed Kryze. Kenobi, still suspended on the moving production line, called out to Kryze as he was about to be dropped into a grinder. Satine kicked a barrel onto the grinder to jam it, and Kenobi jumped from the production line and knocked out the two Death Watch soldiers. Kryze and Kenobi continued their banter as they boarded an elevator. Kryze noted Kenobi's eagerness to fight, to which he mentioned her seeming lack of concern for the fact that he could have been killed. Kryze pointed out that he wasn't killed, adding that he still hadn't thanked her. When the elevator stopped, the doors opened to reveal a Death Watch warrior standing guard.

The two hid behind a large boulder near the elevator. Kenobi quipped that the two would have to stand and fight, adding that in Satine's case, just stand. Since the two soldiers in the mine had taken his lightsaber, he used a blaster from the guard he knocked out to fire at a trio of warriors flying towards the boulder, making quick work of them. He was tackled by another member of Death Watch, who Satine distracted by throwing a stone at him. The soldier fired at Kryze, who dodged the blasts and jumped behind the boulder. Kenobi took out the warrior and rushed to see if Kryze was alright. A group of Death Watch, led by their leader, advanced towards the boulder. The leader, who was in possession of Kenobi's lightsaber, removed his helmet, revealing that he was, in reality, Vizsla. Vizsla tossed Kenobi his lightsaber and told the Jedi that Kryze had tarnished the name Mandalorian and gave him the chance to defend her. Vizsla unveiled the Darksaber, and ancient Mandalorian weapon, and engaged in a duel with Kenobi. Kenobi managed to beat Vizsla, who ordered his soldiers to kill the Jedi. Three Death Watch warriors fired missiles at Kenobi, who dodged them with ease. The missiles turned to retarget Kenobi, who grabbed Satine and jumped down the elevator shaft before they could be hit. The two hit the ground as the missiles made impact and quickly made their escape from the mine, where Kryze and Kenobi made light banter once more. Kryze told Kenobi that they were on even terms, seeing as how they had each saved the other's life, but Kenobi jokingly replied that his rescue of her had been the more daring.

With his role in Death Watch now known, Vizsla escaped surveillance and disappeared. Vizsla's disappearance interrupted the investigations into the scope of Death Watch and their operations, but their alleged affiliation with the Confederacy led many in the Republic, including Kenobi, to believe that Mandalore would have to openly side with the Republic to stop them.

She invited several senators to accompany her on her aircraft, including two members of the Council of Neutral Systems, Senator Onaconda Farr of Rodia and Senator Kin Robb, as well as Senator Merrik. The other dignitary, Senator Orn Free Taa of Ryloth, was not a member of the neutral faction. In addition to Kryze's personal guard and the crew of the Coronet, a small detachment of clone troopers led by Obi-Wan and his former Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, rounded out the security forces on the voyage. Kryze did not want the Jedi and their soldiers on the ship, but they were stationed onboard at the behest of her guests. Kryze spoke with her retinue about her reasons for remaining neutral, citing her opinion that war in and of itself was an affront to life. Kenobi's support of occupation had made Kryze bitter with him, and the two became aggressive and argumentative about their opinions following the Coronet's departure. Kryze opined heavily that the Jedi were no longer peacekeepers, which Kenobi argued against in response. The duchess saw Kenobi's reasoning for the Jedi's involvement in the war to be contradictory and hyperbolic, whereas Kenobi saw Kryze as a dreamer who only listened to those who agreed with her. Despite Skywalker and Senator Taa's efforts to settle the arguing, the two remained at aggressive odds. As the arguing became a standoff, Senator Merrik suggested that they put aside politics and went to dinner. Both Kryze and Kenobi gave in, and Kryze pushed Kenobi out of her way as she left the room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, in the cargo bay, two clone troopers went missing. The search team found a large shipping container knocked over and open with the contents missing. Kenobi reported to the dining room, where he asked Kryze and the accompanying senators to stay where they were until the situation was solved. While Satine and her guests stayed tensely seated at the dining table, Anakin contacted Kenobi and told him that he and the clones had located assassin probes in the cargo bay, and that one of the droids was heading up the lifts to the dining room. Obi-Wan ordered Kryze and the senators to stand back from the lift. The droid violently entered the room and killed two of Satine's guards before Kenobi managed to disable it. The brief moment of peace was broken quickly when smaller probe killers were ejected from the larger droid and started crawling towards towards the duchess and her retinue. While Obi-Wan did what he could to keep the droids away from the senators, Kryze took out a small but powerful deactivator pistol and fired at the probes. Kryze and Kenobi stood back-to-back as they took out the droids, easily shifting position in conjunction with each other. Kenobi questioned why Kryze was carrying a deactivator. Kryze defended herself by saying that, despite being a pacifist, she was still willing and able to defend herself. Kenobi joked that her contradiction made her sound like a Jedi. Once the droids were all destroyed, Kenobi reminisced about the swarm of venom-mites he and Kryze had encountered on Draboon during the Civil War. Kryze joked that she remembered the incident and still had the scar from when he had dropped her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker soon found from the cargo manifest that the container that held the assassin probes had been authorized to board the Coronet under the stamp of the Senate. Using this information, he and Kenobi deduced that one of the senators had ordered the crate onto the ship. Kryze and the senators, meanwhile, had reconvened for dinner. Senator Taa noticed that Kryze was not eating, and she explained that she had lost her appetite. Kenobi soon arrived carried a dish that Taa believed to be dessert, but Kenobi revealed that he was carrying one of the small probe killers. Kenobi explained that he believed the droid would attack the duchess and everyone besides the senator who had the droids brought onboard the ship. Kryze objected to Obi-Wan's use of interrogation, but he assured her that the situation was under control. Kenobi walked around the table, where the droid displayed hostility towards Senator Farr, Senator Robb, and Kryze, but did not react to Senator Merrik. Merrik knocked the tray out of Kenobi's hand, freeing the probe. The droid scurried towards Kryze, but Kenobi used a plate to bat it away. The droid attacked Senator Farr, who panicked as Kenobi sliced it in two using his lightsaber. Using the disarray to his advantage, Merrik grabbed hold of Kryze and put a blaster to her head, then left the room with her as a hostage. Merrik brought Kryze to the bridge, where he mercilessly killed the crew. The traitorous prince took the ship out of hyperspace and contacted a Death Watch soldier. Merrik told the soldier that he had succeeded in kidnapping Satine, but that he would need help making his escape. The soldier in turn told Merrik that reinforcements were on their way. Three Confederate boarding ships entered the space around the Coronet.

Still holding Kryze hostage, Merrik explained that he had wired the ship's engines to explode. Kryze pleaded with Obi-Wan not to try to free her when everyone on the ship's lives were at stake. Merrik left the room with the duchess, closely followed by Kenobi. Once they arrived at the Separatist boarding ships, Merrik sardonically told Kryze to say goodbye to Kenobi. Kryze, believing that it would be the last time she would ever see Obi-Wan, told the Jedi that she loved him and had loved him since their time during the Civil War. Though he didn't think it was the right time or place, Obi-Wan confessed that had she asked him to, he would have left the Jedi Order. Merrik was annoyed by the display, but as he started to leave Kryze dug her heel into his foot and freed herself from his grip, taking his blaster in the process. Merrik simply mused that even if he didn't take Satine to the Separatists, he still had the engines wired. Merrik also took note of the fact that if either Kryze or Kenobi killed him, they would prove that they were a hypocrite and a murderer respectively. Confident in his victory, Merrik dared either one of them to strike him down and prove themselves a cold-blooded killer. Before he could push the button to destroy the ship, Merrik was killed by Skywalker. Kryze threw the blaster aside and approached Obi-Wan, but before she could speak CC-2224 and the other clone forces arrived to inform the Jedi that the droids had been defeated.

Kenobi brushed their opinions aside and told Satine that the needs of her people were what was most important, adding that they were in capable hands. Satine told Obi-Wan that his words were kind and came from a thoughtful and committed Jedi. Their arguing and confrontational attitudes gone, Kryze jokingly told Obi-Wan that she still wasn't sure about his beard.

Vizsla planned to strike once Republic forces arrived, becoming liberators in the eyes of the people. Meanwhile, in the Republic Senate, Kryze made her appeal to the Senate against a Republic invasion. Kryze's primary ally in her case was Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo, who was opposed to the resolution as well. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine pushed for an occupation, using the bombing at Peace Park and Merrik's treason on the Coronet as the basis for his claims that Death Watch was a significant threat to the New Mandalorian government. Kryze explained to the Chancellor that Death Watch was not strong enough to destabilize her government and that her forces were close to finding the leaders of the terrorist organization. Kryze reasserted her position of neutrality, knowing that occupation would only lead to more violence. Vice Chair Mas Amedda denounced her speech to be the talk of an idealist, but Kryze stated that her words, and by proxy the words of her people, came from a place of pacifism and non-violence. The Chancellor informed Kryze that his office had received a message that morning, adding that she would find it illuminating. Amedda played a testimony from Kryze's friend and Mandalore's Deputy Minister, Jerec, arguing that a Republic occupation was needed to stop Death Watch. Kryze watched the testimony in shock, then ordered that the feed be stopped. Kryze told the Chancellor and Vice Chair that Jerec would not have said those things. The Chancellor continued the testimony, during which Jerec stated that Kryze's government was weak and that she acted out of pride. Kryze was quick to denounce his words and demanded to speak to Jerec, but the Chancellor informed Satine that Jerec had been killed in a Death Watch bombing on Kalevala. Palpatine used Jerec's death as a rallying point for the occupation to the distress and opposition of Kryze.

Satine was confused by what he meant, and the Jedi explained that a person in her position would be hysterical, which infuriated the duchess. Kryze yelled at Obi-Wan, telling him that the Republic was attempting to impede on innocent people and that if more people were hysterical then they would be willing to speak up against the Republic as it trampled their rights. Kenobi softly told Kryze that her actions were foolhardy, again insulting the Mandalorian. Satine told Kenobi that his words were ironic, considering that he was one who rushed into battle without consideration as if on a crusade, pointedly telling him that he was, in her opinion, foolhardy. Upset and saddened by their encounter, Kryze boarded her airspeeder and departed. As Kryze's speeder left the Senate building, the navigation system failed and the transport lost control. The speeder had been wired by a Death Watch assassin sent to Coruscant to kill Satine. With the speeder accelerating and beginning to emit smoke, Kryze asked the pilot, Aramis, what was happening. Aramis ordered the Protectors on board to get Kryze off the speeder, then attempted to fly the craft closer to a platform ahead. Satine protested in fear of her friend's life, but the Protectors grabbed the Duchess and formed a protective circle around her.

Kryze argued that it couldn't have been an accident due to how it happened so shortly after her defense of neutrality. Amedda agreed with Kryze, though to her horror he twisted her words and made the case that Death Watch was out of control and that the Republic had to intervene immediately. Kryze protested the Vice Chair's misuse of her words but the Chancellor rendered her position useless, given that the resolution was no longer up for debate and was in the hands of the Senate. Kryze left Palpatine's office to head to the Ministry of Defense, where she planned on speaking to a contact of hers who had information that would stop the occupation from happening. Outside the Chancellor's office, she was immediately greeted by Obi-Wan, who had heard about her accident. Kryze expressed her disgust with the Chancellor and Vice Chair, but found no words to describe them. Kenobi persisted in asking if she was well, and she explained to him that she wasn't hurt in the accident, though added that she hadn't told him to keep him from worrying. Kenobi laughed and joked that she had failed to stop him. Both Satine and Obi-Wan agreed that the attack proved that Satine had enemies on Coruscant as well. Obi-Wan intuited Satine's intent to follow up on the accident herself, but she didn't waver to his protests and told him that Republic authorities were not reliable. Obi-Wan tried changing her mind about being so self-reliant, telling her that she didn't need to be alone. As Kryze tried to explain her feelings, Senator Amidala approached the two. Amidala told Kryze and Kenobi that the Senate had completed its vote on the resolution, and had decided in favor of occupation. Kryze was confused and asked when the vote, which was meant to happen the following day, took place. Amidala told the duchess that, after the attempt on her life, the Senate had accelerated the vote and decided its outcome during Kryze's meeting with the Chancellor. Kryze, extremely upset at the sudden revelation, despondently told Obi-Wan that she was right not to trust the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knowing that getting the information from her contact in the Ministry of Defense, Davu Golec, was the only way to halt the occupation, Kryze went undercover on the streets of Coruscant to meet him. In a back alleyway of Sector GL5, Golec found Kryze and gave her a tape he had found buried deep in the Evidence Facility of the Ministry. The tape was the original testimony from Jerec, which Golec explained had been tampered with and altered before its presentation to the Senate. Golec was fatally shot by the Death Watch assassin after handing Kryze the disc. Kryze took out her deactivator and looked around for the killer, but before she could find him she was surrounded by civilians and a police droid. The onlookers mistook her as Golec's murderer, and the droid reported the shooting and identified Kryze as the killer. Several police units arrived at the scene, but the terrified duchess ran before she could be arrested. Satine was pursued by both the police units and the assassin, who made attempts to shoot Satine as she ran. Using her deactivator, Kryze disabled the police droid, which fell and tripped the police following it as Kryze disappeared into a large crowd. Kryze ran into an alley, where she spotted a man getting into his speeder. Kryze used the departing man as a distraction; the police units saw Kryze enter the alleyway, then saw the speeder depart. Kryze managed to evade notice, and once she was in the clear she contacted Obi-Wan.

Kryze suggested that Obi-Wan bring it to Senator Amidala, knowing that she was someone they could trust. Two clone police units started walking towards Kryze and Kenobi's position, so the two got up and reentered the city's alleyways. Kenobi asked Satine what she planned to do while he was in the Senate, and she explained that she would turn herself in. Obi-Wan was anxious about the idea, but Satine reasoned that he would need a distraction to enter the Senate building and not be searched on account of their association. Obi-Wan countered that since he was a Jedi he wouldn't be searched. Kryze replied that times were changing. As they continued walking, the Death Watch assassin threw a detonator at the pair. Kenobi used the Force to push Satine out of the blast radius and he fell to the ground as the blast knocked him over. The assassin walked towards Satine, who ran out into the street as Obi-Wan ignited his lightsaber and engaged the soldier. The assassin knocked Kenobi's lightsaber out of his hand, and they two brawled into the street. Satine picked up Obi-Wan's lightsaber and tossed the weapon to him.

The undoctored testimony from Jerec proved to the Senate that the New Mandalorians did not need intervention from the Republic and restored faith in Satine's ability to lead. With the new information now in the hands of the Senate, an emergency session was called to revote on the resolution. The Senate rescinded its earlier approval of the occupation and Mandalore was allowed to remain a neutral state. The news that the occupation was no longer underway soon found its way to Vizsla and Death Watch, whose plans fell through and were no longer supported by the Confederacy. Freed from custody, Kryze met with Amidala, Kenobi, Skywalker, and the Chancellor and Vice Chair later at an informal meeting in the Chancellor's office. Palpatine and Amedda offered Kryze an apology on behalf of the Republic, but Kryze did not accept their apology wholeheartedly. As the others left the office to finish ratifying the Senate's decision, Kryze and Kenobi stayed behind to talk. Satine thanked Obi-Wan for all he had done, saying that his actions were what made things right, but the Jedi disagreed and told the duchess that it was her unshakeable faith and determination that stopped the occupation.

Satine effectively became an outsider to the Republic at large and was given no aid as trade routes became disrupted by the war and Mandalore faced supply shortages. Kryze knew that smuggling had become an issue on the planet, and asked Senator Amidala to visit Mandalore to help in finding a way to alleviate some of the issues. Amidala's visit was excitedly awaited by the people of Sundari, who gathered outside the dockyard to cheer on the senator's arrival. Kryze wanted to welcome Amidala in private and met the senator as she departed her ship. The two began discussing the crisis. Kryze recognized that the Senate was reluctant to aid Mandalore, but was reassured by Amidala that there were still members of the senate sympathetic to Mandalore and willing to help. As the two entered a speeder, Kryze asked that they put aside political discussion, as she wanted to surprise Amidala with the crowds gathered just inside the city. The crowds cheered on Kryze and Amidala, who made their way to the Royal Palace. Once at the palace, Kryze and Amidala began their formal business. The Ruling Council argued amongst themselves, unable to find a way to deal with the surge of black market dealings. Amidala noted to Kryze that Prime Minister Almec seemed overwhelmed, and Satine invited the senator to enter the discussion. The senator advised that they reject any illegal business dealings and trust in the Republic, but was quickly called a hypocrite, given that the Republic had their own issues with rising underworld operations. Satine was angered and embarrassed by the council's behavior and adjourned the meeting to let the tensions dissipate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kryze and Amidala later attended a private dinner in the palace.

She also admitted that she wished she and her homeworld, Naboo, had taken up the opportunity to become a neutral state as Kryze had with Mandalore. Satine took the moment to mention her own problems with the Republic, and though Amidala agreed with her she believed that there was still hope of solving those issues. Kryze told the senator that she arranged a visit to a new hospital that had opened, where she believed that the two would be able to see true good at work. The following day, Kryze and Amidala arrived at the hospital only to find it at full capacity with a large portion of the student populace. Kryze was disturbed by the sight and demanded to know what had happened. She was informed that children across the planet had been poisoned, though the doctors had no idea what had caused the outbreak. As Amidala discussed the sudden crisis with Doctor Zak Zaz, Kryze solemnly comforted one of the ill students. Kryze and Amidala met with Almec soon after, who guessed that Death Watch was behind the outbreak. Satine disputed this claim, reasoning that Death Watch had only targeted her and her administration, not children. Almec left to speak to the Ruling Council, and Kryze and Amidala became concerned about his lack of care for the sick children, many of whom had died from the poisoning.

One of these drinks was tested shortly after by Zaz, and was found to contain high levels of slabin, which had become lethal from the mixture with the tea. Knowing where the outbreak had come from, Amidala and Kryze traveled to the dockyard to read the school's import log to find the origin of the tea. Once at the docks, however, they discovered that the import log had been erased. The school's superintendent, who had come along, hastily walked towards a speeder and ignored Kryze's order to stop, but was arrested by two of Satine's guards. Kryze uncharacteristically threatened the schoolmaster with violence and demanded he tell her what he knew. The superintendent told her that he had welcomed the tea as a way to cut costs and make a profit for himself, but was unaware the drinks were poisoned. He told the duchess that he had only met with an importer named Siddiq on his end of the bargain. Once Satine and Amidala located Siddiq, who worked for a shipping company elsewhere in the city, he admitted his role in the black market ring and willingly gave up what he knew, believing that he was free of consequence by his corporate contracts.

The three witnessed a customs official receive credits from the Moogans, who unloaded several crates of tea from their ship. Despite their evidence, Kryze could not convince Captain of the Mandalorian Guard Patrok Ru-Saxon of the illegal activity. Kryze accused Ru-Saxon of stalling their investigation, and she, Amidala, and the captain traveled to the docks once again, where they found two guards stationed at a warehouse. The two guards refused to comply with either Kryze or Ru-Saxon's orders and were quickly arrested. Ru-Saxon opened the door to the warehouse, where Kryze saw several Moogans and Mandalorians brewing the imported tea. The Moogans and their workers opened fire on Satine and her escort, and a firefight ensued. Ru-Saxon was shot during the fight, and Amidala had two of Kryze's guards push a storage container in front of the warehouse door. Amidala picked up a blaster and, with the two guards pushing the container into the warehouse, closed in on the smugglers, who were captured in quick succession. With the smuggling operation shut down, Satine ordered the warehouse to be burned down.

Despite Almec's promise, Kryze remained skeptical. As she escorted Amidala back to her ship, Kryze confided in Amidala that she believed there to be corruption in the Prime Minister. She asked Amidala to send a Jedi to aid her in finishing their work, proposing that they could go undercover at the Royal Academy of Government to help root out the corrupt leadership.

As the Jedi's ship landed, Almec questioned the integrity of having a Jedi teach at the Academy, specifically what he perceived to be a lack of understanding of Mandalorian ways. Kryze dashed aside his concerns by saying that it wouldn't hurt to have the students be exposed to new ideas. Skywalker and Tano exited their ship, and the Jedi Knight greeted the two Mandalorians. Kryze expressed her thanks to the Jedi Council for their ability to spare the two Jedi, but Skywalker informed her that only Tano would be staying on Mandalore. Almec was taken aback by the revelation, but Skywalker assured him that Tano was capable.
