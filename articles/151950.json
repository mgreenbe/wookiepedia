After losing a munitions crate, this droid and O.M.5 began marching behind Poggle's tank. They were caught up in a sandstorm, which first caused them to lose sight of one another. First the other battle droid, and then O.M.5 was buried and left behind in the storm, and despite the remaining commander's shouts to try and locate O.M.5, Lord Poggle ordered them to press onward. He soon stopped functioning as well and was also buried in the sand, unable to stand up to the storm as the Geonosians continued onward to the Progate Temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This battle droid showed some concern when O.M.5 disappeared, but followed Poggle's orders to keep going."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This B1 battle droid, like every battle droid in The Clone Wars movie and The Clone Wars television series, was voiced by Matthew Wood.
