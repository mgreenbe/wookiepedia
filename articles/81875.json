Sealed away in his Jaguada bastion Gravid set about amassing centuries worth of Sith lore that had been passed down from Master to apprentice since the time of Darth Bane, including: holocrons, crystals, scrolls, tomes, amulets and all other manner of artifacts, and proceeded to burn them, seeking to ensure that future generations of aspiring Sith remained committed to the path he had laid before them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately, Gravid's apprentice Darth Gean did not share her Master's vision. Horrified by the destruction of the Sith's treasures she threw herself at her Master, attacking Gravid with her bare hands, and after a violent struggle, succeeded in killing him, bringing an abrupt end to his plans. Although many valuable artifacts and teachings were consigned to the flames, including the coveted technique of essence transfer, Gean did manage to preserve enough material with which to instruct her own apprentice, ensuring the continuation of Darth Bane's original intentions: Unfaltering allegiance to the dark side."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Plagueis later recounted the events of Darth Gravid's demise in regards to seeking out the lost method of immortality.

Her first attempts are unsuccessful as they are suspicious of her and attack, forcing Willsaam to kill in self defense. Surviving as a Light Sith requires a healthy level of suspicion, as her master is well aware, and her approach was too naive to be believable. Future attempts work much better."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is possible for a player Sith Warrior or Sith Inquisitor to be a Light Sith.
