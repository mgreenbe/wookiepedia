The bow fired pink bolts of energy and could be retracted when deactivated. When the former clone troopers of Clone Force 99 were sent to rescue Muchi, an adolescent rancor that the slavers held captive, the young clone Omega released the rancor as a distraction, and several slavers attempted to fire upon Muchi with their energy bows. Omega later came across one of the bows on the ground and picked up the weapon, carrying it with her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
