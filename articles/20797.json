The Three Families' new war camp was between Broga's palace and the Republic's Operational Headquarters. Broga had the palace stocked with slaves and luxuriousness from the moon of Nar Shaddaa, and when the reconstituted Sith Empire took the palace, it became a product of great humiliation for Broga. Held by Moff Dracen, the palace was eventually liberated by an individual who was working with the Three Families and the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
