A cautious commander, Dorja commanded the vessel during the Battle of Endor, where the Relentless was distinguished by not sustaining any casualties. Afterwards, the Relentless retreated along with the Chimaera, and remained part of the fleet faction which Thrawn would eventually command. Dorja's personal differences with the Chimaera's captain, Gilad Pellaeon, and Grand Admiral Thrawn relegated him to a minor role in the latter's campaign of 9 ABY. The Relentless played a role in the Raid on New Cov, where its crew attempted to capture Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.

This corvette carried Colonel Meizh Vermel, a courier sent by Pellaeon to enter peace negotiations with the New Republic. Later that year, the Relentless was at the Battle of Yaga Minor, carrying the Remnant's ruling triumvirate (Moff Disra, Major Grodin Tierce, and the Thrawn impersonator Flim)."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yuuzhan Vong War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 28 ABY, following the Imperial Starfleet's retreat from the Battle of Bastion and the withdrawal at Yaga Minor, the Relentless led Fleet Group Relentless, one of four temporary battlegroups created for the defense of Borosk against the Yuuzhan Vong invaders.
