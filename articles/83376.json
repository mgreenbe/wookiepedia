These Aqualish troops discovered a cave in the wilderness of Talus and took up permanent residence when they realized that it was the perfect staging ground for their raids. When the war ended, the Aqualish remained hidden and continued to live in complete isolation during centuries. Highly paranoid, and often described as crazed by those few who knew of their existence, the Lost Aqualish kept their base well hidden fearing that the war could break out any day. Though there were occasional skirmishes between the Lost Aqualish and the Human settlers on Talus, their existence was virtually unknown to the rest of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lost Aqualish had cut themselves off from all outside communication during centuries.
