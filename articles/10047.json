Located in the New Territories, the sector was traversed by the Braxant and Relgim Run hyperlanes, and was home to several native sentient species, including the Dazouri, Ho'Din, Makurth, Shaliz'Na and Zeffliffl. Those civilizations, and the immigrants that joined them in the sector, were united by their fierce independence. Full exploration of the sector began in 15,000 BBY and continued through until 1000 BBY.

The Confederacy employed the notorious Pirates of Iridium to raid supply lines, and ran a research factory on Fest, but was eventually defeated by the Galactic Republic. Later, the rise of the Galactic Empire saw the sector placed under the control of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin as part of Oversector Outer.

The following year, the death of Kaine during a major offensive Imperial campaign precipitated the eventual transition of the sector into New Republic control. It remained in Republic hands for only a few years before being conquered by the invading, extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong in 26 ABY.

Two major hyperspace routes passed through the sector: the Braxant and Relgim Runs. The Braxant Run was the most important route in the entire northern quadrant of the galaxy, beginning at an intersection with the Hydian Way. The Braxant entered the Atrivis sector from Ketaris in the Oplovis sector and traversed the Fedje and Vuchelle systems before leaving Atrivis for the Cassander sector. The Relgim Rum began at the Fedje system, but struck out almost perpendicular to the Braxant Run, working its way through a string of Atrivis systems, with a sharp kink west at the Nam'ta system before continuing across Atrivis and into its namesake, the Relgim sector. By 25 ABY, the average population of the sector was less than 1 million per inhabited planet, with the exception of Fedje and areas around Moltok, which averaged between 1 and 10 million inhabitants."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Braxant Run star systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Fedje, at the intersection of the Braxant and Relgim Runs, was a forested world, home to many exotic arboreal life forms; these included the rare folded ear boosqueak.

Members of a religious sect inhabited its fourth planet, Devon Four."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Generis system was located further down the Relgim Run; it contained the planets Atrivis 7, Atrivis, and Generis. Generis was a world of striking natural beauty, covered with rough terrain and lush jungles. The planet had no major settlements, and was only lightly settled. Some of its locals\u2014a mix of Humans and other species\u2014established wilderness ranches, attracting wealthy offworlders with opportunities to hunt, hike, and raft down white-water rapids.

It was there, in the system containing the gas giant Nam'ta, that the Run kinked westward, continuing on towards the Horuz system. The Horuz system contained the planet Despayre, two gas giants and two asteroid belts. Despayre's single continent was covered in dense jungle filled with diverse poisonous species such as the crab spider, flit and scorpion slug. Because of these attributes, the planet was turned into a prison for many of the worst criminal offenders in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mantooine system was located on the Relgim Run near to its crossover into the Relgim sector.

After a significant victory at Coruscant, the Sith forced the Republic to sign the Treaty of Coruscant, which effectively divided the galaxy into two spheres of control. The Atrivis sector fell within the sphere of control of the Sith Empire, which compromised most of the eastern half of the galaxy. Despite the signing of the peace treaty, relations were uneasy between the galactic powers: a Cold War lasted for over a decade years, before outright war returned in 3641 BBY.

Several years before the Clone Wars would embroil the galaxy, the religious leaders of Devon Four refused to pay taxes to the central galactic government. In response, the Republic embargoed the planet, preventing any starship traffic from reaching its surface. Shortly after the embargo was initiated, an infectious plague broke out on the planet's surface. Despite the threat this posed to the planet's population, the Republic was unrelenting in its embargo.

Moffs Rebus and Seerdon also had projects within the sector. The Atrivis sector was at the forefront of opposition to the New Order, due in large part to the stubborn independence common throughout much of the Outer Rim Territories.
