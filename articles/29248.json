Princess Leia Organa was sent to represent the Alliance to Restore the Republic in the belief that Rebel Alliance support could strengthen the Circarpous resistance movement, leading to Circarpous IV and its neighboring worlds joining the Rebel Alliance openly. This was a vital mission, as at least one other system was ready to join the Rebel Alliance, but only if the Circarpous system did so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately Princess Leia Organa, along with her escort Luke Skywalker and their droid companions C-3PO and R2-D2 were delayed when Princess Leia Organa's Y-wing suffered a malfunction, forcing her to put down on Circarpous V. They were further delayed when an energy drill operated by the Galactic Empire on that world caused atmospheric feedback that wrecked both her and Luke Skywalker's X-wing on the planet. They were eventually able to escape the planet with the help of a woman named Halla, and continue on their mission to the conference."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
