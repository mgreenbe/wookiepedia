By the time of the Galactic Civil War, its fortuitous location at the junction of three important hyperspace routes led Gerrenthum to grow from a sleepy Outer Rim planet into a modern megaworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was surrounded by thousands of nav beacons that outlined the corridors off and on the planet, and thousands of starships passed through the spaceports of Gerrenthum every hour.
