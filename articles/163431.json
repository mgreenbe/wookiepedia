Evolving under merciless conditions, their tough, leathery skin helped them endure the harsh environment of their homeworld as well as providing natural resistance to blaster fire. This made Weequays ideal bodyguards and bounty hunters. Many Weequays served the Hutt Clan as mercenaries, bodyguards, and slaves as the Hutts controlled their homeworld. Some were able to escape those hardships and sought out the Alliance to Restore the Republic and used their skill to bring some good to the galaxy. The pirate Hondo Ohnaka and most members of his Ohnaka Gang were Weequay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
