It had large fins that ran from the back of their heads to their necks. The body was mostly made up of a long tapered tail used for swimming. Their skin was able to change color rapidly and the coloration was used as a form of communication among the animals. An attempt was made by Barabels to use them as a food source, but popular opinion was against this and laws were put into place to prevent the slaughter of the animals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Halfbacks were very playful, and attracted to shiny objects. They would often wrestle with each other over baubles that they would take back to their warrens. They would spend much of their time sunning themselves on the beaches of Pantolomin. Due to their social nature, they would often approach tourist and if given attention, they would follow the tourist around for hours. People were able to ride the halfbacks as they swam. The animals were also domesticated as pets and were loyal and intelligent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
