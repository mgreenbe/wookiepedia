The first Fair to be held in a generation, Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh intended the festival as a way for the Galactic Republic and the galaxy to show they had recovered after the devastation of the Great Hyperspace Disaster and its subsequent Emergences the year prior. Lonisa City, Valo's capital, was transformed for the festivities, with a new spaceport constructed and the city extensively renovated and refurbished. Soh invited Elarec Yovet, the regasa of the Togruta species, as an honoured guest, and members of the Jedi Order also extensively participated. Much of the fair's planning was directed by Coordinator Samera Ra-oon. However, the Nihil, who had spent much of the time since the Battle of Kur regrouping, attacked the Fair the day after it opened, resulting in much death and destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Valo Republic Fair was created as part of the Star Wars: The High Republic publishing initiative, featuring in its second wave of content, primarily the novels The High Republic: The Rising Storm, written by Cavan Scott, and The High Republic: Race to Crashpoint Tower, written by Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older and illustrated by Petur Antonsson, both published on June 29, 2021."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scott described the Republic Fair as the World Fair for the Galactic Republic.
