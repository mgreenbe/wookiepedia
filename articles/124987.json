At some point, he assisted Doctor Chelli Aphra with a job, but betrayed her to work with the Trandoshan Skikkesk. Some time later, Aphra, wishing to get revenge on Shrem and pay the hunters Winloss and Nokk back for previously sparing her life, devised a plan. Aphra's plan involved the hunters working with the bounty hunter Black Krrsantan, tricking Shrem into both betraying Skikkesk's location and trying to sell a worthless creature to Jabba the Hutt. The plan was successful, and Jabba had both Shrem and Skikkesk dropped down to his pet rancor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
