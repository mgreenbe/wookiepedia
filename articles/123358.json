Six months before the Battle of Yavin, the Jynni's Virtue was attacked over the Sith tombworld of Korriban by Imperial patrol ships equipped with cloaking shields. The Jynni's Virtue crashed on the surface of Korriban near the planet's equator, causing Sev\u2014along with everyone else aboard\u2014to be stranded in the Valley of Golg near a Sith tomb. While exploring the planet, Naz Felyood discovered the tomb and was possessed by the spirit of the deceased Sith King Dathka Graush, an act which caused his undead army of Korriban zombies to awaken. Some time after the zombies were unleashed, Sev was bitten by one, and he was infected with a plague that was transmitted through the zombie's bite. Sev died from the zombie attack, but the plague later reanimated his body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three days after Felyood was possessed by Graush, the zombies of Sev and several other beings attacked the Jynni's Virtue.

During the skirmish, the zombies of Sev and Derec, another pirate-turned-zombie, assaulted Babbnod Luroon, Felyood's First Mate. However, when the zombie that was once Sev attacked her with a rusty sword, Luroon killed him and Derec with a blaster.
