His first mission with Red Squadron, under the call sign Red Two, was to rescue Rebel prisoners, including his friend Captain Samuel Raider, who had escaped on the BFF-1 bulk freighter Genue from the Star's End penal colony at Mytus VII. Although the mission was successful, Cardacs was killed in action when his R-22 Spearhead was destroyed by TIE Fighters from the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Intrepid. Although Captain Keyan Farlander, Cardacs' flight leader, had known him for only minutes, Cardacs was the first wingmate he had lost, and the guilt of his death weighed heavily on Farlander. Cardacs' friend Raider initially held Farlander responsible for his death, but later realized that there was nothing he could have done."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cardacs is the wingman (the A-wing that escorts the player) in ToD II: Op I: 'Rescue at the Stars' End' of Star Wars: X-Wing, although he is not mentioned in the game's narrative.
