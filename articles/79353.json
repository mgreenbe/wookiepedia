Kahmf had recovered a portion of Darth Maul's brain and spinal cord, and preserved them in a specialized bacta tank in the laboratory. A device in the laboratory concealed the laboratory behind a holographic wall, while another was used to project Maul's essence as a solid-state hologram so Maul could exact his revenge. When Luke Skywalker was on Iridonia to assist with a trade negotiation, he was attacked by the hologram of Maul. Skywalker tracked the disturbance in the Force Maul's unnaturally preserved essence was causing, and after Kahmf fled the lab, Skywalker deactivated the support system keeping the brain alive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
