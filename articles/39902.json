He participated in the Second Battle of Geonosis, under the command of Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Clone Commander CC-1004, after the native Geonosians broke free from the Republic control that had been established on Geonosis since the beginning of the Clone Wars. Draa took part in the attack on a primary droid foundry and, along with most of the Republic forces there, distracted the Separatist droids as two Jedi Padawans infiltrated the foundry to destroy the main reactor. Although Draa and the troops faced heavy opposition from enemy battle droids and ray shielded super tanks, the foundry was destroyed and the Republic later won the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Draa, a clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, was born on the planet Kamino to serve in the Galactic Republic's Grand Army. In 21 BBY, the planet Geonosis, site of the first battle of the Clone Wars, once again became a problem for the Republic as droid foundries manned by Geonosians resumed producing battle droids for the Separatist Droid Army. Determined to stop the production of these battle droids, a Republic attack force arrived in the Geonosis system. After the Republic forces saw the destruction of the Geonosian Ray Shield Fortress protecting the primary droid foundry, Draa and other clone troopers, along with Clone Commander CC-1004, who had arrived in the system to reinforce the attack force that would strike for the foundry, were dispatched in Republic gunships to help the attack force. Led by Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and CC-1004, Draa, and fellow trooper Buzz, disembarked from the gunship, Dooku Boot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unduli, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, and their Padawans, Barriss Offee and Ahsoka Tano, respectively, met and established a plan. It was decided that the main Republic force, which included Draa, CC-1004, Buzz, Skywalker, and Unduli, would distract the enemy with a frontal assault, while the Padawans infiltrated the foundry to destroy its reactor with thermal detonators. As planned, Draa and the troops, led by Unduli and Skywalker, marched to attack the droid factory head-on via a bridge in an effort to distract the enemy as the Padawans completed their mission. Draa and the troops faced heavy opposition as ten garrisons of droids and Geonosians armed with sonic blasters engaged them. When a detachment of shield-equipped droidekas arrived to reinforce the droid forces, Draa was called forward by Clone Captain CT-7567 to deal with the destroyers. Draa used a missile launcher to destroy the first rank of droidekas, while mass driver blasts from the supporting Republic All Terrain Tactical Enforcer walkers obliterated the rest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Confederate experimental super tanks arrived to support the droid forces, Draa and the clone forces were forced to fall back after they discovered the tanks were ray-shielded, rendering the clones' artillery-class AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons useless against the tanks. To help Draa and the clones, Unduli and Skywalker eliminated the tanks by destroying the bridge they were crossing, but the effort left the Jedi stranded on the other side of the bridge, facing heavy droid opposition. Watching from the opposite side of the canyon that the bridge had spanned, Draa observed the foundry collapse, due to the destruction of its reactor by the Padawans. Draa and the troops took cover, as the dust wave, created by the factory's demise, swept toward them. As the dust wave passed, Draa and a detachment of troopers rendezvoused with their Jedi officers on the opposite side of the canyon via a gunship. With the main droid resistance eliminated, Republic troops began the task of wiping out small pockets of enemy forces to once again gain control of Geonosis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of Jango Fett, Draa stood 1.83 meters tall.
