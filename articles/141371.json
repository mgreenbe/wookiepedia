They had eight eyes, sharp teeth, and at least three fins, one of which was a dorsal fin. In the year 19 BBY the Jedi Knight Dass Jennir encountered a member of this species after escaping from the T'surr crime lord Ken-Kiba's and his spice runner gang through a trap door in the floor of the brothel known as Ember's Fire in the town of Noua. The eel emerged from amongst some rocks and attempted to devour Jennir while he was submerged, but the Jedi narrowly escaped when he was pulled to safety by a local fisherman named Fish."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The eel species first appeared in the fourth issue of the Blue Harvest story arc of the Star Wars: Dark Times comic book series.
