She later fought in a skirmish after half of Hondo's pirates join Darth Maul and Savage Opress in their conquest for power. She utilized a blaster pistol during the fight and killed several pirates before being forced to retreat into the ruins of the base with Ohnaka and the rest of his forces, as well as Obi-Wan Kenobi, after Adi Gallia was slain by Opress.
