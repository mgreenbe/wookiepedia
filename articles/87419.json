Considered smug and self-righteous, Qual grew up on Coruscant in a wealthy family. When the Empire rose to power, and alien discrimination became the norm,  Qual's family had to flee from Coruscant. Her father often ranted about the Empire, and how their family lost a lot of prestige when they had to leave Coruscant. This made Qual hold a great deal of resentment toward the Empire, and so she joined the Rebellion. She was suspected of conspiring against the Alliance after a traitor was confirmed within its ranks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
