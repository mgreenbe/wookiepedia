The carbonite had been pulled down into Gall's gravity well and accidentally hit a barracks housing a large unit of TIE/LN starfighter mechanics. The impact punched a hole into the outer hull large enough to form a crater thirty meters wide in diameter, killing fifty mechanics immediately, and another thirty who were sucked out into hard vacuum during the explosive decompression. The hole was so large that another twelve mechanics who survived the initial blast and the decompression died from a lack of air before emergency droids could seal the barracks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
