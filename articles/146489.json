It was a time in history when the original Sith Empire had reached the height of its power, and the Republic was poorly prepared for a conflict of such magnitude. Master Gnost-Dural looks back at the Great Hyperspace War and identifies the controversial decision that drove the Sith into exile and set the stage for the Empire's campaign of vengeance against the Republic. While the war went well for the Sith at first, Naga Sadow's apprentice had his own plans: betray his master. Without experienced command, the Sith were driven back to their territory by Republic forces. This time, the Supreme Chancellor ordered a search for Sith to prevent future devastation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "BTC 1347 \u2013 When two hyperspace explorers stumbled onto the remote world of Korriban, they never could have guessed the chain of events they were setting into motion.
