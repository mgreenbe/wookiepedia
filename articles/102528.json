It was lightweight personal defense weapon that could be easily disguised as a small container. The Ionic Tingler featured a horizontal clip with five soft-shell cartridges attached to the base of the weapon. Ionic pulse regulators energized plasma particles within the ammunition. When fired, the shell's covering disintegrated upon impact, blasting the target with charged plasma particles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
