Even the engines experienced a bonus from this reconfiguration. The end result was a very fast and maneuverable vessel that was well armed for a ship its size."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Enforcer-class was a joint venture by Sienar Fleet Systems and Kuat Drive Yards engineers located in the Pentastar Alignment at the behest of Grand Moff Ardus Kaine.

The ship was born out of Kaine's desire to quickly rebuild fleet strength."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although labeled as a picket, the cruiser served as the frontline vessel of Kaine's resource-strapped fleet.
