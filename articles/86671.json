When two of the Tempest Runners failed their respective missions, Ro asked one of them, Kassav Milliko, to intercept a transport carrying the Legacy Run's flight recorder in the Kur Nebula.

He explained to Greatstorm that his family had extensive knowledge on the Jedi and their powers, as well as how to resist them.
