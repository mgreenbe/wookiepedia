By the time the Empire made contact, the Marasans had spread from their homeworld, Marasai, to set up over twenty colonies in the nebula."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unable to duplicate the Marasans' methods, the Empire elected to conquer the cyborg aliens, forcing them to guide their starships through the nebula."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Marasa Nebula was also inhabited by giant plasma-fliers, large creatures which hid within the nebula.
