He was a scholar of Jedi and Sith history and lore. Following the discovery of the Lothal Jedi Temple in 0 BBY, Hydan was placed in charge of leading the excavation of the Temple and deciphering its mysteries. The excavation site employed many Mining Guild personnel and was heavily guarded by Imperial stormtroopers, scout troopers, and death troopers. Minister Hydan and the Emperor were interested in accessing the \"Gateway,\" which led to a realm known as the World Between Worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To avoid erasing any evidence critical to understanding the \"Gateway,\" Minister Hydan issued orders that no personnel were allowed to touch any objects excavated from the temple. The Imperial excavation project attracted the attention of the Spectres rebel cell including the Jedi Ezra Bridger, the Padawan of the late Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus. Disguised as scout troopers, Ezra and Sabine infiltrated the excavation site. Unaware they were rebels, Minister Hydan stumbled upon the two examining art and chastised them for tampering with the objects. After learning that the Emperor wanted to contact him, Minister Hydan departed and left the death trooper commander to deal with the two scout troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the Mobile command center, Minister Hydan informed the Emperor that the excavation had reached the roots of the temple and uncovered a painting of the Mortis gods, which was reminiscent of art and iconography found at the former Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Hydan believed that the painting was the key to unlocking the \"Gateway.\" The Emperor told Hydan that he sensed a great disturbance in the Force and opined that the death of Kanan had altered the fate of Lothal. Vowing to control the conduit between the living and the dead, the Emperor ordered Hydan to hasten his efforts."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Interrogating Sabine"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to Hydan, his conversation was being tapped by the Spectres, whose droid Chopper had rerouted the Imperial transmission. Acting on this information, Ezra and Sabine began to unlock the painting of the Mortis gods, which was the \"Gateway\". Though Sabine was taken away for questioning by a group of stormtroopers, Ezra managed to unlock the \"Gateway\" by touching the Daughter's hand. Meanwhile, the stormtroopers brought Sabine into Hydan's office for questioning. After identifying Sabine as a rebel spy, Minister Hydan ordered that the camp be locked down because an intruder was on the loose. Minister Hydan, several troopers, and the captive Sabine arrived at the \"Gateway\" but were unable to stop Ezra from entering the portal. A stormtrooper tried to follow but the portal sealed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response, Hydan had Sabine brought into his mobile command center for questioning. Recognizing Sabine as the talented Mandalorian rebel artist, Hydan attempted to flatter her. When Hydan asked Sabine how she and Ezra had entered the portal, the Mandalorian refused to cooperate. Hydan then mocked Ezra's master Kanan, prompting Sabine to tell him that he was a pawn of the Emperor. Hydan countered that his power was a reflection of the Emperor's might. When Sabine mocked the Emperor for failing to unlock the \"Gateway\", Hydan claimed that Ezra was not safe inside the World Between Worlds and that the Emperor would eventually find him. Hydan then told Sabine that the \"Gateway\" was a pathway to time and that whoever controlled it controlled the universe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Continuing his interrogation, Hydan told Sabine about the \"Mortis gods\", a family of three powerful beings known as the Father, Daughter, and the Son. When Hydan asked about the differences in their depiction on the Temple and Lothal mural, Sabine feigned ignorance. Hydan then warned her not to mistake his \"pleasant demeanor\" for weakness and observed that the positions of the Loth wolves, Daughter's head, and Father's hand had changed since Ezra's arrival.

They concluded that the Daughter opened the portal while the Son closed it. Before they could continue further, Hera activated one of the thrusters beneath the mobile command center, causing the structure to rise and fall on its back. Sabine managed to escape with her fellow Spectres and headed towards the painting. They were joined by Ezra, who had escaped the Emperor's clutches and encountered Ahsoka inside the World Between Worlds. Ezra convinced his fellow Spectres including Sabine to help him seal the portal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hydan arrived with several Imperial troops but the rebels managed to escape on a Mining Guild excavation driller.
