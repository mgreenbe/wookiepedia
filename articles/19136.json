They were equipped with thick armor and twin booma-throwing catapults packed with enough firepower to level shore emplacements. Like standard Bongo Behemoths, Advanced Bongo Behemoths were cetacean vessels, metallic rather than biological in form and appearance, and featured two propellers on outriggers. They were constructed at shipyards at a cost of 200 units of carbon and 150 units of nova crystals. Advanced Behemoths had limited submersible capability. They were first used during the War of the Gungan tribes around 3000 BBY, and later during the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bongo Advanced Behemoths appear in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack.
