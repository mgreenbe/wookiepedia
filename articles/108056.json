Project Iokath was even more ambitious, with the goal to fabricate an expandable and adaptable home for the entire species that was also secure against any outside force. To that end, they picked an unremarkable star in the Unknown Regions and demolished every orbital body in its system down to the last asteroid, salvaging them for core elements. Those were used to create a massive self-sustaining ecosphere that completely engulfed the star, using all of its energy output. The massive habitat was named Iokath and once completed it allowed no light from its star outside, the entire system became undetectable to the rest of the galaxy. Even then, the exterior defenses of the sphere made the inside biome virtually unassailable, while the inside biomes could be altered and expanded as needed, giving Iokath creators complete control over its environment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
