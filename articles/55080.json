Their huge roots grew out of the bog, providing shelter in the hollow spaces. Each gnarltree was a microcosm of life-forms with lichens, moss, and shelf-fungus filling the crannies of the calcified trunk. But the strangest part of the gnarltree was that the knobby white spider was part of its lifecycle. The spider was actually a detachable, mobile root that broke free of the parent gnarltree. It became a predatory carnivorous plant, hunting and devouring to build up its energy and nutrients before making a clearing and putting down its eight sharp legs, which become the roots of the new gnarltree."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
