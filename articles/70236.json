With their plans compromised, Zayne decided to openly face the Covenant, keeping up his Sith guise, bluffing that the Talisman made Sith artifacts come to life. Haazen attempted to talk to Zayne and once he was close, he snatched the fake from Zayne's neck, which actually contained Zayne's lightsaber. At that moment, the Jedi strike team burst into the Estate, showing the members of the Covenant that they had been revealed. Zayne then told the truth of what happened on Jebble. in response, Haazen issued command \"Vindication\" during the same moment, ordering the Covenant to destroy the Jedi Council due to it having been \"infiltrated\" by the Sith.
