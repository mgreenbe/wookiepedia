Held in a dark river in the Nightsister fortress, the ceremony began with the shaman questioning the potential Nightsisters on her loyalty to her clan. After the prospective Sister had answered affirmatively to all questions, she would be submerged into the waters. The shaman would then draw forth spirit ichor as the spellcaster coven lifted her out of the waters. Once the Sister had been baptized in the magicks, she would be lowered, her eyes momentarily rising back into her skull before they returned to normal, signifying the beginning of her new life with the Nightsisters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Asajj Ventress, who was born a Nightsister but spent her early life away from Dathomir, was baptized as a full Nightsister in 20 BBY, shortly before the Battle of Dathomir."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
