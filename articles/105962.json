The vehicles were driven by repulsorlift engines and collected plasma by burrowing underground and lifting the plasma out. Three were used by a mine director to collect plasma at a mining camp affiliated with the Borvo the Hutt's smuggling organization and the Trade Federation. The miners and the mine itself were destroyed during an incident with the Royal Naboo Security Forces. Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes had stumbled onto the camp while it was under attack by the Trade Federation Droid Army. After driving off the Federation tanks, Sykes contacted the mine operator, who warned the lieutenant to back off. Sykes was not deterred by the warning and defended himself when the remaining laser cannons attacked him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These vehicles were created for the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo and are only in one mission.
