During operation of the missile, the user would point the weapon's nose at the target and depress a stud to take a mass spectral record of the object to be targeted. The mass spectral record of a target included such information as its infrared exhaust signature and its shift shield output."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
