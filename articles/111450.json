Most ramships were built from the frame of standard starships though their interiors would be packed with explosives. Due to the highly dangerous profile of the mission, few sentients would pilot these craft and many were entirely automated like robot ramships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ramships were often deployed by pirates and occasionally rogue planetary governments like the Sacorrian Triad during the Battle over Centerpoint Station in 18 ABY which utilized modified frigates. Throughout the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Yuuzhan Vong invaders would occasionally ram vessels into enemy targets including spacecraft, orbital stations and even planetary surfaces particularly during the conquest of Coruscant in 27 ABY. Ssi-ruuvi Fw'Sen-class picket ship could also double as ramships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
