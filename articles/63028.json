Beckett entered the cantina posing as a death priest, wearing a cloak and pretending to Force choke Durant. The other patrons fled the cantina, allowing Beckett's partner Val to place a tracker on Dvorad, following him as he escaped and boarded a speeder. Beckett jumped aboard the speeder to confront Dvorad as Val and Durant searched for another craft. The crew eventually met up at the location of Dvorad's ship, which the Pantoran summoned from the water while holding Beckett's crew at gunpoint. Beckett caused a creature to emerge from the water and grab hold of the ship, using the distraction to steal the identichips. After he had retrieved the cargo, Beckett and his crew left Hovun IV aboard their starship Rampart, traveling to the space station Munt Ontdal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A city floated on the surface of one of Hovun IV's oceans, known to house a cantina, where gamblers would play games such as sabacc."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hovun IV first appeared in Beckett 1, a canon comic written by Gerry Duggan, penciled by Marc Laming, Edgar Salazar, and Will Sliney, and released on August 15, 2018."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
