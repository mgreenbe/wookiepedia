Following the death of the Devaronian noble Carisica Vanq on Danteel, Stenberk led several officers into the High Card Casino, to investigate whether a Tchine statue that had been offered as a prize in a sabacc tournament had been stolen from Vanq. However, shortly after his arrival, Stenberk received word that Vanq's Tchine had been found in a vault on her estate, and he and his party departed from the casino.
