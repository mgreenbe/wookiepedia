It fetched a very high price offworld, so prospectors would travel there hoping to collect the spice and capitalize on the market. The prices were so high that people would try this amid heavy fighting during the Summertime War between the planet's tribes, the Korun and the Balawai. These attempts persisted into 22 BBY, when the factions fighting the Clone Wars began militaristically supporting the tribes and intensifying the local feud."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinsol was briefly mentioned in Shatterpoint, a 2003 novel by Matthew Stover.
