However, rookie clone troopers Hevy, Fives, and Echo, under the command of Captain Rex and Commander Cody, retook the base. Unfortunately, reinforcements arrived when General Grievous became suspicious of the lack of response. The clones tried to blow up the base with Tibanna gas and thermal detonators, but the remote control was malfunctioning.
