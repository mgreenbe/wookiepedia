During the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, Imperial Senator Bail Organa suggested in a letter to Imperial Security Bureau Chief Investigator Axvering that a missing shipment of U-wing transports might have been mislogged by the Coruscant port authority, and that was the reason for the confusion as to the whereabouts of the shipment.
