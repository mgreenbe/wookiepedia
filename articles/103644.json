One of these was installed on the modified YT-1300 Millennium Falcon, and used with a Fabritech ANy-20 active sensor transceiver. As Fabritech and Siep-Irol devices were not generally compatible, Han Solo modified the passive sensor array and rigged the Falcon's computer to read it as a Fabritech-friendly unit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
