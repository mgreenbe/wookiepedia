Bozzi married during her lifetime, but by the time of the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire, she was an elderly widow. While at the hotel she allowed the droid staff to handle most business while she dozed in a Human-sized armchair. During the war when the Jedi Knight Elaiza came to Cloud City in hope of acquiring the Jewel of Yavin, a Corusca gem, the Jedi adopted the persona of a crazy old lady which fooled Bozzi. The Ugnaught took pity on what she saw as a kindred spirit and allowed Elaiza to stay at her hotel with a hefty discount."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bozzi first appeared in The Jewel of Yavin, an adventure module released in 2014 by Fantasy Flight Games for Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. she is described as a character players might interact with, although no specific meeting is described."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
