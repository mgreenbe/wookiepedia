Early one morning, he and three pilots razed the campsite of Clan Ordo in retaliation of Ordo's invasion of their territory, as each clan chose its own territory in which to search for Mandalore's Mask. He and the other Basilisk pilots concentrated their assault from above, while Jendri soldiers attacked by ground near Ordo's Basilisks in an attempt to keep the enemy pilots from reaching their deadly semi-sentient machines. The Jedi Master Revan, who had accompanied Canderous Ordo, a Mandalorian mercenary, to help Ordo's clan in the search, realized their strategy and attacked the Basilisk pilot and his allies in order to distract their attention from Clan Ordo's Basilisks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Master charged the pilot and leaped high in the air using his lightsaber to slice through one of the stabilizing fins, damaging the tail.
