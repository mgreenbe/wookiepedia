The tribal leaders of the Fyodoi would meet, and after a great feast, discuss tribal matters. Before the feast, the tribal chiefs would gather in the middle of a specially constructed circle of straw huts, and shout gibberish at one another for four hours, followed by burning down all the huts save one. The ceremony was a symbolic reenactment of the events leading up to the Great Cleansing, and the war that followed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
