It was the entertainment district with a large number of cantinas, casinos and taverns. It was decorated by columns, carved out of the comet's solid interior by Salovan Fische's mining droids. Smugglers, pirates and spice dealers could be commonly found in the Arcade. It was controlled by Anjiliac Hutts, as neither Epsis nor Sable Dawn had any interest in it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
