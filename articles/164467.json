They were hyper-intelligent, and evolved into a form that was virtually indistinguishable from near-Human species. This form enabled them to move and was used to secure shelter and trap prey. Wirituds were encountered in shadier districts of the planet Coruscant, while their homeworld and many other details about them remained unknown. In 22 BBY, a member of the species was present in the Outlander Club on Coruscant when it was visited by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker in pursuit of the bounty hunter Zam Wesell. The Wirutid appeared as a female with white hair and was wearing a green dress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wirutid were created by Simon Beecroft and Curtis Saxton for Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, published by Dorling Kindersley in 2003.
