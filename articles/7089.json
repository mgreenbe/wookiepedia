Since the planet was a vibrant galactic commercial hub, it had a thriving animal economy. Traders, brokers, trappers, and hunters brought species from all over the galaxy to dealers, who sold the animals as pets, zoo animals, livestock, as well as other roles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of these enterprises were sanctioned, while some were nefarious. Officials usually looked the other way. Escape was also accomplished easily and in many ways for the animals stationed at the Animal trade. Most of them escaped and became fugitive animals that adapted to Coruscant, sometimes making it dangerous to go out into the lower levels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
