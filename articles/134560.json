The first Star Wars film, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, introduced us to a brave Rebel Alliance standing up to the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. Many years later, in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, we saw the birth of the Empire and the rise of Darth Vader. But between Episode III and Episode IV lies a 20-year stretch of Star Wars history never before explored."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now, Star Wars Rebels gives us a first-ever glimpse into this exciting period and the genesis of the Rebel movement. As the evil Empire tightens its grip on the star systems, the Jedi are nearly extinct. The few who remain are forced into lives of seclusion. Citizens in various parts of the galaxy band together to rise up in protest, and help those oppressed by Vader and the Emperor. Star Wars Rebels takes us into the thrilling adventures of one of these groups. Adding to its collectability and super-sized value is the book's nine full-size, removable posters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Poster-A-Page series delivers children's most popular characters, stories, and memorable moments to them in a unique visual format and offers kids ages 4-12 the opportunity to bring their favorite friends and stories into their homes, onto their walls, and become part of their world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
