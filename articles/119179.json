He was the son of Ru and Halia Vushan, also members of the Dreamers. He accompanied fellow Dreamer Seyn Marana, whom he had fallen in love without knowing she was secretly an undercover Imperial, on a mission to explode an munitions factory. They disguised themselves as students on a field trip to the factory and planted a bomb on a timer to destroy it. When the timer expired without the bomb exploding, Vushan turned back, planning to detonate his suicide bomb to finish their mission. Unaware that Marana has actually changed the timer to allow the students on the field trip to escape in time, Vushan sacrificed his life to destroy the factory, unaware that his sacrifice was unnecessary because the bomb was on a delay. He died in the hands of  Marana, who would later be discovered as a traitor and killed for her role in his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
