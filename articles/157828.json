The Unifiers specialized in the use of Force persuasion and were less skilled at other Force powers. They received orders from the Krevaaki Sith Lord Saaj Calician via a network of telepathic Celegians, and used their Force abilities to create a haze of Force persuasion that numbed the minds of the Dyarchy's non-Force-sensitive populations, keeping their subjects fully under Dyarchy control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
