Nurseries were produced by droid or organic workers such as Glurrgs or Wookiees at a cost of 100 units of carbon. Many techniques allowed an increase in food production by using advanced processes, such as cloning, stimulant use, and gene splicing. They were utilized by various groups, including the Gungans, the Rebel Alliance, the Galactic Empire, the Trade Federation, the Royal Naboo Security Forces, the Wookiees, the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems had access to particularly unique animal nurseries.
