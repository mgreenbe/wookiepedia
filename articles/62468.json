Circa 1 ABY, he was contacted by Wernell Covington who was seeking to avenge his daughter. The Covington knew that two of the kidnappers had escaped justice during all those years but he ignored their identity. The reporter agreed with helping the old man, even if he did not completely approve Covington's bloody thirst for revenge. Horace Korr therefore worked with a spacer recruited by Covington. The reporter first requested the spacer to visit the Corellia Times News archive in Coronet, on Corellia. Korr then tasked the spacer to find his original notes on the crime in an old warehouse near the Narmle Starport that was overran by thugs. With those information, Horace Korr was able to identify the last escaped kidnappers: Jurgen Nath and Vladlun Travan. The spacer eventually killed them both."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Horace Korr was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
