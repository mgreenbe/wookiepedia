During his time there, Asaige became enamored by the enigmatic teachings of Xendor, who preached that the Jedi High Council was too restrictive in their teachings and wished to limit understanding of the Force. When Xendor parted with the Order to found an academy on Lettow, Asiage followed to learn from Xendor. Calling themselves the Legions of Lettow, the Jedi Renunciates grew strong in the Force as they studied the Bogan through many different Force-traditions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the High Council declared war on the Legions of Lettow, Asaiage and his fellows took up swords to protect their rights to study the Force. Meeting the Order in a full-blown conflict called the Great Schism by the Order, Asaiage jumped from world to world to fight off the Jedi as part of General Xendor's vanguard. At the battle of Columus, the van was cut off from the bulk of the army by Jedi Master Awdrysta Pina and his Jedi Knights. Despite Asaiage's repute as a fine warrior, he fell alongside fellow Legionnaires Xendor and Tun Bohoi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
