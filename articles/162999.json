His species differed from those known to New Republic databases. Waru was considered a healer by many, due to his ability to treat injuries utilizing his own body. Physically, Waru was predominantly blob-shaped, and consisted of several golden plates acting as shields around a layer of raw, permeable tissue. A thick, syrupy liquid, comparable to ichor, flowed freely from within Waru through the spaces between the covering plates. The inside of Waru was much larger than the outside revealed, allowing three adult Humans enough space to swim through. Waru's interior was was also breathable by Humans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time before 14 ABY, Waru was sent from his own dimension due to the combined efforts of the crystallizing star Crseih and the research and sacrifices of Darth Vader's former apprentice, the Imperial Procurator of Justice Hethrir, who was searching for the means to acquire complete mastery of the Force. Waru, looking for a way to return home, met with Hethrir and agreed to grant Hethrir his wish concerning the Force if the former Procurator could bring Waru a being powerful enough to create a path home. Hethrir began a quest to fulfill Waru's wishes, and in the meantime Waru resided on Crseih Station, where before long he gained a following called the Cult of Waru. During this time, he resided in an arena containing the Altar of Waru where he would gather those who wished to be healed. Eventually, Hethrir's quest proved fruitful after coming upon and kidnapping the Solo children, of which he planned to sacrifice Anakin Solo in order to fulfill his end of the bargain. This forced Anakin's mother, Leia Organa Solo, along with astromech droid R2-D2 and Wookiee Chewbacca, to pursue the kidnappers, meeting Hethrir's wife Rillao along the way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and the protocol droid C-3PO arrived at Crseih Station to follow a report sent by the mercenary agent Xaverri, one of Waru's confidants and an old flame of Solo's. While Solo was originally skeptical and convinced of Waru's intent to harm supplicants seeking his healing power, Skywalker became enamored at the golden being's actions; Skywalker began seeking a way to heal himself of the effects of the nearby crystal star, which were severing his ties to the Force and making Skywalker feel as if he were dying. Soon after, Hethrir arrived on the research station to present young Anakin, but was stopped by Hethrir's son Tigris. Waru, exhausted and lonely, demanded a sacrifice; Skywalker stepped in at this time and offered himself to join with Waru, much to the shock and dismay of both Leia and Han Solo. They both took pursuit into Waru's body. They rescued Skywalker and exited Waru; this angered the trans-dimensional golden being, who turned on his former ally Hethrir, consumed him, and then collapsed into himself and disappeared. It was unsure to those present, as well as those who reported on the events, what happened after Waru contracted; different sources claim that he survived and was teleported home, yet another claims that he died there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Travel through dimensions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Waru lived in an alternate dimension\u2014a parallel universe\u2014to the one in which the galaxy existed.

This caused a large enough disturbance in the Force to teleport a being, Waru in this case, between parallel universes. Waru's journey was also made possible by the sacrifices made and scientific research done by the Procurator of Justice, a Firrerreo named Hethrir trained by Darth Vader as an apprentice.

The two made a deal: Waru would reveal and teach everything that the Force contained, thus granting complete mastery of the Force to Hethrir. In exchange, Waru wished only for a way to escape back to his own dimension, which he hoped to accomplish by consuming a being with a large amount of Force-sensitivity. Hethrir believed it was possible for the trans-dimensional being to reveal the fullness of the Force, as he performed every act toward that goal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To acquire energy inside the alien universe he had found himself in, Waru had to annihilate the Force he found within the universe with the anti-Force of his own universe. To fuel Waru's need to ingest beings for their energies, Hethrir would \"harvest\" children from their homes and raise them for two different purposes: those able to use the Force would comprise the Empire Reborn, which was set up to restore the Galactic Empire to its former status in the galaxy, and those unable to touch the Force were to be sacrificed to Waru, or sold as slaves to fund Hethrir's actions. In order to fully prepare the youths he planned on training in the ways of the Force, he would take them to Waru for a purification ceremony, in which the new recruit would be offered to Waru. If the purification ritual failed, the young warrior would die, granting Waru the life force to continue living. Those without Force abilities would be fed to Waru to sustain him, until Hethrir could find one gifted enough in the Force he could sacrifice.

Soon after, a cult had been formed around Waru and his powers, with its own internal hierarchy. Humans and aliens alike flooded to the Altar of Waru located in Waru's temple, where they would stand for hours, even days, with their sick and those in pain, hoping that Waru would select their respective groups. The large auditorium in which Waru held his followers was often packed beyond the recommended limits, even to the point of being considered dangerous. Waru would choose a group, signified by a call to the stage at which Waru would perform the ceremony of healing. The called company of beings would approach the altar, where a request would be made. Waru would then attempt to heal the creature."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to maintain the charade of his power and to keep those watching under his control, Waru would often sustain those who he treated. However, Waru's power could only go so far until draining his own life force. To keep his vitality, he would have to kill and consume the life force of a being searching for the complete opposite. Waru was able to pass this off as an accident, or lay the blame on the individual he had attempted to heal, claiming they were too weak or too far gone for him to work any cure. The families of the victims always accepted this when it happened, and mourned openly on-site; Waru would, more often than not, join in the grieving process."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Followers"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several individuals comprised a group of messengers, tasked with the responsibility to share the news of Waru.

Though she had attended almost all of his services, she hadn't personally met with Waru until 14 ABY. Over the course of several days, Xaverri befriended Waru, and Waru allowed her to join him alone after services.

Having learned of a possible Jedi presence aboard Crseih Station, he traveled, along with his friend and brother-in-law Han Solo and the purple-clad 3PO-series protocol droid C-3PO, to the research station. This information was started by Xaverri in the form of a rumor delivered in several cryptic messages to Solo as a subtle way to enlist Skywalker's help in discovering Waru's mysteries. Previously, Solo and Xaverri had worked against the Empire through subterfuge in tricking Imperial governors and officers out of their credits, as well as working together in the defense of Nar Shaddaa. As they were also formerly involved romantically, Xaverri feared approaching Solo with the request without hiding her identity until Solo arrived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi, general, droid all traveled as a group and went undercover as tourists, and as such were disguised to protect themselves from discovery. Once the three arrived, still unsure who they were looking for, Han Solo was approached by a female Ghostling follower of Waru. The Ghostling invited Solo to the next meeting at the Altar of Waru; however, the New Republic general refused, passing the cult off as phony. Later, though, once contact was established with Xaverri, the destination was proven to be Waru's cult. As they arrived, Skywalker noticed that all of the supplicants shared one characteristic: at least one of each group's members was suffering from some sort of sickness or ailment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Waru continued his services, one of which Skywalker, Solo, C-3PO, and Xaverri attended, and healed those who approached. Calling out to Xaverri, whom Waru correctly identified was not alone, Waru asked the nature of the visit, as neither Skywalker nor Solo were sick or injured. Xaverri revealed that the two newcomers were there to learn the ways of Waru and become his followers. After the initial introductions, Waru asked about C-3PO, whose kind he had never encountered prior to this meeting, and Xaverri answered, calling the protocol droid \"Purple-Three\". Pleased, Waru allowed the three to remain with him as he conversed with Xaverri concerning several complicated texts. The two continued to speak until Waru broke off the discussion and performed a ritual with Xaverri that caused the latter to faint."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After this personal meeting, Waru began to accept members of the throng of devotees so that he could heal them. One such being was a Zeffliffl whom Waru healed. Solo expected Waru's service to be nothing more than an elaborate hoax and remained cynical even when no mention of monetary compensation was made. Soon after the first healing, Solo left with Xaverri and C-3PO, initially leaving Skywalker but then returning to retrieve the transfixed Jedi; Waru continued on with his healing rituals, eventually stopping to rest."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Solo children kidnapped"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, on the planet of Munto Codru, Hethrir set in motion the kidnapping of the Solo children\u2014the twins, Jacen and Jaina, and their younger brother Anakin, as he planned to sacrifice them to Waru in exchange for the ability to master the Force in its entirety. The plan was completed successfully, and the former Procurator of Justice held them aboard his worldcraft, named the Rebirth, until they could arrive at Crseih Station. After learning of the kidnapping, the children's mother, Chief of State and former Princess of Alderaan Leia Organa Solo set out on a mission to track and retrieve the children, and confront whomever took them. She was joined by Chewbacca, the Wookiee co-pilot and friend of Han Solo, who had been injured in the kidnapping, and the astromech droid R2-D2. Along the way, the trio came upon a group of stranded starships, which, after some investigation, yielded knowledge of the kidnapper's identity, as well as several Firrerreo slaves. They were also joined in the quest to track Hethrir's location by a new partner, a Firrerreo named Rillao who had been held aboard the slaving ships. Eventually, the group was able to track down Rebirth, where numerous kidnapped children were held. Two of the Solo children, Jacen and Jaina, were found and recovered, as well as the rest of the children aboard, but Hethrir, Anakin, and many of his followers had fled already."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Continued investigation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The day after Skywalker and Solo witnessed the first healing ceremony, another healing session began as usual in Waru's altar. Xaverri joined Waru when they began, and he chose people to heal. However, his own life force was ebbing, and he needed to consume another being before he would die himself. Spotting a subfamily of Ithorians who were caring for an especially weakened youth, Waru took the opportunity to use his healing effect and called the family to the altar. The ceremony began normally and Waru encased the young Ithorian in the chrysalis formed by his ichor. The ceremony took a different path, as Waru suddenly cried out, signifying a problem with the healing process. As the cry was uttered, the entirety of the audience fell to the ground and covered their eyes, save for Solo, who had been watching the event unfold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Instead of his typical motions with an intent to heal, Waru reversed the process, contracting his scales rather than expanding them, crushing the fragile youth. After a sigh emanating from Waru, the chrysalis exploded, leaving the Ithorian dead upon the altar before the being. Waru admonished the subfamily of Ithorians for not being quick enough in presenting the youth, as well as the ill youth for not being strong enough, and then requested to be left alone to rest. None of the other members of the audience, save Han Solo, seemed to pay any mind to the recent death, and instead continued to honor Waru. Solo instead was struck dumbfounded at what his perception of Waru's actions brought; the former smuggler was certain that he saw Waru kill the youth on purpose."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Tempting Skywalker"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the two Solo twins, along with several other confiscated children, had been recovered on the worldship by Leia Organa Solo, Hethrir still possessed the young Anakin, who he felt was the key individual Waru needed to grant the former Procurator the entire knowledge of the Force. Hethrir and Anakin Solo, along with his finest Proctors, his son Tigris, and several children whom Hethrir planned on selling as slaves, traveled to Crseih Station to meet with Waru.

Han Solo approached the building soon after the service terminated, in time to see Waru conversing with Luke Skywalker\u2014no longer disguised or traveling incognito\u2014who felt that he was dying, due to the effects of the crystallizing star. Waru took pity on the Jedi, and offered to attempt to heal him; this offer, however, was nothing more than an attempt to take Skywalker's life force to replenish his own, and attempt to return to his home dimension. Solo interrupted the conversation before Skywalker could commit, against Waru's wishes, and dragged Skywalker towards the exit.

Waru commended Hethrir, and allowed the ceremony to begin. Once the child had been placed on Waru's top, the extra-dimensional being began absorbing Anakin; he was stopped by Tigris, who ran from the stage and returned Anakin to his parents, who had arrived on the scene shortly after the service began. Waru roared a cry of desperation, angry due to the loss of the sacrifice. In the confusion caused by Tigris's actions, Luke Skywalker approached Waru. Initially, Waru rejected the Jedi's coming, as Waru was tired and would be unable to heal Skywalker's ailments; Hethrir changed Waru's mind once he revealed that Skywalker was more powerful, as he was the son of Vader.

However, Organa Solo soon slowed and stopped, remembering her children and hearing their calls from the outside of Waru. Snapping out of the trance-like state caused by Waru's words, the former princess fought against her captor, and attempted to free Skywalker as well. Initially, Waru's bonds over Skywalker's will were too strong; when Organa Solo looked into Skywalker's eyes, she did not recognize the man he had become.

At the moment Waru captured Hethrir in his self, a void in the Force was created in the near vicinity, noted by those sensitive to the Force in the area. Also occurring at this time was the ripping of the space-time continuum, allowing Waru to escape back to his own dimension. Tigris, desperate to keep his father even after Rillao's revelations that he was a traitor to the boy, attempted to follow the former Procurator of Justice into Waru. Initially restrained by his mother and Xaverri, the boy broke their holds and flung himself at Waru's body, which collected him before quickly rebounding him from Waru's surface, which began to contract.

During the several healing services Waru performed to maintain his position aboard Crseih Station, those healed would praise the golden creature; surprisingly to Han Solo, Waru never asked for anything in return. In private with confidants such as Xaverri, Waru expressed that, while he enjoyed healing those who came to him, doing so was detrimental to his own existence. In the event that Waru had to kill one of his patients to recover his own vitality, he took satisfaction in doing so.

Ichor poured from the spaces between each covering plate, which was described as similar to the ooze leaking from the core of the main asteroid in the cluster of asteroids known as the Smuggler's Run. Waru would use this ichor to encapsulate his patient, within which the healing would take place. Waru possessed no external forms of expression, as he contained no face, but spoke in a deep, booming voice.

The interior of Waru was much larger than the exterior showed; there was ample enough room for three adult Humans spaced far apart. The ichor that leaked outside was the main component present within Waru. It was itself intriguing due to its nature; its consistency was somewhere between a solid and a liquid and could be breathed, albeit with effort, by Humans as if it was regular air containing oxygen. Floating within this ichor were sharpened scales which matched those outside in size and appearance; Waru could control these to attempt to injure or kill intruders. These could be broken when enough force was applied, and they would shatter and melt into the ichor. In a manner much like Waru's outside, no organs responsible for life were obvious.
