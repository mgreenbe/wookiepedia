However, the leading members of Kegan's government, known as the Benevolent Guides, were Force-sensitive and could see into the future. They saw Kegan being taken over by Masked Soldiers and the Galactic Empire. They kidnapped Olana and sent her to the Re-Learning Circle to enforce upon her the ways of The Learning. However, the Jedi were able to rescue Olana after Kenobi and Tachi managed to get captured and sent to the Learning Circle. After finding Olana Force-sensitive, the Jedi brought her back to Coruscant for training, while V-Nen and O-Melie adopted a young orphaned boy by the name of V-Davi who had escaped with Kenobi and Tachi from the Re-Learning Circle. O-Melie and her husband were part of a covert resistance against their leaders, and after the Jedi exposed what was going on at the Re-Learning Circle, the city's populace peacefully ousted their Benevolent Guides."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
