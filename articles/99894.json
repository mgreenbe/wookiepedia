During this time, he visited a Force-sensitive spacer and asked the traveler if they ever considered the possibility that they were Force-sensitive, which the spacer had. The old man gave the spacer a Force crystal which he said would help them find out for sure. The spacer was eventually attacked by two Sith Shadows who had come looking for the crystal. The spacer killed them and looted a datapad from their bodies. The datapad led the spacer to a Sith Shadow camp on the planet Dathomir. When the spacer arrived at the camp, they were attacked by more Sith Shadows but the spacer managed to kill them as well. The spacer looted another datapad from one of them which had coordinates to a village on Dathomir known as Aurilia. The spacer traveled to the village and discovered it to be a commune for Force-sensitive individuals. The villagers confirmed the spacer's Force sensitivity and welcomed them to their village."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first time he visited this person, he granted them access to the village of Aurilia on Dathomir.
