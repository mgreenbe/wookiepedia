In this position, Wesyse, who previously worked as a censor for the Empire there, replaced Mandora Catabe, who held anti-Imperial views. Eridan's first staffing decision was the promotion of Calliope Drouth, who became famous after an article on the suffering of the Wookiees, from which the Imperial Censorship excluded the entire author's position, up to the senior reporter, and her appointment as the head of the \"Voice of the Empire\" column. He sent her to the Imperial Ball at the Imperial Palace, where she was to form an opinion on the fashion of the highest echelon of dignitaries and officers of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
