Some time later, the Colossus space station arrived above D'Qar, hoping to meet with the Resistance to refuel, but found only the wreckage from the Resistance's battle with the First Order. While salvaging the wreckage of the destroyed dreadnought, the First Order tracked the station to D'Qar, and attempted to attack and destroy it.

An obscure world far from the main space lanes, the remote D'Qar was surrounded by a wide planetary ring that cast a shadow on its forested surface. The lush, jungle-covered terrain did not host any intelligent life, though creatures such as birds and insects called the huge trees and fast-growing roots of the jungle home, as did the carnivorous plant known as the creepervine. Aside from the foliage, D'Qar's surface featured plains and mountains. The world had a comfortable, temperate climate despite its challenging ecosystem and dangerous predators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point, D'Qar was home to a civilization.

Shortly afterward, the Resistance evacuated their base, but were interrupted when a First Order fleet arrived above D'Qar. Almost immediately after the last U-55 orbital loadlifter had taken off, the base was annihilated by four blasts from the First Order Dreadnought Fulminatrix's orbital autocannons. The Fulminatrix was later destroyed by the Resistance bomber Cobalt Hammer, and the Resistance fleet escaped from the system, leaving the First Order behind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the end of the battle over the planet, the supertanker fuel depot Colossus arrived at D'Qar hoping to refuel and resupply at the Resistance base, unaware of the base's recent destruction.
