After the Emperor is defeated, the player is presented with two light side options and a dark side option: tell the Emperor that he will face justice, promise the Sith that he will be redeemed, or simply kill the Emperor. The first two options give light side points, but the Emperor still collapses and seemingly dies before exploding into dark side energy after the player speaks with Lord Scourge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor's Voice dies as a result of the collapsing building and wounds inflicted by the Knight, but it is revealed in a message to Sith Warrior players that the Emperor's essence survived and returned to another body, where he entered a deep sleep under the care of his Hand to recover his strength. However, the 2012 novel Darth Plagueis reveals that the Sith Emperor did in fact die a final time at some point before the book's events, which take place 3,600 years after the events of The Old Republic. In the novel, which explains the backstories of the Sith Lords Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious, Plagueis muses about Vitiate's accomplishments during the Muun Sith Lord's own research on immortality. The Emperor's fate was expanded on in the 2014 Digital Expansion Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan', which reveals that the returned Revan seeks to destroy the Emperor. The expansion's storyline on the moon of Yavin 4 deals with the joint Imperial and Republic efforts to stop Revan from resurrecting the Emperor, as they believe he will be unable to kill the restored Sith ruler, and the expansion ends with the Emperor vanishing from Yavin 4 after regaining his strength. The Emperor's story is continued in Game Update 3.2: Rise of the Emperor, which sees him possess the population of Ziost and ultimately eradicate all life on the world, and the Digital Expansion Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire introduces the Valkorion form and the Eternal Empire, with Valkorion becoming a major character as he enters the player's mind."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cut content"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several Codex entries within The Old Republic were present in the beta release of the game, but were cut for unknown reasons.
