It was incapable of supporting life, but the moon was mined for ores and minerals during the height of the Galactic Republic by the Sullustans. The mines finally played out approximately a thousand years before the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War; as a result, the facilities were then abandoned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
