According to Kaliyo Djannis, an ex-associate of Rholl, Rholl was a pirate with a bad temper who hijacked Galactic Republic supply ships. They were apparently close and he considered her somewhat like a daughter but they had a falling out when Kaliyo wanted a bigger cut and tried to steal from him. Kaliyo tried to kill him but only managed to break his arm. Years later, Kaliyo made him a target of Imperial Intelligence and had Cipher Nine kill him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
