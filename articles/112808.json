Its members wore a red sash to distinguish them from their major rivals, the Gold Faction, and its leader was given his or her own private box at the Korsinata. In 3961 BBY, the Reds and their rivals were forced to work together to elect a new Grand Lord for the Tribe. Unable to agree on a suitable Grand Lord, the Red and Gold factions compromised on High Lord Lillia Venn, the eldest of the High Lords. As of 3960 BBY, High Lord Dernas led the faction, though he was killed after participating in a conspiracy to assassinate Grand Lord Venn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
