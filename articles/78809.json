During the Galactic Civil War, he saved Admiral Hiram Drayson during an Galactic Empire attack. Thus, he came under the service of Admiral Drayson, and went on to serve as his chief aide. During the Siege of Coruscant, Leia tried to contact him to warn the officers that Garm Bel Iblis had identified the point in space where Grand Admiral Thrawn was about to bring two Victory-class Star Destroyers out of hyperspace. The lieutenant was unfortunately unavailable via comlink and the Imperial's tactic went unnoticed by the military commanders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
