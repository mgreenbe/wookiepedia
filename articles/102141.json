Saka used heirloom seeds from her family farm, heated them in an antique kettle to pop the grains, then blended them with imported spices that she gathered from other planets. Her signature seasoning blend created a mix that was salty, spicy, and sweet. Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs could not get Saka to reveal the secrets of her seasoning, but he would often buy bags of Outpost Mix when he was purchasing supplies from Saka."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This popcorn snack is found in the real world at Kat Saka's Kettle in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.
