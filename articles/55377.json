In his time, Bothawui was divided among the clans, and conflict was common. However, there were no domesticated animals that could carry the weapons of the Bothans, leading to ineffective warfare. Also, the Bothans had the tendency to destroy the object the rival clans were seeking. Golm thus wrote The Way, a publication detailing the Bothan Way\u2014that Bothans should put aside their differences, but in the attainment of power, anything\u2014save violent means\u2014was perfectly acceptable. While considered a hero by the Bothans, other races consider him the source of everything wrong with Bothan society."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
