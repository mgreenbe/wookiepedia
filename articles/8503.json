To this end, The Cell re-programmed Nirama's former protocol droid N3-A2, deceived Nirama's master of properties Jobril, and forged some proofs linking the loyal employees with The Cell. When Nirama went to Rothe Gate personally, The Cell tried to assassinate him there and then, and staged a distraction using N3-A2 as a walking bomb; Melast was personally involved in the customization of the droid. The attempted coup failed. Nirama discovered Melast's implication and ordered his right-hand man Len Markus to capture her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
