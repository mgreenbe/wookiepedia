B1 battle droids usually piloted these STAPs. STAPs utilized by the Trade Federation prior to the Clone Wars tended to be brown in color; Separatist STAPs were predominantly blue with white triangular markings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The STAP-1 was used for scouting and anti-personnel hunting operations, and would occasionally be used in open battle to harass enemy forces.

During the Battle of Teth, STAPs were utilized by the Separatist forces against the clone troopers and AT-TEs scaling the cliff wall. Anakin Skywalker managed to destroy all but one by knocking their droid pilots off, using the remaining STAP to reach the top of the cliff. STAPs were again utilized by the Separatists on Naboo during the Blue Shadow Virus crisis. A small force of three battle droids riding STAPs were escorting a tactical droid when the convoy was destroyed by Captain Typho, Chrin and another member of the Royal Naboo Security Forces. They were also deployed by the CIS during the Battle of Tirahnn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It later saw use during the Galactic Civil War when a small Jawa warlord named Wittin found a STAP and remote controlled B1 battle droid pilot.

In it, the heroes travel through a dense jungle planet on \"jet-sticks.\" This idea would go unexplored for over two decades before resurfacing in the revised rough draft of Episode I. In this version, the battle droids are said to ride STAPS, or Single Troop Armed Pogo Sticks. In developing the look of the STAP, Design Director Doug Chiang experimented with heavier versions of the vehicle, which appeared more like the speeder bikes from Return of the Jedi. Ultimately, he borrowed the lightweight design of a hummingbird to establish the STAP's final look."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LEGO produced many sets including the STAP.

The third was from the set \"7675 AT-TE Walker\" which was based on the scene during the Battle of Teth. The fourth was the promotional UK set \"30004 Battle Droid on STAP\", in which the design's basis was from the third, and the fifth is in the 2011 set \"7868 Mace Windu's Jedi Starfighter\" which includes the third's design for the STAP."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some sources released around the time of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace said that organic beings could not use STAPs due to the radiation from the thrusters at leg-level, but this has apparently been retconned with several sources since presenting organics using STAPs with no adverse effects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack, STAPs serve as the \"strike mech\" unit for the Trade Federation.
