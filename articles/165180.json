Exterminated by carnivorous worms that served as the second security measure, these worms destroyed the X'Ting hive, leaving no information on the other security systems. Around one hundred fifty years before the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Yoda traveled to Ord Cestus and saved the native X'Ting from disaster, to which they honored Yoda by building a giant statue of him, at least 70 meters tall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his guide, Jesson Di Blinth, learned that the correct entrance went through the largest of the statues, that of Jedi Master Yoda."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
