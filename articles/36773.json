Its local day was 22 standard hours long; its year was 285 local days long. It was a trading hub of the Outer Rim settled by a consortium of Galactic Core businesses. With the beginning of the Galactic Civil War, the planet lost its importance, becoming a backwater. It became the headquarters of the Glasfir Ring, which took over the local underworld, eliminating Hutt competition. The local government was coerced by Glasfir'a'lik to leave the crime ring alone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
