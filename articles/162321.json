The Rogues were commanded overall by Rogue Leader, Colonel Tycho Celchu. 11 ABY saw Rogue Squadron assigned to hunt for the elusive pirate group known as the Invids, who managed to elude every New Republic attempt to capture them, leaving the Rogues with about a week of down time in between raids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When New Republic Intelligence received a tip that the Invids would be attacking the luxury liner Glitterstar near the moon Alakatha, the Rogues were ferried almost all of the way to Alakatha's star system aboard the MC80 Star Cruiser Home One. They finally entered the system using micro-jumps, and their X-wings went to ground on several large asteroids near the moon. When the modified bulk cruiser Booty Full arrived in-system and dispatched numerous ugly starfighters to attack the Glitterstar, Rogue Squadron intercepted and engaged them. Horn told Three Flight to pick their targets carefully, and after their enemies' ranks had been thinned considerably, Vurrulf covered Horn as the captain pursued and destroyed an ugly tri-fighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Booty Full quickly surrendered, and with all of the uglies defeated, Home One and two New Republic Victory-class Star Destroyers entered the system to collect both the Rogues and the defeated bulk cruiser.
