While the Kaminoans instilled uniformity in their clones, limiting the choices and individuality available to them, Alpha-\u00d82 was a case of a one percent failure rate in the Kaminoans' product. Of the hundred ARC troopers in his class, he alone was independent and free-thinking, rejecting the anonymity enforced on him, and internalizing no loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Like all aberrant clones\u2014which appeared in 3.5 percent of the general clone population\u2014Alpha-\u00d82 was put through reconditioning.

The Kaminoan handlers came to call him \"Spar.\" Alpha-\u00d82 developed a friendship with Mij Gilamar, one of the Mandalorian Cuy'val Dar trainers working as a doctor. Eight-and-a-half years after his cloning, when he was biologically seventeen years of age, Alpha-\u00d82 heard a mention of Jango Fett's exploits, which triggered a memory in him\u2014not of his own life, but of Fett's. Fett's memories returned to Alpha-\u00d82 in a rush; and, knowing that they would be reconditioned out of him, he prepared to make his escape from Kamino. Alpha-\u00d82 began faking insanity and headaches to meet with Gilamar. Gilamar eventually called in a favor with Jango Fett to smuggle Alpha-\u00d82 off Kamino in the hold of Fett's ship, Slave I.

He took to working odd jobs around the galaxy, particularly in the Outer Rim Territories, as he attempted to sort through his mental state. The man mostly took work as a bounty hunter, specializing in live captures. When Jango Fett was killed in the opening battle of the Clone Wars, Spar concluded that his purpose was to rebuild the Mandalorian Supercommandos. Spar traveled to the planet Mandalore, where he called for aid from the local police to form his new Mandalorian Protectors. Two hundred police came to him; among them were two constables of Mandalore named Fenn Shysa and Tobbi Dala, as well as twelve former members of the splinter Mandalorian faction, the Death Watch. A rumor spread across Mandalore that Spar was the son of Jango Fett who had come to rebuild the Mandalorians. He was opposed in this by Duchess Satine Kryze, leader of the pacifist New Mandalorians, who wished Mandalore to remain neutral in the Clone Wars. Spar won out over her faction due to her death in 20 BBY, however, and assumed the position of Mandalore, leader of the Mandalorians. He took the title \"Mandalore the Resurrector\" as a sign that the old traditions of the Mandalorians would hold dominant.

Recalling how Mandallian Giants had been used by the Mandalorians on the front lines of the New Sith Wars, as well as Fenn Shysa's encounter with the droid C-3PX, Spar also had the droid foundries of the Separatists produce a limited run of one thousand BL-series Battle Legionnaire droids. Spar and his Protectors fought the Jedi and Republic around the galaxy, including at New Holstice, Null, and Zaadja. Supercommando squads engaged in covert missions on behalf of the Separatists. Near the climax of the war, Spar and the Protectors helped the government of Mandalore capture the facilities of MandalMotors in the city of Keldabe for Separatist use.

Hoping a Fett could hold together the people of Mandalore, Shysa tried to convince Spar once again to return to his role. Spar allowed Shysa to float the idea that he was considering a return, but did not commit; he ultimately would refuse the position. The meeting ended with the arrival of ex-Jedi Bardan Jusik; Sull bore a grudge against Jedi and started an altercation, which Spar attempted to break up. Spar himself still held resentment for Jusik as a Jedi, however, and the two ARC troopers confronted Jusik and Fi as they were preparing to leave for Coruscant. Jusik put himself at their mercy, and after learning that he bore no more allegiance to the Jedi, Spar backed down, with Sull following suit. Having heard rumors that Jusik's friend, Kal Skirata, was in pursuit of a cure for the clones' rapid aging and shortened lifespan, Spar verified the story with Jusik. Jusik confirmed it, and Spar and Sull joined the other two to head to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Spar reunited with Gilimar and met with Skirata a month later on Coruscant. The ex-Mandalore agreed to join with Skirata in exchange for a share of whatever treatment they found.

He also wanted to free his daughter, Ruusaan, imprisoned in the Republic Detention Center in Pols Anaxes. It was to this mission that Spar was assigned, alongside Sull, Fi, and Jusik. After almost two months of preparation, the trio of clones infiltrated the center on Anaxes disguised in clone trooper armor, with Jusik as their supposed prisoner. They claimed to the camp commander that Jusik was there to identify Ruusaan, presenting false credentials to move her to Coruscant. Upon removing Ruusaan from her cell, the girl proved recalcitrant; Spar had to restrain her until Jusik administered a Force Stun. They were able to get her to their spacecraft and escape the planet. They rendezvoused with Skirata's adopted son, Ordo, on Coruscant, right in the middle of the Battle of Coruscant. Jusik was able to get Spar offworld in his Aggressor assault fighter, along with Sull; Ruusaan Skirata; ARC trooper Mereel; Uthan; and Jango Fett's sister, Arla\u2014the latter two of whom had been sprung from custody on Coruscant in the days prior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Spar refusing to return, Fenn Shysa succeeded him as Mandalore.

While there, Spar learned of Uthan's progress on her cure for rapid aging and volunteered to trial anything that she developed. Spar eventually disappeared into the Extrictarium Nebula. There, he succumbed to clone madness as his mind attempted to sort out the two sets of memories within it. Years later, Ailyn Vel found him within the nebula.

Spar's character description was brief, only detailing his biography up to his escape and ending with a note that Jango Fett might hunt down the rogue clone in the future. It was Abel G. Pe\u00f1a who retconned Spar in the 2005 Star Wars Insider article The History of the Mandalorians to explain a decades-old reference that, with the release of the prequel trilogy, was now a continuity error."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Marvel Star Wars comic Star Wars 68, published in 1983, told how the Mandalorians had fought in the Clone Wars. According to a story told by Fenn Shysa in the comic, Shysa and his friend, Tobbi Dala, had fought under Boba Fett, serving the Emperor to fight the Jedi. During this time, they had been ordered to capture Princess Leia. Most of these references became a problem with later revelations about the Clone Wars: Boba Fett was only ten to thirteen years old during the conflict, Leia was only born after their end, and the Emperor, Palpatine, had only been the Supreme Chancellor at the time. The latter two inconsistencies were solved by having the Mandalorians serve Palpatine in his persona of Darth Sidious and having them capture Leia's mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, instead. To solve the issue of Boba Fett's appearance, Pe\u00f1a had had the idea of Alpha-\u00d82 in mind for some time. When Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds was released, Pe\u00f1a realized that Spar could be fit into the role that he had planned. His retcon made Spar the leader of the Mandalorians in the time of the Clone Wars, and due to a rumor that he was the \"son of Jango Fett\", characters such as Shysa would think it had been Boba leading them. Pe\u00f1a also created Spar's clone name, Alpha-\u00d82. The use of the \"\u00d8\" was an instance of image association, a visual sign that set Spar apart and signaled that he was defective in some way. Due to a layout error in the printing of the article, Spar's image was mistakenly placed over a heading of Jango and Boba Fett. The large scar visible on Spar's face originated in an earlier draft of the article's description of Spar. The article did not give a timeframe for Spar's death; Pe\u00f1a estimates that it occurred between 7 and 11 ABY, after the Boba Fett: Death, Lies, & Treachery trade paperback."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New errors arrived with the release of the novel Legacy of the Force: Revelation by Karen Traviss. While earlier works had established Fenn Shysa as a follower of Spar who was mistaken about his identity, Revelation stated that Shysa was the leader behind Spar, using Spar as a figurehead Mandalore and claiming that he was Boba. Traviss's next novel, Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, radically altered Spar's story further. In the novel, Spar is said to have refused Shysa's request to be Mandalore. He never becomes Mandalore and never joins the Separatists; the novel ends with Shysa becoming what is said to be the first Mandalore since Jango Fett. This new version of events, however, has been an anomaly; later sources such as The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, The Essential Atlas, and Galaxy at War confirm that Spar was Mandalore, with the latter source specifically addressing the Shysa aspect as a rumor. Other errors have since occurred\u2014the sequel to Order 66, Imperial Commando: 501st, states Spar received inoculations for Separatist viruses, a statement made difficult by the fact that Spar deserted the Grand Army of the Republic before the Separatists ever went to war against the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
