Voxchips translated the intended speech of the droid from a binary language into a natural language, such as Galactic Basic Standard, which would then be emitted through the vocoder. Voxchips were neither vocoders, nor verbobrains, but were crucial to the utilization of both hardware items, especially in conjunction with each other."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
