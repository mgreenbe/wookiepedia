During the drought, the worst in what was then-recent memory, left moisture farmers with little water to harvest, worsening conditions on the poor, backwater world. In the midst of the drought, henchmen for the crime lord Jabba the Hutt collected a \"water tax\" on their master's behalf. Rumors stated that Jabba collected the water so he could take long baths because of the elongated heatwave. Former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi later wrote in his journal that he believed the rumors weren't true; stating that he had met Jabba and that he had never bathed in his life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
