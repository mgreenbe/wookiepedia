During that time, the Black Sun discovered that the Rebel Alliance was smuggling and hoarding a new kind of spice. Around 1 ABY, the Black Sun acquired a sample of this new spice after the smuggler Cal Handro crash-landed on Rori while transporting it. Tover Blackmoor analyzed the spice and discovered that it was nothing like any other spice available on the marker. The Black Sun leaders therefore decided to obtain more spice but they attracted the attention of a group of spacers who were looking for Cal Handro, the missing pilot. The spacers attacked the Black Sun bunker and eventually forced Blackmoor to reveal everything he knew about the pilot and the new spice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tover Blackmoor was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
