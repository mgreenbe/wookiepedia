After graduating from a technical school, he joined a private shipping corporation as an apprentice starship mechanic. In 0 ABY, at the age of twenty, he was Chief Engineer aboard the Colders Watch, a bulk freighter under the command of Captain Beezrul Granf. He was involved in a relationship with the ship's First Mate, Chessa Dohhenty; the two dreamed of settling down and sharing a peaceful life. Unbeknownst to Harkess, Dohhenty was also an agent of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. During a stop on the planet Kelada, a squad of stormtroopers confronted Dohhenty as she was unloading a smuggled cargo of blaster weaponry. Dohhenty opened fire on the stormtroopers, and they responded in kind, killing her. Harkness grabbed a blaster and began firing before fleeing the docking bay. He stumbled into Lorana's Labyrinth, where he met Dohhenty's Alliance contacts, General Halomar Corros and Captain Tony Franco. They recruited him in the Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harkness initially worked as a mechanic at Reginard Base, but he was restless and wanted revenge on the Galactic Empire. He soon left the base to kill Imperial officers and diplomats, but eventually rejoined the Alliance in Intelligence and commanded several intelligence missions. At the Battle of Endor, he was assigned as Chief Engineer on a capital ship in the Alliance Fleet. Following Endor, Harkness was assigned to the New Republic Intelligence Service with the commissioned rank of lieutenant. His tenure with the New Republic Intelligence Service lasted only a few weeks before he resigned.
