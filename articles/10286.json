Galactic Alliance Admiral Gar Stazi was seriously wounded by shipman Tealart, a Mon Calamari traitor, during the initial phase of the battle. The Alliance fleet eventually made their way to the Teraab sector where they were pursued by the Imperials, but managed to turn the tide of the battle in their favor as their enemies jumped out of hyperspace behind them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
