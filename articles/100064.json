It was well known as a place to go for luxury holidays. However, during the Clone Wars, the Metatheran Cartel freighter Porthoy landed in the city and the gas Trinex-M was released after an accident. It entered the city's air-circulation system and infected most of the population, giving them Force powers and driving them insane. However, the Heroes of Cularin were able to gain a sample of the gas; this was used to create a cure for it, which was given to the population."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
