However, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader soon arrived and assumed command of the commander's forces. Although the battle was won, Vader executed the commander for his incompetence in making sure that the Rebels were not alerted to the Empire's presence on the planet, which resulted in Vader's failure to find the traitor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male individual held the rank of the commander in the Imperial Army. At some point between 2 BBY and 0 BBY, it was discovered that a traitor was feeding the Rebel Alliance secret data concerning the latest Imperial project, the Death Star. It was soon revealed that a clue to the identity of that traitor could be obtained from a Rebel base located on the planet Thyferra. The commander was sent there to investigate. Before landing, the commander's forces jammed the Rebels' communications in order to take the enemy by surprise.

The Dark Lord soon arrived on Thyferra in his personal shuttle. The commander reported to Vader on the mission's progress, and Darth Vader, taking the commander's forces, went on to destroy the Rebel base and find the rogue Imperial, while the commander remained at Vader's shuttle. During the battle, however, Vader discovered that the Rebels had somehow been alerted to the Empire's presence. Despite the fact that the battle was won, the Dark Lord failed to find out who the traitor was. Vader confronted the commander near the shuttle and accused him of incompetence. The commander tried to explain that the traitor may have somehow been responsible for the Rebels' state of alert. Before he could finish, Vader used the Force to choke him to death. The commander's failure, however, was only a minor setback for Vader.
