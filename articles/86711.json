Marden served aboard Vance's YT-2400 light freighter Blackstar and accompanied the starship when it traveled to salvage a derelict ship in the Unknown Regions. Rival salvagers Khedryn Faal and Marr Idi-Shael also planned to salvage the derelict and after Vance boarded the pair's starship and found it to be empty, he suspected that Faal and Idi-Shael had abandoned their vessel so that they could steal the derelict. To prevent them from seizing the derelict, Vance ordered Marden to disable the derelict's engines. Marden then fired upon the derelict with the Blackstars cannons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marden was created by the writer Paul S.
