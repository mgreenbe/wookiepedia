He never killed any passengers on board, though he did feed lightly on some of them, instead taking his major \"meals\" from residents of the planets the ship visited. The Pride was known to have made at least four stops in different systems with the Force Vampire on board. The ship was headed for the planet Coruscul when a team of investigators boarded it looking for the murderer of the Vampire's previous victims."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
