The governor was held in a make-shift brig of an airlock in section 10 of the company's CR90 corvette Thunderstrike. After a rebel recruit from the planet attempted to visit Chalis holding a galley knife, Namir made sure there was a guard at Chalis's cell, with Maediyu being assigned to this post three days after Twilight Company's departure from Haidoral Prime."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Maediyu was posted at the cell, the Thunderstrike, and its escort the Braha'tok-class gunship Apailana's Promise, engaged in a battle with an Imperial reconnaissance squadron.

Sergeant Fektrin attempted to contact Maediyu, but was unsuccessful, and so Namir rushed to the airlock. The first sergeant found Maediyu and pulled her into the make-shift brig, sealing the door.
