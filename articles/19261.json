During the war, Boost served in the siege of Hisseen, and the Wolfpack was later sent to hunt down and destroy the mysterious Separatist superweapon, Malevolence, which had been destroying entire Republic fleets without leaving any survivors. When they finally confronted the Malevolence in the Abregado system, the Separatist starship used its ion cannons to cripple Plo Koon's fleet, and then destroyed the Star Destroyers.

Plo-Koon told Sinker and Boost they were not expendable to him despite being clones, and then guided Tano to he and the clones location using the Force. The four survivors were brought onboard the Twilight where the medical droid TB-2 examined them.

After Boost blasted his way into the station, R2 successfully started the download and the troopers left him to, returning to help Wolffe and the other clones in aiding the Aleena native to Aleen.

Traveling onboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Triumphant along with a fleet of two other Venator-class Star Destroyers, they discovered the weapon, a Subjugator-class heavy cruiser named Malevolence, in the Abregado system. After Plo-Koon contacted the Skywalker's fleet and informed him of the location of the Malevolence, the Separatists blocked the Triumphant's communications, and opened fire with the Malevolence's ion cannon, which crippled the three Republic Star Destroyers and left them defenseless. Knowing the Triumphant would not last long under fire without its shields, Plo ordered that all personnel onboard evacuate in the ship's escape pods.

Plo Koon ordered that the clones try and repair the power systems, which Sinker began doing while Boost watched. The air in the ship quickly became stale, and Boost and Sinker began bickering over the cause of the smell until Wolffe interrupted by asking what Master Plo truly thought their chances were. After the Jedi Master reassured them that someone would come for them, Sinker pointed out that a rescue mission would not make sense. The four then spotted a second escape pod through their viewport, which Plo-Koon span using the Force so that they could see inside. The clones were horrified to see their comrades on board the other pod were dead, as the viewport had been cut open to expose the occupants to the vacuum of space. The clones returned to their repairs, and after more bickering, Boost and Sinker finally managed to return some power to the pod. As the communications systems reactivated, the four survivors were contacted by Pod 1977, another pod of clones who had survived the attack by the Malevolence, but were now being attacked by a Separatist vessel. After Wolffe spotted the other pod, he, Boost, Sinker and Plo could do nothing by watch in horror as rocket battle droids cut open Pod 1977, killing all inside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After finishing their work on 1977, the droids quickly spotted the pod containing Boost and his comrades and the Separatist boarding craft was soon headed their way.

Boost and Sinker obeyed and exited the escape pod with Plo, while Wolffe remained inside to monitor the communications in hope of rescue. As Boost and Sinker opened fire on the Separatists, Plo used the Force to push some of them away into space. Just at the Separatist vessel began to crush the escape pod with its attachment arms, Wolffe picked up communications from Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who had traveled to the Abreadgo system in the G9 Rigger-class light freighter Twilight looking for survivors. As Wolffe tried to make contact, Plo launched Sinker into space using the force and maneuvered him behind the Separatist vessel, allowing him shoot down the droids that had been taking cover behind it.

As Plo reassured Sinker that clones were not as expendable as he believed, the Twilight arrived and pulled the survivor's pod aboard with a tow cable. Once onboard, the clones and Plo collapsed, and were examined by Skywalker's medical droid TB-2 who declared that they would need to recover on a medical frigate after he stabilized them. Skywalker informed Plo that they had found no other survivors, making Wolffe, Sinker and Boost the last surviving members of the Wolfpack. As the Twilight made to leave the Abraedgo system, the Malevolence approached again and Plo demanded that Skywalker cut all power to the freighter to avoid detection. Realizing the lights had gone out, Boost, Sinker and Wolffe attempted to head to the bridge to find out what was wrong, but TB-2 stopped them and went in their place. Realizing that the medical droid still had power, the three Jedi quickly learned they had been detected and switched the power back on, sending TB-2 back to the clones. The Malevolence then fired its ion cannon, but the Twilight was able to outrun it and then jump to hyperspace, escaping the Separatists. Skywalker and Tano safely delivered their four passengers to Skywalker's flagship, the Resolute.

The Republic forces attacked a recently reinforced Separatist outpost, splitting into three groups for the assault. Boost, Sinker, Comet and several other members of the Wolfpack split off with Tano and scaled the side of the outposts walls using grappling hooks, after shooting down the B1-series battle droid sentries stationed there. All of the clones successfully made it over the wall and began their attack, but before Tano could scale the wall herself she was stunned and captured by the Trandoshan hunter Lo-Taren. The Republic forces quickly destroyed the Separatist forces holding the outpost, not realizing Tano was gone until the battle was over. Skywalker then ordered Boost and the other clones to spread out and look for his missing Padawan, but to no avail. After dozens of unsuccessful sweeps of the area in search of Tano, Koon eventually persuaded Skywalker to stop looking, promising that alerts had been sent out and the missing Jedi would be found soon. Tano, who had been taken to the moon of Wasskah to be hunted for sport by the Trandoshans, eventually escaped with the aid of the several Wookiees and returned to the Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Aleen"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While traveling in an Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ship to the Qiilura system to block Separatist transmissions, the Wolfpack were diverted to provide aid to the inhabitants of the planet Aleen, which had been devastated by earthquakes. Finding that thousands of the native Aleena had survived, the clones were tasked with helping to start the rebuilding process and then returning to the war. Sinker and Boost traveled to the planet's surface onboard one of the Plo's Bros Low Altitude Assault Transports/infantry which was piloted by the clone trooper pilot Warthog and also carried several other clones, crates of supplies and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. After disembarking, the Republic forces were greeted by the Aleena but quickly experienced an aftershock from the quakes.

Boost made to shoot through the rubble with his blaster, but was stopped by Sinker who thought the shooting might cause the station to collapse. Unperturbed, Boost blasted the rubble apart, greatly impressing the Aleena present. Inside the station, Sinker had R2 scan the building to check it was safe, and then had the droid activate the computer and begin the download. After another small aftershock hit the station, Sinker reported into Wolffe that the download was underway and the Commander ordered Sinker, Boost and the rest of the clones to return to aiding the Aleena, leaving R2 to complete the download. On the way out the station, Sinker barged into C-3PO, who Boost ordered out of the way as the droid tried to pass. C-3PO and R2 were then guided by the Aleena to an opening into into Aleen's underground, which C-3PO fell into during a quake, causing R2 to follow. In the underground they encountered the Kindalo species and the being Orphne, who revealed that they had caused the quakes because a breach had opened between the underground and the surface, releasing air toxic to the Kindalo into the underground. Realizing that the opening they had entered the underground through was the breach, R2 and C-3PO sealed the opening and restore the balance on Aleen, ending the earthquakes.
