The native Koban people rebuilt the bridge and through it memorialized the Jedi Master, whose likeness was carved into the structure. The bridge was damaged when Tulak's son, Kalut attempted to reclaim the planet in the name of his father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
