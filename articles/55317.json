As with many other dark side devices, it emitted a dark presence in the Force. Though no more than four meters when measured from the outside, its size within was infinite, allowing it to hold a large amount of captives. Within the Golden Globe was a realm filled with sand and dust."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Golden Globe was protected by a powerful energy shield which threw back anyone who attempted to touch it. The only way to break through this field was to weaken it with the Force.

Ikrit realized he was not able to free the imprisoned souls and placed himself in a Jedi trance to await the arrival of the one who would break the curse, even if it took centuries. Centuries later, in 22 ABY, Jedi trainees Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila discovered the Golden Globe and Ikrit. Ikrit then revealed his identity to the two young Jedi trainees and also informed them of the origins of the Golden Globe. He believed that the pair could succeed where he had failed long before."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Anakin and Tahiri traveled to nearby Yavin 8 where they discovered carvings deep within the caves on the moon that informed them that Massassi children were imprisoned within the Golden Globe by Exar Kun.

Having broken past the energy field, they fought past a whirlwind of sand and dust within the realm before using their powers to break the energy field from inside, freeing the trapped souls and destroying the Golden Globe for all time. Having emerged from the Palace of the Woolamander, they were greeted by a pleased Master Luke Skywalker and Ikrit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
