It was the Confederacy of Independent Systems' first capital and hosted its major battle droid foundries. It was the site of the First Battle of Geonosis, the opening conflict of the Clone Wars, as well as the subsequent invasion by the Galactic Republic. During and after the war, the Death Star was constructed above the planet. Five years after the conflict's conclusion and transformation of the Galactic Republic, the Galactic Empire would garrison the planet heavily and attempt to mine the planet's asteroids for minerals. At least five years after the Clone Wars, the Empire moved the Death Star to another construction site and the planet was sterilized by the Empire as a security measure, an act which resulted in the virtual elimination of the planet's native population."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Situated in the Geonosis system of the Arkanis sector in the Outer Rim Territories, the planet of Geonosis was 43,000 light years from the Galactic Core, and less than a parsec away from the neighboring Outer Rim planet of Tatooine. It was the homeworld of the Geonosians, a species of sentient insectoids. It had a breathable atmosphere, but a hot and arid climate. Its irradiated surface was covered in harsh, rocky deserts, marked by mesas and buttes. Both its rocks and sky were tinted in shades of red. Surface water was scarce, amounting to only 5% of the entire total planetary surface. However, Geonosis had frequent flash floods. From space, it could be seen that Geonosis had awe-inspiring rocky rings.

When the Galactic Republic made first contact with the Geonosians, it was successful and beneficial to both groups. Due to this, the Geonosians became interested with Republic technology and became skilled in adapting and improving advanced technology. As such, Geonosians exported droids and other technology to the rest of the galaxy, although this didn't last long. Once Tatooine was almost abandoned by the first wave of colonizers, Geonosis suffered from its distance from the Core Worlds as visitors to the planet grew smaller and smaller until visitors stopped traveling to Geonosis altogether. Geonosian exports were more easily met by other manufacturers closer to the Core."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Geonosians became split over the idea of working with offworlders, and with the planet's economy in ruins, wars erupted throughout the planet for millennia, while the rest of the galaxy largely forgot the planet and left it to its endless wars.

During that time, Geonosis built droid armies for large corporations such as the Trade Federation. Ten years after the election of Sheev Palpatine as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, the Archduke of Geonosis, Poggle the Lesser, hosted a summit of the heads of the Confederacy.

Having been knocked unconscious and captured, the Jedi Master was taken before Karina. Jedi Kenobi and Skywalker came to her rescue; they were not far off when Luminara regained consciousness and wrestled her way out of the zombies' reach. Realizing what they were up against, she contacted Kenobi to warn him not to come after her, but was cut off as the zombies overwhelmed her. The Jedi disregarded her warnings and continued their search until they came upon Karina's abode, where they found Luminara in an energy trap for her to be infested with brain worms.
