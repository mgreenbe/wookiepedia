It contained hundreds of capital ships (although none of them were the size of the Galactic-class battle carrier) and at least a dozen starfighter squadrons. Most of the ships were built by Corellian Engineering Corporation and had green running lights. The capital ships included Strident-class Star Defenders, EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates, corvettes, patrol boats, gunships, and heavy transports; the starfighters included A-9 Vigilance interceptors, A-10 interceptors, I-7 Howlrunners, YT-5100 Shriek-class bombers, Corellian attack fighters, and various TIE series fighters. Units of the fleet included Panther Flight and Nebula Flight. Many of the ships were little more than wrecks designed to intimidate and confuse, distracting from the truly operational ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Second Galactic Civil War, the fleet consisted of two parts. The second fleet was secretly being constructed at the Kiris shipyards, and was designed to provide Corellia with a force capable of assaulting enemy planets. Thrackan Sal-Solo and his political allies were the impetus for this fleet, and it began construction at least as early as 30 ABY, even before Sal-Solo was Minister of War. It was over a year before Five World Prime Minister Aidel Saxan learned of its existence from her own spies. The cornerstone of the secret fleet were the three Corellian Dreadnaughts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
