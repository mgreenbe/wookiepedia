Gravitational curves intersected through the star, creating a convergence of mass shadows and placing the star under great stress. The gravitational curves were not uniform, and the intersecting stresses would force a portion of the star to explode into realspace, releasing high-energy plasma. It caused immense disturbances throughout a local area of hyperspace, stretching the walls between dimensions and disrupting subspace communications."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
