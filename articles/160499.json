They were typical protocol bipedal units equipped with walking, running, and jumping ability. They were made of copper, titanium and high-carbon steel, which allowed them to be magnetic. They had medium-to-low material durability. The Versatile Humanoid Biped Units were designed by Cybot Galactica and were part of the famous 3PO-series, and presumably others like 3PX-series or TC-series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
