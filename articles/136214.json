A trade dispute soon developed between the megacorperation, the Trade Federation and the Republic, resulting in the blockade of Naboo, and the Invasion of Naboo shortly thereafter. While Theed, the capital city of Naboo was occupied, several students from Naboo's Royal House of Learning joined the Naboo Underground, becoming well known amongst the resistance for their exploits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While recuperating from a previous mission, Naboo Underground leader Lucos Dannt introduced the students to Lialla Tane, a resistance operative. Tane explained that she had heard of the students' exploits, and requested their help. She had learned that her parents, Minister of Culture Kyu Tane and his wife, were being held by the Trade Federation in a prison camp on the Street of Glory very near Theed Royal Palace. Tane was concerned for the health of her parents, since the Trade Federation wasn't feeding any of their prisoners. Tane, who had was to participate in another mission, asked the students free her parents. She provided as much information as was available the opposition the team would face, including the presence of a B1-Series battle droid patrol in the area. She advised the team that the prison consisted of unbreakable portable energy walls, and that a pair of Neimoidians overseeing the facility were able to deactivate an energy gate with a keypad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The students arrived on the Street of Glory outside of the prison. They approached and negotiated with the Neimoidian overseers, who easily parted with the gate code, before turning their attention to the pair of Security Droids guarding the gate. After dispatching the droid guards, the students opened the prison. The cell itself housed the Tane family, four Naboo citizens, and one wounded Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps pilot. All of the prisoners were skeptical of their rescuers, and only the Tane family initially agreed to escape. A patrol of four battle droids arrived at the scene, alerted by the Neimoidians, and the students were forced to defeat the patrol before the remaining prisoners were convinced they could be kept safe during the escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The students escorted the prisoners back to the Naboo Underground, reuniting Lialla and a number of other Underground operatives with their families."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This article is based on Adventure 3: Rescue, a pre-packaged adventure included in the Star Wars: Invasion of Theed Adventure Game, designed for streamlined play. The game set includes eight playable playable characters, although the adventures are designed for four."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The actual adventure can play out in a number of ways. Instead of attempting to bribe the Neimoidian overseers, the players can attempt to intimidate them, or can simply defeat them in battle. If the players do not obtain the gate code from the Neimoidians, they can attempt to disable the lock physically, or slice the lock's computer to obtain the password. The rescue of Lialla's parents is the only goal required to successfully complete the mission, however, the players earn experience for each additional prisoner rescued."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
