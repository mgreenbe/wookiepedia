At some point between 0 BBY and 1 ABY, it was captained by a man named Kazan and stationed at an Alliance base that was hidden in an asteroid field. When the Rebel-allied smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca left the base to retrieve a mystical artifact known as the Talisman, Kazan recorded a starlog journal entry about their mission from the RS Revenge's bridge. His entry, which mentioned the cruiser by name, was later used as narration for a cartoon created about the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The RS Revenge's only mention in Star Wars canon is in The Story of the Faithful Wookiee, a cartoon written by George Lucas and produced by Nelvana Studios.
