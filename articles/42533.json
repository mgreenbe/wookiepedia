Made with a cortosis weave, the blade of this melee weapon was resistant to lightsaber strikes, which enabled them to be used against Force-users. In addition to this, they were sometimes supercooled during production in order to maintain alignment. This had the added effect of giving an icy sting to those struck by this weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
