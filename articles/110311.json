He was one of the units in the line of battle droids that were controlled by a Central Control Computer, a model which was considered old by 22 BBY. That year, the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth, and RB-551 was among the battle droids that participated in the battle. At some point of the conflict, he was destroyed near the city of Cazne, the site of a major battle between the Confederacy and the Twi'lek freedom fighters led by Cham Syndulla. His remains were later found by a group of newer, independent-thinking model battle droids that were on the lookout for a missing patrol in that region. The droids reflected on RB-551's dependency on a central computer, believing themselves to be superior to him; however, they were destroyed immediately thereafter by Syndulla and his freedom fighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "RB-551 was programmed by a central computer, which limited his independent thinking.
