Lord Vader counters that mind tricks are not the way of the Sith and that the Jedi are long gone. Jabba tries to intimidate the Sith Lord by telling him that the rebels and \"darker factions\" have imposed a bounty. Jabba warns that if he is not careful, he can make him \"disappear\", hinting at the controls to the rancor pit below. Jabba asks the Sith Lord if he is brave or foolish, but Vader throws the question back at him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jabba, remarking that the Jedi are always making things so difficult, summons his entourage who converge on Lord Vader.

With the Empire besieged, the Emperor blames Lord Vader for the recent disasters. He is angry that Vader tagged the rebel ship with a homing beacon and allowed the rebels to escape with the Death Star plans deliberately.
