Soon after, he decided to rescue Grogu, which resulted in a firefight between him and stormtroopers in their facility. After Din Djarin escaped the facility, members of the Bounty Hunters' Guild led by Greef Karga confronted him. Neither intending to relinquish, a skirmish broke out between Din Djarin and the other bounty hunters, Din killing several bounty hunters with his Amban phase-pulse blaster. Eventually, the Mandalorian group known as the Tribe joined the battle and helped the Mandalorian escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
