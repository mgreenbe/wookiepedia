When the First Order attacked the iron planet Demir, with Phasma leading the assault, KM-8713 participated on the battlefield. KM-8713 was promoted to the military rank of lieutenant by Phasma, who saw KM-8713's ambition. KM-8713 eventually realized Phasma's willingness to expend soldiers, and declared her superior a traitor. KM-8713 would meet her demise attempting to kill Phasma and earn a name for herself, only to be killed by her commander instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
