It boasted an old ion engine capable of reaching speeds of 800 km/h in atmosphere. Its hyperdrive had also been upgraded to a Class 1.0 speed. The backup hyperdrive remained the stock Class 15.0. It had been upgraded to support a deflector shield and was protected by a single turreted heavy blaster cannon. It only required a single crewmember to fly and could carry up to four passengers and had consumables good for a single month. Its cargo bays were slightly smaller then a stock ship due to the added weapons and shield at only 75 metric tons. It came equipped with sensor arrays, lifesupport, and a navicomputer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Close inspection of the ship revealed that its hull had undergone a lot of stress in the past and that the ion drive was worn and needed to be replaced.
