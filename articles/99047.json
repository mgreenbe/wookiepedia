Telira"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "O.S.S. Telira was a CR90 corvette owned and captained by Osman Shrier, who operated it as a passenger liner. It traveled along a ten-day route that included Elshandruu Pica, the capital of Parmel sector and the Quence sector in general. Although the O.S.S. Telira's less-than-satisfactory accommodations and service garnered it a three-star rating from critics, its staff were reputed to be friendly and helpful. Additionally, Shrier's charismatic demeanor and clownish appearance won the O.S.S. Telira a number of return customers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
