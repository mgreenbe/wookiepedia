Around 9 ABY, the former Jedi Ahsoka Tano could be found on the planet, a fact known to an old ally of Tano, the Mandalorian Bo-Katan Kryze. After seizing an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser on the estuary moon Trask, Kryze told the Child of the Watch Din Djarin to seek Tano out on Corvus and bring to her Grogu, a powerful Force-sensitive infant. Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth, the leader of Calodan, gave Din Djarin the task of killing Tano, who had been giving her problems. Eventually Djarin met up with Tano, and after a short fight in the woods they united to take Calodan. Tano defeated Elsbeth in a duel and control of the city went to Governor Wing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corvus was first mentioned in the third episode of the second season of The Mandalorian, a Disney+ television series.
