During the Iron Blockade of the Anoat sector it was inhabited by miners and their families; however, it became overrun with hostile droids. Aid workers were sent to provide relief aid to the families, and a mercenary helped forge a path for the workers in return for payment in chromium from the miners. The criminal Trade Spine League owned a storage cave within the district; however, it became overrun with vermin during the blockade. In order to retrieve the goods in the cave, the League put out a request for someone to sneak into the cave and reset the perimeter defense systems to clear the cave out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
