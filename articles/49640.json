Operating from a secret base on the planet Talus, the Followers of Baba raided a number of local towns over a period of several weeks. The Corellian Security Force, a law enforcement agency, decided that if it got directly involved in stopping the Follows' attacks, it would just worsen the situation, so instead, the CorSec agent Mark Hieks hired a spacer to take out Baba. The spacer encountered the Followers during an attack that they had launched on a town, and the individual captured Baba and handed him over to CorSec."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Followers of Baba also recruited several Lost Aqualish outriders to act as scouts and snipers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
