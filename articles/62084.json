It could change the appearance of anyone who used it, even compensating for physical differences between the subject through use of advanced sensors that holographically filled in the differences. One downside of the matrix was its shortcomings in power supply. Another problem was, despite the advanced holography, the image consistency was not perfect. It was created by a Snivvian technical expert and bounty hunter named Sinrich. These devices were subsequently used on a bounty hunting mission led by Cad Bane to kidnap the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, Sheev Palpatine. The disguises were also used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems after taking control of a Venator-class Star Destroyer to destroy the space station Valor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A modified version of the disguise matrix, the holographic cloaking unit, allowed users to appear practically invisible, and was used by thieves attempting to make off with artifacts from the Imperial Museum on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, the assassin Rukh used a Sinrich optical dephaser that was similar to the disguise matrix."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years after the Battle of Endor, a matrix was in the hands of droidsmith Babu Frik.
