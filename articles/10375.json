During the attacks the Partisans scored a number of victories against Imperial storehouses, convoys and inspection stations, leaving no survivors. Sometime after, Cynabar's InfoNet reported on the attacks, stating that they had been making life miserable for the territorial moff and that it was a rare display of ruthlessness from the growing anti-Empire resistance. Cynabar added that after the attacks, the bounty on Gerrera's head was likely to increase, so hunters willing to wait longer would get a bigger payout."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
