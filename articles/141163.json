Despite fruitless attempts to make peace with the natives, Kaa stayed true to his peaceful ideals and jettisoned an escape pod with his people, so the Amani could claim the ship like they wanted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a while, the Lurmen gathered up giant pods from the local trees and fashioned a village out of them. There Kaa and his people lived in relative peace until approached by General Aayla Secura, Commander Ahsoka Tano and Commander Bly after their crash landing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He initially refused to help General Anakin Skywalker due to his belief that the Jedi were perpetuators of the war, because they continued to fight in it. Eventually, Secura wore him down and he agreed to sent his son and healer Wag Too to help them, although she had to remain behind as collateral. Through a series of conversations with the Jedi Knight, the two became amiable and began to come to an understanding with each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much to the frustration of Ahsoka and Rex, Tee Watt Kaa refused to allow his people to form a resistance against a Separatist invasion force, even when the Separatists intended to exterminate them as a means to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new weapon. Tee Watt Kaa would not be convinced otherwise, as he was prepared to turn himself and his entire species into martyrs and victims of genocide just to prove his point. Although Ahsoka was reluctant to aid a people who she viewed as lacking in courage or the common sense to accept help, Anakin and Aayla were adamant about preventing the annihilation of innocents, regardless of their personal beliefs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Separatists attacked the village, the Jedi and clone troopers engaged them in battle. During the battle, Wag Too couldn't stand by any longer and, to his father's dismay, led a force of Lurmen into the battle. The Jedi and Lurmen successfully drove the Separatists off. Although Tee Watt Kaa did manage to display his gratitude for the survival of his people, he nevertheless wondered what the price was for Republic assistance. Seconds after he voiced this, three Venator-class Star Destroyers entered the Maridun world's atmosphere - a symbol of the dreaded Galactic Empire soon to come."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tee Watt Kaa was extremely devoted to the traditions of his people and a strict pacifist. He cared greatly for such ideals, and firmly believed the Republic was no better than the Separatists because the two were equally responsible for the war. He also believed because the Jedi fought and killed others they could not be called peacekeepers. As far as he was concerned his people would rather die than engage in battle and he thought that if they sacrificed their beliefs they were no better than the Separatists or the Republic. Wag Too rebelled against him in order to protect his home despite his father forbidding him to fight the Separatists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tee Watt Kaa could also be sarcastic at times, telling Lok Durd that his village was \"an obvious threat\" when it clearly wasn't. He was also indifferent to the Jedi and it was only after the Separatists were defeated that he finally admitted that he owed them thanks. But even then, he still wondered, \"At what cost?\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
