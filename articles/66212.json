At one point Solo saved Imra by pulling an Imperial Star Destroyer off her tail and got himself raided in the process, earning a favor from her. Sometime after the Battle of Endor, Imra contacted via hologram Solo onboard the Millennium Falcon while he was looking into rumors that the Empire was trying to organize new supply lines through some of the criminal organizations it was allied with. Solo and Chewbacca were pleased to see their old acquaintance, who mocked Solo about his age and his abandonment of a rogue's lifestyle in order to settle down with Princess Leia Organa. She then told the pair that there was a very brief window of opportunity to liberate Chewbacca's homeworld Kashyyyk from Imperial control. The normally constant heavy Imperial presence on Kashyyyk was going to lessen for a short period, as several starships left to provide support elsewhere. The details she had were fuzzy, but she explained they would have to act within the next day or not at all. Solo initially rejected the idea as he already had a commitment to the Republic's mission, but he swiftly changed his mind and called in his favor with Imra to have her contact anyone she could think of that might be able to help in the liberation. He asked Chewbacca to contact any Wookiee refugees that he new of who would want to help and told everyone to meet at Warrin Station as soon as possible. Imra then broke off contact with Solo and Chewbacca, who set a course for the space station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imra first appeared as a hologram in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
