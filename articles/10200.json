The simultaneous deaths of so many Jedi affected Grand Master Satele Shan greatly, and the Republic dispatched the patrol frigate Toron Voq to Rhinnal in order to investigate when the Enclave did not respond to communications. The Toron Voq discovered the Red Reaper in the process of massacring the enclave, and it was barely able to send an image of the attacker before it was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
