With a Klorri-clan battle shield in hand, Grakchawwaa stood alongside Jedi General Luminara Unduli and the Republic clone troopers under her command in the final moments of the Clone Wars, surveying the Kashyyyk tree-city of Kachirho's beach as Separatist forces moved to mount an amphibious assault there. While the natives and Republic forces prepared to repel the Separatists, Wookiee warriors from across the planet Kashyyyk flocked to Kachirho because of its strategical importance in the region."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Separatist Alliance lost the resulting Battle of Kachirho, although the clone troopers turned on their Jedi commanders during the battle in response to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's Order 66 command; in the Kachirho settlement, Palpatine's troopers captured Luminara Unduli and attempted to kill Jedi Grand Master Yoda, a respected figure amongst Wookiees. With allies becoming foes, the Wookiees were then targeted by clones serving Palpatine's Galactic Empire, a regime that replaced the Republic soon after the issuance of Order 66 and went on to enslave the Wookiees of Kashyyyk, including warriors such as Alrrark who fought alongside Grakchawwaa, until the world was liberated by New Republic forces in 5 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grakchawwaa was a male Wookiee who sported predominantly light brown hair, although there were some patches of dark brown hair on his limbs.

In the new Star Wars canon, the name \"Grakchawwaa\" was first mentioned in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, with a 2018 card from Star Wars: Card Trader attributing the name to the Revenge of the Sith Wookiee that was established to be Grakchawwaa in the Star Wars Legends continuity."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Revenge of the Sith"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grakchawwaa was one of eight Wookiees to have a practical costume in the production of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. The eight costumes were constructed by Industrial Light & Magic's creature department for the film, a task Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels describes to be the most difficult for the department. While Chewbacca was portrayed by actor Peter Mayhew during the production of Revenge of the Sith in Sydney, Australia, each of the remaining seven costumes were worn by local extras, which included several basketball players and a corrections officer. The film's credits do not state which person played which Wookiee, but other official sources have connected four of the extras to their respective roles. Grakchawwaa is not one of those roles, but process of elimination reveals that the character was played by either Steven Foy, James Rowland, or Julian Khazzouh, and was either Wookiee #1, 2, or 6 in the production of Revenge of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each Wookiee extra had a full body and head cast made for use in a fitted fiberglass muscle suit that was then covered in an elastic material knitted with modacrylic hair. Scenes of Wookiees preparing for battle and battling on Kashyyyk in Revenge of the Sith were filmed against a bluescreen on Stage 2 at Fox Studios in Sydney, with the shots, excluding those of Chewbacca and Tarfful, being taken with a single camera on May 17, 2004. The shoots were directed by Industrial Light & Magic's Rob Coleman, who had met with film director George Lucas a week prior to discuss the Wookiees' hero shots. When Coleman directed the Wookiee extras, he stated that their characters were senior Wookiee leaders, and that Chewbacca was significantly younger than them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grakchawwaa appears twice in a tracking shot of Revenge of the Sith. Earlier in the shot set on Kashyyyk, a part of Grakchawwaa's body is visible to the right of the screen, holding a long-gun and conversing with Lachichuk as clone troopers ran by the pair of Wookiees. Later in the shot, Grakchawwaa is fully visible to the left of the screen, holding a shield next to Luminara Unduli. For another scene, when the Wookiees charge towards the Separatists at the beach, Grakchawwaa and four other Wookiee characters were filmed repeatedly rushing over a barrier. Each time the scene was filmed, the Wookiees took new positions and carried different weapons and accessories. The shots for the Wookiee charge were then digitally combined to fill out the front row of the Wookiee army, and the Wookiees were afterward digitally duplicated so as to present dozens of additional warriors standing behind them and participating in the beachfront battle. The multiple Grakchawwaa costumes in the final cut of the film held either a long-gun or a Wookiee bowcaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
