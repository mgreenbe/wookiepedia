Candles were made of meltable material, with a central wick which was lit to give light as it burned. The light produced by a candle was dim and flickering. To prevent extinguishment or excessive flickering, they were sometimes put into portable cases.

Skywalker eventually found his dying mother held within a hut illuminated by dozens of candles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beyond their practical use, candles were also lit around graves and tombs in honor of the dead. When a deceased Human citizen of Naboo could not be cremated in the vicinity of the Livet Tower, which contained an Eternal Flame, it was customary to place a lighted candle on their chest.
