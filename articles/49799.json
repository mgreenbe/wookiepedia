They were devoted to creating the finest art, architecture, and starships. The Force Builders built the city of Alistan Nor on a remote jungle planet. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Alistan Nor had long been abandoned and overtaken by the jungle. Prior to the Battle of Endor, the Mon Calamari shipbuilder Quarrie informed Rowan Freemaker about the history of the Force Builders. Rowan later undertook a mission to Alistan Nor that brought him into contact with the Imperial hunter droid M-OC. Quarrie came to regard Rowan as one of the last Force Builders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
