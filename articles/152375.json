At some point, she knew Lor San Tekka, whom the Cr\u00e8che called \"the explorer,\" when he lived with them for two years. The Resistance Captain Poe Dameron visited the Cr\u00e8che elder and her fellow cultists during his search for Lor San Tekka. Shortly later, they were caught in a conflict between the Resistance, the First Order, and two large winged creatures.

She and her fellow cultists regarded the egg as their charge, their purpose, and their salvation. They based their entire lives around protecting and nurturing the egg. The elder believed that the egg held their unborn savior, who would reward them for protecting it for so many generations. At some unknown time, the Cr\u00e8che elder encountered the explorer Lor San Tekka, who spent two full seasons with the Cr\u00e8che learning their ways and communing with the savior unborn.

Poe and his droid BB-8 flew their T-70 X-wing starfighter into the Cave of the Cr\u00e8che during their mission to Ovanis.

She then briefed Poe about the Cr\u00e8che egg and emphasized that she would not let anyone hurt the egg. The elder offered to share her group's secrets if Poe stayed with them and became a brother. Poe replied that he was on a deadline. When BB-8 discovered the presence of a tracker on his starfighter, Poe confronted the cultists and raised the tracker. Mistaking it for a detonator, the elder ordered her fellow cultists to take him down.

As her followers surrounded Terex, she threatened to destroy him. However, Terex had brought reinforcements in the form of several stormtroopers equipped with jetpacks.

However, the creature attacked them and Terex's stormtroopers, whose blasters could not penetrate its thick skin. The elder confronted the creature and asked if she had angered them.

Eventually, the black winged creature gained the upper hand over the blue creature and killed it by firing a bright beam through its throat.

After Poe and his fellow pilots let Terex and his men go, the elder decided to let him go since he could not hurt them anymore.
