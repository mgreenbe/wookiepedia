In 43 ABY, one such deputy minister of trade was located in the Galactic Empire Embassy on Coruscant when a kidnap attempt was made on the Imperial Head of State Jagged Fel. Fel shot his blaster several times into the ceiling in order to trip off an alarm, accidentally shooting the deputy minister of trade in the foot.
