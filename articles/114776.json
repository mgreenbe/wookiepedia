In 20 BBY, the ship was sent to the Outer Rim planet Drongar where Republic and Confederate forces fought against each other to gain control of the bota fields on the world. Bota was a native plant of Drongar with substantial medicinal qualities. However, when the bota mutated during that year and became useless, the Republic decided to pull out of Drongar, and the Resolution was tasked to escort the Republic forces on the planet back to the Core Worlds. After arriving over the planet, the Star Destroyer fought off the Confederate troops\u2014who had started an offensive to secure most of the bota\u2014and was able to evacuate most of the Republic clone trooper forces, along with the medical personnel stationed there. Also, the Republic saved two metric tons of non-mutated bota. Afterward, the Resolution, together with a Republic MedStar-class frigate that contained troops and personnel, jumped to hyperspace, with its destination being the Core Worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Resolution appeared briefly in MedStar II: Jedi Healer, the second novel of the MedStar Duology.
