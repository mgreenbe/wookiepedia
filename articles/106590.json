When Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, Clone Captain Rex and Clone Force 99, the \"Bad Batch\", came to the planet on a rescue mission, they briefly came into conflict with the Poletecs as a chief of that species did not want their war on his planet. Skywalker, who had been kidnapped by the chief, noted that communication was going to be difficult as he did not speak the Poletecs' language and they did not understand Galactic Basic Standard.
