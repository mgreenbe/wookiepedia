These markings, called qukuuf, applied as tattoos when young, were passed down through families on the mother's side, except for on those rare occasions where an individual's mother was not a Kiffar, in which case the father's markings were taken on. Such was the case of Korto Vos, the son of Kiffar Jedi Master Quinlan Vos and Human mother Khaleen Hentz. Clan membership seemed to be passed down on the father's side, although it is unclear what occurred when the father was not a Kiffar, as with the case of Ailyn Vel. These tattoos also identified which clan a Kiffar might be in, but these clans were at war or in high tension partnerships for most of the Kiffarian history. But since the Imperial annexation of the Kiffars' homeworlds, 3,500 standard years before the rise of Darth Vader, this race diminished in numbers greatly, along with the clan heads and other instigators of the clan-feuds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The traditional colors of the facial tattoos were red, yellow, and green.
