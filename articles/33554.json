It also operated as a secret society, bringing together the galaxy's most influential beings for the yearly Gatherings on Sojourn, attended, at times, by the full presiding body of the Holdings steering committee. Damask Holdings was owned and expertly run by Magister Hego Damask, a Muun of the Damask clan who was secretly the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis. A dozen Muuns, including operating officer Larsh Hill, made up the group."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the year 120 BBY, Damask Holdings acquired one of Harnaidan's most magnificent superspires.

Damask personally traveled to Naboo, seeking to establish a foothold on the world by striking a deal with the reformist party of monarchical candidate Bon Tapalo in the heated election season. He sought out the young noble who had released sensitive information to the Tapalo group: Palpatine, heir of House Palpatine, one of the conservative clans. Damask recruited the young Human as a spy, and later trained him as his Sith apprentice, bestowing upon him the name and title of \"Darth Sidious.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hego Damask continued to run the company until 52 BBY, when all of its guiding members except for Damask himself were killed in an attack at the Lodge of the Order of the Canted Circle during Larsh Hill's initiation ceremony.
