The siringana were considered to be as merciless and brutal as the Yevetha, who were the only sentients native to N'zoth. These bigoted, violent natives had great respect for the siringana and its ability to kill its enemies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
