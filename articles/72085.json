Jowa was assigned to the Rebel hospital with cargo for the rebels who were wounded during the evacuation of Hoth. However while Tomaas Azzameen, piloting the Vasudra, was delivering bacta to the Rebels, The Star Destroyer Corrupter and a pair of Lancer-class frigates, the Cascade and the Blue Hawk, dropped out of hyperspace and began a bombardment of the hospital, executed by TIE/sa bombers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jowa's fate is unclear, as it is possible for the vessel to escape, or be destroyed, depending on a number of situations made possible by random AI events in X-Wing Alliance, as well as the actions of the player.
