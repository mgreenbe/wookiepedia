The lack of sales eventually led to KSE being re-integrated under the KDY banner as an after-market upgrade kit manufacturer. Shortly after the Battle of Endor, KSE was sold off to a group of Imperial loyalists. It was later revealed that the loyalists were really Vaathkree merchants with strong ties to the New Republic. At this time, KSE products were costly, but they were often worth the extra credits due to the Vaathkree's stringent quality-control standards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
