As an alternative to the standard dorsal-mounted twin mass-driver missile launchers, the Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship could be equipped with an EP-750X. They fired guided missiles that were tipped with EMP warheads that delivered a powerful ion blast upon detonation, and were, as a result, effective against massed droid formations, as well as effective anti-ship and anti-vehicle weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
