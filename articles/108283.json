It described the process by which Grutchin, an insectoid weapon used by the Yuuzhan Vong to attack enemy starships, could be created. In 26.5 ABY, Onimi, the court jester of Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane, decided that he would use the knowledge found in this protocol to create a perfect grutchin while disguised as a Master Shaper named Kae Kwaad. Onimi did this as part of a plan to determine whether Shaper Adept Nen Yim would be able to design new protocols to fill the almost empty Eighth cortex."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Protocol of Hon Akua appeared in the novel The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth, written by Greg Keyes and released in 2001."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
