Around 22 BBY, the Confederacy took control of the planet Khorm and built a weather-control station on the Kafiri Mountain to defend the planet from Republic forces. Nagg was placed in charge of the station, which created storms in order to prevent Republic troops from landing. The Republic, however, managed to land several units on Khorm, and Nagg was contacted by Warlord Unger Gout. The warlord informed him that two Jedi were on the way to destroy the station and ordered Nagg to create a storm strong enough to kill the Jedi. The Aqualish obeyed and created the storm; however, the Jedi were able to redirect it on the station itself.

The station was built on the Kafiri Mountain and was able to to create storms capable of preventing Republic forces from landing and capturing the agrocite mines.

He also told him that the Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress was on her way to kill the Jedi, but nevertheless ordered Nagg to create a storm large enough to destroy the Jedi, as well as placing Ventress in danger. While Nagg was hesitant about the possibility of slaying Ventress, Gout insisted that Nagg carry out his orders. The Jedi survived, however, and managed to reach one of the station's junction boxes. With the help of the clone trooper Fixer, they sliced the box and changed the coordinates of the storm to target the weather-control station itself.
