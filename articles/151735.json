After a group of Zemerin arrived on Enujut, the protocol droid discovered that the species was telepathic and caused negativity in order to feed on it. The droid informed the local peacekeeper, Evor Haris, of the visitors' true intentions, and Haris pretended to angrily chase the droid into a transport. The Zemerin followed to feed on the negativity, but Haris escaped the transport, trapping the Zemerin, while the droid took off, piloting the starship back to the Zemerin homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
