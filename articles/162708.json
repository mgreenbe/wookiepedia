Corporate Sector Authority agents Fiolla and Magg used one of these for transport during the former's attempt to break up a slaving ring run by Zlarb and, unknown to Fiolla at the time, Magg himself. During their transit to Bonadan, their Wanderer was rendered inoperable, so it was deposited in a CSA pool hangar while it waited for parts and repairs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
