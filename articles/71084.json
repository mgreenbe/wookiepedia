Several Jinata Security officers were present alongside the Aqualish Gleb when Iden Versio returned to her homeworld after being court-martialed for sedition. By 34 ABY, Protectorate Gleb ruled Vardos with the support of Jinata Security and the First Order. Jinata Security also supported Project Resurrection, a First Order initiative to create new stormtroopers using conscripted children. After Gleb was killed for her failures and Vardos was locked down by the First Order, J-Sec rebelled against their former allies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time Project Resurrection was active, J-Sec mostly used severely outdated starships and vehicles.
