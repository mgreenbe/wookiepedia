Briggs and several others under Cracken's command were imprisoned in the hold of a light freighter by lizard men. The group found a positive flow detonator in the hold, and Briggs accessed the engine system via a service tube and took a negative power coupler. They intended to create a bomb by fusing the two together and blast a hole in the side of the ship. Lots were drawn to see who would try to detonate the jury-rigged explosive, and a man named D'kar was chosen. The plan worked, but D'kar was killed in the explosion with the rest escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
