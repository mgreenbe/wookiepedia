It was fully licensed but nevertheless sold knockoff merchandise that were produced in its factories. When fellow Xexto Niai Fieso was promoted to his side, the two expanded the business into a smuggling operation. Fieso embezzled credits and sold Drevan out to authorities; he fled the Troiken system before a raid landed Drevan in jail and lost him his business license."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
