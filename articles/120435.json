Inheriting her family's Force-sensitivity, she was inducted into the Jedi Order and became the Padawan of Jedi Master Ngani Zho, though she later traveled to the Sith homeworld of Korriban to study under the Zabrak Battlemaster Kao Cen Darach. It was there that she witnessed the recapture of the planet by the Sith Empire in 3681 BBY, and she escaped to warn the Republic with the help of the smuggler Nico Okarr and a Republic trooper named Jace Malcom at the cost of Darach's life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Achieving the rank of Jedi Knight under the tutelage of Master Dar'Nala, Shan led her fellow Jedi and the forces of the Republic Military into battle in the Great Galactic War, becoming a well-known hero to the Republic. Shan also grew close with Malcom despite the Jedi Order's restrictions on attachments, and their bond drove her to rescue Malcom and his small band of Special Forces troopers on the Core World of Alderaan when the Empire invaded the world in 3667 BBY. Her arrival turned the tide of the Battle of Alderaan in the Republic's favor. After defeating the Sith Lord Darth Malgus in combat with the help of Malcom, she and Malcom began an affair that lasted for six months before Shan broke it off in fear of the darkness in the soldier's heart. However, she was pregnant with Malcom's child, and Shan eventually gave birth to her son, Theron, in secret with the help of Master Zho before giving the child up to the Jedi Order and returning to the battlefield."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3653 BBY, Shan was selected to be part of the delegation that was to attend peace talks with the Sith Empire on Alderaan. However, the Empire used the conference as a distraction while it attacked the Republic's capital of Coruscant, holding the world hostage to force the Republic to accept the terms of the Treaty of Coruscant. As the galaxy settled into an uneasy Cold War, Shan foiled a conspiracy to sabotage the new peace perpetrated by Dar'Nala herself and afterward embarked on an odyssey inspired by the call of the Force across the galaxy. The journey led her to the Jedi Order's long-lost homeworld of Tython in the Deep Core, and for her rediscovery of the planet, Shan was appointed to the position of Grand Master and given leadership of the entire Order. In her new role, Shan guided the Order through a number of crises that arose during the Cold War also and trained her Kiffar Padawan, Shigar Konshi, to Knighthood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the fragile calm of the Cold War began to collapse, Shan worked with the Republic Emergency Response Corps to protect the unsteady peace and the innocents of the galaxy, and she was alerted to a dangerous threat from the Sith Emperor by his former servant Lord Scourge when a daring mission that she had authorized to capture the Emperor ended in disaster. Learning that the Emperor intended to extinguish all life in the galaxy, Shan helped the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython foil the Emperor's plans and personally led an invasion fleet in an assault on the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas while the Knight confronted and defeated the Emperor. As the renewed war continued to spread across the galaxy, Shan worked with her former flame, Malcom, in his capacity as Supreme Commander of the Republic Military, and the two achieved victory over the prototype Imperial warship Ascendant Spear at Duro thanks to the efforts of their son, Theron. Shan also forged a temporary truce with the Empire's Darth Marr in order to combat the threat of the Order of Revan, and the two led their combined forces in defeating the returned Revan on the moon Yavin 4.

The Republic pressured the Order into exiling Tasiele to an uninhabited planet in the Outer Rim Territories. When the political controversy eventually died down, the Order attempted to retrieve the Jedi Knight, but Tasiele was nowhere to be found\u2014the only thing the Order could locate in Tasiele's abandoned dwelling was a series of journals written to Satele, which it delivered to the missing Jedi's daughter. Apprenticed to Jedi Master Ngani Zho, Shan studied the ways of the Force as a Padawan until 3681 BBY, when she traveled to the Republic's space station in orbit of the Sith homeworld of Korriban to study under the Order's Battlemaster, Kao Cen Darach. Under Darach's tutelage, Shan learned how to wield and fight with the blue double-bladed lightsaber that she constructed for herself. He also guided the Padawan through some of the Jedi Trials, though her ascension to Knighthood was not completed by the end of that year. The reconstituted Sith Empire soon began attacking the edges of the Republic, instigating the Great Galactic War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long into Shan's stay, she and her Master were alerted to the landing of an unidentified freighter on the surface of Korriban by the space station's crew. Shan and Darach traveled to the surface along with Corporal Jace Malcom of the Republic Special Forces Division and were able to capture a smuggler captain named Nico Okarr, though they failed to capture Farel Wickes, the infamous grave robber from whom Okarr was attempting to purchase Sith artifacts. Impounding Okarr's ship, an XS stock light freighter named Redshifter, the three brought the smuggler back up to the space station and were in the process of escorting Okarr to his cell along with another trooper when Shan was overcome with an intense feeling of pain and dread in the Force. Outside the station's viewport, an armada of over thirty Harrower-class dreadnoughts jumped out of hyperspace into the Horuset system. Darach immediately recognized that their attackers were Sith and that the outpost would not withstand the attack, so he quickly decided that their priority had to be warning the Republic of the Sith Empire's attack. When Malcom warned Darach that they would be unable to outrun the Sith's starfighters, Okarr surprised the Jedi and the soldiers by reminding them of his ship's speed.

While Malcom and Okarr prepared the ship, Shan and her Master engaged the two Sith arrivals\u2014a masked Sith Inquisitor named Vindican and his Human apprentice, Malgus. The two apprentices battled each other as their Masters fought, but when Malgus ultimately knocked Shan to the floor, Darach stopped Malgus from killing Shan with a toss of his lightsaber, giving her time to recover. Summoning her lightsaber back to her hands, Shan tried to jump to her Master's aid, but Vindican stopped her with a blast of lightning.

However, as they were leaving the belt, Shan felt the death of her Master at the hands of Malgus. Shan was able to push aside her grief as Okarr strafed the superstructure of a Harrower-class dreadnought, continuing to fire on the pursuing fighters until the Redshifter jumped to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Great Galactic War"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Fighting the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to the Republic, the trio brought word of the Sith attack, though by the time the Jedi Council learned the news, the Empire had already launched an invasion in the Minos Cluster, an attack on Sluis Van, and blockaded the Rimma Trade Route. The Council requested several debriefings of Shan, and the Padawan was even permitted to sit in on one of the Council's strategic discussions. She was present at the Jedi Temple when a contingent of Jedi, including the Kel Dor Gnost-Dural, departed the capital planet of Coruscant for the occupied Minos Cluster, and she witnessed the riots that broke out across Coruscant as a result. Shan then spent the next part of the war partnered with various Jedi Masters before she was apprenticed to the Togruta Jedi Master Dar'Nala, who helped her become a full-fledged Jedi Knight. A diplomat and political strategist, Dar'Nala helped to temper her student's aggression and impatience, and Shan became one of the Republic's most famous champions in the years to come. In 3671 BBY, Shan and Dar'Nala were stationed at the Temple when news arrived of the Republic's victory at the first Battle of Bothawui, and her meditation was interrupted by intense cheering that echoed across the planet from the Senate Plaza."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3667 BBY, Shan traveled to the Core World of Alderaan to investigate rumors that one of the planet's royal houses was harboring Imperial spies. However, the Empire invaded Alderaan while she was there, and Shan raced to the royal palace in order to protect Queen Silara Panteer, though the structure was in ruins by the time she got there. It was then that Shan had a vision showing her that Jace Malcom\u2014whose unit, Havoc Squad, was training injured troopers on Alderaan at the time\u2014would need reinforcements. Shan and Malcom had worked together on previous missions, and the soldier had tried to pursue a relationship with her, though she refrained from doing so because of the Order's restrictions on attachments. Sending word to the Jedi Council, Shan rushed to the Juran Mountains to aid them in their guerrilla war against the Imperial forces marching on Castle Organa. The Imperials were led by Darth Malgus, the Sith whom Shan had fought on Korriban fourteen years earlier, and by the time she arrived, the members of Havoc Squad were fighting a losing battle against a disorganized but far larger Imperial force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just as Malcom was about to be executed by three Sith warriors, Shan leaped into the valley and landed behind the two holding Malcom. Unleashing a powerful telekinetic blast into the ground before killing the three disoriented Sith, Shan located Malgus nearby and drew her lightsaber as a challenge to her opponent. The Jedi then vaulted across the battlefield, destroying an Imperial war droid and eliminating four Sith in the process before engaging Malgus in a fierce duel. After a series of blows, Shan was forced to her knees as she tried to hold back Malgus's blade, though she reached out with the Force and brought down a nearby tree to grant herself a reprieve. The two then continued their duel atop the fallen tree branch before Malgus threw her against another tree trunk with the Force, and Shan was barely able to somersault over the Sith Lord's head before Malgus buried his lightsaber in the tree where she had been moments earlier. However, Malgus quickly spun and sliced her double-bladed saber in two before she could spin it and attack, and he immediately followed up with a stab directly at her chest. The energy of the lightsaber used by Malgus was which absorbed by Shan, who blocked the attack with her bare hands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Malgus's attack was interrupted when Malcom charged the Sith Lord with a ferocious yell, catching him about the waist and engaging in a short fistfight before revealing the primed thermal detonator in his hand. The explosion threw the commando backward out of the clearing, though a scarred Malgus was able to withstand most of the explosion with the Force. Yet before the Sith Lord could pursue either Shan or Malcom, Shan gathered the Force (likely from the energy previously absorbed through tutaminis) and unleashed a powerful blast that sent Malgus flying into a nearby cliff side. The Sith Lord continued to fight against her power as she pinned him against the cliff, and Shan gathered her strength into a second and more powerful blast that tore the entire cliff to pieces. With her enemy buried under tons of rubble, Shan joined an injured Malcom in surveying the battlefield, and the commando sent up a flare to signal victory, one of many that began to light the surface of Alderaan as the reinforcements Shan had requested arrived in the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Malcom was given kolto treatments to deal with his injuries, the most prominent of which left him with a permanently scarred face. Shan visited him later while the Republic forces were celebrating their victory, and she informed Malcom of the vision that had brought her to his aid. In response to Malcom's questions about Malgus, Shan confided in him her belief that the Sith Lord had survived the battle. Malcom then reminded Shan of his feelings for her, and her attempts to remind the soldier of her vows as a Jedi were not enough to suppress the feelings she had for him in return. Succumbing to her emotions, she and Malcom entered into a secret relationship\u2014one that led to her becoming pregnant around six months after the Battle of Alderaan, not long after Malcom had been promoted to the rank of general. In addition to working with Colonel Elin Garza to develop the Special Forces Division, Malcom was conducting a campaign near the city of Gell Mattar on a planet with Shan, and she decided to speak with him about his desire for vengeance against the Empire before informing him of her pregnancy. Their conversation revealed that Malcom's hatred of the Empire was his driving force, and Shan was forced to confront the possibility that she would turn to the dark side if the Empire caused Malcom's death. That fear, and the fear of the darkness within Malcom's spirit, drove Shan to break off their relationship and make plans to give up her child\u2014as she understood that having them in her life put the Republic at risk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the next few months, Shan continued to serve on the front lines as one of the Republic's greatest heroes, inspiring the rank and file of the Republic Military to victory on battlefields across the galaxy. However, as her pregnancy advanced and her Jedi robes were no longer able to conceal the signs, Shan went to her first Master, Ngani Zho, and told him of her pregnancy\u2014but not of the father's name. Zho did not question her story and immediately agreed to help, approaching the Jedi Council and the Republic Military's leaders with the story that he had sent her on a vital and clandestine mission. Shan bore her son with Zho's help on a planet far from the war, and Zho took her child to raise on his own as per their agreement\u2014but not before she named her son Theron."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Hero of the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A year later, in 3665 BBY, Shan was assigned to a Republic Navy contingent tasked with protecting a fleet of prototype warships that were being gathered for an attack on the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas.

Hundreds of vessels on both sides met their end during the conflict, and Shan was aboard one of the few Republic ships that managed to escape destruction. In 3661 BBY, Shan was recalled to Coruscant when the Mandalorians, a culture of warrior nomads, began a blockade of the Hydian Way trade route.

Between the four of them, the Jedi had fought previously on battlefields such as a conflict with Gelpog the Tyrant and a battle on the Ash Plains of Lenico IV, and the four led the Republic forces in a charge that brought them within reach of the fortress of Darth Mekhis, a member of the Empire's Dark Council.

A Republic delegation led by the Cerean Senator Paran Am-Ris traveled to Alderaan, accompanied by several Jedi: Shan, Dar'Nala, Syo Bakarn, and Aryn Leneer. Shan spent the first morning in meditation, though her efforts were not enough to conceal the tension she felt at the conference, and she confided in her former teacher that she believed there was something more to the meeting than the Council believed. At that moment, Shan's suspicions were being proven correct\u2014an Imperial fleet under the command of Darth Angral was approaching Coruscant, and it began attacking the Republic capital the moment that Darth Malgus and his strike force brought down the planet's defense grid within the Jedi Temple.

Later that night, Zym informed Dar'Nala and Am-Ris that the Republic had no choice but to accept Baras's terms until Coruscant was freed and also warned Dar'Nala that Shan had to apologize to Baras if the negotiations were to proceed.

The Togruta Jedi Master then departed for the bridge in anger as Shan settled down to sleep. Shan was still in her room when Dar'Nala arranged for the Envoy to attack a passing Imperial transport, as part of a plan to dismantle the Treaty and restart the war. Shan was alerted to the Imperials' returning fire by SP-99, and her attempt to investigate led her straight into a pair of Imperial commandos, who tried to kill her on sight. Quickly dispatching the attackers and ignoring SP-99's protests, the Jedi raced to find Dar'Nala, only to witness her capture by several Imperials.

The Jedi Knight told them her story immediately upon being rescued, and Din decided that Zym needed to be alerted right away. Tavus laughed down Shan's argument that they should also rescue Dar'Nala, but Din agreed that they did need more information on the attack before they could make a judgment. They contacted the Grand Master from their ship, but Shan was dismayed to learn that an intercepted Imperial transmission had reported that Dar'Nala was dead. Saddened by the loss of her former Master, Shan accompanied the two on their original mission to enforce the ceasefire on the nearby planet Balmorra, where Din forced his former student Fortris Gall to withdraw from the battlefield.

Meeting with Major Dael at Base D-55 on Dantooine, the two were dismayed to learn from Am-Ris that Grand Master Zym had been killed\u2014just as a bomb exploded in the Senate Building. With the Treaty of Coruscant crumbling under the strain of recent events, Am-Ris reiterated his order to withdraw to Dael and ended the holotransmission with the hope that Shan and Tavus would succeed in convincing the major to heed the orders. To Shan's surprise, Tavus did not object to Dael's refusal, and the lieutenant decided to return to their ship until Shan came to her senses and realized that the Treaty was not worth protecting.

The protocol droid was barely able to communicate before losing power that Tavus had gone to the ruins of the Jedi Enclave, and Din called Shan just then to report that Braden had escaped. Din ordered her to remain there until he arrived, but Shan decided to pursue Tavus herself and set off for the Enclave.

In light of the news, the Council decided that the Order would move its headquarters to Tython. By 3645 BBY, the Council had appointed Shan as the Order's Grand Master, and she guided the Jedi throughout the Cold War as they rebuilt their ranks and recovered from the fighting.

However, Konshi soon found himself caught up in a firefight with an armored Mandalorian named Dao Stryver. Stryver escaped despite the efforts of Konshi and the Republic trooper Larin Moxla, but Moxla had learned that Stryver was seeking something called the Cinzia and a person named Lema Xandret. Konshi immediately reported these events to his Master, who relayed them to the Supreme Commander before contacting Tython regarding her earlier meeting.

Shan was troubled by two aspects of her apprentice's report: The droids were adaptable in combat, and a Sith apprentice named Eldon Ax had been present at Bareesh's palace during the fighting. As Konshi was planning to use his psychometry to track the source of the hexes, Shan gathered a Republic task force and traveled to a rendezvous at the planet Honoghr. Using his powers, Shan's apprentice tracked the hexes to a planet named Sebaddon, which was located near a black hole, well above the galactic disk. Shan soon followed them to the Sebaddon system aboard the Corellia, a cruiser among the Republic flotilla under the command of Colonel Gurin. Shan attempted to contact Xandret's Sebaddon colonists three times before receiving a response\u2014a woman's voice, saying they did not recognize the Republic's authority and that they wanted only to be left alone.

Xandret's droids had intrigued Mandalore the Vindicated, but the Mandalorians soon realized that the hexes were, in fact, a galactic plague\u2014Xandret had lost control of her droids not long after she contacted the Mandalorians, and the droids' drive to consume and their incredible replication speed would allow them to destroy the entire galaxy within a matter of years.

Though both sides initially objected to such an alliance, they eventually agreed to a temporary cessation of hostilities in order to eliminate the hexes. As part of the joint assault, Shan led a strike team to destroy the hexes' coordinating intelligence while another team led by Moxla took out the main factory.

The transport breached a subterranean mining complex beneath the facility, but an explosion of what seemed to be lava consumed both Shan and Ax before they could get out of the way. To their surprise, the two discovered that it was not lava; it was a lake of warm, reddish fluid that concealed an Imperial vessel far beneath its surface. Shan and Ax boarded the ship to find a massive glass tank containing the same red fluid in one of the vessel's compartments, and they soon realized that the fluid was some kind of organic material that gave the hexes a semblance of life\u2014and that the tank contained a clone of Eldon Ax."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone explained to Shan that Eldon Ax was actually Xandret's daughter, a fact that the Sith apprentice had concealed, and that the fluid in which she was submerged was suppressing her Force powers.

With her dying words, the clone instructed Ax on how to take control of the hexes, and Shan and Ax returned to the surface to test whether it would work. Ax's control of the hexes allowed her to end the battle in a matter of minutes, and Shan retreated with the rest of the Republic forces as Ax used the hexes to kill her Master before destroying them and ending the threat they posed to the galaxy.
