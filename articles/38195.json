The system contained the star Din that went supernova around 5000 BBY, creating the pulsar Din Pulsar and devasting the system. The supernova vaporized the inner planets of the system and left only the cores of three gas giants, with one that turned out to be a diamond the size of a terrestrial planet. The pulsar's magnetic pulses complicated hyperspatial travel along the nearby Trindello-Endor route and made the Din system inaccessible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
