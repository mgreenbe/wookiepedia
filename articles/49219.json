A Flesh Raider with gray skin and white tattoos, the Force-sensitive Bladewielder was part of a group sent to establish a base in the ruins of the ancient Je'daii temple-city Kaleth during the Flesh Raider uprising in 3643 BBY. The Flesh Raider rose to a position of power after defeating the Selkath Jedi Laotah, who had attempted to investigate the Flesh Raider base. Earning the title by mortally wounding the Jedi and taking his lightsaber, the Bladewielder used the blue-bladed weapon in conjunction with Force powers until the Flesh Raider was killed by the apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din, who had been sent to eliminate the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Flesh Raider Bladewielder appears in The Old Republic, a 2011 MMORPG released by BioWare.
