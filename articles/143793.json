The nebula was located on the borders of the Albarrio and Relgim sectors, and the Relgim Run ran through it, forcing starships on the run to exit hyperspace and navigate through the cloud at sublight speed. This created opportunities for the Riders of the Maelstrom, pirates led by Big Jak Targrim, to raid starliners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Great Galactic War, the Maelstrom served as a important location for the Sith Empire.
