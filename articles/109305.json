Following the assassination of the Mon Calamari King Yos Kolina, the Quarren led by Chieftain Nossor Ri contested his son Prince Lee-Char's claim to the throne. With the encouragement of Tamson, Ri called for new leadership and a chance for the Quarren to rule Mon Cala. This led to a civil war on Mon Cala with the Separatists backing the Quarren Isolation League and the Republic supporting the Mon Calamari.

However, the Quarren-Separatist alliance fell apart after Nossor Ri learned that Tamson intended to crown himself as the new ruler of Mon Cala. Ri foiled Tamson's plot to execute Prince Lee-Char, who wanted to restore relations between the Mon Calamari and Quarren.
