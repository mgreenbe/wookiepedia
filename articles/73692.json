About a thousand years later, around 2900 BBY, the small city of Kaadara was founded along a scenic coastline in the northern reaches of the Mid Rim planet. Early in its history, Kaadara was unique among Naboo cities because the local populace welcomed, and even encouraged, interactions with the native Gungans. Kaadara's first regent, Kallos Sook, actually hired a large contingent of Gungans to serve as the city's security force. However, in the centuries following Sook's regency, the increased presence of outsiders led the suspicious Gungans to abandon their role as protectors of Kaadara. The Naboo then went on to install a small garrison of Royal Naboo Security Force officers in their stead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kallos Sook was first mentioned in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
