In this context, the term came to mean \"perfect being\" or \"god.\" The prophecy, which was in many ways similar to the Jedi prophecy of the Chosen One, retained its significance for the Dark Lords up until the time of the Order of the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Sith'ari Prophecy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith'ari Prophecy was considered too sacred to be put into writing by the Kissai, who passed it on verbally from generation to generation.

However, Sirak was killed by his nemesis, Bane. Darth Bane, eventually becoming a Dark Lord of the Sith, finally fulfilled the prophecy in many ways, first by providing Skere Kaan with the thought bomb, which caused the annihilation of the Brotherhood of Darkness, and then by instating the Rule of Two, leading to a powerful line of Sith by reducing their numbers to only two at a time. This allowed the dark side to distill in two vessels only; whereas Bane believed that its power in the past had been spread far too thin among the vast numbers of Sith 'lords'. This concentration of strength also made it easier to hide the Sith until they built up enough power to destroy the Jedi, and thereby open the way for the Sith to rule the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Darth Plagueis, due to being a creature of logic and not superstition, never believed in the Sith'ari prophecy, or any prophecy since he considered prophecies \"wishful thinking\", he nonetheless saw no reason to not claim the title figuring that it ultimately fit him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Almost a millennium later, Darth Sidious proclaimed himself to be the perfect being of ancient Sith prophecy while killing his master, Darth Plagueis, in his sleep."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ever since its first mention, fans have speculated who the Sith'ari was. Some of the most notable candidates among this speculation were Darth Revan, Darth Bane, Darth Sidious, and Darth Vader. The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, however, establishes Bane as being the looked-for Sith'ari, confirming the assumptions of many fans. But the title has also been interpreted as having multiple holders throughout galactic history. Giving credence to this, the 2012 publication Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side featured a number of references to the prophecy of the Sith'ari in what was intended by the book's author, Daniel Wallace, to be a running joke, whereby each in-universe writer of the Book of Sith came to the conclusion that he or she was the Sith'ari."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
