But one day, he met Rahasia Sandral away from both his and her fathers, and he fell in love with her despite the feud between their families. He also became friends with Rahasia's brother Casus Sandral. But soon after, Casus was killed by kath hounds while exploring the ruins near the Jedi Enclave. When Nurik Sandral wrongly assumed that Casus had been kidnapped by Ahlan, Nurik kidnapped Shen and held him prisoner inside his own heavily-defended mansion. Rahasia pleaded with her father to release the man she loved, but he refused."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, an amnesiac Revan came to the Sandral estate to find Shen, and Rahasia told him what was going on.

During the escape both of them thanked Revan profusely, but then Ahlan showed up with a pair of battle droid bodyguards. When Nurik, flanked by droid guards of his own emerged to confront his old rival, Revan was forced to mediate the feud lest the whole thing end in a firefight. Though both men proved stubborn, Revan managed to persuade the two fathers to see that their children were indeed in love and agreed to build a new house for them. As the two families parted, Shen told Revan that they would always remember him. Shen asked Rahasia to marry him shortly after Revan left."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is known that the Matales were \"removed\" from Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War, so it is likely Shen was killed when the Sith invaded the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is possible for the player to convince Shen and Rahasia to run away to the Jedi Enclave.

If this happens, then Shen likely dies during the destruction of the Enclave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the player follows the dark side, he/she can lie to Nurik to make him think that Ahlan killed Casus.
