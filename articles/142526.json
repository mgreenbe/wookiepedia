Usually sponsored by a crime lord or pirate syndicate, it was a large event that spawned its own sub-cultures. In addition to the selling of stolen vessels, luxury liners became floating casinos, and private yachts provided accommodation. Alongside selling the ships, services selling components, upgrades and modifications were also in demand. Salvage ships, smelting vessels, and drydocks were common sights, including the services of those specializing in altering and masking transponder codes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
