Like many other plants from that planet, D'ian orchid vines were renowned for the aesthetic appeal of their fragrance and appearance. The plants consisted of a large central pink flower with orange protrusions, which was surrounded by pink and yellow leaves. They were exported from the planet and became common throughout the Corporate Sector where their homeworld was located. Rossum Droidworks, a company based in the sector, sent an orchid vine as a gift to Colonel Milosh Muhrlein, the Imperial commandant of Imperial Research Station 61 on the planet Wayland. Muhrlein, who sold experimental droids and technology from his research station on the black market to Rossum, kept the plant on his desk until Imperial Security Bureau Jahan Cross recognized it around the year 3 BBY. Cross, who was investigating the commandant's black market dealings, later knocked it to the floor while fighting Muhrlein."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orchid vines were first mentioned in Han Solo's Revenge, a novel written by Brian Daley in 1979.
