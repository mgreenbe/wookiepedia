The base was mainly made up of multi level bunkers similar to that of the bunker on Endor, with roads in between. There was also a path on the side one side of the base which led to a landing platform. It was seen around 2 BBY, when Galen Marek, Darth Vader's apprentice, stormed the facility, slaughtering all of the Navy commandos, medics, and Imperial heavy troopers. It is unknown what happened to the facility afterwards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was built in around several small cliffs. The Empire built the base so Imperial troops could operate on the planet and keep the native population of Felucians from rebelling. Many soldiers assigned to the base noted that this was no easy task."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
