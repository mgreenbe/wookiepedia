Whilst Strayit was captain, Zertik Strom served as a lieutenant on board the vessel and during a rebellion by the Poporov merchants of Armstiss, the lieutenant saved the captain's life. Strom took a blaster bolt intended for Strayit and then, ignoring the pain, grabbed the leader of the rebellious merchants and pushed a thermal detonator into his pants before throwing him off a cliff into a crowd of his followers. The subsequent explosion killed the vast majority of rebels along with most of their merchant stalls, with those left alive to afraid to rebel again. For his heroics, Strom was promoted to the position of First officer on board the starship Peacehawk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Strayit was first mentioned in the second part of Viva Space Vegas!
