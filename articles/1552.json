As well as the T-65 models used during the Galactic Civil War, these engines were also used on later models such as the XJ3 X-wing, which saw action during the Yuuzhan Vong War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Four of these powerful engines were mounted on each X-wing, allowing for a maximum speed of 1,300 kilometers per hour in atmosphere, with even higher speeds possible with deflector shields on. In addition, engines of this type were often adapted with a system of etheric rudders, allowing thrust vectoring and enhanced maneuverability. This maneuverability was so increased that pilots likened it to flying a T-16 skyhopper in atmospheric flight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Next-generation X-wing models, such as the XJ X-wing, were equipped an even more advanced propulsion system\u2014Incom 4j.4 fusial thrust engines. Rated at 300 KTU, these engine units provided even more power than the 4L4s, allowing speeds comparable to that of the RZ-1 A-wing interceptor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
