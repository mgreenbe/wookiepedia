Higher settings of gravity meant the user could burn more energy, lose more weight, and build more muscle. It could be dangerous as objects that were heavier could land on a limb and crush toes or break bones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Conan Antonio Motti used a Heavy Gravity Room on the Death Star during the final stages of its construction.
