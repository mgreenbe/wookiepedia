The legislation was opposed by Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and other senators who had formed the Loyalist Committee. As the threat of the Separatists grew more pronounced to the Senate, Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks proposed that Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine be given emergency powers to raise an army on his own. The motion passed, and the Republic adopted the clone troopers created on Kamino as the Grand Army of the Republic, leading to the Clone Wars and, eventually, the rise of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Honor Salima, the commander of the Coruscant Home Defense Fleet, was given access to upgraded technology made available to her through the act."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
