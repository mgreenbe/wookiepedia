Bearus presided over the carbonite smelter that orbited Empress Teta, where he facilitated annual tours of progress that were conducted by Lord and Lady Keto, rulers of the Tetan worlds. Bearus oversaw his last inspection in 3997 BBY, when the children of the Ketos, Aleema and Satal, arrived on station to initiate their political takeover of the Empress Teta system under the guise of their new Sith cult, the Krath. All of the Tetan officials present were killed, and Bearus was among the casualties, having first been overcome by the Krath's Sith magic and then forced into a vat of molten carbonite."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mining executive"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bearus was a humanoid male politician native to the Empress Teta star system. He obtained a position within the system's Carbonite Guild, an influential mining conglomerate that worked in close correspondence with the Tetan Monarchy. Bearus eventually rose to the title of guild chairman, and under his leadership, the guild saw great success with the production of carbonite, a mined ore that was an integral component in the manufacture of starship parts, most notably hyperdrive engines. By 3997 BBY, the guild's profit margin had risen by fifteen percent under the leadership of Bearus, which in turn provided a significant boost to the already flourishing Tetan economy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bearus operated from a carbonite smelter space station that orbited the system's capital world of Empress Teta. The Emperor and Empress of the Tetan worlds, Lord Keto and his sister Magda, conducted annual inspections of Bearus' smelter station and its production progress. During the inspection of 3997 BBY, the Ketos arrived as scheduled, and Bearus escorted them through his facility. In the midst of the tour, Bearus was made aware that the children of the Ketos, Aleema and her cousin Satal, were en route to the station. The chairman was reluctant to grant them permission to enter at first, knowing that their presence was a breach of protocol, and that only sanctioned officials were allowed to attend such important matters of state. However, he allowed for their entry onto the station, believing that their arrival would not detract from Lord Keto's inspection."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Krath takeover"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bearus' efforts to improve the production of carbonite pleased Lord Keto, who noted that the significant rise in the station's net revenue directly resulted in a substantial boost in the Tetan system's overall wealth and influence. However, when Lord Keto learned of Bearus' decision to admit Aleema and Satal on board the smelter, he chastised the guild chairman for his insubordination. Bearus offered to have the children sent away, but Lord Keto relented, and instead blamed their royal tutor for the mishap. Aleema and Satal arrived at that moment, declaring themselves and their new Krath Sith cult the new governing body of the Empress Teta system, and proceeded to subdue the present Tetan officials. Lord Keto ordered Bearus to summon the authorities and have Aleema and Satal taken into custody, but when the chairman reached for a comlink, Aleema used Sith magic to transform it into a monster, and it attacked Bearus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Krath's violent coup underway, Bearus was among the Tetan officials with Lord and Lady Keto who were ordered by Aleema and Satal into the adjacent carbonite smelting chamber. Once inside, each of them was forced into a vat of molten carbonite, where they fell to their deaths. Bearus was no exception, and suffered a quick demise at the hands of the Krath usurpers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bearus was an accomplished politician and business executive, evidenced by his successful operation of the Carbonite Guild and the orbiting smelter. His administrative skills and leadership abilities were instrumental in the success of Tetan carbonite production, as favorably remarked by Lord Keto. Bearus appeared humble in the Emperor's presence, and attributed the station's success to supply and demand rather than his management skills. Nonetheless, he was proud of his accomplishments. An obedient member of Keto's bureaucracy, Bearus nevertheless went against policy when he granted permission for Aleema and Satal to board his carbonite facility. His insubordination would ultimately result in his death and the deaths of all those present."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bearus first appeared in the first installment of the Tales of the Jedi Dark Lords of the Sith story arc, Masters and Students of the Force, written by authors Tom Veitch and Kevin J.
