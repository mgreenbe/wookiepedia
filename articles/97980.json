After becoming an admiral, Sommos and her staff employed a young Naval Academy graduate named Dallan Morvis as a junior liaison with a Vanjervalis Systems design team. Although the epic battles with the Sith had long past by 3964 BBY, the Galactic Republic faced a new threat at the edge of its borders\u2014the Mandalorian warrior clans, which had carved out a sizable empire of their own before encroaching upon Republic space. As the Mandalorians threatened resource worlds near the valuable ecumenopolis of Taris, the Republic Navy set up a defensive cordon known as the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line. Sommos was serving along this border by the time the Mandalorians finally began their advance, attacking the planet Vanquo in a diversionary tactic to open up a path to Taris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The line soon collapsed\u2014Sommos and Admiral Jimas Veltraa responded by reforming what was left of the Outer Rim fleets into a makeshift force meant to protect Taris.
