She was the best friend of fellow Padawans Farzala Tarabal and Qort, often looking out for them. When the Padawans of the Star Hopper were sent to respond to an Emergence in the Trymant system after the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Talisola met the Force-sensitive resident Zeen Mrala during a confrontation with a group of Nihil pirates, as the two girls used telekinesis against a large piece of hyperspace debris."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lula Talisola, a Force-sensitive human female, joined the Jedi Order at a young age, so young that she did not remember her original home. She became close friends with two other Padawans, Farzala Tarabal and Qort, frequently looking out for them when they got up to mischief. Eventually, Talisola became a member of the class of Padawans aboard the cruiser Star Hopper, who were supervised by Jedi Masters Torban Buck and Yoda. She was also apprenticed to Master Kantam Sy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle on Trymant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 232 BBY, the freighter Legacy Run was destroyed in hyperspace outside of the Hetzal system. This caused the Great Hyperspace Disaster, when the star system was imperiled by large amounts of hyperspace debris. In the aftermath, further Emergences of the debris began occurring throughout the Outer Rim Territories. When one Emergence threatened the Trymant system, the Star Hopper was the only Jedi or Galactic Republic starship within range, and it diverted to assist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Yoda ordered the Padawans to prepare themselves for whatever awaited them at Trymant, Talisola grew nervous, feeling that her skills were not up to going out in the field yet, even though she had aced all of her exams, as she thought she should have been happy about the situation but was unable to focus. In response to a question from Tarabal, Yoda reminded the apprentices that they could not turn back as they were Trymant's only hope, and Talisola thought that things might go terribly wrong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Star Hopper was about to arrive at Trymant, Yoda and Buck gathered the Padawans and had them report on what they had learned about the situation. Tarabal and Qort reported that it was fallout from the Great Disaster, and Talisola, alongside the Bravaisian Bibs, reported that several large chunks of debris were on course to hit Bralanak City, the most densely populated area of Trymant IV, the most densely populated planet in the system. Yoda reminded the apprentices to trust in the Force, and Buck stated that he and Yoda would be handling the largest pieces of debris, before the Padawans were sent to board their rescue speeders. Taking the helm of a speeder with Tarabal as her co-pilot, Talisola headed into action. Steering around falling debris, she alarmed her Zygerrian friend after narrowly dodging a large piece in response to a warning from him, grinning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once on the ground, Talisola stepped into a leadership role while working with Tarabal, Qort and Bibs to assist civilians, and began to think that things might actually go well. During their efforts, Tarabal spotted and alerted Talisola to a piece of debris heading for a building with people on its roof, so she told Qort and Bibs to follow with their hover platform while she and Tarabal hopped into their rescue speeder. As Talisola flew the speeder, Tarabal managed to shoot down the debris just in the nick of time. Talisola complimented him, before wondering how they were going to evacuate the city, as they needed a large craft the people would be able to fit into. Spotting a large ship in the area, Tarabal suggested it to his friend."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cruiser belonged to the Nihil pirates, who were there to evacuate Tromak, a member of the Elders of the Path. The Padawans, led by Talisola, arrived at the building where the spider-shaped ship had landed just after Tromak had asked the pirates not to kill Zeen Mrala and Krix Kamerat, two young members of the group who had been attempting to persuade the pirates to allow the use of their ship as an evacuation vessel. With her lightsaber already ignited, Talisola politely insisted that the pirates' vessel was required for evacuation immediately. Bibs was concerned that they hadn't asked nicely, and one pirate snapped that they were not going to hand over their ship to childen, especially \"snivelling\" Jedi. As Mrala and Kamerat dove out of the way, a firefight occurred as the Nihil opened fire on the Padawans, who deflected the shots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sight of Talisola and her friends fighting awed Mrala, who as a Force-sensitive in a sect that spurned its use had been trying to hide her powers all her life. Mrala realized that she could be like the Jedi and use her powers for good. After deflecting the first barrage, Talisola retorted to the pirates that she had been \"asking nicely\" earlier, and Tarabal declared that they would take the ship. As the Padawans leapt forward again, Talisola and Mrala both sensed a large piece of debris heading straight for their position. The two girls, strangers to each other, moved as one, Mrala leaping out to hold off the debris while Talisola Force pushed away attacking pirates. The Padawans were shocked at Mrala's actions, but Talisola stepped in to help her when the untrained girl began to lose her hold on the debris, reassuring her that they had her back. A shocked Kamerat was dragged away by Tromak as another figure emerged from the Nihil ship, declaring that the Jedi were right where he wanted them. As the pirates surrounded the Padawans and Mrala, the figure ordered their execution."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarabal asked her what they were going to do, and Talisola declared that they had no choice but to fight. Masters Yoda and Buck shortly arrived to assist the apprentices, and Talisola and her friends were taken aback by the Chagrian's dramatic \"Buckets of Blood\" nickname before leaping into action. As the battle raged, Mrala asked the Masters for help, as Kamerat had apparently been captured by the Nihil. Talisola immediately backed her up, telling the Masters how Mrala had helped them by using the Force, and offered to sneak around and rescue Kamerat herself. Yoda overruled her and said he would do it himself, telling Buck that Talisola was right about their duty to Mrala when the Jedi healer expressed concern about his ability to lead the Padawans to safety by himself. In the thick of battle, Tarabal shouted a warning to Talisola and Yoda about a projectile flung in their direction by a Gigoran pirate, which Yoda swiftly destroyed. Talisola was visibly impressed, and after Yoda headed off with Mrala's pet, Cham Cham, she reassured Master Buck that the Jedi could handle the situation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Talisola led the charge as she, her fellow Padawans, Mrala and Buck waded into battle. In response to Tarabal asking how they were looking, Talisola complimented Mrala's use of telekinesis during the battle, saying she was a natural. Tarabal then spotted Buck, who was in danger of being overwhelmed, and Talisola rallied the Padawans to rescue him, driving the pirates back. Just then, a Republic rescue fleet arrived to assist, leading Buck to proclaim that they were saved. In the aftermath, as Republic ships began landing, Talisola and Tarabal asked Buck why he called himself Buckets of Blood, but neither apprentice found his explanation, about keeping blood inside the body, to be very convincing. Just after the Spider Cruiser took off, Talisola and her fellow apprentices were surprised by the arrival of Yoda, who stated it was imperative that the ship be stopped. Returning Cham Cham to Mrala with the news that he may have eaten a pirate's arm, Yoda told her that she had to come to the Starlight Beacon with them, and he had not been able to rescue Kamerat because he had not wanted to be rescued. Talisola put a hand on Mrala's shoulder to comfort her. The Nihil ship escaped the system by firing on a medical frigate as a diversion."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A new friend"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While travelling to the Beacon on the Star Hopper, Talisola comforted a crying Mrala, who admitted to her that she had left the only place she had lived that felt like home. Mrala added that she might not have had a true home because those who raised her would not have accepted her for who she really was, and Talisola responded that she had left her home so young that she did not remember it, but had found a new one with her friends. Talisola said that she and her friends had Mrala's back, and Tarabal and Qort backed up her statement. She further assured Mrala, as the cruiser prepared to dock with Starlight, that they were going to the best place in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the following week, Talisola and her friends easily incorporated Mrala into their group as they had fun together. At the end of that week, Talisola went to Mrala's room to inform her that the Jedi Masters wanted to speak to her, walking in on her crying as she had just watched a message Kamerat had sent her through paired holoprojectors given to them by Yoda. Talisola asked her what was wrong, and Mrala said she was simply processing the changes in her life before asking the Padawan what she wanted. As Talisola was explaining, however, Masters Yoda, Buck, Sy, Estala Maru and Avar Kriss arrived, Sy asking if they were interrupting. Kriss said that they wanted to talk to Mrala about her future plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Masters' discussion, Maru pointed out that Mrala was too old to begin Jedi training, but Kriss noted that they did not know what conditions were like on Trymant IV and Sy argued that Mrala got along well with the apprentices, including Talisola. The topic led Talisola to interrupt, suggesting that they should ask Mrala what she wanted to do as her opinion was the most important, and Tarabal backed her up, adding that they also ask the various Padawans and younglings Mrala had befriended, whose opinions were second most important."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lula Talisola was a human female with brown skin, brown eyes and dark brown hair styled in many braids. She was intelligent and skilled, but was unsure of herself due to her skills never having been tried, and was nervous about her first mission on Trymant IV, although she did not show her nervousness externally. She frequently looked out for her best friends, Farzala and Qort, when they got up to mischief. When she did go into action on Trymant IV, she naturally fitted into a leadership role with her fellow apprentices. When approaching the Nihil to request the use of their ship, she considered insisting on it first was \"asking nicely\" before resorting to violence after being fired upon. She also reassured Zeen Mrala that she had her back when helping the girl, who was a complete stranger, hold back falling hyperspace debris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Talisola was also quick to advocate that the Jedi had a duty to help Mrala rescue her friend Krix Kamerat, since she had helped them.
