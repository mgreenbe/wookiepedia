The outpost was surrounded by trees on all sides apart from a short clear path to the south that ended at the river, which had to be crossed to access the base. The outpost consisted of a troop center in its middle, where B1-Series battle droids were manufactured, and a power core that generated energy to speed up the troop center's droid production. A light wall and a gate surrounded the outpost, and four sentry posts were built on the path to it to alert the Trade Federation of approaching enemies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The outpost was constructed during the war between the Trade Federation and Alaris Prime's rightful Wookiee colonists, which occurred between the years 39 BBY and 36 BBY, to provide B1 battle droids for the Trade Federation Droid Army. It was commanded by the GWC-04 with a garrison of five battle droids. As part of the war, the Trade Federation attacked the Wookiee Chieftain Attichitcuk, and in response, his son, Chewbacca, planned to drive the company from the moon, choosing the outpost as his first target. In preparation for the attack, the Wookiees made a base to the south of the outpost, on the other side of the river."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When his scouts located the base, Chewbacca crossed the river with a strike force of twelve Wookiees, including bowcaster-wielding troopers, grenade troopers, and katarn-riding dragon troopers, and commenced the attack. Acting on the recommendation of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, an advisor to the Wookiees, the dragon and grenade troopers brought down the light walls first, as they were far weaker than the large gate. These troops then moved through the breach to destroy the troop center while the bowcaster troopers defeated the five battle droids defending the outpost. Chewbacca went on to destroy the Trade Federation's other bases to remove the company from Alaris Prime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trade Federation outpost was first referenced in Prima Games' 2001 strategy guide for the LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, before appearing in the game itself in \"Exploration and Transport,\" the fifth level of the Attichitcuk campaign. The objective of the level is to build an army of Wookiees to destroy the outpost. The location of the outpost is revealed on the mini-map from the very start, in order to aid the player while they grasp the game's mechanics; throughout the rest of the game, enemy bases must first be scouted before they appear on the map. The strategy guide states that a few battle droids await the player on the path to the base; however, these droids do not appear in the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
