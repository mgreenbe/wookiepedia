Considered ruthless even by the standards of his people, and adept at treachery and combat, Skal'nas reached his high rank by fighting his way up from low beginnings and had a bad temper. Trill, Skal'nas's Force Hound, sensed a Force-rich planet deep within the Deep Core but could not precisely locate it, so Skal'nas summoned Predor Tul'kar and his force hound Xesh to help him find it. When Xesh said he could locate the world, Skal'nas followed protocol and let Tul'kar be the one to invade it, but also said that they would share the prize. However, the planned invasion came to naught when Tul'kar's ship crashed over Tython and Tul'kar himself was murdered by his own Force Hound Xesh. Not knowing what had happened, Skal'nas thought that Tul'kar had disabled his ship's reporting device so he would be able to keep all of the planet for himself. Enraged by this, he sent Trill to find Tython, and Xesh and Tul'kar, and bring both of them back dead or alive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born within Infinite Space, Skal'nas was sensitive to the Force like the rest of his species.

However, during the culling, the planet's massive cities were destroyed, eventually turning the planet into a desert seas. While transporting the sensitives, Skal'nas sent Ore'mun to Tatooine to send Tul'kar back to Rakata Space while Ore'mun watched over the culling. However, Tul'kar killed Skal'nas' messenger and ate him. Soon, Tul'kar returned to Skal'nas with his Force Hound to find out what he wanted. Skal'nas informed Tul'kar of Trill being able to sense a Force-rich world in the Deep Core, but wasn't able to find it.

During the invasion, Skal'nas and his fleet came across the Je'daii, who fought to defend their home. Soon, Ceh'let's ship was being fired upon and Skal'nas told the female Rakata to retreat, and she did so, but not before defying him. Skal'nas retreated to Ska Gora, where Ceh'let would later join him. Skal'nas told Ceh'let that the Rakata were starting to lose their Force-sensitivity and that the Rakata would need to start using the Infinity Gates on Tython. He also said that they would rule Tython together once they defeated the Je'daii, though this was a lie. Once Ceh'let lowered her defenses, Skal'nas killed her with Force lightning for defying him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, on Tython, Skal'nas dueled both Xesh and his brother, only to be sliced across the chest, falling to his death within a pool of acid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
