By the fourth year before the Battle of Yavin, he led a band of thugs on the planet Ammon IV. He and his henchmen wanted to seize a piece of land inhabited by a human named Jarret and his family, but the latter refused to have their homestead confiscated. One day, as Kruno came to confront Jarret once again, their quarrel was interrupted by the sudden arrival of Ketsu Onyo, a visibly heat-exhausted woman who was dragging a large box behind her. As the parched Onyo hurled herself on the farm's water through, Kruno asked her who she was, but she did not respond. When one of the thugs pried the box open, revealing Imperial grade blaster rifle, Kruno decided to appropriate them. With as much energy as she could muster, Onyo tried to stop them, stating that there was \"something they needed to know\" about those blasters. Confused and angry, Kruno barked at her, ordering her to tell more. The woman, however, chose to show rather than tell; she activated a remote control device, which caused prominent blue lights on the blasters to turn bright red. Noticing this, Kruno and his men reacted with surprise, and all the blasters suddenly explosed spectacularly, taking the gang out with them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
