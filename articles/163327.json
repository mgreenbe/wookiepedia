Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, the facility was under contract to the Galactic Empire. Circa 1 ABY, Stephax Dain, a lieutenant of the Corellian technology-hating terrorist organization known as the Meatlumps, launched an ambitious attack on the facility. A rival lieutenant by the name of Kaiya Merel was not keen on letting Dain take all the credit. She tasked a spacer to travel to Rori in order to disrupt the facility operations before him. The spacer succeeded in doing so, but ended up killing both Stephax Dain and a number of Meatlump pronks who had already taken over the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Weapons Research Facility was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
