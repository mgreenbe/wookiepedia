The wonders Vicendi chose ranged from the towering, pre-Republic Statue of Xim to the crystal city of Calius saj Leeloo on the planet Berchest, and from the fire-breathing Caliginous Automaton of Tomo-Reth to the massive library on Obroa-skai known as the Celebratus Archive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many beings found fault with Vicendi's list, however, arguing that it was overly focused on wonders of the early Republic and placed too much emphasis on the Core Worlds region rather than the galaxy as a whole.
