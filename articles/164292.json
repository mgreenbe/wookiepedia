After crashlanding on the planet, the Weik settlers underwent a technological regression and the collapse of civilization and industry. Over the millennia, the people recovered and began to reinvent technologies long thought of archaic across the civilized galaxy. Wind-ships were a product of the ingenuity of the people of Weik, using their understanding of the wind currents to create boats which floated atop the waves and was powered by sails that caught the wind. Duros captains led cargo ships across the planet and allowed for global trade and commerce to develop."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
