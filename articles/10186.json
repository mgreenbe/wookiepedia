The aim was to eliminate insurgents. Darth Vader and a stormtrooper detachment were deployed to the surface in order to do this and were successful. Just when they had control of the moon, Ahr withdrew the stormtroopers though he kept Vader on the moon surface. Vader finished off the rest of the insurgents to the surprise of Ahr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
