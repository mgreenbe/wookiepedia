When none returned, Roland Wann enlisted the services of Revan to do the same, promising that this would in turn lead Revan to the Star Map that he sought. Revan discovered that almost everyone on the station had been killed and eaten by maddened Selkath who had been driven insane by the calls of the Progenitor. In order to pacify the Progenitor, who was distressed by the construction encroaching upon her lair, Revan destroyed the Hrakert kolto harvester. Once the Progenitor had been placated, she allowed Revan access to the Star Map near the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The station later became the secret headquarters of the Order of Shasa, a Force-sensitive Selkath cult."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the player chooses to follow the dark side story, Revan releases a chemical that kills the Progenitor but turns the kolto black.
