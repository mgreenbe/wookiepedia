A large man, he wore a suit of armor including a mirrored helmet that hid his identity. Major Gaevril Daraada dispatched Graphyt to stop the New Republic operative Shandria L'hnnar and the thief Sienn Sconn to stop them escaping from the planet Venaari. Sconn fought Graphyt on top of a stolen SV-50 Swift-Strike Speeder. Initially, Graphyt had the upper hand using his strength and size against Sconn. However, Sconn managed to puncture the coolant tanks of Graphyt's rocket pack, strapped several thermal half-spheres to the bounty hunter, then used him as a makeshift missile to destroy an Imperial blockade of the spaceport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
