And at the feet of its wise Masters, Lanoree Brock learned the mysteries and methods of the Force\u2014and found her calling as one of its most powerful disciples. But as strongly as the Force flowed within Lanoree and her parents, it remained absent in her brother, who grew to despise and shun the Je'daii, and whose training in its ancient ways ended in tragedy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now, from her solitary life as a Ranger keeping order across the galaxy, Lanoree has been summoned by the Je'daii Council on a matter of utmost urgency.

But if an error occurred, a black hole will form and swallow up the Tython System, causing the deaths of all the inhabitants. He wants to do this because he believes that it will allow the inhabitants of the system to expand outward throughout the galaxy.

By the end of the novel, Lanoree tracks Dalien back to Tython itself where he plans to activate the hypergate. She stops him by killing him with her sword, but she is left with not only the question of whether or not Dalien was right to pursue this, but with regret of killing her own brother."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
