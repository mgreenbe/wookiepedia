They were built in orbital shipyards and almost never entered planets' atmosphere; they docked instead at space stations and transfer yards where they loaded and unloaded cargo. Most of these freighters were owned by corporations, as they were very expensive and only few captains have the possibility to acquire and maintain craft of these dimensions. The Eravana, Han Solo and Chewbacca's Baleen-class heavy freighter, was a bulk freighter, owned only by two individuals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
