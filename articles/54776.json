Early into the conflict, the Master-Padawan pair was assigned to team up with Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Padawan Anakin Skywalker in investigating the mysterious communications blackout on the Gungan colony moon, Ohma-D'un. Arriving on the moon, the Jedi discovered that a toxic bioweapon had been released on the moon's population and all of the Gungan's wiped out.
