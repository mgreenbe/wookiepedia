It hovered on repulsors scavenged from a security droid. To contain the Tirrith, a translucent pinkish ball of hermetically sealed transparisteel is placed on top of the base. The vents that release volatile gas are located on each globe's base. An electric prod powered by a small Vuvritech 44 generator bolted onto the side ensured that the Tirrith are kept agitated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
