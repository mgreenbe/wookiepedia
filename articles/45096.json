Datoo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Erich S. Datoo was a human male military officer who held the rank of colonel in the First Order. In 34 ABY, Datoo was in charge of the primary fire control room on the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon. Under orders from Supreme Leader Snoke, he oversaw the weapon as it destroyed the Hosnian system, the location of the New Republic Galactic Senate. The weapon then began preparing to fire on the Ileenium system, where the Resistance headquarters was located; however, Resistance forces then attacked the superweapon. As it became clear the base was going to be destroyed, Datoo was shocked to see Lieutenant Rodinon trying to leave the control room, and questioned where he was going, although the latter talked back and bluntly pointed out that they needed to evacuate or else they won't survive, citing that even the base's commander, Hux, had already evacuated. Starkiller Base then exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Datoo was a methodical officer who believed that the destructive power of Starkiller Base should command respect from all members of the First Order.
