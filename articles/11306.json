Coming into possession of the storage container holding the super droids, along with a single B1-series battle droid, the pirate Sidon Ithano sold them to another pirate, Captain Kragan Gorr. Gorr used them in his attempted mutiny on the supertanker fuel depot Colossus. However, mechanic Neeku Vozo had reprogrammed the B1, simply nicknaming him \"B1\" as well, to serve as the new droid commander. With the battle droids on their side, the crew of the Colossus forced Kragan and the rest of the Warbird gang to leave their station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
