However, they appear more than anything else to be a game mechanic, and are not mentioned in any other source, apart from fleetingly in Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines. This does not rule out the possibility that were a standard armament on most small ships, as Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance suggests; however, they are merely not mentioned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
