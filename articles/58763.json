In 3643 BBY, Hacklin accompanied the Sith to the Ord Mantell Orbital Station when Angral's spies identified Jedi Padawan Kira Carsen's presence on the space station. Angral, who was searching for Carsen's Master in an effort to avenge the death of his son, Tarnis, interrogated Carsen with Hacklin and Inquisitor Ferav, though Carsen managed to trick the trio into believing the Jedi Knight was on Corellia.
