They were well adapted to life on the world's fiery surface due to their tough exoskeletons, and ate through the planet's crust, forming a variety of underground caves where the native sentient Mustafarian species would inhabit. Due to the unforgiving nature of Mustafar, the Mustafarians had to make the most of the hardy native creatures and tamed lava fleas to use as mounts. Visitors to the world from other species also used the fleas for transport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lava fleas first appeared in the 2005 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
