Darth Sidious was the most powerful and notorious user of this power, having hid his dark nature for over three decades from the Jedi High Council, even when in the same room. It has been argued that Revan may have used the technique to shield his true light side affiliation on Korriban in order to infiltrate the Sith Academy. Darth Traya used a powerful version of this to evade both the surviving Jedi and her Sith apprentices, as well as mask her nature from her own student, Meetra Surik who in turn may have mastered this ability. Other users included the Jensaarai, who constantly hid their presence in the Force from both the Sith under Darth Vader and the New Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xanatos used this kind of power to shield his presence when he infiltrated the Jedi Temple.

When properly applied and maintained, a Sith Lord or Dark Jedi could mask their own dark signatures appearing completely benevolent to even the most powerful and alert Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Known users of the Quey'tek meditation included Asajj Ventress, Darth Tyranus (although Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker were eventually able to see through his shielding), Darth Maul, and possibly Darth Zannah. Anakin's grandson, Jacen Solo, also used this technique to hide Lumiya's dark presence. Jacen also used it to hide his own emotions from other Force-users whenever he was upset or under stress. Ben Skywalker later gained this power from Jacen and likewise his mother Mara Jade Skywalker learned it from him. Luke Skywalker used this ability to sneak up on Jacen during the Battle of Kashyyyk. Luke's control of this Force ability was so precise he was able to allow certain individuals including his own son to sense his presence when hiding from adversaries. By the time Jacen became Darth Caedus, he had used the power so much that he was able to constantly remain hidden with little effort, and taught the power to his apprentice, Tahiri Veila."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hidden Ones of the Baran Do sages used this power to fake their own deaths during their farewell ceremony.

The original version allowed a Force-user to not only hide his or her Force sensitivity, but increase his or her ability to hide. The Revised version only provides a way to cloak one's connection to the Force, and any use of the Force causes this ability to fail, although Jedi Sentinels can learn to use Force Stealth and Force Camouflage together. The Saga Edition splits the ability into a number of distinct powers and talents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
