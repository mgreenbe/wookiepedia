It vaguely resembled two sawhorses connected by a bar. When a Quor'sav perched and rested upon the structure, the posture triggered a sleep reflex which made the avian become drowsy. Many Quor'sav found this comforting and restful, although the way the device fit around the body could be dangerous should it fall over. In 4 BBY, police officer Waywa Fybot broke his legs when his resting rack toppled during a dogfight involving the Millennium Falcon, upon which he was a passenger. For seating, the Quor'sav utilized a seating rack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
