Elainye's daughter, Arihnda Pryce, approached Senator Renking. The latter agreed to have the charges dropped, but in return, the valuable mine was signed over to the Empire. Renking expected that Pryce would want something in return for letting the doonium go and asked her what that something was. Pryce asked for a job on Coruscant as an assistant, and the senator offered her an opening in the citizen assistance office. Renking told Pryce that she would be representing the interests of Lothal citizens on Coruscant, and she accepted the position and moved to Coruscant to begin working in the office."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While running the office, Pryce received and acted on citizens' complaints. One of the citizens, Daisie, complained to the office about a leaky pipe. When the building's faculty ignored the pipe, Pryce confronted the landlady, Chesna Braker. While Braker was upset, she agreed to have the pipe fixed. Meanwhile, a government program encouraged senators to open new citizen assistance offices. Renking thus opened a new supplementary citizen assistance office in the nearby Bartanish Four Sector, which was open to not only Lothalites, but all citizens. In return for Pryce's good performance, Renking offered her a job as overseer of the new office, which Pryce accepted. Pryce's former office was then reopened in the following week with a new overseer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The office was first mentioned in Timothy Zahn's novel Thrawn, which was published in 2017 as the first installment in the Star Wars: Thrawn trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
