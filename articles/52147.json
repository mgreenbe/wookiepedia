The rogues, smugglers, and adventurers who eke out a living on the largest settlement on the planet, Black Spire Outpost, are here to avoid prying eyes and unnecessary complications. Vi, a Resistance spy on the run from the First Order, is hardly a welcome guest. And when a shuttle full of stormtroopers lands in her wake, determined to root her out, she has no idea where to find help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To survive, Vi will have to seek out the good-hearted heroes hiding in a world that redefines scum and villainy.

Before Moradi can depart for Batuu the next day, Organa transmits an announcement that Hosnian Prime and the Hosnian system have been destroyed by the First Order. Moradi's mission is put on hold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Four months after the Battle of Crait, Moradi's mission is back on. Alongside the PK-Ultra worker droid Pook, she picks up Archex from his enforced healing retreat on Cerea and they journey to Batuu. Their starship is caught in a skirmish between two smuggler ships upon arrival and they are forced to crash land in the forest. While unconscious, their ship is ransacked by the crew of the local crime boss, Oga Garra. A local Batuuan woman, Salju, find them and offers assistance. She gives Moradi a tour of Black Spire Outpost and gets her a job at Savi & Son Salvage to earn money to buy back her own equipment to establish a Resistance base. Through her new work, Moradi meets Ylena and Savi's Gatherers, but fails to recruit them to the Resistance. Due to limited mobility resulting from wounds inflicted by Phasma, Archex must remain hidden in the forest, leaving him feeling useless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moradi is taken by one of Garra's enforcers to meet the crime boss within her cantina. Garra tells her that if she locates an artifact within the ruins and brings it back to Garra, Moradi can have her property back. Moradi secures Garra's agreement that the Resistance may also use the ruins as a base. Meanwhile, the First Order is alerted to the Resistance presence on Batuu, and General Hux dispatches Lieutenant Wulfgar Kath and twenty stormtroopers to inspect the world.

The next day, Moradi goes into town to buy a comm array and defends a Chadra-Fan named Kriki who is being mistreated by her employer. Kriki chooses to join the Resistance, helping Moradi with her errands and fixing up the new base within the ruins, the layout of which is being planned by Archex. Later on, Moradi recruits a drunken but charismatic loudmouth named Zade Kalliday, who helps manage the recruitment of Resistance personnel. Soon after, while Moradi is picking up lunch, she witnesses stormtroopers harassing two old women seeking information on Moradi. When she defends the women, she is overwhelmed by the two troopers, who take her prisoner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After undergoing torture by Kath, Moradi is rescued by her new companions. By then, multiple stormtroopers have been killed, leaving only twelve. Moradi and her three recruits make a plan to get the First Order to leave Batuu despite being outnumbered. She uses a stolen First Order comm link to tap into their network and send out a message to the Resistance, requesting that Organa send supplies and personnel, but Organa informs her that none are available and she has faith in Moradi. Dolin also goes back to his village to recruit for the upcoming attack, but his grandmother disowns him. Having no other options, the group proceeds with their plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moradi pretends to get captured and is again interrogated by Kath.

When Dolin is signaled, the group rushes the transport to further distract Kath and his troops while Kriki works inside the transport; however, they only take down a few while incurring heavy losses as they are not trained soldiers. Just when everything seems lost, a man in red-painted stormtrooper's armor and a black cape emerges from the clearing. It is Archex dressed as his former identity, Captain Cardinal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Archex offers himself as Kath's prisoner, knowing Kath will not leave the planet unless he has something to give his superiors.
