During the battle, numerous starships crashed, leaving wreckage in a desert area later known as the Starship Graveyard. In one portion of the graveyard called the Crackle, a capital ship had crashed, and the impact's heat turned the sand into blackened glass. The crash completely destroyed the ship, leaving only its keel intact; the keel, which had burrowed into the desert sand, held an upright position, and was named \"the Spike.\" About 29 years after the Battle of Jakku, a scavenger named Rey climbed the Spike and was able to see several kilometers from its height. From her perch, she located an intact Ghtroc 690 light freighter shining in the distance as the sun reflected off of its exposed hull."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Spike first appeared in Before the Awakening, a junior novel written by Greg Rucka and published in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
