The series was terminated when the Intergalactic Law Agency was founded during the last century of the Galactic Republic, and the last of the X-1s were collected and scrapped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, a Ranger X-1 brought to the Dodz to protect pioneers was missed by the ILA and found by Jost Ellon near the planet's crystal mines. After meeting R2-D2 and C-3PO, Ellon discovered that the X-1 had corroded power cells and kicked the inert droid, accidentally reactivating it. Despite being low on power, Ellon wanted to use the X-1 to aid the merchants of Dodz against Governor Kugg, who used his killer droid, the Destroyer, to murder those who refused to pay his heavy taxes. Although outmatched, the Ranger was able to destroy the Destroyer when R2 tapped into its power and fed it back into the X-1. The defense droid ran out of energy in a permanently heroic pose, remaining on top of a hill as a reminder of its importance to the people of Dodz for ending Kugg's corrupt reign."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ranger X-1 first appeared in Droids 1, the first issue of the Star Wars Droids comic series published by Star Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics, which was first published on April 1, 1986."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
