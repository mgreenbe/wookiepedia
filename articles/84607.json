It was designed to cram as much killing power as possible into as small a package as possible, and became a standout in the heavy pistol market. The weapon was thick and squat with a large caliber and sold for one thousand credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Instead of the standard rounds, the M9 fired fin-stabilized grenades from a box magazine, giving the user respectable anti-personnel capabilities at a medium range. The weapon's downsides included a limited payload, poor accuracy and cumbersome handling.
