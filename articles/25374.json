The Mandalorian flies the starship with Grogu in his cradle. The Mandalorian is contacted via Holographic projector by Greef Karga who has received his transmission. He orders him to deliver his quarry directly to the Client. Karga does not care about what the Client wants to do with it, but says the Client is very anxious. He reminds the Mandalorian about their prearranged venue. The Child picks up a ball but the Mandalorian takes it away, telling him it is not a toy. He puts the Child back in his cradle before taking the ship down to the planet below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He lands the ship in the settlement's spaceport and disembarks with the Child in a cradle as another ship lands nearby. The two move through the streets, walking past humanoids, droids and aliens. The Mandalorian takes the Child back to the Imperial remnant facility.

The Child reacts in surprise as the droid retracts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly later, a pair of Remnant Stormtroopers exit the house. The Child lowers its ears and head.

The stormtroopers lead the Child and the Mandalorian to the Client and Doctor Pershing, who are delighted to see him. Pershing scans the Child with a glowing red device while the Mandalorian watches."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pershing remarks that the Child is very healthy. The Client tells the Mandalorian that his reputation is not unwarranted. When the Mandalorian asked how many tracking fobs he gave out, the Client tells him that the Asset was of extreme importance to him. He had to insure its delivery. but promises the spoils to the winner: a container containing several bars of beskar. The Client remarks that the Asset is \"such a large bounty, for such a small package\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Child cries as Pershing leads him into an adjacent room. When the Mandalorian asks the Client what are his plans for the Child, the Client say that it is uncharacteristic for one of his reputation and commission to ask such a question, since it is the code of the Bounty Hunters' Guild that such events are \"forgotten\" once they have been delivered. The Client says that the beskar is enough to make a handsome replacement for his armor, but that finding a Mandalorian able to forge it is more difficult than finding the steel."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "An icy homecoming"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian walks through the marketplace and returns to the underground lair of the Tribe with his reward.

The Mandalorian says that his armor, damaged during the mission to Arvala-7, had lost its integrity, and that it might need to be reforged.

The female Mandalorian armorer responds that their secrecy is their survival, and that their survival is their strength.

She reminds them that when one chooses to walk the way of the Mandalorian, they are both \"hunter and prey\". She asks how can one be a coward if one chooses this way of life. She asks the Mandalorian if he has ever removed his helmet, and if it has been removed by others, and he says no. The Mandalorians, including Vizla, chant \"this is the way\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The female armorer then asks the Mandalorian what caused the damage to his armor. He replies that it was a mudhorn, and the female armorer replies that he has earned the mudhorn as his signet, and that she will craft the new armor.

When she asks why an enemy would help him in battle, he explains that it did not know it was his enemy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since the Mandalorian has forgone a signet, the armorer decides to use the beskar to forge whistling birds.
