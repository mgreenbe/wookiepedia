Jimba was among the ones to lead the attack on the droids and personally jumped on top of R2-D2 to deliver the final blow. After the two droids were overpowered, Jimba called the other Patitites to tell the Big Hay-Zu for, as the overlord of the Patitite people, he would know what to do. After binding the droids down, Jimba proceeded to explain the power of the Great Hay-Zu and how he sent the \"lucky\" children off to fight his wars. However, R2 accidentally fell on Hay-Zu, killing him. Jimba and her fellow Patitites cheered and praised the droids as a result of this. With Tagoo, Jimba requested that C-3PO would stay as their new leader, for he was the one to defeat the Great Hay-Zu, to which he refused. After creating the foundations of democracy, the two droids left the Patitites to argue over the future leadership."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jimba was voiced by David Acord in the episode \"Nomad Droids.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
