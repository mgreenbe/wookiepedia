He was the owner of the R2-series astromech droid, R2-RC and the ship, G Cat, and was instrumental in the rescue of Rivoche Tarkin and the capture of the Super Star Destroyer Guardian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When his nephew Sienn Sconn's parents were killed during the Ryvellia uprising, Cavv travelled to V'eldalv to rescue the boy. He then raised him as his own. Cavv spent time on Contruum where he worked with Cracken as part of Cracken's Crew."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rescuing Rivoche Tarkin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after 0 BBY, Cavv reported to Cracken and reminisced about old times. Cracken revealed that an Imperial spy had infiltrated the Rebel Alliance and stole an encrypted list of deep cover agents. Cavv learned he wasn't on the list, but was informed that the niece of Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends, Rivoche Tarkin, was and needed to be extracted to safety immediately. Cavv agreed to take on the mission, and requested some assistance. Cracken introduced him to Quillin Arkell, who the general had picked to accompany Cavv to Corulag."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cavv and Arkell departed on the G Cat. As Cavv attempted to make small talk with Arkell, the Velbari told the thief that is was dishonorable to associate with him. Cavv joked with the warrior, but Arkell became insulted and stood up to confront Cavv. Due to the cramped confines of the starship, he knocked himself unconcious before getting to Cavv. The thief put him in a bunk and applied first aid. When the warrior regained consciousness, Cavv talked about the Velabri Bloodvow and Arkell told him on why he was serving under Cracken."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the ship approached Corulag, Cavv prepared his disguise as an Imperial noble so they could land on the planet without drawing suspicion. Arkell recognized the G Cat as a Helix-class light interceptor but Cavv assured him that he had the proper paperwork that would prevent any inspection. He told Arkell that the warrior would have to assume the role of a bodyguard. When they arrived at the planet, they were stunned to see a huge armada of ships in orbit. R2-RC received a transmission that welcomed them to the engagement party of Vastin Caglio and Rivoche Tarkin. Cavv quickly realized that party would be excellent cover for infiltrating the planet and ordered his droid to add them to the invitation list. He and Arkell landed on the planet and made their way to Tarkin's apartment. After attempting to bluff their way in, Cavv gave Tarkin the passphrase that identified himself and told her she had to leave immediately."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before they could escape, ISB officer Sollaine arrived with a group of Storm Commandos to arrest Tarkin. Cavv shoved a package containing thermite into his hands and locked the door of the apartment. The thief used a detonator to remotely explode the package, blowing a hole in the side of the building. After escaping the building, the group took to the streets of Curamelle in an attempt to get to the spaceport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cavv was concerned about the extensive patrols and Imperial forces, and deduced that Moff Jamson Caglio had presumed Tarkin was kidnapped while Sollaine knew she was a spy who was trying to get to safety. Despite the knowledge, he was still unsure of how to get off-planet until he realized that his droid could bring the ship to him. Tarkin informed him the tallest building in the city was the Royal Galaxy Hotel so Caav decided to use the roof as a rendezvous point. Once they got to the hotel, Caav broken into a hotel room so they could wait for backup. Caav had used security cameras to check the roof and noticed that Sollaine and a group of bounty hunters were waiting to ambush them. Once Finn Varatha arrived and was introduced to everyone, Cavv led the group to the roof where they defeated the assembled bounty hunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Escaping the planet, Cavv attempted to pilot the G Cat through the armada of ships in orbit and avoid Imperial ships trying to capture him. He found himself face to face with the Star Destroyer Devastator commanded by Solliane. Cavv performed evasive maneuvers and the Devastator gave chase. Before the ship could get a tractor beam lock on the G Cat, Darth Vader arrived in the Super Star Destroyer Executor. This provided Cavv enough cover to get away and jump to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cavv returned to Cracken and received congratulations on a job well done.
