Formerly known as the LiMerge Power building, the abandoned tower served as Darth Sidious's secret hideout, with him using it to meet his Sith apprentice Darth Tyranus, publicly known as Count Dooku, after the initiation of the Clone Wars. Later during the war, when they sensed that Grand Master Yoda of the Jedi Order was on Moraband, the ancient Sith homeworld, the two Sith Lords conducted a dark side ritual in the tower. Although the ritual failed, Sidious and Dooku planned to use the ritual to tempt Yoda, breaking his will and further weakening the Jedi Order from within."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tower later served as the headquarters of the Inquisitorius, a dark side organization of Imperial Jedi hunters tasked with eliminating remaining Jedi after their destruction, following the rise of the Galactic Empire.

The skyscraper was located in The Works, an industrial district located on the planet Coruscant, capital of the Galactic Republic. The base of the building was composed of three large fins that met at the mid-section of the structure, and from one of which extended a smaller secondary structure that, during the Clone Wars, was connected to the main building by several derelict walkways. A large, central, cylindrical pillar with a coned head protruded from the mid-section. Also in the mid-section was a secret hangar with multiple hatches that opened upwards, enabling ships as large as a Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop to enter and exit. Upon entering the hangar, the ceremonial chamber was to the left, which was donned with statues.

After Dooku arrived from his flagship, Sidious greeted Dooku and led him to the tower's ceremonial chamber which was lined with statues positioned in a circle with a sacrificial altar basin at its center.
