Having finally broken a siege by the Maulers of local farmers, Typho, who was at that time in command of the RSF branch in Keren, ordered an unknown number of Royal Security Police Force agents, who had previously been under the command of Quarsh Panaka during the successful attack on a Skaak Tipper base, during which Jonni Skaak was killed, to help the Keren police make sure that the remaining Maulers would not further harm the citizens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The operation"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Confiscation of five weapons crates"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The RSF agents arrived, infiltrated a local Mauler Stronghold, and fought the remaining Maulers, killing at least fifteen of them, before securing the area. As a result of the operation, the RSF learned that the Maulers were in possession of five crates of experimental weapons which were located in a secondary base. Typho immediately dispatched the agents to the secondary base to find and confiscate these weapons crates. The RSF agents managed to located the secondary base and the crates, which were originally stolen by the Maulers during the siege. After engaging in combat with the Maulers, killing at least five Mauler Champions in the process, the RSF agents managed to secure the five crates. The operation being a success, Typho ordered the RSF agents to initiate a second stage of the operation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Decrypting communications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suspecting that the Maulers were planning a major military operation, potentially involving the experimental weapons, Typho ordered the RSF agents to further investigate the matter to determine whether his suspicions were grounded or not. Having rendered at least seven Mauler Apprentices incapable of fighting, the RSF agents found seven communiqu\u00e9s in the Mauler Apprentice Camp, which were encrypted. From his command post in Keren, Typho suggested that perhaps they could obtain a decoding device from one of the resident Mauler Lords. Having defeated an unknown number of Lords, the RSF agents finally found the device, and proceeded to the Theed Royal Palace to decrypt the messages, only to learn that a Mauler warlord was planning to take control of the gang and stage a major assault on Keren."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A final effort"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Distressed with the newly acquired information, Typho ordered the RSF agents to return to the secondary base and assassinate the Mauler Usurper before the attack on Keren could be staged.
