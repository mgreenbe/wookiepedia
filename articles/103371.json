The cord was similar in function to a Whipcord launcher, in that when fired it unspooled a large amount of animated cord, that proceeded to wrap itself around a target. Unlike a whipcord however, a paralysis cord kept on unspooling, until it had completely bound an enemy in its coils. Essentially, this paralyzed the victim, as the tight coils disabled a sentients ability to move. Some models of paralysis cord had conductive metals interwoven through its fabric, in which after enveloping an enemy, a powercell would electrify the cord, and further incapacitate the target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
