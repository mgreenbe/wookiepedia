Before leaving, Skywalker orders CT-7567 to keep firing the Republic's heavy cannons at the enemy. Skywalker contacts Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala via the hologram, and learns that she has captured Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. He advises her that she must be careful with Gunray.

Eventually, Skywalker tells his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, that she will go to Rodia and oversee the transfer of Gunray to Coruscant for trial. At first, Tano shows less enthusiasm with her new assignment and wants to stay with Skywalker to help him cut through enemy lines, but Skywalker tells his Padawan that she must protect Amidala and make sure she is safe. A Nu-class attack shuttle soon arrives and departs the planet with Tano on board. Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Master Mace Windu contact Tano via hologram and explain to her that Skywalker has given her the assignment without the Jedi Council's approval. Though Tano tells the Jedi Masters that Skywalker felt that her given assignment was important, Windu then reveals that Master Luminara Unduli has already been assigned to oversee the transfer of Gunray."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano defends her Master's orders and tells Yoda and Windu that she is less than three parsecs away from Rodia.
