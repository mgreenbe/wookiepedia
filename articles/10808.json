Even though Ponc Gavrisom and Leia Organa Solo were on the Predominance's bridge trying to defuse the crisis, and Av'muru was aware that the battle began due to the machinations of a third party, this touched off a battle between the pro- and anti-Bothan fleets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Organa Solo realized that cloaked ships, probably belonging to the Imperial Remnant, were in the area, she used the Force to take control of the Predominance's helm.
