The Hasty Harpy was shot down by the Death Watch's vessel, so Breakout Squad found other transportation to Bilbringi Depot to search for Kungurama's missing Jedi Master, Ring-Sol Ambase. They did not find Ambase, but they freed the depot from Techno Union Overseer Umbrag. They also once again met the Chiss Ambassador Veeren.

The Clawdite, a male individual, surreptitiously replaced Sharp during the Mission to Kynachi and took the Clone's place in Breakout Squad, while the Jedi General Ring-Sol Ambase and Sharp were captured and put in the hands of the Confederacy of Independent Systems' leader Count Dooku. Breakout Squad, the Clawdite, and Ambase's Padawan Nuru Kungurama joined with Captain Lalo Gunn and her navigation droid Cleaver and left Kynachi in Gunn's starship, the Hasty Harpy.

Breaker noticed a broadcast signal and thought the ship had a tracking device on it. Republic Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Jedi Grand Master Yoda contacted the Hasty Harpy via Hypercomm and asked them to divert to Vaced to rendezvous and escort Kynachi's Commissioner, Langu Sommilor. The Hasty Harpy was five hours from Vaced, while Sommilor's ship was six hours away.

They were confronted by a swoop gang looking to collect insurance payments, but Kungarama used a mind trick to force them to dispense. \"Sharp\" then offered to be a lookout, but Kungarama asked him to search the ship for a transmitter. Cleaver found the tracking device but it was forgotten in the following events. The Kynachi leader and his pilots soon landed nearby, but was hit by a sniper as he was disembarking. The Clones ran for cover while Kungarama chased after the sniper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Clones went back on the Hasty Harpy to rescue the Padawan after he fought the sniper, a Mandalorian Death Watch member. The Harpy was attacked by the Mandalorian's transport. The Harpy shot down the other vessel but was damaged in the process and crashed near Vaced's spaceport. Breakout Squad and Captain Gunn parted ways; the Republic troopers, along with the rogue swoop rider, Gizman, took the deceased Kynachi ambassador's ship. Kungarama had found a belt belonging to his Master, Ambase, which had an imagecaster with coordinates leading to Bilbringi Depot. The Clones arrived there and captured Techno Union Overseer Umbrag. After the facility was secured, Chiss Ambassador Veeren arrived. She revealed that it was she who had planted the tracking device Cleaver still carried on his chassis, and that it appeared someone was manipulating Breakout Squad. Kungarama was confused, but Veeren left just as quickly as she arrived. As her ship was preparing to jump to hyperspace, a Kuat Drive Yards Corona-class transport arrived. Veeren's shp fired on the Corona; return fire from the Kuat transport destroyed her ship. Kungarama Force sensed that his missing Master, Ambase, was onboard the Corona. Breakout Squad could only watch while Ambase's ship fled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A hidden battle droid then surprised them by shooting Chatterbox in the back.

Once inside the empty corridor, he removed his helmet and reverted to his true form. He thought what would have happened if the droid had shot him instead.

During the trip, Umbrag grabbed the young Jedi, forcing the Clawdite to shoot him. At Coruscant, Ventress made contact and ordered the bounty hunter to help the overseer escape, and cut him off before he could explain that Umbrag was dead. Kungurama directed the ship to the Dacho District, where it was damaged. The real Sharp had already arrived with Master Ambase, and when Sharp saw the Clawdite, he tackled the impostor and they fell through a skylight. Sharp fell on top of him, and the Clawdite died when he landed.
