The Hutt had him commission the Khetanna and his fleet of skiffs from the Ubrikkian Corporation. Flet also designed additions to his palace on Tatooine, focusing on the dungeons. Flet provided Jabba with almost everything he wanted, making the palace function as both a stately manor and fortress; however, he failed to provide adequate space for Jabba's prisoners, leaving the existing dungeons intact. This made Jabba so furious that he had Flet killed immediately."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jabba's architect from Star Wars: Republic: Outlander may be the same character as Derren Flet.
