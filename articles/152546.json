After Revan returned to Lehon to destroy the Star Forge, the Elder Council told this Rakata to perform a chant with several others, which allowed Revan to get access to the Temple of the Ancients. This Rakata was hopeful that Revan would destroy the Star Forge, and his hopes was fulfilled when Revan destroyed the Star Forge, though it is unknown whether or not Revan aided this Rakata and the others in going back to galactic society."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
