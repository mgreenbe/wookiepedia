Mere hours before the Battle of Yavin, Thlu-Ry helped with the Death Star's final alignment tests and was lucky enough to leave the space station prior to its destruction. The professor was a colleague with Cylo, an Imperial doctor-turned-traitor, and in the time after the Battle of Yavin Darth Vader confronted Thlu-Ry aboard the Executor, demanding to know the location of Cylo's whale fleet. Thlu-Ry complied, revealing the location to be the Crushank Nebulae. Vader left, and when the Sith Lord located the renegade fleet, he signaled the Executor to thank Thlu-Ry before executing the professor for fraternizing with a traitor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thlu-Ry was created for Darth Vader 21, a 2016 comic book written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Salvador Larroca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
