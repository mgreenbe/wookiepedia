She had spent several nights with Wedge during their days on Tatooine.

However, thinking about Belina only made Wedge more depressed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the dubious nature of this story and the contradictory backstory given to Wedge in Star Wars 78, it's unknown if Belina actually existed or was simply a fabrication of Wedge's story. The assertion that Wedge apparently met Belina when he was growing up on Tatooine, when he was actually from Corellia, may point more heavily towards the latter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
