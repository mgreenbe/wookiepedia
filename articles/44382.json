The bounty hunter Shalla Mondatha was known to wield one such weapon. Those built by the Nightsisters of Dathomir were plasma-based. The soldier Jannah used a variant of the energy bow that imparted an energetic charge to a physical arrow during the war between the First Order and the Resistance. Omega, the unaltered clone of Jango Fett, also wielded a Zygerrian energy bow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
