However, they were hunted by the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Slave I, which chased the shuttle through space. Pershing asked what was going on, but the co-pilot told him to be quiet. The pilots attempted to outmaneuver the Slave I, but the attack craft soon immobilized Shuttle 2743 with an Ion cannon shot.

The shuttle co-pilot introduced Pershing to Djarin, who had already met the doctor.

Dune asked the co-pilot to drop his weapon, but the pilot denied her and summarized the importance of Pershing being alive. He also noticed a tear tattoo on the marshal, identifying her as an Alderaanian and taunting her about her homeworld's destruction and condemning the deaths of millions aboard both Death Stars. Dune asked him again to drop his blaster, but he continued, calling the riddance of Alderaan a small price to pay against \"terrorism.\" The marshal thus shot him in the face, and she and her associates used the shuttle to infiltrate Gideon's cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial shuttle co-pilot was a human male with light skin and brown eyes.

His zealous loyalty to the Empire also drove him to murder his fellow pilot when the man tried to bargain as well with the intruders. The co-pilot identified Cara Dune as Alderaanian from her tear drop tattoo, as well as a Rebel dropper, but foolishly chose to taunt her about her destroyed homeworld, which led to his death when the enraged Dune shot him in the face."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The co-pilot donned a black flight suit with the Imperial crest on his shoulders.
