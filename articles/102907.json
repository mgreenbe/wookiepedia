Built over a part of Theed that was heavily bombed by Trade Federation Armored Assault Tanks during the Invasion of Naboo, the Courtyard was meant to nurture and encourage principles of enlightened thought and practice. A huge half-circle with a central islet, the courtyard featured a number of bridges and fountains. Its buildings consisted of several domed structures and a large arcing colonnade running along the courtyard's edge, whithin which a holographic frieze depicted artists and philosophers from Naboo's history. It was connected to the Royal Palace by a long avenue known as the Palace Plaza."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, the Palace Courtyard appeared to be located in front of the Palace and directly linked to it, which suggests that it took the place of the former Palace Plaza, which appeared in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. However, when the original trilogy was released in DVD format in 2004, shots of the Palace Plaza were inserted in the ending sequence of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, creating a discrepancy between the movies. In the 2005 movie Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the location of the Palace Courtyard was modified. The Courtyard opens its two arms towards the Palace Plaza, and is not part of the Palace proper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The brief Courtyard scene in Attack of the Clones was filmed at the Plaza de Espa\u00f1a in Seville, Spain on September 13, 2000. In post-production, Industrial Light & Magic greatly expanded the plaza, which is a half-circle, to create what is seen in the movie."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
