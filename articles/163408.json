Wedge Antilles Boulevard crossed under the wider, elevated Five Brothers Avenue, which had much more traffic than the boulevard. A team of Jedi rode a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle across Wedge Antilles Boulevard in 40 ABY after unsuccessfully attempting to arrest Five World Prime Minister Aidel Saxan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wedge Antilles Boulevard was created by Aaron Allston for his 2006 novel Legacy of the Force: Betrayal.
