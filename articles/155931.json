Tuggs won the majordomo over to the idea by suggesting that they could broadcast the event throughout the castle using cam droids in order to entertain the guests. As there was a storm blowing into the region that the castle was built in on the planet Takodana, the majordomo agreed, as there would be little entertainment otherwise. Tuggs secretly planned to use the contest to root out the member of his staff who had killed his sous chef Robbs Ely, and in the final round was attacked by two of his serving droids, Carly and J'Nell, who had been behind the killing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The majordomo was first mentioned in the short story \"A Recipe for Death\", which was written by Landry Q.
