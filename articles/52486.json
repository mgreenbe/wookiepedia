With no way to move away from the Star Destroyer without being cut to shreds from its turbolasers, Calrissian decides to fly the Falcon into the Executor's hangar bay. Calrissian decides he is safe for the moment and shoots through a tight access corridor, allowing the Falcon to fly through the Executor's numerous hangar bays. The Falcon ends up in what appears to be a staging area, alerting a ground crew, before colliding with a gantry inside another opening killing several technicians who are working on it. Calrissian figures out that the only way to safely escape the Executor is to create a large fireball to serve as a smokescreen. Calrissian gives the order to open fire with all of the Falcon's weaponry, and the ensuing fireball allows the Falcon to escape the Executor's weapon range unharmed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
