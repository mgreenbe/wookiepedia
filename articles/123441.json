The company employed the use of semi-sentient, pacifist Octusi servants from neigboring Blaudu Octus. When Freedom Flight convinced the Octusi to revolt against their masters in 44 ABY, Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala feared that the uprising would help fuel other such revolts throughout the galaxy, shattering the stability of the government.
