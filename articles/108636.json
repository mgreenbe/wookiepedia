Wookiee couples traditionally bore two to three pups.

Lucas cautioned the creation team not to make Wookiee younglings look like Ewoks, and advised them to explore a \"Venetian look.\" Conceptual drawings of Wookiee children by Sang Jun Lee can be seen in the book. However, when Revenge of the Sith was released in 2005, the idea of showing pups had been dropped, and none appeared in the movie."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
