A native of the planet Sleheyron, Ziro eventually left Hutt Space in favor of the galaxy's Core Worlds and established his residence on Coruscant, the galactic capital of the Republic. In addition to his father and mother, Ziro's family included his son Hiro and Jabba Desilijic Tiure, his nephew who fathered the Huttlet heir Rotta. Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo was another influential relative of Ziro, serving as a member of the Grand Hutt Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 22 BBY, Ziro formed a secret pact with Count Dooku\u2014the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems\u2014during the early days of the Clone Wars. With the help of the Separatists, Ziro had his great-nephew Rotta abducted and taken to a B'omarr monastery on the distant world of Teth. Knowing the Jedi Order would send their own to rescue the Huttlet, Ziro hoped that the deaths of Rotta's would-be Jedi saviors would lead to a conflict between Jabba and the Republic. With Jabba removed from power, Ziro would be in a position to seize control of their clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ziro's role in the conspiracy was discovered by Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who confronted the gangster in his nightclub on Coruscant during the mission to rescue Rotta. With Rotta safely returned to his father on Tatooine, Ziro was taken into custody by the Coruscant Guard. However, as the war progressed, the Grand Hutt Council regarded Ziro as too dangerous to be left in a Republic prison, given his knowledge of their inner workings. As a result, the Hutts recruited the bounty hunter Cad Bane, who freed Ziro and turned him over to the Hutt Council. Although Ziro escaped the Hutts as well, he was ultimately murdered in 21 BBY by the Pa'lowick singer Sy Snootles, Ziro's one-time lover whom Jabba hired to kill his uncle and retrieve the Hutt Council records."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Ziro was born to Mama and Papa.

However, Ziro ended the affair and went to Coruscant. From his nightclub, Ziro controlled his criminal organization. At some point, Ziro had a son named Hiro. Eventually, Ziro earned the title of Master of the Hutt Clan for seven separate star systems."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Ziro made a deal with Separatist leader Count Dooku; Dooku's assassin, Asajj Ventress, would kidnap his nephew Jabba's son, Rotta. However, Ziro then learned from Naboo Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala that the Jedi had rescued Jabba's son. Fearing that his role would be discovered, Ziro contacted Dooku, informing him of Amidala's investigation. Dooku assured Ziro that Jabba believed him about the Jedi killing his son. Knowing Jabba would execute the Jedi responsible for killing his son, Dooku assured Ziro that he would become master of all the Hutt Clans when the Jedi would bring Jabba to justice. Ziro was then ordered by Dooku to eliminate Amidala if she continued investigating."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ziro and his IG-86 sentinel droids then found Amidala. When Dooku realized that it was Amidala, he told Ziro that his allies would pay him for delivering Amidala to him. Ziro, agreeing to the deal, had Amidala placed in his dungeon and thanked Dooku for the profitable alliance. However, Ziro learned that Amidala had contacted her protocol droid, C-3PO, for help. Thus, he decided to execute Amidala, knowing his powerful friends in the Republic Senate would protect him. Ziro and droids were then attacked by Commander Fox and his detachment of the Coruscant Guard that 3PO called. Ziro was then held at gunpoint by Amidala. Ziro tried to plead innocence to no avail to Amidala. Ziro contacted Jabba on Tatooine, and Amidala informed Jabba that Ziro was behind Rotta's kidnapping.

Sing followed the Naboo Senator to Alderaan, and awaited her speech to fellow senators regarding the refugee crisis that has plagued the galaxy following the outbreak of the Clone Wars. There she attempted to assassinate the senator on two separate occasions, but was foiled by Ahsoka Tano who had been experiencing premonitions of the assassination attempts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sing was then remanded in custody on Coruscant, with Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Amidala, and Bail Organa also present to deliver the assassin to Republic authorities represented by Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.

Ziro was left fuming after giving himself away, vowing to take revenge on the Jedi and the senator. When Sing failed, Ziro spoke with Skywalker and Tano. When Tano told Ziro that Sing revealed that he paid her, Ziro confessed to hiring her.

Ziro was brought out when Senator Orn Free Taa arrived and gave the Detention Center's guards a pardon disc. Ziro then boarded HELIOS-3D's speeder and took Ziro to the Galactic Senate Building despite his objections. HELIOS-3D and Ziro then picked up Bane's team. After Bane and his group boarded the speeder, Ziro told Bane about his captivity in the detention center and approved of Bane killing off the senators.

Ziro was meant to speak Huttese into a microphone which would translate his speech into English, but this idea was dropped when the producers felt that younger audiences wouldn't understand what the translator was. Later, George Lucas stepped in and specifically asked for Ziro to sound like Truman Capote. Since the character was a favorite of the production team, they brought him back for further appearances in the subsequent The Clone Wars series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the release of The Clone Wars film, reviewers from some media outlets criticized Ziro as an anti-gay stereotype, with MTV News wondering whether that would make him the first gay alien in the Star Wars franchise. Interviewed by the network after the film premiered, Dave Filoni said that his continuity experts had told him that Ziro did not have a biological sex because he was a \"slug;\" therefore, Filoni framed the matter of Ziro's sexuality as \"questionable\" rather than answerable as straight or gay. Other outlets disputed the framing of Ziro's traits as offensive stereotypes, with Gizmodo instead regarding the character as \"pure weirdo campiness in a franchise known for being far too self-serious.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As of 2014, Filoni's remarks on Hutt biology no longer apply to Ziro and other Hutts.
