The shells were heavy and heat-resistant and the species was able to withdraw inside the shell for protection. Their necks were long and thin, but muscular enough to dig food out of the hard ground. They had retractable opposable digits on their foreclaws and usually walked on all fours, but were capable of bipedal motivation by using their tail to balance themselves. The Krieks' sense of vision was good and extended into the infrared and their sense of touch was very sensitive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kreik society was tribal in nature, with each tribe staking out territory. There were 43 tribes overall, although some of the larger tribes had smaller sub-tribes. Each tribe was ruled by a patriarch known as a k'lar advised by a small council called the ken'karro. The Ken'kali were warriors that guarded the lands of the tribe. A family of Krieks were called a selio."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their religion worshipped a goddess named Br'lai and a god named T'kor. Kreik would sacrifice small piles of lichen to their gods.
