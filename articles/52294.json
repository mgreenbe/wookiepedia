During her training, Norsh was assigned to Blue Team during an urban tracking exercise beginning at the Temple and leading into the All Planets Market to retrieve a specific fruit. Assigned to the same team as Dooku and Hran Beling, Dooku took command of the team and was determined to beat his former friend and leader of Gold Team Lorian Nod. Deposited in the Nova level of Galactic City, Norsh suggested using the many alleyways leading to the Market to move about undetected and hide so as not to be tagged by the other team as they all strove to get the fruit first. Suggesting that the Gold Team was most likely staking out Blue Team and awaiting them so as to tag them all and move easily to the Temple, Norsh and Beling aided Dooku in infiltrating the market. Beling was tagged by one of the opposing team members but Norsh was able to grab the fruit without any disruption. Before she could make her way out of the market, Nod appeared from above an awning and tagged her, ending her ability to play in the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
