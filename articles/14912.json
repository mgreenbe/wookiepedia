Unbeknownst to him, his ship was being followed by Desann and Tavion Axmis. After being led to the Valley, Desann and Tavion used its latent Force energy to empower several soldiers with Force energies. These unnaturally powerful beings came to be known as Reborn Jedi and shadowtroopers. The Reborn combined their forces with those of Imperial warlord Admiral Galak Fyyar, and in doing so, gained enough strength to invade Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With such a force primed for the attack, Fyyar launched the Doomgiver from his base on Cairn Installation.

On board, Katarn eventually managed to alert Rogue Squadron of the Doomgiver, and soon made his way to the detention levels of the ship. After rescuing a still living Jan Ors and learning of the attack on Yavin 4, Katarn set out to disable the shields. In the shield generator room, Katarn met and battled Galak Fyyar, who was operating a mechanical suit made from cortosis. The duel resulted in Fyyar's cortosis suit exploding. After killing Fyyar and disabling the Doomgiver's shields, Katarn and Ors were able to reach an escape pod and evacuate the doomed ship.

The two confronted each other and engaged in a lightsaber duel. Kyle Katarn killed Desann in the duel.
