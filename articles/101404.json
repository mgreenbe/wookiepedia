Following the formation of the Alliance, the Orion, two other Braha'tok-class gunships and a portion of Dodonna's fleet went to Atollon where the Phoenix Cell was based. The combined fleet was preparing for an attack on Lothal's TIE Defender factories but were discovered by Grand Admiral Thrawn, whose forces blockaded the planet. Commander Jun Sato led the attacks on the blockade from his flagship, the Phoenix Nest, as an attempt to break it. However the attacks were ultimately worthless costing the rebels too many starfighters and starships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With his tactic becoming too costly, Sato ordered the fleet to charge the blockade. The Orion and many other ships advanced on the blockade only for one of the Imperial-class Star Destroyers to destroy a Nebulon-B frigate. TIE fighters then flew on an attack vector to the Orion and dealt two crippling blows to the gunship's underbelly on the attack run. The Orion continued moving forward but the damage caused it's bow to explode, beheading the starship. Sato witnessed the Orion's demise from his ship and a reported to him over the comm that it had been destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Orion first appeared in the Star Wars Rebels Season Three finale Zero Hour."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
