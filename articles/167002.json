The Pykes agreed to Manted and the other guild employees being there, but often disagreed with them on tactics for running the mine, as the criminals prefered less bureaucratic and more brutal methods of security. In 10 BBY, Manted and another guild employee accompanied the Pyke capo Quay Tolsite when he traveled to one of the mine's landing pads to meet the crew of the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crew was led by the human Qi'ra who claimed to be a slaver and offered her captives Han Solo and Chewbacca as a sample of her product.
