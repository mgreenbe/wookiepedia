They were used to locate the provenance of exotic objects, among many other tasks. Staffed with SP-4 and JN-66 analysis droids, the Analysis Rooms could access the computer system of the Jedi Archives to match identification indices, and were equipped with multispectral readers as well as polysensitive graspers capable of detecting even the slightest odor traces. In order to avoid contamination that could cause faulse readings from the very sensitive equipment, the Analysis Rooms were hermetically sealed to organics."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
