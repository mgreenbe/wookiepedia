After successful missions to several planets across the galaxy, the Jedi group had established itself as the best the Jedi Order had to offer. After engaging several terentateks in a remote area of Tatooine's planet-spanning desert, the Jedi slew all but one of their targets. The Jedi chased the last terentatek into a cave, only for the beast to kill one of their number. Unfazed, the rest of the Jedi killed the final terentatek and burned the corpses on a large pyre."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the Great Sith War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith faction led by Sith Lords Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma, many Sith-created monstrosities were spread across the galaxy. Although the Sith were defeated, creatures such as silan, Sith wyrms, and, especially, the vicious and highly dangerous terentatek, still posed a major threat to the Jedi Order and the general populace. In response, the Jedi High Council organized the Great Hunt, a collaborative Jedi effort aimed to eradicate these beasts wherever they trod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Hunt, one Jedi group including Humans Duron Qel-Droma, Shaela Nuur, and Cale Berkona, along with Twi'lek Guun Han Saresh, established itself as the best team of hunters the Jedi Order had to offer. The group trekked to worlds such as Onderon, Yavin 4, and Tython, wiping out terentateks along the way.

However, before the group could launch a coherent attack on the beast, their target killed one of the Jedi who had led the team into the cave. Unfazed, the Jedi group redoubled its efforts. Qel-Droma used a mental Force power to confuse the terentatek, allowing Saresh, Nuur, and Berkona to attack the beast up close. The terentatek was quickly overtaken and killed, and the bodies of Jedi team's prey were burned on a large pyre."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five days after the successful mission to Tatooine, the Jedi High Council called an official end to the Great Hunt.

On Korriban, the group broke apart, and Saresh left to hunt a terentatek that was rumored to exist on the Wookiee world of Kashyyyk.
