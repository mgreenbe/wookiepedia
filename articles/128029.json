The snubfighters were equipped to attack ground targets and warships along with other fighters. Because of this role they typically carried missiles or torpedoes in addition to laser or blaster based weaponry. They also often include a Hyperdrive to allow planet based fighters to attack targets in nearby systems, or to allow deployment from carriers without forcing the carriers to enter battle directly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Great Hyperspace War, Republic and Jedi Forces deployed the S-100 Stinger-class starfighter while the later Aurek-class tactical strikefighter used during the Mandalorian Wars would see service for thousands of years. In the last years of the Republic the Naboo developed the N-1 starfighter to defend their world, and the Republic made wide use of BTL-B Y-wing starfighter and V-19 Torrent starfighter models. Snubfighters were also the fighters of choice for the Rebel Alliance, New Republic, New Jedi Order and the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances with variations of or models based on the X-wing starfighter serving each group often alongside many other models of snubfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
