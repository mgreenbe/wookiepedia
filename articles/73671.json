Although they originated on Kallidah, they also established their presence in the asteroid field of Polis Massa, and they came to be known as Polis Massans. Kallidahin were typically silent, communicating only through telepathy. The species lacked facial mouths or noses, but they could still speak and breathe. One Kallidahin was the curator Utani Xane, but was killed by Darth Vader during the theft of the Triple-Zero protocol personality matrix. The Kallidahins on Polis Massa attempted to save Padm\u00e9 Amidala when she died delivering Luke and Leia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kallidahin first appeared in the 2005 movie Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leland Chee stated on Twitter that, although it is rare, some Kallidahin have vocal cords."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
