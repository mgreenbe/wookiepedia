The attempt failed, leaving the flotilla to float powerless in space. Subsequently, one of the parties affiliated with the Republic's enemy in the war, the Signatories of Waymancy, massacred every crewmember of the Fortieth Flotilla. At a speech delivered on the 25th anniversary of Victory in the Waymancy Storm in 7786 BBY, the Republic's Supreme Chancellor Nagratha noted the massacre at Sooncanoo Beacon as one of the bloodiest events of the Waymancy Storm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sooncanoo Beacon was originally meant to be mentioned in the 2012 reference book The Essential Guide to Warfare by Jason Fry and Paul R.
