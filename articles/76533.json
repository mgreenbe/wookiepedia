Shorg was part of a Thaereian squad that tried to obtain the head of L80-RC from Ginder the Bimm, alongside fellow soldier Joq Landhauler under the leadership of Teck Randon. Though they wore gray miner's jumpsuits instead of uniforms, they did not try to disguise their military bearing. The trio tried to intimidate a group of freelancers who were helping Ginder into handing over the droid head, but interference from a group of criminals ended up in a battle between the three factions, with the head staying in the possession of the freelancers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
