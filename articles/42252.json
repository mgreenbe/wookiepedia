She was recruited through Project War-Mantle along with her squadmates, and was described by Vice Admiral Rampart as one of the best soldiers in the galaxy. As a member of Clone Commander CT-9904's Elite Squad, ES-04 participated in the execution of civilians after ES-01 was killed for refusing to comply with the commander's orders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Recruit of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the dissolution of the Galactic Republic and the formation of a new Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, the burgeoning Imperial Military sought to reorder its ranks. Under an initiative known as Project War-Mantle, Vice Admiral Rampart began enlisting conscripted human recruits to potentially replace clone troopers, the standard infantry of the Grand Army of the Republic. The individual who would take on the designation ES-04 was one of these recruits, becoming one of the first Elite Squad Troopers of the Empire. She was regarded as one of the top soldiers in the galaxy by the Vice Admiral, who took great pride in his troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along with fellow recruits ES-01, ES-02, and ES-03, ES-04 was brought by Rampart to the Tipoca City Military Complex on Kamino, where the squad was assigned to the clone commando CT-9904 \"Crosshair,\" a modified clone regarded for his skills as a sharpshooter. After undergoing a medical examination by Kaminoan droids, the group was tasked by Governor Wilhuff Tarkin to eliminate Saw Gerrera, an insurgent located on the planet Onderon. Hoping to test the squad's effectiveness, Tarkin ordered the unit to destroy Gerrera's camp and wipe out any resistance."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A tangible test"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving at Onderon aboard a Nu-class attack/transport shuttle, ES-04 and her squadmates entered the planets jungles and located the camp of fighters, though Gerrera himself was absent. As Crosshair led the main unit in a frontal assault on the insurgents, ES-04 flanked the enemy with a flamethrower and took out several fighters as they retreated towards an LAAT/le patrol gunship. Her next target, the occupants of the gunship's cabin, were spared from her stream of fire when the ship's pilot sealed the vessel's hatch doors. A well placed shot from an Elite, however, took the pilot out and left the ship defenseless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With only refugees left aboard, ES-01 encouraged his team to take them as prisoners, but Crosshair disagreed, shooting the trooper for refusing to wipe out all members of the camp. Under orders from their clone commander, ES-04 and the rest of her squad turned their weapons on the huddled refugees, killing them all. Upon returning to Kamino, Tarkin and Rampart commended ES-04 and the rest of the squad for their diligence, anticipating the victories they would accomplish in the name of the Empire. The squad then took their leave to their barracks, where Crosshair's old team, Clone Force 99, had previously resided."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Searching for Clone Force 99"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being notified by scavengers on Bracca that Clone Force 99 had been spotted on the planet, they were taken to search for them along with the rest of their squad and three Empire ships worth of stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "ES-04 was a human female with dark skin, brown eyes, and auburn hair.
