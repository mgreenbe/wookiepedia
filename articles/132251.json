He mentioned that W. Haden Blackman and him were working on a story for a third The Force Unleashed video game, what would be released for next generation consoles, like PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Wii U.

Haden Blackman, and David W. Collins, the three discussed the development of the first game. Blackman also gave some details on his initial ideas for The Force Unleashed III's story. Following on from the events of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, Boba Fett would follow and then shoot down the Rogue Shadow over a planet, forcing the Apprentice and Vader to team up to survive and escape. A co-op system would allow two players to play side by side as both characters. Players would not know if Vader could be trusted or not, and Fett would have been revealed to have been sent by the Emperor to stop both of them from getting off the planet because he had his own scheme in motion. Blackman also stated that his work on The Force Unleashed III did not get past the initial ideas phase as he was already planning to leave LucasArts to form his own company, Hangar 13. As far as Blackman recalls, there was not even any concept art created."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
