At some point after the Galactic Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire, he was inducted into an Imperial agency of Force-sensitive assassins called the Inquisitorius, which was tasked with hunting down and eliminating any Jedi who survived Order 66. To accomplish this, he and his colleagues were trained by The Grand Inquisitor in the Inquisitorius Headquarters in The Works, but soon fell under the command of Darth Vader when Darth Sidious first demonstrated the Inquisitorius to Vader, who continued their training in the ways of the dark side of the Force. During his training with Vader, he lost his right hand."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Working with Darth Vader"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Hunt on Chandar's Folly, Darth Vader took a team of Inquisitors, including Fifth Brother, on a mission to locate Eeth Koth. When Vader and the Inquisitors arrived, they found Koth with his wife, who had just given birth. He was assigned, along with the other Inquisitors, to find the child. As they made it into the city, the Twi'lek Inquisitor asked how they would find the infant and the Fifth Brother suggested that they split. The three did so and the red-skinned found the child first. The Fifth Brother arrived soon after and was surprised to see that she had allowed Koth's wife to escape with the baby. However, after the Twi'lek Inquisitor too arrived, the red-skinned Inquisitor used the Force to pull the baby from her mother and over to her. They took it back to Vader and Koth saw the infant in their hands before he was struck down. The baby was made a part of Project Harvester and taken back to Coruscant with the Fifth Brother and the others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the mission, the Fifth Brother reported the red-skinned Inquisitor's actions to Vader, who was already suspicious of her attachment to the Twi'lek Inquisitor. Vader deduced her to be a traitor and when the Inquisitors were socialising around in a bar, Vader approached the assumed traitor and ignited his lightsaber, interrupting her conversation with the Twi'lek Inquisitor. The Fifth Brother stood across the room behind the Grand Inquisitor, who asked Vader if this was a test or training exercise. Vader bluntly replied no and tried to kill the red-skinned Inquisitor, only to have his lightsaber blocked by the Twi'lek's. Vader confirmed his suspicions of them having a special attachment and threw the Twi'lek Inquisitor into the wall while the red-skinned Inquisitor got away. The Twi'lek Inquisitor then followed her and the Grand Inquisitor asked Vader if he needed the Inquisitors around to help. Vader told him he didn't and made chase for the two rogue Inquisitors."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A new target"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the death of the Grand Inquisitor and after Vader hunted and broke a growing rebel fleet during the Siege of Lothal, Vader was ordered by Emperor Palpatine, to dispatch another Inquisitor to deal with the growing rebellion against the Empire. Vader soon sent the Fifth Brother to continue the work that he and the Grand Inquisitor had started."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial assault against the Lothal rebel cell on the planet Seelos, Admiral Kassius Konstantine was ordered to have his Star Destroyer rendezvous with a shuttle he was led to believe carried Lord Vader himself. In reality, however, it carried the Fifth Brother, who arrived aboard Konstantine's Star Destroyer to begin hunting the rebellion. Konstantine questioned why his vessel had to divert from Seelos to rendezvous with an Inquisitor, as the diversion may have compromised the assault that ISB Agent Kallus was leading on Seelos, but the Fifth Brother had no interest in the assault and pledged to stop the rebellion himself."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Skirmish at the medical station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, he was present with both Kallus and Konstantine on the bridge of the Star Destroyer when a power surge at an abandoned Haven-class medical station was detected. Though Kallus dismissed it, the Fifth Brother quickly took command and immediately set out for the medical station, unaware that the Seventh Sister was already there and hunting the rebels. When Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren were fleeing the Seventh Sister, they were met by a grinning Fifth Brother who ignited his lightsaber threateningly. Ezra was captured helping Sabine to escape, with the Fifth Brother reaching him just as the latter fled. He attempted to kill the young Jedi with his lightsaber, only for the Sister to deflect it with her own blade. When the Fifth Brother protested, citing Bridger as his kill, the Sister derided him for short-sightedness and pointed out that the boy could be used to trap his friends."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Seventh Sister interrogated Ezra, the Fifth Brother went to hunt down Sabine accompanied by two of the Sister's ID9 seeker droids. Hunting her through the corridors, he sensed the presence of Sabine and the Lasat Garazeb Orrelios who had prepared an ambush consisting of several thermal detonators planted in the corridor. Unfortunately, the Fifth Brother used the Force to lift the detonators and throw them at the rebels, knocking out Sabine in the process. Hefting the unconscious Mandalorian over his shoulder, the Brother told the two seeker droids to do as they wished with Orrelios; both droids were subsequently destroyed when the Lasat crushed them against boxes of medical supplies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Brother returned to find that Ezra had delivered very little information, but at that moment they received a transmission from \"Commander Meiloorun\" asking if they needed help; the Brother forced the two to accept at lightsaber point and then proceeded to Bay Six where the rebels were to arrive. When they got there, they were ambushed by Orrelios in the Phantom; in the chaos, Ezra managed to recover his lightsaber and both boarded the shuttle. Both Inquisitors attempted to hold it in place with the Force, but the Brother was forced to break off to deflect blaster fire and the Sister was nearly dragged out into space when the shuttle burst free, leaving both Inquisitors fuming."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Abducting children"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister boarded a passenger ship above the planet Chandel to seize a Force-sensitive infant named Alora. Despite the best efforts of Alora's grandmother Darja to stop them, the two Inquisitors managed to corner them and took Alora into custody. Prior to leaving the ship, the Brother killed all of the other passengers by throwing his double-bladed lightsaber at them. The Inquisitors' actions attracted the attention of the former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and the rebel crew of the Ghost. While Ahsoka traveled to Chandel, Ezra, his master Kanan Jarrus, Zeb, and Chopper traveled to the planet Takobo aboard the Phantom to investigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taking Alora with them, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister traveled to Takobo to collect a Force-sensitive Ithorian infant named Pypey. After parking their TIE Advanced starfighters at a spaceport hangar bay in Hammertown, the two Inquisitors left a seeker droid to guard their ship and the baby. Together, they then visited Pypey's home and confronted her mother Oora. However, Oora had already sent her child away with a droid. Before leaving the house, the two Inquisitors accosted her and smashed the furniture in her home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While prowling the streets of Takobo, the two Inquisitors managed to intercept the droid. However, Pypey had already been picked up by Zeb. The Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister then pursued Zeb to a nearby apartment building. While the Brother used Pypey's fear to track the Jedi, the Sister sent one of her seeker droids to keep an eye outside. Shortly later, Ezra and Kanan entered the building to aid Zeb."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra's presence caused Pypey to cry since he could sense the boy's fear. Closing in on the rebels, the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister attempted to spike them out with their lightsabers. Bridger managed to temporarily mislead the Inquisitors by using a comlink to make a recording of Pypey's cries. The Fifth Brother fell for that ruse and was warned by the Seventh Sister to stop wasting their time. In the meantime, the rebels managed to escape the room and made a run for the stairs. To confuse the Inquisitors, the rebels split up; with Bridger and Pypey heading into the ventilation shafts while Kanan and Zeb held off the Inquisitors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Resuming their pursuit, the Fifth Brother sensed Ezra and Pypey's presence in the ventilation shaft above. He then used his lightsaber to spike holes in the ceilings in an attempt to flush out their quarry. Before the two Inquisitors could corner their prey, they were confronted by Kanan and Zeb. Zeb took on the Brother but was unable to match the Inquisitor's Force powers. Forced to retreat, Kanan and Zeb jumped out of the window and fled on a speeder. In response, the Inquisitors commandeered another speeder and continued the pursuit. Following another skirmish, the Inquisitors cornered their rebel foes outside the spaceport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Inquisitors quickly overpowered the three rebels. Before they could finish off their work, the spaceport doors opened to reveal Tano. While the other rebels retreated aboard the Phantom with Pypey, Ahsoka engaged the two Inquisitors in a lightsaber duel. Armed with two lightsabers, she engaged both Inquisitors for a few moments before effortlessly side-swiping the Fifth Brother's clumsy attack and throwing him against a pillar, knocking him out. The Seventh Sister put up a better fight, but was soon defeated as well. Before Ahsoka could finish the Sister, Imperial reinforcements arrived in the form of stormtroopers and a few Imperial Troop Transports. Though the Brother threw his lightsaber at her to try and prevent her escape, Ahsoka managed to dodge it and escaped with her rebel comrades and the babies aboard the Phantom. To add insult to injury, the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister discovered that the rebels had also destroyed their TIE Advanced fighters and taken Pypey. However, the Inquisitors were delighted to learn from one of the Sister's seeker droids that the rebels were hiding on the planet Garel."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Raid on Garel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following their skirmish with the rebels on Takabo, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister joined forces with Kallus and Konstantine to attack the rebel presence on Garel. The two Inquisitors accepted Kallus' suggestion that the Imperial servants work together to capture Phoenix Squadron, which included the crew of the Ghost. The Fifth Brother and Seventh Brother took part in the ground assault and encountered Bridger and Jarrus in their hangar bay. Despite the Sister's best efforts to goad Ezra into attacking them, Kanan prevented the fight from occurring by shutting the blast door; leaving the Inquisitors on the other side. The crew of the Ghost then took advantage of this delay to escape into the atmosphere above Garel."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Pursuing the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For several months, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister pursued Kanan and Ezra. The two Inquisitors cornered the two Jedi while they were scouting Oosalon as a potential site for a new rebel base. During the duel, the Fifth Brother threw Ezra down a cliff but the young Jedi managed to cling onto his master. The two Jedi counter-attacked with their lightsabers but were pushed back to the edge of the cliff by the two Inquisitors. Before the Inquisitors could finish off their Jedi opponents, the two Jedi managed to escape on the back of a tibidee before being picked up by Chopper in the Phantom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister visited the Jedi Temple on the planet Lothal. They landed their TIE Advanced v1 starfighters moments after Chopper had departed the scene on the Phantom. While the Brother did not sense the presence of the Jedi and thought they had left, the Sister could still sense that they were hiding in the Temple. Using their Dark Side powers, the two Inquisitors forced their way into the Temple. After forcing the Temple open, the two Inquisitors entered the structure only to be confronted by several spectral Jedi Temple Guards, who were part of a Force vision. The two Inquisitors recognized the leader as having the face of the late Grand Inquisitor, who had once been a Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister both survived their supernatural encounter, they failed to captured the Jedi. However, they managed to capture the Temple and promptly informed their master Darth Vader, who came to visit the site in person.

Managing to catch them off-guard, he was soon joined by the Eighth Brother and together they engaged the Jedi. The situation soon turned against them when Maul, having slain the Seventh Sister, leapt into the fray and engaged the two Inquisitors on behalf of the Jedi. Taking advantage of the Fifth Brother's distraction in fending off Maul, Ahsoka lunged forwards and struck the hilt of his lightsaber, damaging the weapon and causing him to drop it.

He wore the gray and black uniform of an Inquisitor, wore a metallic headpiece, and carried a double-bladed spinning lightsaber. The Fifth Brother displayed a confident personality, bordering on arrogance, upon arriving at Admiral Konstantine's Star Destroyer, dismissing the admiral and Agent Kallus' \"struggles\" as being beneath him and vowing to succeed where they had failed. He was also quite bloodthirsty and brutal, eager to hunt and murder any Jedi who had survived the Purge, but did not seem to have much in the way of foresight or strategic sense, focusing purely on the kill in front of him and not considering how they could be used to accomplish a larger objective, causing the Seventh Sister to label him as \"short-sighted\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In this capacity he showed no qualms with murdering children or young adults, attempting to murder Ezra Bridger with his lightsaber once he was defenseless and threatening to behead Sabine Wren in order to convince Ezra to summon rebel reinforcements to be captured. Despite his rather poor track record in hunting and battling the rebels, he still maintained a sense of arrogance and entitlement, pulling rank on the Seventh Sister and threatening Admiral Konstantine when they expressed doubt in him. When he encountered the apparent ghost of the former Grand Inquisitor when he was a noble Jedi Knight and Temple Guard, as well as the spirits of several other Temple Guards, the Fifth Brother displayed confusion and fear at this Force apparition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fifth Brother held some skill in telekinesis and was able to control multiple thermal detonators, keeping them from exploding when thrown at him and then sending them back at an opponent to explode.

His fighting style was one of unrelenting aggression and seemed to rely almost wholly on brute force and heavy slashes, lacking any finesse or agility in contrast to most of his fellow Inquisitors. Though he was able to engage Ahsoka briefly, he was proven to be no match for her and was swiftly knocked out of the fight. He was later able to put up a slightly better fight against her on Malachor, albeit whilst backed up by two other Inquisitors, but was utterly outmatched by the powers of former Sith Lord Maul and was bested and killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fifth Brother was created for the second season of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels.
