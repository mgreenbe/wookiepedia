Durron spearheaded a faction favoring more aggressive action against the Yuuzhan Vong, and so came prepared to confront Skywalker. His side made up of around two-thirds of the adult Jedi, including about half of the non-Human Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke favored more defensive action against the Vong, but in a surprising move, did not confront Kyp immediately, rather inviting him to share his first-hand insights on the Vong gained while leading the Dozen-and-Two Avengers.
