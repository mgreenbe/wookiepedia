Johun Othone used the word kriffing when asking Supreme Chancellor Tarsus Valorum to hire a security team, after having to fight off several armed kidnappers. Luke Skywalker also used this word to refer to slicers when R2-D2 refused to let him see the contents of a protected memory area, and had gone so far as to damage himself.
