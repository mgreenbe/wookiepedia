They agreed to meet on Phinel's Folly to make the transaction, but Vordell was captured by the Imperial Customs corvette Auditor, before the deal could take place. To buy his freedom, Vordell promised to help the Imperials recover the rifles. The Imperials agreed and the corvette traveled to Phinel's Folly, where Vordell; his crew members Kollu and Trom; and a detachment of stormtroopers, set up an ambush on the moon's surface, to attempt to capture the agents and the rifles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
