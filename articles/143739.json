Tumperakki was preparing for a crash landing, while boasting about his accomplishments. Amaiza Foxtrain was very angry with Tumperakki when he crash landed, believing she should have worked with Han Solo instead. Foxtrain stormed off to meet their contact, after they landed and told Tumperakki to fix himself up or she would never work with him again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While working on his starship, the Rabbit's Foot, he asked his maintenance droid ML-08 \"Mel\" why he did not put in the modulator and was angry when he learned the droid had forgot to. As he got to work, he was interrupted by Foxtrian, who came back with their contact. Their contact was Queen Prizzi of Livorno who requested she take a box of eggs to Princess Leia Organa. The eggs were the last of the queen's species after the Galactic Empire nearly hunted them down to extinction. Tumperakki did not want to be involved with the Alliance to Restore the Republic and refused the mission but Foxtrain told him that she should have used Solo which convinced him to take the mission. Imperial stormtroopers arrived to stop them but they managed to blast their way out and escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the Rabbit Foot, Queen Prizzi did not believe that her eggs were safe. Tumperakki showed her the eggs but then realized that Foxtrain was not onboard the ship. But then Prizzi's eggs started to hatch. But the eggs were not Prizzi's and instead bats emerged from them. The bats attacked them but then Tumperakki realized that Foxtrain had double crossed them and had taken the eggs for herself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On The Wheel, Foxtrain was auctioning off the eggs as the some of the rarest items in The galaxy. On the auctioneers made a bid and revealed themselves as and agent for the Empire. Blaster fire was exchanged until a hooded figure stopped to insult the agent. While the agent was distracted, the hooded figure revealed themselves to be Tumperakki and he knocked out the agent. Foxtrain opened fire on Tumperakki as he dodged her fire. Tumperakki then opened a box he had which released the bats towards Foxtrain. Tumperakki stole back the correct eggs and escaped while Foxtrain fought off the bats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tumperakki arrived to the Rebel Fleet with the eggs and Queen Prizzi. On the rebel ship, Prizzi thanked Organa for her help and Tumperakki for helping to deliver her. Solo tried to make a joke about Tumperakki but Tumperakki stopped Solo before greeting him. Organa thanked Tumperakki and asked for the eggs. Mel came to drop off the eggs but tripped and fell, causing the eggs to splat on the floor. Everyone freaked out but Tumperakki remained calm because he knew they were fake. Solo was surprised that Tumpernakki knew and the Lepi told Solo that he had Mel scan them before. Organa revealed that the real eggs left before him with Solo and the other eggs were a decoy as R2-D2 arrived with the real eggs. But Organa promised to pay Tumperakki and have Solo help him fix his ship. Tumperakki was happy with the deal in the end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collection"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
