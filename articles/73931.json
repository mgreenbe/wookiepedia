During fights, he was known to take risks in order to show off to attractive women, if they were present. He booked passage aboard the Ananuru Express at the same time as when the secret Imperial RNA brainwashing virus was being auctioned off. During his trip, he used the wrong implements at meals, rather than admitting he did not know which ones to use. When Secesh Trant attempted to steal the datatape containing the virus information, he joined a group of Rebels in attacking her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
