He was new to the battlefront and thus regarded as \"green\" by his superiors. He and the young Padawan Caleb Dume struck up a friendship, and when Dume was wounded and rendered unconscious during a skirmish on Kardoa CT-1157 defended him from the Separatist droids. Following this, he won a commendation of valor and earned the nickname \"Stance.\" Soon after, Stance and the rest of the battalion were sent to Mygeeto, but during the battle on Mygeeto he was killed by Colonel Coburn Sear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After his death, Dume fought Sear.
