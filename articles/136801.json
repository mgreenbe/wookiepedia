Native fauna such as ash angels foraged during the day and returned to nest at night, while rockrenders prowled the planet's underground. Because the planet's atmosphere was highly toxic, native Sullustans lived in technologically advanced subterranean cities that were highly regarded for their beauty. They commuted to work by lifts and shuttles that carried them to the factories on the planet's surface, alternating between day and night shifts. The SoroSuub Corporation employed roughly half the population of Sullust and the world was the center of the company's industrial empire, with famous factories manufacturing starships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sullust lay on the Rimma Trade Route, which connected it to Vondarc and Eriadu.

By the High Republic Era, Sullust had formed a joint task force with a the Mid Rim world, Malastare. With officers like Hedda Casset among the membership of their joint fleet, they kept order in their small portion of the Mid Rim, fighting threats like pirates. By the later Republic Era, Sullust was also host to the Sullust Sector Spacefarers Academy that young Wilhuff Tarkin attended. In the years following the Invasion of Naboo, the rogue Jedi Count Dooku spread political turmoil on worlds such as Kashyyyk, Onderon, and Sullust, and Sullust would secede. During the Clone Wars, it hosted a battle between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Naboo, Dooku, on the orders of his Sith Master, came to Sullust on a secret mission and met with Kap Klyp. Meanwhile, on a secret mission, Jak'Zin, the Jedi Knight, recognized Dooku and came to his side. After Dooku fused with Jak'Zin, the two revealed to each other their secret mission. Later, they were surrounded by armed men, but the duo killed them all. However, Dooku also killed Jak'Zin."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial reorganization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet eventually came under the jurisdiction of the nascent Galactic Empire following the proclamation of the New Order, and was reduced to vassal status and a source of fuel for the Imperial Military, becoming an essential mining and manufacturing center for the Empire. By 18 BBY, the Empire already had an established presence on Sullust. For years, Sullust remained relatively peaceful as workers accepted the stability offered under the Empire's reign. However, the Cobalt Laborers' Reformation Front steadily began to increase in numbers, sending letters to the Imperial governor demanding better working conditions and increased local autonomy. In response, the Empire detained roughly eighty percent of those in the organization and those it deemed most radical."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, the Alliance to Restore the Republic listed Sullust as a safe world. Sullust was included in a map of the galaxy with a legend listing the various Alliance safe worlds, starfighter hubs at level five or higher, rebel operations sectors and regional headquarters, and shadow planets with deep space caches. The map would be incorporated into The Rebel Files."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial occupation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, shortly after the Disaster, an enclave of Alderaanian refugees took up shelter on Sullust, hoping to escape Imperial reprisals against the remaining population of Alderaan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, the Imperial Security Bureau began to suspect the Cobalt Laborers' Reformation Front of harboring rebel sympathizers and material for a possible resistance movement. The group claimed to have no connection to the local Sullustan resistance on the planet, but that did not stop the Empire from locking down the city of Pinyumb following a pipe bomb explosion in a nearby manufacturing facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Weeks later and shortly following the Battle of Hoth, the Rebel Alliance initiated Operation Ringbreaker, which sought to force Imperial redeployments from the shipbuilding world of Kuat by assaulting worlds such as Obumubo, Naator, Xagobah and the asteroid mines of the Kuliquo belt, thus allowing for the Alliance to assault its ultimate goal. When the Alliance 61st Mobile Infantry jumped out of hyperspace a mere half million kilometers from the planet in an effort to rapidly deploy drop ships to assault the Inyusu Tor mineral processing facility, the attack ultimately went awry the following day when the Imperial Vixus Squadron ambushed their troop transports, stranding the company on the planet. The next three days would result in the bloody Siege of Inyusu Tor, initially being in the Empire's favor as the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Herald arrived in the system and the Imperial Army utilized overwhelming force to surround the rebels on the mountainside facility. However, after receiving aid from the local resistance as well as finally convincing the Cobalt Front to rise up in Pinyumb, the Imperials were overwhelmed, while subsequent uprisings across the planet ultimately liberated it from Imperial rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the following days, an interim government was installed in Pinyumb, while heavy losses sustained by the Sixty-First ultimately canceled Operation Ringbreaker, allowing the company to act as a temporary police force for the Sullustan people.
