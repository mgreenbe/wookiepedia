It began with picking up Verpine shatter guns at the Roche asteroid field, continued with slipping out while avoiding Imperial patrols, and arriving at Tatooine, where guns were exchanged for slaves from Ryloth and Kashyyyk. The slaves were then transferred to Kessel, where they were exchanged for a load of glitterstim spice. On the prison planet of Kiffex the spice was exchanged for a freedom of certain convicts, who were then transported to Nar Shaddaa to resume their criminal career."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
