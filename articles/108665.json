The Bith had an unmatched love for music, and thus no style or instrument was too \"common\" for the hall; however, all acts had to be of utmost excellence in order to be permitted a performance on its stage. One such performance included a Gamorrean singer and at least two Bith musicians. The diverse percussion group Shluur visited the concert hall during a tour that consisted of two weeks' worth of sold-out performances. These concerts were used as an experiment for the male Wookiee Wurokkk, one of the group's arrangers. Wurokkk composed a piece designed to subliminally bring out aggressive behavior in Bith based on vibrations and brainwave patterns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ensuing chaos that resulted from the experiment led to a government investigation that eventually brought Wurokkk's plans to light. When confronted, the Wookiee was content with the success of his experiment but was nevertheless escorted off-planet.
