He and his partner, Sergeant Dobi, were called in to a small dwelling to investigate reports of domestic disturbance. The two Pop-Dogs then found themselves caught in a trap set up by the Quad-Linked Militant Pacifists, a fictitious terrorist organization that served as a front for Wraith Squadron, and Vitkins and Dobi were then tied up.
