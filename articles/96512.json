After a five-year term in the Republic rocket-jumper corps, Netus devoted his life to politics, successfully running for a position within the Galactic Senate. By 3998 BBY, he had been appointed to the Republic's lofty position of Minister of Defense. That year, Netus received a message from Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma, who had requested military aid in a struggle with the Naddist Sith cult on Onderon. Netus called for a meeting of the Defense Committee to determine whether or not to send in their forces, and the group was swayed into action after a speech by Jedi Master Thon. Two years later, Netus and the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic met with a group of Jedi headed by Master Vodo-Siosk Baas on Coruscant to discuss recent raids on Republic shipyards. After it was discovered that Ulic Qel-Droma was behind the attacks, a fleet led by Qel-Droma attacked the Republic capital. Although most of the Republic Navy had been massed at Kemplex IX to defend against a raid that turned out to be a ruse, Netus and the Jedi were able to fight off the attack and capture Qel-Droma."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Problems with the Naddists"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Human male, Netus served in the Galactic Republic rocket-jumper corps. After serving a five-year term in the Republic Military, Netus chose a career in politics. He successfully ran for the Galactic Senate and rose to the position of Minister of Defense by the year 3998 BBY. That year, a troubling issue on Onderon came to Netus's attention: a Sith cult known as the Naddists, led by Onderonian King Ommin, had attacked Jedi forces on the planet. Soon after the initial battle with the Naddists, Netus received a garbled transmission from one of the Jedi Knights serving on Onderon, Ulic Qel-Droma. In the message, Qel-Droma detailed the events of the uprising, including the capture of Jedi Master Arca Jeth, and asked the Republic for military aid. Netus was alarmed to the point that he called a meeting of the Republic's Defense Committee to discuss what course of action they should take."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Netus suggested that the Republic Navy move out at once to assist the Jedi, several senators, among them the representative from Orron III, disagreed, saying that it was a matter that the Jedi should address themselves. Suddenly, the Tchuukthai Jedi Master Thon, accompanied by his apprentice, Nomi Sunrider, entered the meeting chambers. Netus felt honored by the Jedi Master's presence, and with Sunrider serving as a translator, Thon admonished the assembled senators for not being truly united with the Jedi. The Tchuukthai warned the Committee that the battle against the dark side did not solely concern the Jedi, but the Republic and galaxy as a whole. Having made his point, Thon left the room without another word alongside Sunrider. When Netus decided to take the matter to a vote, the senators unanimously motioned in favor of aiding the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Battle of Coruscant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two years later, Netus still held the position of Minister of Defense and served under the Republic's mollusk-like Supreme Chancellor. After reports that a rogue Jedi Knight had committed terror attacks on Republic shipyards, the Krevaaki Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas and a contingent of Knights\u2014Nomi Sunrider, Cay Qel-Droma, Dace Diath, the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta, the Cathar Sylvar, Nazzar prince Qrrrl Toq, and the Miraluka Shoaneb Culu\u2014came to Coruscant to convince the Senate to allow the Jedi to handle the crisis. Netus and the Chancellor met the group as they landed. However, as they were greeting the Jedi, Netus was brought a message from Republic Navy Captain Orley Vanicus, which revealed that Ulic Qel-Droma led the raids. Netus ordered the Republic fleet to gather at Kemplex IX in the hopes of running the enemy down, as they had received word that it was to be the next target for Ulic's raiders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group, especially Ulic's brother Cay, was stunned, but as they discussed these developments a large attack force appeared out of the sky. At that moment, Ulic's plan was revealed: Kemplex IX was never meant to be his next target; it was merely a ruse to draw the Republic's defenses away from their capital, Coruscant. As the attacking fleet began bombing the Coruscant streets, Netus ran for cover and ordered his subordinates to summon whatever defenses they had left to defend the planet. More of Qel-Droma's forces landed in the middle of Galactic City, and the Jedi team was pressed into action. Netus was able to rally a defense force of nominal size, and the Minister of Defense, brandishing a blaster pistol, joined the fight. Although Qel-Droma and his forces fought their way into the Republic's War Room, Netus and the Jedi were able to apprehend him and ultimately repel the invasion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Minister of Defense, Netus was very hard-working and spent the majority of his time reviewing requests for military aid, higher budgets, new weapons, and the like, while overseeing matters of Republic security and the status of the military. Netus approached most issues with caution, but also knew that prompt action was often successful. As a result, Netus was forced to spend a large amount of time arguing for the approval of military action. Although Netus was an important government figure as the Minister of Defense, the former Republic rocket-jumper still was not afraid to take matters into his own hands, producing a blaster pistol and actively fighting in Ulic Qel-Droma's invasion of Coruscant. Netus respected the Jedi Order and felt that the Republic should repay them for their service in any way they could. He also held a reverence for Jedi Master Thon. Netus believed strongly in the Republic's political system and expressed to Thon that a united government could overcome the personal differences of individual politicians. Although Netus was red-haired in 3998 BBY, by 3996 BBY he had changed his hair color to black. He also had a large facial scar running from the top of his forehead to his right cheek."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Netus first appeared in Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising, the third story arc of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Tom Veitch and released in 1994.
