Mercenary units, local law enforcement, and military personnel were known to use them. These grenades were designed to explode on impact and could knock out individuals caught within the blast radius from the concussive force released. They were effective against organic, living targets, not droids or electronics; ion grenades or similar devices would be used to incapacitate droids. From 32 BBY to 4 ABY, these items typically cost 600 credits, but were sometimes available for as low as 250. As with other explosives, they were often restricted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. weapons manufacturer produced a couple of variants of the stun grenade, including the C-10 stun grenade, and the C-14A stun grenade which had the unusual ability to be recharged and reused.
