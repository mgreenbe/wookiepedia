Boba Fett incorporated one into his left wrist gauntlet. During a skirmish at the Great Pit of Carkoon, Fett attempted to shoot Luke Skywalker with his wrist blaster after the Jedi destroyed his EE-3 carbine rifle, but was knocked into the sarlacc after firing a few blasts that missed the target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
