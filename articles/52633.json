Cut off from the outside by the uncharted and unexplored expanses of highly irradiated interstellar gases that surrounded their pocket of space, Ganathan technology remained at an archaic level in comparison to much of the rest of the galaxy. They had limited space-travel capabilities, making use of steam-powered spacecraft capable of slow, inter-system journeys."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their antiquated technologies in some areas, the Ganathans were quite advanced in other fields. For instance, the Ganathans helped craft the Human Jedi Empatojayos Brand's cyborg suit and the lightning gun weapons system. With his ship too damaged to travel, the severely wounded Jedi Knight had remained among the Ganathans, who combined their technology with his own to create the repulsorlift sphere that housed Brand's body and kept him alive. Eventually Brand came to be the Ganathans' leader, and ruled through the Jedi creed of justice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 10 ABY, the severely damaged light freighter the Millennium Falcon flew into Ganathan Space, and the Humans Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo, and Vima-Da-Boda, and the Wookiee Chewbacca sought sanctuary among the Ganathans and their King."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
