In that time Vonzel worked alongside fellow smugglers Tregga and the twins Lozira and Rewinda Briil, and eventually, partners Han Solo and Chewbacca, who went on to great fame as Rebel heroes. At some point before 2 BBY, however, Vonzel suffered a brutal accident during an emergency landing, which required multiple organ transplants and left him an invalid. At the time Solo, who had kept in contact with many of his smuggling acquaintances, expected Vonzel to spend the rest of his life on life support."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vonzel was first mentioned in Han Solo's Revenge, a novel written by Brian Daley and released in 1979."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
