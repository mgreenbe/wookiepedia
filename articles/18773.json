Unbeknownst to the trio, they were being led into a trap devised by Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray to capture Amidala. After Binks learned of Amidala's arrest, he rushed to her rescue - donning a Jedi robe that he had found aboard her ship. He was soon discovered by Gunray and his accompanying battle droids, however, and escaped underwater via a grate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Here, Binks discovered \"Bogey,\" and only just managed to escape the beast. Later, however, Binks found himself underwater once more, this time evading a missile that had been fired by a B2-HA super battle droid. In the process, Binks came face-to-face again with Bogey, and was swallowed whole by the creature - only for it to shrug off the missile and then release the Gungan. With the beast seemingly friendly towards him, Binks affectionately stroked its hide and gave it the nickname of Bogey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, as Amidala and C-3PO were set to be executed by Gunray, Binks distracted the droid executioners and was then assisted by Bogey, who launched out from underwater and destroyed a number of battle droids, with Binks on its back. As Gunray looked to flee amid the confusion, Bogey toppled his shuttle off the edge of the hangar, cutting off his escape route. Gunray was then arrested by Amidala and Farr, while Binks was commended for his bravery as Bogey watched on."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
