Their design included a long body with a grill at one end and an engine at the other, as well as a pair of wires running down each side of the vehicle. The highly maneuverable atmospheric patrol vehicle could travel normally at three-hundred and thirty Kilometers per hour up to ten kilometers off the ground, with a maximum height of fifteen kilometers, though at reduced maneuverability. The vehicles were 4.7 meters long and could carry two crew, a pilot in the back and a gunner in the front who controlled the airskimmer's laser cannon, which could be rotated to face any position except the rear of the ship. Each airskimmer cost 24,000 credits and had a carrying capacity of twenty-five kilograms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SX20 was created by the Corporate Sector Authority and used by the Security Police in the Corporate Sector.
