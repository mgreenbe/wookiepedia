The city participated in the fighting, and its troops targeted the nearby city of Otoh Langua, ruled by Boss Hantic, when the Sacred Staff of Otoh Jahai came up missing. When Boss Gallo of Otoh Sancture visited the settlement to request Tenko's aid in his fight against warlord Boss Rogoe, Tenko agreed to a ceasefire with Hantic only if Gallo retrieved and returned their stolen staff. Gallo set out to find the staff and discovered that Rogoe's forces had taken it rather than the people of Otoh Langua. Gallo returned the staff to Tenko, and in return Tenko donated four heavy troopers to Gallo's recently formed Gungan Grand Army. Gallo went on to defeat Rogoe during a battle in Rogoe's capital city of Spearhead, and the Gungan tribes were united."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Otoh Jahai appears in the Gungan campaign in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack Clone Campaigns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
