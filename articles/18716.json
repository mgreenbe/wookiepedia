Many types of armor, including the type worn by Imperial stormtroopers, included an insulated, and sometimes airtight, body glove underneath the armor plating. Some bodygloves had self cleaning properties. Larin wore a body glove that was self-cleaning during the rise of the Sith Empire but felt nothing was better than a good old fashioned cleaning. Military and paramilitary combat groups, such as the Firebird Society, wore body gloves, as the garments allowed much freedom of motion. Additionally, body gloves were worn as clothing in and of themselves, such as the Szona body glove worn by dancers such as Ryst\u00e1ll Sant. Thermoguard bodyglove was an example of a body glove."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Armors that included a body glove"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
