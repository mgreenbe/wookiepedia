In 29 BBY, Sidious sent him to retrieve the holocron of the Sith King Adas from the dark side student Norval. The Guard found Norval over the planet Ploo II, and when the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived in pursuit of Norval, he attacked their vessel. However, he soon turned his guns on Norval's ship when it became apparent that the Jedi would get the holocron, and when they escaped with it, he killed Norval. Sidious later executed the Sun Guard agent for his failure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
