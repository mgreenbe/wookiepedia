She participated in the Great Hunt, where one of her targets, Imperial Admiral Ivernus, brought her to the war torn planet of Balmorra. There, she posed as a loyal servant to Lieutenant Major Pirrell. Pirrell wanted to surpass his superior, Colonel Sartius. Therefore, he enlisted the help of a young bounty hunter. He tasked this hunter to cause many unfortunate mishaps on Sartius's important missions. This angered Ivernus to the point of where he came down to Balmorra itself to personally execute Pirell himself. Little did Pirell know that this hunter was in the Great Hunt also and their target was Ivernus. As Ivernus came into the spaceport, the hunter killed Ivernus, then Murghir, their competition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
