The properties of the Azzameens were scrapped at Tolig IV, after the Azzameen Station was captured. In an attempt to discover just who double-crossed the family in the recent missions, Ace Azzameen and Emon Azzameen investigated the scrapyard to find a scrapped Azzameen datacore that held communications data. Emkay jumped to space and claimed the Core. During that procedure a raider assault occurred but Otana and Andrasta could repel them long enough until Emkay returned to his ship. The Container transport Torven and Gabi, Assassin-class corvette Sprinter, and C-3 passenger liner Manta were all present at the scrapyard during the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
