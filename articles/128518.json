The sonic disruptor disintegrated its target, leaving few traces of a victim behind. Personal defenses such as energy shields were no match for this weapon. Due to the massive energy requirements, the disruptor needed a few seconds of cool-down time between shots before firing again. Additionally, it had the advantage of dealing sonic damage, which a Jedi would not be able to deflect with his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This weapon was carried by bounty hunting brothers Dob and Del Moomo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords video game, the sonic disruptor was a rifle.
