Confident that the Empire's defeat at the hands of the Republic would be temporary, the regiment remained in seclusion on Thule, bolstering its ranks with Sith loyalists and training in preparation to serve as an advance force for a resurgent Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group persisted through the passage of the centuries, maintaining ties with other vestigial groups of Sith loyalists who had similarly survived the collapse of the old Sith Empire.
