The canopy of his cockpit was punctured by enemy laser fire, which in turn hit him in his left side. It was something of a miracle that he survived from his injuries, much less being able to fend off the pain and the coldness of vacuum to first destroy a TIE/IN interceptor close on the tail of fellow pilot Tyria Sarkin, and then finding the strength to maneuver his fighter to safety."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The award itself was a gray statuette of a New Republic mechanic with a wrench upraised as a weapon. The mechanic's expression was of pure, if silly, rage. The figure was half the length of a Human forearm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The award was in mock tribute to the extremely damaged state Loran's X-wing was in when returned to the Nebulon-B escort frigate Tedevium, described by Commander Wedge Antilles as, \"the worst shape her mechanics had ever seen a flying snubfighter.\" Loran himself had to be cut out of the cockpit, as part of his charred flesh had melted together with the cockpit's instrumentation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
