It was designed to fit inside the AT-AT walker toy also produced by Kenner. The original toy packaging depicted the INT-4 in a white setting with snowtroopers and AT-AT pilots, and described it as performing \"a scouting mission for Rebel Base [sic]\". The contemporary catalogue, however, stated it could \"fly short missions.\" Kenner later reissued the INT-4 twice in 1982, and again in 1983."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A similar vehicle appeared on the cover of the novel Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka.
