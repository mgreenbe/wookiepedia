The Ryn settlers of an unidentified planetoid in the Corporate Sector once offered to pay Dexter Jettster a small fortune in chrysopaz and aurodium after he brought them equipment with which they could defend themselves against a group of overzealous tax collectors and their Security Police enforcers. Jettster refused, however, instead settling for an ancient Ryn technique of making Jawa juice in payment. Han Solo once commented that he traded his sense of chivalry for a ten-carat chrysopaz and three bottles of brandy on Commenor when Luke Skywalker was trying to convince him to rescue Princess Leia Organa from the first Death Star. During the Galactic Civil War, chrysopaz was valued anywhere from 5 to 2,000 credits per Coruscant Standard Carat. In 11 ABY, Duchess Mistal offered a large reward of chrysopaz and firefacet gems for the return of her consort, Dack. After Lando Calrissian resolved the situation, he was paid the full reward which equaled over a million credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chrysopaz is misspelled \"chrystopaz\" in the gemstones table on page 38 of Pirates & Privateers, and \"chyrstopaz\" on page 164 of the supplement The Far Orbit Project."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
