He explained to the Consular about the protection of his family and the people that he cares about in order to bring hope and victory that his master was going to bring. Barsen'thor redeemed him to let go of the dark side and to protect his family and the people he cared about.

The first option will result in Lerek telling the player about his family, and the player will be able to persuade him to return to his family and let go of the dark side. In the second option, the player tries to redeem him, but Lerek engages the Jedi nonetheless, and is killed in the fight. At last, the third option, which will be awarded with Dark side points if chosen, the player would just engage Lerek, killing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
