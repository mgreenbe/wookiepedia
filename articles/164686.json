Returning to the hideout, she tells her comrades Jinx and O-Mer about Kalifa's demise, plunging them into despair. Ahsoka is still determined to fight and suggests to attack the dropship when it delivers another batch of prisoners, re-heartening her comrades somewhat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, using the cover of vegetation and the morning mists, Ahsoka and the younglings jump onto the ship as it hovers above the beach, forcing one of the pilots to go after her. While Jinx and O-Mer wrestle him down, Ahsoka descends into the ship to take down the other pilot. Their fight at the control consoles sends the ship drifting around aimlessly and damages vital systems, forcing the young Jedi to abandon their attempt. Just before the ship breaks apart, Ahsoka opens the cage release to let the other prisoners out, but the only prisoner on that ship is a Wookiee named Chewbacca, who joins the Jedi's company. Though their escape attempt has failed, Chewbacca announces that he can contact his nearby homeworld Kashyyyk for help if they can get their hands on the ship's wreckage to construct a transmitter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the cover of night, the Jedi and Chewbacca sneak back to the ship, which is, however, being patrolled and guarded by a sniper post after the Trandoshans have become aware of the younglings' unexpected new boldness. While O-Mer and Jinx take on the sniper, Ahsoka and Chewbacca sneak into the ship to collect the necessary parts. With the Wookiee's help, they even succeed in capturing the sniper alive and take him to their hideout. The transmitter fails to work properly, however, and Jinx, who has grown angry and impatient, suggests using their captive to lure down and hijack a hunting pod and take the base ship. O-Mer agrees to Jinx's plan, and unwilling to let her comrades go alone, Ahsoka persuades Chewbacca to join them in their endeavor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, Jinx uses his suggestion ability to make their captive call for a pick-up. They manage to capture the pod and get aboard the base ship, but cannot prevent the guard from warning his compatriots and are overpowered after a vicious but short struggle. Unbeknownst to them, however, Chewbacca's transmitter has succeeded in contacting his people, and a Wookiee relief force, led by Wookiee General Tarfful and aided by the bounty hunters Sugi and Seripas, arrives just in the nick of time to save them. While a firefight erupts on the lower deck, killing the entire Trandoshan crew, Ahsoka follows Garnac into the bowels of the ship and defeats him in hand-to-hand combat. When he still attempts to kill her in retaliation for his son's death, Ahsoka Force-pushes him out of the hatch and down onto the lower deck, killing him instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Anakin Skywalker welcomes his Padawan joyfully, but also heavily blames himself for initially being unable to protect her and then leaving her behind. However, Ahsoka responds by thanking her master as she tells him how his teachings had helped her and the others to survive, and the two bow to each other in a newfound mutual respect under the delighted eye of Master Yoda."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
