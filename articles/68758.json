The father of Elan, her death hardened his religious orthodoxy, and he consistently urged Shimrra to eliminate the Jeedai heresy before it gained strength (including a recommendation to send wild spinerays into the Coruscant underworld). Though he expected to lead many glorious sacrifices for the Gods on Yuuzhan'tar, the Priest caste was humiliated repeatedly by the sabotages the World Brain caused. During the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, Jakan, along with High Prefect Drathul and Master Shaper Qelah Kwaad, attempted to sacrifice Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo, and Harrar to the World Brain, but was stopped by a group of heretics and renegade Warriors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jakan was one of the Yuuzhan Vong who went to the Unknown Regions on Zonama Sekot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
