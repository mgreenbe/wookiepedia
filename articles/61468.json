A safe belonging to crime lord Avrak Villachor was also made of Hijarna stone. The stone was black, incredibly dense, and had the apparent ability to absorb laser or turbolaser fire like a sponge. This is not to say it was invulnerable to all forms of energy attacks, however - a powerful enough laser blast, such as that from a superlaser, would damage it. Additionally, it could absorb energy somewhat from lightsabers but after enough hits the stone would break."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
