The size of a freighter, skywatchers had a stark and austere interior that often drove crew members to provide decoration of their own; typically carrying a crew of three to twelve depending on the mission assignment, a compliment of scout troopers and their speeder bikes was often part of this crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though shielded, the skywatcher was relatively lightly armed; as a result crews were far more likely to use its speed to run away than to fight when outnumbered or outgunned. As a scout ship, the craft was well equipped to handle planetary scans, surveys, and navigate stellar phenomena such as nebulas. As an Imperial scout craft, the ship also contained a compliment of twelve probe droids of various models, and was capable of deploying the droids in atmosphere, or into space via hyperspace pod."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
