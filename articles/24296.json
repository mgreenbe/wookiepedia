No life existed on the planet, although there was evidence to suggest it once supported life. An ophidian grotesque sculpture had been discovered at some point in galactic history, which had been much older than the one found on Coruscant. This sculpture, alongside its Coruscanti counterpart, were later mentioned by Dr. Insmot Bowen in a debriefing in 1 BBY on Coruscant, where he mentioned that it might have been one of the remaining hints to the Celestials. Years later, Luke Skywalker remembered several \"ophidian grotesque\" sculptures, which he remarked were similar to those found on Abeloth's planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
