One of the B1 battle droids under his command; however, ended up blasting the head off another B1 droid due to a programming glitch, causing the OOM droid to clutch its face in exasperation and presumably file another suboptimal weapon discharge report, which it had done at least one day prior."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The OOM command battle droid appeared in an artwork by John Van Fleet in the 2012 guidebook The Essential Guide to Warfare, titled \"Another day, another suboptimal weapon discharge report.\" According to author Jason Fry in his endnotes, it was one of the last artworks issued for the book, as well as the best in his opinion.
