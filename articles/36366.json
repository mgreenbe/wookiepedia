The Republic dispatched Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, and the elite 501st Legion to defend the planet. Droid tri-fighters played an important role in the fighting. After punching through Separatist warships in orbit, Skywalker and Tano led a squadron of Z-95 Headhunters to the surface, followed closely by Republic gunships ferrying Clone Captain CT-7567 and clone troopers, as smaller Republic cruisers engaged Separatist vessels around them. After a dogfight in the atmosphere resulted in Skywalker's starfighter getting hit by Pistoeka sabotage droids, disabling his fighter and resulted in him losing consciousness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Tano was alerted to Skywalker's status by R2-D2, also onboard Skywalker's fighter, she mounted a daring rescue by first telling R2 to crash land in a nearby mountain plain, and then jumped from her starfighter to his and was able to rescue him, just as his starfighter went over the cliff and was destroyed, but not before R2 also escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Skywalker regained consciousness and became aware of what transpired, he received a transmission from Jedi Master Yoda who informed Skywalker and Tano that the Jedi Temple had been bombed, and that they were being recalled to aid in the investigation.
