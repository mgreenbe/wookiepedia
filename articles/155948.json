The child was reserved and well-mannered, intelligent but eager to participate in adventures. Orphaned when his parents were killed by Imperial soldiers during their occupation of the planet, the child became homeless and was without money. Down to his last fifteen minutes of oxygen, the child faced his own death with dignity, but was rescued by a bounty hunter who took pity on him as he reminded the hunter of their own younger brother who had died at an early age."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
