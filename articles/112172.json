After Luke Skywalker announced that the Jedi would be disbanding from the Galactic Alliance and leaving Coruscant altogether, Thul was one of the many Jedi who joined him. He was among the team led by Skywalker as they hunted the dark side entity known as Abeloth throughout the galaxy. When the hunt for Abeloth led to the Sith planet of Upekzar, Thul was one of the many Jedi to escape the Force-explosion that followed the Sith Tola Annax's death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the incident on Upekzar, Thul was sent to a planet in the Reo system within the Maraqoo sector alongside fellow Jedi Knights Lowbacca and Tekli, as well as the protocol droid C-3PO. There, they met with the Killik queen of the Thuruht nest in order to ask how they stopped Abeloth thousands of years earlier. When the Thuruht began performing their duties in haste, C-3PO translated for the Jedi Knights that the Thuruht were doing this because, according to the queen, the end of times had come. The Jedi stayed with the Thuruht for a few more weeks but could not get much more information until Thul decided he would join the nest in order to learn everything the Thuruht knew about Abeloth. Thuruht showed them the nests history as they remembered it, which is in fact the story of the Ones. Since the Thuruht had been their servants they'd witnessed how Abeloth had become what she was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Thuruht finished telling the story, Thul had become a joiner again and Lowbacca and Tekli left Thul to stay behind. Later, after the Jedi defeated Abeloth, Grand Master Skywalker ordered Master Sebatyne to dispatch a team to retrieve Thul so his presence among the Killik did not antagonize the Chiss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Raynar was first introduced in Young Jedi Knights: Heirs of the Force, he was not given a last name and was just described as a spoiled young man who wore garish robes of varying colors. He was given his last name in the Diversity Alliance arc of the Young Jedi Knights series, which also fleshed out his backstory and identified him as the son of Bornan Thul and Aryn Dro from A. C.

He presumably used this weapon for most of his time as a Jedi, even during the Yuuzhan Vong war. As UnuThul, he wielded a gold-bladed lightsaber, which was eventually confiscated by Luke Skywalker after a duel, though Luke offered to return the weapon someday. By 43 ABY Raynar again wielded his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
