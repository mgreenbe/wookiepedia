It centers around Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker as the Clone Wars come to an end. There are seventeen levels, interlaced with over twelve minutes of footage from the movie. It was released on May 5, 2005, for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. Additionally, a version was made available for mobile phones on April 2, and a version for the PlayStation Portable was cancelled and never released. On April 28, 2015, the game was released for download on PlayStation Network, and made available to play on PlayStation 3. Also, unlike other Star Wars video games, there was also going to be a Nintendo GameCube release, but that one was cancelled for unknown reasons as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Storyline"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game follows the movie storyline very closely, incorporating footage from the movie into the game and blending it well with the game portion itself. It involves playing through the events as either Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, with radically different events taking place in either. As Obi-Wan, much of the game is centered around destroying General Grievous, while the Anakin levels chronicle his fall to the dark side of the Force and extermination of the Jedi Order. This includes Anakin's attack on the Jedi Temple, which culminates in a duel with Serra Keto, who happens to be the best student of Cin Drallig, who Darth Vader later fights and kills along with Keto. The game ends with the duel on Mustafar between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan. There are two different endings to the final battle, the first being that Obi-Wan defeats Anakin like in the film, the second being that Anakin kills Obi-Wan then meets the Emperor who gives him a new red lightsaber, Anakin in turn kills the Emperor and claims the new Empire for his own. The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of Episode III are much the same to the console versions, except as a side-scrolling action game. The other difference is that while the PS2 and Xbox versions feature a singular campaign, with player controlling Obi-Wan or Anakin depending on their scenes in the film, the GBA and NDS versions feature two separate campaigns for each one. The DS version also features uses for its touch-screen capability. The game was also released on the mobile phone and followed the storyline of all other versions. It bares resemblance to 1999's Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace videogame where the overall game is the same as the actual film with a few minor changes in exposition and background information."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Gameplay"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Console Version"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The player alternates between playing as Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, reliving various scenes from the film through the game's missions. There are 17 levels, interlaced with over 12 minutes of footage from the movie. The game's combat system is heavily concentrated on lightsaber combat. Each of the playable characters (with the exception of the MagnaGuard) is equipped with at least one lightsaber. There are three basic attacks: fast attacks which do the least amount of damage, strong attacks which do more damage but are slower to execute, and the slowest but strongest critical attacks. These attacks can be mixed to create combination attacks. Attacks can also be charged up for greater strength. One feature of the game is called a Saber Lock - a sequence in which the player's character clashes swords with an opponent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game features an experience system, whereby the player's character can upgrade attacks and gain new ones as they progress through the game."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Portable Version"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The handheld versions of the game are played as a 2.5D side-scrolling beat 'em up game, where players can freely choose to play as either Obi-Wan or Anakin, traversing across roughly a dozen levels to battle a variety of enemies and occasionally dodge deadly hazards, such as a laser trap or a missile launcher. Both characters have nearly identical attack moves, and can gain access to special unlockable moves that can be unleashed when a \"fury\" or \"focus\" gauge is filled up during battle."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Alternate ending"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the PS2 and Xbox versions, after completing \"Friendship in Flames\", one more mission \"Revenge of the Sith\", is unlocked. It gives the player the opportunity to play as Anakin (aka Darth Vader) during the duel on Mustafar, with the objective of defeating Obi-Wan Kenobi. The duel plays out the same until the very end, where Anakin avoids Obi-Wan's blade in his leap behind Obi-Wan to the lava river bank and fatally stabs Obi-Wan with his lightsaber, killing him. He then kicks Obi-Wan's corpse near the lava. Anakin is then greeted by Palpatine as he steps out from his shuttle, who he then tells him, \"Excellent work my apprentice. There are none left to oppose us; the galaxy is ours now.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being presented with a brand new Sith lightsaber, Anakin activates his lightsaber and stabs Palpatine.

They lower their weapons as Anakin says, \"No... the galaxy belongs to me...!\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is unknown if Sidious killed Yoda in this non-canonical ending, or if Yoda survived the duel. There is also no mention whatsoever in the game of the confrontation between Yoda and Sidious. Palpatine only declares that \"There are none left to oppose us,\" causing confusion as to whether or not Yoda's fate was the same as it was in the film. This alternate ending is named in the game as \"Ultimate Revenge Of The Sith\" as the Sith finally won against the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also, without Obi-Wan, Padm\u00e9 would not be taken to Polis Massa and not be able to give birth to Luke and Leia Skywalker, and probably would die before even giving birth, thus Luke and Leia would never be born, leaving the galaxy without any new hope forever."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alternatively, although it is not shown, it could be presumed that she would give birth in Vader's care.

Some of these costumes depict Sith versions of certain Jedi characters and vice-versa.

In the levels \"The Final Lesson\" and \"Assassination on Mustafar,\" music from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords is also used. This music can also be found in some multiplayer duel levels. Music from Episode III was not added in the 2006 \"Greatest Hits\"/\"Platinum Hits\" release of the game on PS2 and Xbox."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the GBA and DS versions, however, music from the film as well as The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones was indeed used, although the output slightly varied due to differences in sound output between the two handheld systems.
