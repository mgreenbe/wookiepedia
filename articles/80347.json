Lathaam was known for his big mouth, and when Adalric Cessius Brandl came to Najiba seeking passage to Trulalis, Lathaam was the first to speak up. He told the Dark Jedi that no ship was allowed offworld while the Children of Najiba were near the planet. Brandl replied by strangling Lathaam's lover, Arruna to death. Lathaam carried his dead love out of the bar, devastated. It is unknown what happened to Lathaam after this encounter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
