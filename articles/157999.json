In 3 ABY, the starship was under the command of Captain Magna Tolvan, who led the Rebel Intelligence unit Strike Team Misericorde. The rebels received intelligence regarding the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra, whom Tolvan had crossed paths with before, which led the Unnamed to intercept an Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle near Asteroid Helix 13-v.

That was when Aphra reached the room and incapacitated Teezee-Too, which immediately caught the attention of Tolvan. As  the captain and Strike Team Misericorde rushed to the operations room, Aphra clothed the protocol droid with her jacket, hat and gloves and remotely controlled the droid to resemble her.

Meanwhile, Tolvan continued to pursue the rogue archaeologist through a maintenance section, the pair scuffling and exchanging comments about their past endeavours together along the way.

In this time, Tolvan had awoken and was making her way to the bridge.
