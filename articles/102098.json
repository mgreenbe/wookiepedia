The organization was established as a response to the inaction of the Galactic Republic's Judicial Forces in dealing with pirates and privateers in the sector. The Security Force was founded using off-world loans, and were armed with ships built on Eriadu and Sluis Van. The forces faced a pirate alliance known as Q'anah's Marauders, but were eventually able to defeat the pirates in the years prior to the Battle of Naboo using their anti-pirate taskforce."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
