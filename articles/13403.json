In order to gain control of temple, Count Dooku sent his Separatist Army to attack. The Republic sent two Jedi\u2014Master Halsey and his Padawan Knox\u2014and several ARF troopers. The Republic troops were able to hold back the Separatist forces and held the upper hand in the battle. However, in order to test the powers of his new apprentice, Savage Opress, Dooku sent him to Devaron to finish the battle and destroy the Republic forces. Opress mercilessly slaughtered all the clones upon his arrival, including ARF Commander Trauma. This was made all the more easy by the clones foolishly attempting to engage Savage in close combat. Finding the two Jedi in front of temple's door, he attacked Halsey, and although the Roonan fought hard, Opress struck him down. Knox, after witnessing his master's death, attacked his master's killer. However, Opress effortlessly slashed him across the chest, sending him flying into the temple doors, dead. Upon successfully completing his mission, Opress returned to Serenno."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after Opress's attack, Delta Squad (Fixer, Boss, Scorch and Sev) arrived at the Jedi Temple with the dead bodies of Halsey and Knox, where Jedi High Council members Obi-Wan Kenobi, Adi Gallia, Plo Koon and Saesee Tiin were all gathered to discuss the recent events on Devaron. Meanwhile, Savage Opress, upon his arrival at Serenno, told his master that the mission was a success. Dooku declared that the two of them would grow to be even stronger than Darth Sidious and that they would rule the Galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
