It was possible to mount Caldorf VII interceptor missiles to Whisperlikes, but the launchers were only able to fire forward. Because multiple species flew Whisperlikes, the language used in their control boards could be changed using a translator card. Han Solo destroyed a large number of Whisperlikes during the Battle of the Poln system. In the aftermath of the battle Senior Captain Thrawn's agent, Vaantaar, acquired one Whisperlike to his master, who was able to use the ship to learn more about his enemies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
