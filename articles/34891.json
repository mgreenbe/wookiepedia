He uses ruthless training methods which result in the Inquisitors sustaining serious injuries including the loss of limbs and eyes. After slicing off the Sixth Brother's left arm, Vader demands that the wounded Inquisitor continue the fight. The Grand Inquisitor intervenes, expressing concern about Vader's violent training methods.

Vader believes that the Inquisitorius are not ready to hunt down and kill survivors of the Great Jedi Purge. The Grand Inquisitor disagrees, telling Vader that the Inquisitors are former Jedi. Vader disparages the Jedi Order's defensive combat methods which are based around minimizing bloodshed. He blames this error for infecting all of the Inquisitors' tactics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they enter a meeting room with a holomap in the center, the Grand Inquisitor reminds Vader that the Emperor appointed him to his position and believes in his ability.

The Grand Inquisitor recognizes that Vader despises them but reminds Vader that the Emperor tasked them with hunt down the Jedi. Since Vader is in charge of the Inquisitorius, he reminds the Sith apprentice that their failure will reflect badly on him rather than the Grand Inquisitor.

One of the targets is the Jedi archivist Jedi Master Jocasta Nu, who has been given extra emphasis for yet unclear reasons.

The Inquisitor vows to read through everything in the Jedi Archives. Lord Vader reminds him that his task is to search the Archives for clues about the surviving Jedi including personal information and family connections. He warns the Grand Inquisitor not to fail.

Nu explains that she has not built an Archive here but rather a school. She tells him that she has to leave in order to retrieve something. Though the mission will be extremely dangerous, she fears that letting it sit where it is would be worse.
