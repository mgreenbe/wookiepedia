It was a unique combination of the functions of an electrostaff and a blaster rifle. It consists of a staff that could be collapsed to a length roughly equivalent to a standard blaster rifle. When extended, the weapon's tip(s) are electrified up to 11,000 volts and tended to be either purple or yellow in color and are the primary contact points of the weapon during combat. The number of tips on the weapon depended on the model (AB-75 and J-19 had two, the CJ-9 had one). The weapon is then used in melee combat as a quarterstaff. When retracted, the weapon's blaster function is used and functions as a blaster rifle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the devastation of Lasan, bo-rifles were rarely seen in the galaxy, although some would later fall into the hands of both the Alliance to Restore the Republic as well as the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Agent Kallus, a member of the Galactic Empire, acquired his bo-rifle via the Boosahn Keeraw: the warrior way of the Lasat species in which a Lasat gifted their weapon to their opponent after being defeated in combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
