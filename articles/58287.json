This update allowed players to create homes with working windows, and to commemorate the occasion, a limited time item was made available in the form of a small, windowed Nabooian house. Due to a lack of sources regarding this item, it is not exactly clear how player's would obtain this item. The closure of the game on December 15, 2011 makes accessing the Sony Online Entertainment website and message boards for further information even more difficult."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nonetheless, from an in-universe perspective, information regarding Guy Remmington is limited. This individual's first and only mention was merely on the description of the item, which could be used a decorative item in player's homes. Given that this item was named in such a way as to be considered a personal rendition of Remmington's doing, it can be deduced that Remmington was an architect. However, this individual's gender and species remain unidentified."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
