The weapon possessed slots for two power packs to be inserted, a feature which made it unique. When one pack ran out of energy an onboard computer within the weapon would automatically switch usage to the second pack. The two packs halved the rate at which a user would have to reload their weapon, but as the time between reloads for blasters were relatively long anyway this proved not to be as strong a selling point as the OK-98's designers had hoped. The weapons relatively heavy weight compared to other carbines put off most users, and after only six years of production SoroSuub canceled production of the carbine due to poor sales. After its discontinuation, the carbine became popular on the black market once a modification was designed which allowed the weapon to draw from both paks at once, increasing the weapons power but also the rate at which its components wore out. The modification was illegal and sensitive, with amateur attempts often resulting in the weapon becoming dangerous to use for the wielder as it would overheat and explode."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The OK-98 was first shown in Dangerous Covenants a sourcebook released in 2014 for the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game produced by Fantasy Flight Games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
