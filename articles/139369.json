Graf argued that stories are important because they can inspire great acts and inspire individuals to be heroes.

Banz didn't believe the stories but was happy to hear them anyways as it helped the work feel like it went by faster. Jinby told him that stories were an important way to learn about the world and that they had lessons on how to be a good person. Banz believed he already was good but Jinby said that the only way they could know is if his goodness is put to the test.

Jinby asked Mattis for help but Fikk threatened Mattis by sending him into the splitter first if he took another step. Mattis Banz thought of the Rebel Alliance heroes, Princess Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, and Admiral Gial Ackbar and all the other heroes Jinby told him in these stories they told.
