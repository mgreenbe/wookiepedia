Synthetic Naorstrachem was used by Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. to fabricate the webbing that was shot from the Anti-Riot Tangle Gun 7. The synthetic form was often combined more readily with a shrinking agent, which was required for not only contraction of the webbing around the target, but also ease of storage within a gun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
