It was designed and built by an Ortolan known as Whistler. During the time of the Old Republic, the cafe was very popular, but it eventually fell on hard times. Unfortunately, the geyser made it a cold, damp place to eat in and the noise drowned out conversation. The customers stopped coming, and the Whistler's Whirlpool was eventually abandoned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
