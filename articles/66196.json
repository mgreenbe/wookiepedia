The Separatist leader remains snug in his fortress. Swan, determined not to fail, enters the heavily protected mansion. Ignoring the taunts of her foe, Swan slices through doors, fends off battle droids, leaps huge chasms, and traverses through mazes, finally to reach the impregnable door leading to the leader's chambers. Quick on her feet, she slices through the control panel with her lightsaber, locking herself out, but locking the Separatist leader in. Watching the Jedi exit the fortress, the leader sighs to himself, knowing that his saferoom will be his tomb."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
