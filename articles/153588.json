Cambias as part of the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game adventure \"Loyalties\", which was published in the Star Wars Adventure Journal 4 in 1994. The species fleshed out the planet profile but did not feature in the adventure. Cambias did suggest several ideas for further adventures on Jerrilek, which included suggestions that the species was not necessarily extinct, had been students of the Force or that their ruins contained advanced technological devices. The species was also mentioned in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, published in 2008."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
