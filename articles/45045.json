The Nothoiin Corridor, blazed through the Ivax Nebula by Ecclessis Figg's explorers, connected the Corellian Trade Spine to the Eriadu Way. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, it had become regarded as a part of the Hydian Way after so many traders used it during the final century of the Galactic Republic that some astrographers considered the Hydian Way to have \"jumped\" from its old course to the bypass through Eriadu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
