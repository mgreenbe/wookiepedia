They had four treaded wheels on each side, which were protected with armored plating. On the front face was a narrow horizontal windshield and two top-mounted cannons. A TNT's interior was spacious enough to accommodate at least one person and a canister containing a protective outfit and helmet that were designed as heat shields. Thanks to its twin fireball-shooting neutron cannons, it could easily blast into solid rock."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TNTs were created for use in the Spice Mines of Kessel when the Galactic Republic was still the dominant political regime in the galaxy. By 44 BBY, some could also be found on Telos IV, where malab was being mined. Their primary function was to blast through rock in order to open up new mine shafts. Following the fall of the Republic, the Galactic Empire took over the mines of Kessel. The Imperial Supreme Slavelord of the Spices Mines, a three-eyed mutant named Trioculus, discovered other uses for the TNTs. During his stint as Galactic Emperor in 5 ABY, he employed them to burn down the forests of Yavin 4 in his search for the Lost City of the Jedi. One of them managed to bring down the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Treaded Neutron Torches first appeared in The Lost City of the Jedi, the second novel in Paul and Hollace Davids's so-called Jedi Prince series\u2014which was released from 1992 to 1993.
