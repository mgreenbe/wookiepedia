After Chewie scouts the perimeter with his macrobinoculars, Zarro shows him the air vents. She proposes sneaking down with the hoist line so that the indentured laborers can all climb out tonight without risking a fight. However, the Andelm beetle lava sometimes collapse the air shafts so they have to find a stable one. Chewie is wary of getting stuck but Zarro tells her that her plan is to allow herself to get captured. To keep in contact, Zarro has borrowed Chewbacca's transmitter, which is fitted with a homing beacon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As planned, Zarro is captured by Jaum's guards. As punishment, Jaum orders that her shifts be doubled and that her rations be halved. She finds her father Arrax and her friend Dek and tells them that she has a plan to escape. Zarro uses a shovel to begin digging through a hollowed-out section of the mine. Chewie is able to monitor her movements with another transmitter.

Addressing the forced laborers, he tells them that their dealings are reaching an end. Jaum reveals that he has sold the entire Andelm beetle operation including his slaves to the Galactic Empire. The Empire is interested in the Andelm beetles, which contain an abundance of rare organics used in the manufacturing of blasters. He intends to replace his indentured work force with droids. When one of the slave labourers tries to attack Jaum with a shovel, Jaum shoots him dead with his blaster pistol. Sensing labor problems on the horizon, Jaum orders his guards to execute the laborers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the guards can execute their captives, Chewbacca appears behind them and overpowers them. He even kills one with his Bowcaster. After introducing her friend Chewbacca to her father and the other miners, Arrax tells the miners that they have to fight their way out. Using a broken-down GNK-series power droid, Chewie is able to fashion an improvised rod. He uses the rod to disabled a wheeled battle droid. Meanwhile, Jaum learns about the miners' \"hairy demon\" from one of his guards, who is addicted to spice. Having other plans, Jaum executes the guard with his blaster pistol.
