It was similar to the Force power Control Pain. Ascendants who used this spell were able to ignore the pain caused by wounds and continue to act as if they were not injured. The spell did not heal the injury, and once the spell wore off, the caster would still feel the effects of the wounds. Block pain could also be used to resist the effects of being stunned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
