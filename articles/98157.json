In 3997 BBY, a Jedi Knight named Ulic Qel-Droma came to Empress Teta, and was promptly imprisoned by Satal in the Krath headquarters, the Iron Citadel. Satal was mistrustful of Qel-Droma, who claimed he wanted to join the Krath, and injected him with a Sith poison despite Aleema's objections. The poison sapped the strength and consciousness out of Qel-Droma, nearly killing him; however, Aleema, who had planned to manipulate Qel-Droma into turning to the dark side, called off Satal and ordered Norgor to help her bring the Jedi to her chambers. Satal's mistrust of Ulic Qel-Droma was only exacerbated when a group of Jedi, led by Nomi Sunrider, came to the Iron Citadel in an attempt to bring him back to the Republic, although Qel-Droma refused to go with Sunrider. Satal later saw a message from Qel-Droma to Sunrider explaining that he needed to break the Krath's power; infuriated, Satal ordered Norgor to send a squad of twenty men to apprehend Sunrider, and commanded him to assassinate Qel-Droma, instructing him to ignore all protests from Aleema.
