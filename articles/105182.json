When applied to armor it rendered the wearer nearly invisible, and extremely difficult to detect visually in virtually every environment. This coating could then be toggled on and off at the wearer's leisure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These crystals were commonly applied to the Model 1010 Photo-reactive Personal Armor, where it acted as a optical camouflage system. Due to the suit's camouflage abilities, however, the suit was considered illegal in most systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While photo-reactive coatings did much to prevent visual detection, they did little to shield the wearer from sensors; this is shown by the bounty hunter Mist, who fortified her suit with sensor stopping reflec plating, atop of which pho-reactive coating was applied. Combined, Mist was considered to be virtually undetectable, be it visually or through sensors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
