Their homeworld, Huloon, was a part of Hutt Space and was forcibly depopulated and converted into a nature preserve by the Hutts, resulting in the near extinction of the species. The Huloons then spread to nearby systems in order to escape their planet's fate. Some Huloons attempted to return every so often, simply trying to see their lost planet, only to be intercepted and tortured for entertainment by the Hutts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Huloons were first introduced in The Essential Atlas written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry and released on August 18, 2009.
