The Invincible launched TIEs but they were unable to reach the Rebels in time to prevent the destruction of the convoy. The loss of the supplies disrupted the operation for several weeks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Alliance held a diplomatic meeting with the Sullustans near Sullust, the Invincible disrupted the meeting and launched fighters. Hamo Blastwell and Keyan Farlander, flying R-22 Spearheads, held off the Imperial fighters until the meeting was concluded and all ships fled into hyperspace. The Invincible's attack, however, had been merely a diversion. While the meeting was taking place, stormtroopers kidnapped the Sullustan leader Sian Tevv. Farlander and Blastwell were called into action again to disable the shuttle that bore him to the Invincible and hold off Imperial fighters until a Rebel shuttle conducted a boarding operation and escaped into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Sullustans set up a plan with the Alliance; with captive Cygnus Spaceworks engineers, they modified a shuttle to appear to be an Imperial vessel. Rebel agents with the shuttle were able to get aboard the Invincible, disguised as suppliers delivering cargo to the ship. The cargo however was armed with an Imperial nuclear warhead, stolen earlier by Rebel pilots from the freighter Gafra. Just after the Rebel shuttle left, Invincible was blown to pieces thereby putting an end to Operation Strike Fear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
