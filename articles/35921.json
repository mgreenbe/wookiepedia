The medal had the highest rate of posthumous nominations of any Alliance decoration. It was often worn alongside the Defense of Yavin medal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The medal was characterized by a single silver pin depicting the first Death Star with a small Aurebesh number one at the center. It was worn below a ribbon rack on a dress uniform, or on the collar of a flight suit. There were a rare number of pilots who wore the medal, and were seen at with awe and admiration by younger colleagues and subordinates. The award was more rare than the Death Star II medal. The only member permitted to wear both the Death Star medal and Death Star II medal was Wedge Antilles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
