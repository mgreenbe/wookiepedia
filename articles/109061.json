When Qin was imprisoned aboard a New Republic transport, Qin's associate Ranzar Malk sent a crew of mercenaries to rescue him, which included Xi'an, Burg, Migs Mayfeld, and the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin. The team betrayed Djarin and left him for dead, but the bounty hunter escaped and imprisoned the mercenaries in one of the transport's prison cells. Djarin returned Qin to Ran, but had hidden a New Republic tracker in the Twi'lek's clothing. The tracker, which had been set off when the mercenaries infiltrated the transport, led a New Republic squadron to the space station where Ran operated. The squadron fired on the station, forcing Qin to take cover."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qin first appeared in Chapter 6 of the 2019 television show The Mandalorian, which aired on December 13, 2019, and was portrayed by Ismael Cruz Cordova."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
