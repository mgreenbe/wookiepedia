The maweater was so named because it was the primary predator of the wingmaw, another creature native to the island chain, and the two species were unintentionally transplanted to the Balmorran mainland by unwary explorers around six hundred years before the Great War. However, the maweaters were wiped out when the Sith Empire bombarded the planet during the Great War, and as a result, the wingmaw population flourished and soon became a threat to both sentients and the planet's ecosystem."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Balmorran maweaters were first mentioned in the Codex entry for wingmaws in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game released by BioWare in 2011.
