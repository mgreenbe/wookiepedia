Seizing the opportunity to sabotage Thrawn's Imperial Navy career, Moff Ghadi sent his aide Culper to speak with Thrawn's translator, Ensign Eli Vanto about the position. Culper insisted to Vanto that the position would come with a promotion to Lieutenant and soon Captain, and since the attach\u00e9's office was an extension of the Imperial Navy, Vanto would continue to serve his mandatory three years in the service. With Vanto still hesitant, Culper added that the position was not a desk job, and that Vanto would liason with the Imperial Navy as well as the system fleet's own defense force, and that he would start with a patrol craft, and would soon move up to command a frigate and up to a light or even heavy cruiser. Vanto, seeing the entire offer as a ruse to sabotage Thrawn's career, as well as motivated by discrimination and xenophobia, declined the offer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
