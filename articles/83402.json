It has recently been annexed by the Galactic Empire and many of the planet's inhabitants are making their way to the capitol for an Imperial ceremony celebrating this event. Two children, Thane Kyrell and Ciena Ree, are traveling to the ceremony with their families. Ciena's family lives out in the valleys with a group known as the First Wavers who are a simple, hardworking people who are descended from the original colonists of the planet. They have a very strong code of honor and use very little in the way of technology. Thane's family is part of the second wave of colonists who tend to be more affluent and live in the cities. Second Wavers and Valley Kindred tend to be at odds with each other and don't get along well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their different backgrounds, both children are fascinated with ships and flying. They both notice the same Lambda-class shuttle flying toward the ceremony grounds. It turns out this shuttle is carrying Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who officiates the ceremony. While the people of Jelucan look on, both Thane and Ciena sneak away to check out ships. They separately come upon the shuttle behind a security cordon. They are not alone; a group of older second wave boys see Ciena and begin berating her for being from the valley. Thane, despite being a second waver himself, defends Ciena, engaging the older boys in a fight. Ciena joins him. Before things get out of hand, the fight is interrupted by Tarkin and his entourage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The boys take off but Thane and Ciena remain behind. Instead of punishing them, Tarkin questions them. Finding out they were merely interested in the ship, he quizzes them and comes to realize the children are bright. He invites them into the shuttle where they continue to impress by identifying the controls. Tarkin gives them a speech about the glory of serving the Empire and the possibility that one day they themselves could pilot a shuttle or even command a Star Destroyer for the Empire. This sets the two children on a new life's mission: to attend an Imperial Academy and become officers in the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five years later, Thane and Ciena have become good friends and flight partners despite their families disliking each other. They train on Thane's brother's ship, which sits unused since he went off to the academy himself. Over the next few years, the two train together whenever they can, helping one another and continuing to become an inseparable team.

Inexplicably, the evidence points to Ciena as the culprit. Ciena's roommate Jude does her own independent investigation and concludes that Thane sabotaged his own cannon. With insufficient evidence either way, no one is expelled but both of them fail the assignment. This drops them from their top spots in the class."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They both approach Jude to continue her investigation into who sabotaged Thane's cannon.

His faith in the Empire continues to falter. On the Devastator, Ciena sees the data feeds from the Death Star go dark. While her superiors deny it, she knows the station and all her academy friends aboard it are likely dead. This was confirmed when she was ordered to escort Lord Vader from his TIE fighter back to the Devastator, as well as to scout out the wreckage of the Death Star to confirm whether or not it was truly gone, the ensuing wreckage and mangled metal was the only view she could see for miles around.
