The Hijadoan population was decimated when the Imperial Navy launched a massive bombardment of the planet, during the early years of the New Order. The bombardment leveled many major cities, leaving the Hijadoan people in need of medical assistance and other relief efforts. The Imperial warships tried to prevent any relief efforts from reaching the planet's surface, while a garrison was installed to ensure that there was no rebellious activity among the Hijadoans. Doctor Parlay Thorp led the relief efforts that helped the Hijadoans recover from the attack, and she was surprised to learn that the average Hijadoan was quite long-lived, and had incredible physical and emotional healing abilities. It was Noneen who told her that Hijadoans simply lived as long as they wanted to live, although he did agree to let her take blood and tissue samples for further investigation. She also learned that Hijadoans had an ability to know beforehand when someone else was going to die, although referred to death as nothing more than leaving."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
