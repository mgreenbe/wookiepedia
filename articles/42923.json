While attending a meeting on his plans with several key players of the project, the conference room they were in suffered a minor explosion.

C-3PO went down to Maintenance for repairs, where he and R2-D2 discovered that the project's oil supply had been tampered with. The two went immediately to tell Egoreg, but were surprised en route by a group of Jawas. Rushing to their aid, Han Solo and Chewbacca ran into the Jawas as well, who were caught red-handed by C-3PO and R2-D2 sabotaging the machines and spoiling the oil supply, which had been the cause of the malfunctioning droid problem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jawas were punished, and Chewbacca was awarded a medal for capturing them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Egoreg's name is a slight respelling of George backwards \u2013 a nod to the creator of Star Wars.
