It was present at the Battle of Kuat. After its TIE squadrons had been overwhelmed to only a few remaining fighters by the Hawk-bats and Vibroaxe Prime, Mauler, to escape being defenseless to the snub fighters, bypassed the engagement zone by a significant distance, only to find itself within the range of Zsinj's Super Star Destroyer, Iron Fist. After a futile attempt of contending with the opposing ship, Mauler found herself spinning inflamed from half a dozen spots along her hull. Presumptuously the captain had believed that he could bring the damage under control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
