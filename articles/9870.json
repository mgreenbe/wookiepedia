The Escort Shuttle was part of a defense force for Science Station Youst, an XQ1 Platform that was officially a science station, but was also secretly a weapons lab. The station fell under attack by Ripoblus forces as retaliation for an attack on a convoy by Dimok raiders. The station called for assistance and Imperial forces under the command of Harkov arrived to intervene.
