Within each guild, there was a hive mind which governed each individual Surronian. They were known for their starship designs, unique creations almost never seen offworld. When the Surronian economy fell on hard times, they entered a contract with Rendili StarDrive, a deal which eventually produced the Starlight-class light freighter. They also produced the Conqueror-class assault ship, the same class of ship as Guri's Stinger. It is presumed the Surronian Farstar was also produced by Surronian craftsmen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
