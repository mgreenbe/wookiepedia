The contention was the result of the Mandalorian blockade of the Hydian Way, which prevented resources from traveling along the super-hyperroute. As starvation spread across the lower levels of Coruscant's Galactic City, panicked citizens began protesting and rioting against the Galactic Senates inability to break the blockade. The riots ended in 3660 BBY, when the smuggler Hylo Visz successfully led a group of fellow vagabonds against the Mandalorian cruisers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
