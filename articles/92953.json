The species freed themselves with encouragement from the Tionese, enemies of the Hutts from the Tion Hegemony, and had been formed by the time of Second Battle of Vontor during the Xim Wars. At the time of the battle the Tionese had forces present in the Moralan system where Moralan, the Moralan homeworld, was located but shortly afterwards they withdrew. With the Tionese gone a Hutt named Boonta Hestilic Shad'ruu attacked the republic and conquered it, driving the Moralans to extinction and so destroying the republic. The battle lasted three days and was celebrated in the three-day holiday collectively known as Boonta's Eve, named after the hero of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The republic of Moralan was first mentioned in an article by Rich Handley and Abel G.
