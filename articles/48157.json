D'an favored the Kloo horn, although could also play a mean Gasan string drum. He proved overbearing and compulsive to his band-mates, although the Modal Nodes earned a reputable standing in the music industry, and achieved reasonable success on the galactic circuit. However, the band largely remained an entertainment feature on the Outer Rim Territories, theorized to be due to the lack of vocals in their tracks. In particular, they became a popular fixture at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in Mos Eisley on Tatooine, where patrons preferred D'an's work on the Gasan string drum over his usual Kloo horn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, D'an and the Modal Nodes played their most recognizable tune \"Mad About Me\" on stage in Chalmun's cantina, although their performance was interrupted by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi slicing off the arm of the Aqualish Ponda Baba in defense of the young farmboy Luke Skywalker.
