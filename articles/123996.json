In 5 ABY Bey, along with her husband Kes Dameron, retired from the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and Bey was able to keep her A-wing as part of her compensation package. While living on Yavin 4, Bey would fly her A-wing as part of the Civilian Defense Force that was stationed there. When her son Poe was six years old, Bey would teach him how to fly in her A-wing allowing Poe to sit in her lap, learning how to control the ship from her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
