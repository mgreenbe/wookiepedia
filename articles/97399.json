That year, the Rebel Alliance launched a decisive attack against the Galactic Empire during the Battle of Endor, where they intended to destroy the Empire's second Death Star superweapon. Sant, one of the Pathfinders, was part of a strike team led by General Han Solo that was tasked with destroying the shield generator that powered the Death Star's shield. Their operation was a success, allowing Alliance forces to destroy the orbiting Death Star and fracture the Empire.

In 2016, at a screening of the second season finale of Star Wars Rebels, executive producer Dave Filoni speculated that the \"bearded old guy on Endor,\" Nik Sant, could be Rex, suggesting it did not make any sense for there to be an \"old guy\" on Endor unless it was someone like Rex. The Rebels series finale, which aired on March 5, 2018, confirmed that Rex did fight at the Battle of Endor, but did not go so far as to confirm that Rex and Sant are the same character. Six months after the episode's airing, Filoni revealed in an interview with IGN he ultimately chose to not canonize the theory because he felt that laying down an already established character prior to his coming to Star Wars wasn't correct, adding that Rex could have been present at Endor and not be Sant, even though some fans could choose to believe that Sant and Rex are the same individual while others choose to not do so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In recreations of shots from Return of the Jedi in the Star Wars Galaxy of Adventures short \"Han Solo - From Smuggler to General,\" Rex is used instead of Sant wearing clone trooper armor.
