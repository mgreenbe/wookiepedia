Fel was irked by beings who barged into his office without asking, as the offices alternatively served as a place where he worked, kept updated on the news, and relaxed from the pressures of politics. He had a secretary in the outer offices who served as a greeter to visitors and notified him when people arrived to see him, and he received frequent visits from his fianc\u00e9e, Jedi Knight Jaina Solo. It was during one such visit that Solo saw that their separate careers were getting in the way of their relationship, and she called off their engagement, although they later became re-engaged. Fel's quarters then served as an intimate meeting area where he and Solo could escape from their troubles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Offices of the Imperial Head of State first appeared in the fifth novel in the Fate of the Jedi series, Fate of the Jedi: Allies, written by Christie Golden and published on May 25, 2010.
