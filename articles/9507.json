The final product was only recognizable as a descendant of the Dreadnaught-class by the nose of the ship. Most of the internal structure was exposed to space, while a dorsal and ventral fin provided added maneuverability. The modifications resulted in greater fuel efficiency."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These modifications removed the internal docking capacity of the Dreadnaught-class, but the ships were equipped with 20 umbilical docking fixtures like those on the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate.
