The 00D-A was a strong shield with a good regeneration rate, but approximately half of the damage taken by the shield bled through to the starship's hull. Thus, pilots were able to activate their hull's charged plating to significantly increase damage reduction for a short time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
