A battle line was positioned in front of an opposing battle line, crossing the front of the formation. Each cruiser in the line was then able to target the lead enemy cruiser in turn, usually inflicting severe damage. The enemy line could only counter effectively with the weapons of the lead cruiser; the ships behind it either had no way of firing past the lead vessel, or, if they did, fired at long range."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
