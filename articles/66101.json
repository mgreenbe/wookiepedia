It also had a platform underneath connected by various wires, along with six laser cannons on the perimeter of the platform. The gas jets also acted as a weak point: blowing them up would result in them falling to the ground, as well as the wires connecting the canopy with the platform separating. The gaps between wires were large enough for an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor to fly between."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial siege balloons were utilized during the Rebel's Raid on Bespin.
