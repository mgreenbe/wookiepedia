Maul challenged Pre Vizsla, the leader of Death Watch, to a leadership battle to determine which of them would rule Mandalore. Maul defeated and killed Vizsla in single combat, however not all of the Death Watch forces agreed to acquiesce to the sudden shift of leadership. Bo-Katan Kryze, the Duchess' sister and a Vizsla loyalist, made her forces into the Mandalore resistance and rebelled against Maul's rule, leading to the fighting. Obi-Wan Kenobi also participated in the battle, as did Darth Sidious, who fought Maul and Maul's brother, Savage Opress. In the ensuing fight, Savage was killed by Darth Sidious, while Maul was captured by the Sith Lord and imprisoned in the Spire on Stygeon Prime."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul was liberated by his Mandalorian super commandos, but, a short time later, his mother, the powerful Nightsister Talzin, was killed during the Second Battle of Dathomir.
