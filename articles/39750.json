Wielding the vibrosword required the use of two hands, and was difficult and dangerous for untrained users, but could be a deadly weapon when held by a skilled combatant. The weapon was notably used by the Royal Guard Champions, who were extremely skilled warriors that were a part of the Emperor's Royal Guard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
