Residing on the refueling platform Colossus, she owned a popular tavern where fellow station residents could eat, drink or seek advice from the tavern owner. After the First Order occupied the Colossus, Aunt Z was arrested for vocally expressing her dislike of the First Order. After Kazuda Xiono and Torra Doza helped Aunt Z, Hype Fazon, Grevel, and Nod overcome their stormtrooper guards to escape the planet in a stolen transport, Aunt Z decided that the pair would go to Takodana and hide out with a friend of hers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Enter Kaz"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aunt Z, originally from the planet Crul, owned a tavern on the Colossus, an independent refueling station on Castilon.

They were looking for Poe's friend Jarek Yeager. Aunt Z led them to Yeager and Poe left with him, leaving Xiono at the tavern.

Shortly after, when Neeku Vozo decided to help Xiono get a start to his racing career by announcing he would be challenging solo the next day, Aunt Z quickly opened up bets. Xiono attempted to tell her he didn't want to race, but Yeager told him he couldn't as Grool would throw him off the platform if he refused to race."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rascally Rucklin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Kaz struggled to fit into Yeager's repair shop, he visited Aunt Z's Tavern to seek solace.

Later, Kaz was pursued by stormtroopers while navigating through the ledges of Doza Tower. Aunt Z placed a bet of 20 credits on Kaz and encouraged her guests and employers to do the same.

Xiono resolved to do something, and along with Torra and CB-23, headed to the west docks to rescue the prisoners after being told where they were by Yeager and Captain Doza. He told Aunt Z, who was using the unwilling Fazon as a footstool to reach a vent hole in the container, that the plan was for her and her fellow prisoners to get onto the First Order transport before Xiono and Torra helped them overpower their guards so they could steal the ship, as the Colossus would be torn apart in a search if they broke them out now.
