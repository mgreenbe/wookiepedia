He was one of several heads of state summoned by the Imperial General Arkos Rakton to a diplomatic summit on Outpost 256, where Rakton seized the heads of state by force. Vonn and Archduke Kailur almost accepted Rakton's offer to join the Empire when the captives were liberated from Rakton's forces by Havoc Squad. Afterwards, those that remained loyal to the Republic called for execution of the traitors, but Havoc Squad Major refused to carry it out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
