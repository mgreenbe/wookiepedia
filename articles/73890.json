He preferred the DL-18 model over other blaster pistols due to its low cost, how easy it was to repair, and its low profile. He brought a couple of modifications to the blaster during his time with it, such as wrapping the grip in dewback leather and modifying the trigger's sensitivity. In addition, Kanan let Sabine Wren increase the weapon's power output."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
