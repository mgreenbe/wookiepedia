In 4 ABY, after learning that the Galactic Empire was constructing a second Death Star in the Endor system, the Rebel Alliance decided to launch an attack on the incomplete battlestation. A commando team was dispatched to the Forest Moon of Endor to destroy the shield generator protecting the Death Star; with the deflector shield out of the way, the Alliance Fleet, under the command of Mon Calamari Admiral Ackbar, could arrive in-system to destroy the station. However, the Alliance had fallen into a trap orchestrated by Emperor Palpatine; when the Alliance Fleet arrived, they were trapped between an Imperial fleet and a shielded and operational Death Star. As the battle raged between the opposing armadas, the strike team succeeded in destroying the shield generator, leaving the Death Star vulnerable to attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Lando Calrissian, flying the freighter Millennium Falcon as Gold Leader, used the opportunity to lead several Rebel starfighters\u2014including Gold Wing\u2014into the battlestation's superstructure to destroy the Death Star's main reactor.
