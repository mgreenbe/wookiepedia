Two of them were befriended by Star Tours droid G2-4T a few months after Endor. They usually were located on the droid lifts and other high places, so they could make their nests. They were also capable of laying eggs, something 4T was unaware of, although their chances of the eggs hatching were smaller than RX-24 making his first flight without problems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hasbro released SK-Z38 as an exclusive Star Tours action figure.
