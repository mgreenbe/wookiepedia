When the game's second add-on, Rage of the Wookiees was released, it added the ability to mine asteroids for various resources. The developers also added Mining Stations to most of the game's star systems to provide the players with an easy way of selling these resources for credits. Only few players however sell asteroid resources to such stations, as the prices paid by other players are significantly higher."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The station cannot be entered and when hailed only gives the option to sell asteroid resources."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
