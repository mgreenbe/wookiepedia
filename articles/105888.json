While attempting to discover the source of the malfunctions, it is found that the spores from the feeder plant had settled in one of the lower cargo holds and began to grow. Mobile feeders roam the ship, sourcing supplies for the mother plant, draining water and eventually trying to kill crewmen for the nutrients in their blood. Threatened, the crew of the FarStar attempt to battle the plant and find a way to defeat it. Despite being hampered by the arrival of a Lancer-class frigate and escort, Doctor Varel DeVay develops a gaseous poison to kill the plant and save the FarStar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
