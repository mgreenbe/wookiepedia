After the Conquest of Makeb in 3638 BBY, Vorjok was posted to guard the Hutt's stockpile of Isotope-5 in the Stronghold One on Makeb's volcanic mesa. Vorjok was visibly angry at the incompetence of the local InterStellar Regulators, who failed to increase security even after several seismic shocks rocked the mesa, believing them mere groundquakes. Shortly after, an Imperial team led by Sith Lord Cytharat assaulted the stronghold and even though Vorjok boasted of having killed Force-users before, he was promptly defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
