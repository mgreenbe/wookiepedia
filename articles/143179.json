The evil spirit proceeded to bind the students and researchers to his will, and induct them into the Cult of Exar Kun. Afterward, he sent them to Talus, to the Corellia University research outpost they had originally come from to enslave the rest of the people there. The majority of them were then sent back to Yavin 4. After losing contact with the outpost and fearing the worst, Professor Cornelius Wagglehorn hired a group of spacers to travel to Talus and investigate. The spacers learned what had transpired and informed the professor. He provided them with the coordinates to the tomb and implored them to destroy the evil Sith Lord's spirit within. The Executioner was among the dark Force-users' enslaved by the spirit of Exar Kun and confronted the spacers alongside the Caretaker of the Lost Souls. However, the spacers managed to defeat all former students, including The Executioner, and then proceed to confront the spirit of the Dark Lord himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
