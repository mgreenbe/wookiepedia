In 4 ABY during a skirmish during the implementation of Operation: Cinder, Commander Iden Versio and Agent Del Meeko of Inferno Squad defected after trying to rescue civilians. They hijacked an AT-AT parked at the center and destroyed anti-air turbolasers and the targeting satellite in the sector which resulted in the shutting down of all nearby turbolaser emplacements. This allowed Versio and Meeko to escape in the Corvus, as well as civilians who were escaping in their own vessels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
