Besides being more portable for soldiers, this effectively limited the size of the grenade's explosions, reducing the risk of friendly casualties. In spite of this, as a military model, its power was calibrated to maximize enemy casualties within its blast radius."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It bore a similar design to the Class-A thermal detonator also manufactured by Merr-Sonn Munitions but had a slate-gray shell instead of the Class-A's reflective shell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the V-1 thermal detonator was officially contracted to the Republic, whose Grand Army employed them, alongside the V-6 haywire grenade, as the standard grenades of its clone troopers. Unlike the V-6, clones of all units were issued the V-1, including clone sharpshooters, clone jet troopers, clone heavy troopers, and Advanced Recon Commandos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Republic was its official buyer, V-1 thermal detonators were widely sighted on the battlefield in the hands of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

Responding to these reports, Merr-Sonn Munitions was keen on denying any accusations as to the sale of the thermal detonators to the enemy of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
