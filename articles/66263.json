In response, Kanan tells Ezra to sit down and find his center. After a short time, Ezra tells Kanan that although he knows that Saw is extreme, from what happened on Geonosis, it seems to him that Saw is the only rebel leader who doesn't care about all of the politics.

A technician asks Mothma, approaching, if he should shut down the transmission, but she tells him not to as she wants to speak with Saw. When he sees her, Saw tells Mothma that her Rebellion doesn't have the will to win against the Empire. Mothma states that she will not be lectured on military strategy by a criminal, which Saw laughs off as he points out that the Empire sees them both as criminals. In response, Mothma retorts that the Partisans target civilians, kill surrendering enemies and break every rule of engagement, pointing out that doing so makes them sink to the Empire's level. Saw calls out Mothma's burst of passion, stating that this is the leader the Rebellion needs and wondering where this was earlier. He tells her that when the Rebellion is destroyed, and the Empire's reign across the galaxy is unopposed, she can at least be content knowing that she played by the rules.

When she asks for questions, Ezra notes that this operation won't really hurt the Empire. Sabine points out to Ezra that was a comment, not a question, but agrees that he has a point.

Sabine opens a panel, and she and Chopper get to work. She tells the droid to tap into the secondary comm relay, and the two install the spike. They are promptly regaled with a transmission from the commander of the cruiser, the Marauder, asking for docking clearance. Sabine realizes that they've accidentally tapped into the main comm channel, and orders Chopper to put the ship through to the station so the Imperials don't realize something is wrong. Ezra has a different idea, and asks Chopper to put him through.
