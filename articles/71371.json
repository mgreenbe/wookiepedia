During a Life Day celebration aboard the Millennium Falcon, Finn performed the song, which was his personal favorite, with instrumental accompaniment by Max Rebo on his red ball jett organ. Whilst attending sentients, as well as a murder of porgs, found Finn's performance unpleasant initially, the group overcame their aversion when Rose Tico pointed out that Finn was singing the original Huttese version of the song, and joined Finn in singing \"Joh Blastoh\" together to celebrate the day of life. The attending Poe Dameron was thus moved to tears of joy by the collective celebration of Life Day he was witnessing before his eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Joh Blastoh\" appears in The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special, released on Disney+ in 2020.
