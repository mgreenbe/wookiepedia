There, she gave birth to her second son, Pqweeduk, and raised the boys in the more peaceful ways of their clan. She tried to shelter Greedo and Pqweeduk from their violent past, but thirteen years later Greedo discovered one of the hidden colony ships and wanted to know more. Soon afterward, Navik and other Chattza Clan hunters found the refugees, slaughtering them. Neela, her sons, her brothers, and a few remnants of the clan barely got away, relocating to Nar Shaddaa.
