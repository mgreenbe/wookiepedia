During the time that they owned the cantina, the brothers were running an illegal spice den there. The two brothers vanished shortly after selling the cantina to Chalmun, possibly because they were fearful of the Wookiee discovering the many bodies that were stored in the basement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
