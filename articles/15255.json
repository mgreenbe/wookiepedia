Rebel Alliance operatives Cassian Andor, Jyn Erso and K-2SO, as well as two Guardians of the Whills, Chirrut \u00cemwe and Baze Malbus, also became involved in the battle against the Imperial forces. However, in the aftermath of the fight, Andor, Erso, \u00cemwe, and Malbus were all taken prisoner by the Partisans and brought to the Catacombs of Cadera."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the convoy passed by Tythoni Square, a grenade was tossed from a balcony in front of the tank. Its detonation halted the vehicle's progress, and the Partisans revealed themselves, opening fire on the stormtroopers, both from ground level and with snipers atop the nearby buildings. Once Jyn Erso entered the street to save a child and return it to her mother, her escort, Cassian Andor, was forced to help her to safety, shooting the tank's weapon operator who had just destroyed a nearby tower with a missile. As Jyn hid in front of the stopped vehicle, Cassian noted a Partisan atop a nearby elevated bridge preparing some grenades and shot him to create a distraction\u2014as upon his fall to the ground, the explosives detonated\u2014to the sight of Partisan troop leader Benthic. As Jyn and Cassian ran to safety, another bomb was tossed at the stormtroopers' feet, and after being detonated, the Partisans raided the vehicle to collect the Kyber crystals. They finished just as Imperial reinforcements, which included an All Terrain Scout Transport, arrived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Jyn and Cassian fought their way through more troopers, Cassian's reprogrammed droid, K-2SO, arrived and detonated a grenade upon a squad of charging troopers. The trio returned to the square, where the reinforcements checked the damages suffered by the tank and were mistaken for an actual Imperial droid directing prisoners. Jyn and Cassian were only saved by the intervention of two Guardians of the Whills, Chirrut \u00cemwe and Baze Malbus. As K-2 returned to Cassian's ship, the Partisans took over the square and captured the rebels and Guardians, as Benthic felt they were hostile due to Cassian's attack. Once Jyn revealed she had businesses with Saw Gerrera for being the daughter of Galen Erso, the Partisans put bags on their heads (which slightly annoyed Chirrut, who was blind anyway) and took them to their headquarters in the Catacombs of Cadera, where Jyn was brought before Saw, while Cassian, Baze, and Chirrut were put in a cell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle on Jedha was created and developed for the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
