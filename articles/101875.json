Originally owned by Tomaas Azzameen, the ship was heavily modified to improve its speed and firepower. It eventually became Tomaas's personal transpor and was often co-piloted by his eldest son, Galin. Around 3 ABY, Tomaas entered into negotiations with the Alliance to Restore the Republic to supply them with much needed bacta, resulting in the ship being present at the Alliance's Echo Base during the Battle of Hoth. The Otana escaped Hoth and Tomaas continued to assist the Alliance, until he and Galin were killed in an Imperial attack while delivering bacta to the Rebels. After Tomaas's death, the ship passed to his youngest son, Ace. Wanted by the Empire, Ace and his surviving siblings fled their home and sought sanctuary with the Rebels. Ace soon decided to join the Alliance Starfighter Corps, but kept the Otana as his personal transport. Co-piloted by Ace's droid, MK-09, Ace used the ship for several missions, working alongside his brother Emon and sister Aeron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Corellian Engineering Corporation YT-2000, the Otana was originally designed to serve as a transport and light freighter. Developed as an evolution to the YT-series, the YT-2000 was designed to incorporate and improve on many of the more successful features of its predecessors and was designed to be customizable, with plenty of space and power made available for modifications. After the Otana came into the possession of Tomaas Azzameen, the ship was modified to further improve some of its features, with notable improvements to speed and firepower."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was 29 meters in length, with a symmetrical layout, similar to that of the YT-1930. The cockpit was located centrally at the front of the ship and could accommodate a crew of two. The pilot's station was at the front of the cockpit, with the co-pilot located directly behind and above him at a raised console. The upper half of the cockpit was constructed of a transparent material, such as transparisteel, which afforded both pilot and co-pilot clear views to the front, sides and above. The crew quarters provided a simple bunk for sleeping and a computer console, which could be used to receive e-mail. In addition to the crew, the ship could carry up to seven passengers. Like all YT-2000's, the ship's cargo space was extensive, with room for 115 tons of cargo and consumables for three months."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Otana's engines were located at the rear of the ship. The basic design could achieve a maximum atmospheric speed of 800 kilometers per hour and was fitted with a Class 2 primary hyperdrive and a backup hyperdrive rated at Class 12. Calculating courses through hyperspace was assisted by the ship's navicomputer. Modifications undertaken by the Azzameen family made the Otana faster than a standard YT-2000, and the ship was ultimately capable of achieving 96 MGLT."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the increased drive systems, the weapons systems onboard were also heavily upgraded. The YT-2000 model came fitted with two double laser cannons, located in turrets on top and underneath the ship, which provided total cover of both the dorsal and ventral hemispheres. Though both turrets could be manually operated by gunners, they also had an autofire mode, allowing them to track a specific target or lay down defensive fire against attacking ships. Following the upgrade to its weapons, the Otana also had a forward facing laser cannon which could be fired linked with the two turrets. A single forward facing ion cannon provided the pilot with the ability to disable enemy vessels, while the ship could carry a load of concussion missiles or other warheads in its twin warhead launchers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Otana's deflector shields, which were rated at 320 SBD, were heavier than those aboard most civilian freighters. Along with a hull rated at 114 RU, the shields were capable of withstanding most attacks, but the vessel could also carry extra countermeasures in the form of chaff, a burst of electromagnetic energy used to deflect either warheads or beam weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Otana was created during a relatively turbulent era in galactic history and came with more powerful weaponry and shielding than similar freighters. The ship came into the possession of Tomaas Azzameen, co-founder and head of the Twin Suns Transport Services shipping company, by 3 ABY. Due to the potentially dangerous nature of the family business, Azzameen had the ship modified to provide improved speed and firepower to ensure his safety.

The Rebels were in need of a supply of bacta but were reluctant to trade with smuggler groups following some previous difficulties in dealing on the black market. Shortly before the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, Tomaas entered negotiations to act as a middleman, using his contacts to procure a supply of bacta on the black market and deliver it to the Rebels. The negotiations led Tomaas and Galin to take the Otana to the Alliance's Echo Base on the ice-world Hoth. While he was still on the planet, the Empire's Death Squadron, under the command of Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, arrived in the Hoth system and launched an assault against the Rebel base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels quickly made preparations to evacuate the base and assigned two T-65 X-wing starfighters from Green Squadron to escort the Otana as the Azzameens made their own attempt to leave the planet. Though the Otana's escape vector was blocked by two Imperial-class Star Destroyers, the Rebels used Echo Base's ion cannon to temporarily disable one of the vessels, allowing the Otana to pass. As the freighter approached, however, the Imperials sent TIE/LN starfighters to intercept it. The X-wing pilots quickly eliminated the threat, but the Otana was struck by debris from one of the Imperial fighters before it made the jump to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Azzameens had escaped the Hoth system but the TIE debris had damaged the Otana's primary coolant tank, causing it to lose coolant pressure. Though they were in no immediate danger, Tomaas decided to take the ship to the family's Twin Suns Station for repairs. Taking precautions to ensure they weren't followed, the Azzameen's arrived in the Roccus system and Tomaas contacted his brother, Antan, aboard Twin Suns Station, to request emergency repairs. Yet, Antan refused to repair it, believing that the Empire would soon trace the ship to the Azzameens, and that the family had worked too hard to risk getting involved in the war. As a result, the Otana was forced to limp back to the Azzameen Home Base for repairs. Shortly after his return, Tomaas sent his youngest son, Ace, and his daughter, Aeron, to Harlequin Station to pick up a supply of coolant for the Otana."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Joining the Rebellion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the narrow escape from Hoth, Tomaas remained determined to supply the Alliance with the bacta they required and made arrangements to collect a shipment from a smuggler group.

Tomaas asked his children to provide an escort\u2014Aeron was given the Otana for the mission, while his sons, Ace and Emon, flew the YT-1300 light freighter Sabra and the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Andrasta respectively. After reaching the rendezvous, the Vasudra docked with the smugglers' Xiytiar-class transport End Run, and the smugglers began pumping the bacta into its tanks. When the smugglers attempted to double cross the Azzameens, the Otana's firepower helped to defeat the smugglers' DP20 frigate Loose Cannon. With their gunship lost, the End Run's crew agreed to complete the transfer and the Azzameens returned to Home Base with the bacta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tomaas soon arranged to deliver the bacta to the Rebels.

However, the transfer was interrupted by the arrival of Imperial forces led by Admiral Garreth Holtz aboard the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Corrupter. Ace helped to engage Imperial fighters with the Otana while the Rebels began to evacuate. Thanks in part to his efforts, most of the Rebel ships were able to escape, but he was unable to prevent the Vasudra being caught by the Corrupter and both Tomaas and Galin were killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Otana now became the property of Ace Azzameen. The Empire declared the Azzameen family traitors and issued warrants for their arrest. With little time before the Imperials arrived, Antan instructed their employees to flee and set off to collect supplies from a hidden cargo facility. Ace, meanwhile, took the Otana, accompanied by Aeron in the Sabra, to collect some weapons and valuables from Twin Suns Station. Though they were interrupted by the Victory II-class Star Destroyer Furious, the Otana was able to hold off the Empire's TIE fighters until Aeron retrieved the supplies. The pair rendezvoused with Emon at Home Base but learned that Antan had been captured by Viraxo Industries, a rival business firm that sought to ruin the Azzameen family's business. With nowhere else to turn, the Azzameen children tracked down the Alliance Fleet and requested shelter with the Rebels. While Emon and Aeron set about consolidating the Azzameen assets and establishing a new base of operations, Ace decided to join the Rebels as a starfighter pilot and was assigned to the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Defiance. The Otana departed with Ace's siblings and MK-09, but frequently returned to the Defiance so the young pilot could participate in missions for his family when his duties permitted.

Hoping to use the droid to monitor the Viraxo, Aeron asked Ace to take the Otana to recover it before the scavengers. By the time the Otana arrived in the system, however, the scavenger operation was already underway. The scavengers moved to attack the Otana, but Ace defeated several R-41 Starchasers and the Muurian transport Pelican before collecting the probe and proceeding to his rendezvous with Aeron via Tinoon Station. The station's customs officers prepared to inspect the Otana, but before they could discover the restricted Imperial property, a mercenary raiding party arrived in the system. Ace used the raid as a diversion to jump to hyperspace and returned to the Defiance after delivering the droid to Aeron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after recovering the probe droid, Ace was transferred to the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Liberty. Shortly after Ace's transfer, Antan's sources informed him that K'Armyn Viraxo would be traveling aboard the Personal Luxury Yacht 3000 Highroller to Destreg Spaceport. MK-09 was dispatched in the Otana to pick up Ace from the Liberty and bring him to the family's headquarters. After Antan briefed Ace and Emon, the Otana and Andrasta intercepted and ambushed the Highroller. They soon realized that they had walked into a trap when several bounty hunters arrived to collect a bounty that Viraxo had placed on the Azzameens. Nevertheless, the Otana and Andrasta proved equal to the challenge and both Azzameens escaped after destroying the empty Highroller."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial troubles"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Aeron learned that Vergesso Base in the Vergesso Asteroids was running low on supplies, she and Ace decided to steal some from the Viraxo industrial complex VXO-33274. Taking the Otana to the Bilbringi V repair yard, the pair met up with several former Twin Suns employees and headed to the Viraxo facility. The Otana soon eliminated the base's defenses, allowing Juno and Lara groups to pick up several cargo containers. However, before the Azzameens could depart, the Viraxo Marauder-class corvette Charybdis arrived, along with Razor-class starfighters from Gundark Squadron. The Azzameens engaged the Viraxo ships, destroying them all and ensuring that their convoy could escape to hyperspace, although the Otana sustained significant damage in the process. Before returning to the Liberty, Ace took the Otana to Vergesso Base to drop off Aeron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, MK-09 in the Otana received a message from Aeron that Vergesso Base was under assault from the Super Star Destroyer Executor. The droid quickly took the ship to pick up Ace and the Otana headed back to the Vergesso Asteroids in the hopes of rescuing Aeron before the Imperials boarded the base. Arriving behind the Imperial forces, Ace navigated the Otana past the Executor on a course for Vergesso Base. Fighting their way past TIE/LN starfighters and TIE/sa bombers, the pair reached and docked with the station.

Quesna Base was expecting a delivery of tibanna gas, which Dunari's agents were able to intercept and plant a bomb in. After Dunari arranged for MK-09 to bring the Otana to Ace on the Liberty, which was stationed near his casino, Dunari's Rest, Ace took the Otana to the XQ4 Platform Stockyard, where the pressure tank containing the tibanna was waiting for collection, and took the tank to Quesna Base. Dropping the tank near Quesna Base, Ace took the Otana to a safe distance before the proximity detonator caused the bomb to explode. The explosion provided a distraction which allowed Dunari's Muurian transport, the Deadman's Hand, to enter the area and board Quesna Base to rescue Emon.

Ace took the Otana to the junkyard to locate the datacore, with Emon in the Andrasta providing support. After locating the cargo container holding the datacore, MK-09 left the Otana and boarded the container to retrieve it. While MK-09 was getting the core, raiders in R60 T-wing interceptors arrived and moved to attack the Azzameens. The Otana and Andrasta, however, were able to eliminate the threat.
