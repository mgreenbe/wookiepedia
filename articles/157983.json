It was run by Vikas Sleer. The shop was reasonably well stocked, but the equipment it sold was usually in less than perfect condition. Therefore prices were cheaper than normal. It did not deal in droids, vehicles, or starships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
