Profiteer was the vessel's name in Basic. The ship was equipped with heavy durasteel armor plating, quad turbolaser cannons, and military-strength communications array, revealed to unwary enemies once in firing range. The Saak'ak also carried a cloaking device. The Saak'ak's 42 turbolaser cannons were on rotatable mounts to hide until needed. The cargo arms were divided into three zones. The war forces were carried in the inner hangars, along with their munitions. Embarked forces included 50 C-9979 landing craft, 6250 Armored Assault Tanks, 550 Multi-Troop Transports, and 1500 Platoon Attack Craft. Electrified racks were installed on the outermost hangar zones to support the fleet of 1500 droid starfighters. Tractor beams guided smaller vessels into the hangar. Smaller hangars were also available inside the inner walls of the cargo arms for shuttles. Sealed hangars below the main hangar zones held dangerous materials. The primary docking claw on the outer crescent had reinforced bracing. A massive acceleration compensator secured the centersphere to the stern of the ship, and the deck structures in the centersphere provided living space for the crew, and the sphere also had its own reactor assemblies. The bridge was in a tower on the centersphere. The engine units on a Lucrehulk-class vessel such as the Saak'ak consisted of three primary Rendili StarDrive proton 2 and four secondary proton 12 engines, and the ship was 3170 meters in diameter. The centersphere was also a detachable core ship. The ship's pilot sat at the navigation station and controls the ship through data goggles and hand-operated instrument panels. Pilot battle droids were stationed at a recessed floor at navigation computers. A viewscreen was situated at one side of the bridge. The bridge could be sealed off by two blast doors. The Saak'ak was also equipped with 50 conference rooms in the centersphere. The Neimoidians adjusted the rooms to their benefit when dealing with clients\u2014the chairs were remote-operated \"concentration deficit\" units, and the rooms contained gas emitters. The Trade Federation had replaced much of the crew with droid labor, such as PK-series worker droids and Loader Droids. The Saak'ak also contained holoprojectors for real-time communications."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Lucrehulk-class battleship, Saak'ak, known as Profiteer in Basic, was captained by Daultay Dofine and the Communications officers Tey How and Sil Unch. In 33 BBY it was aboard the Saak'ak that Darth Sidious contacted Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray and Captain Dofine to suggest that they blockade of the planet Naboo in response to Senate Resolution BR-0371 and the assassination of the Trade Federation Directorate on Eriadu. Six months later, from onboard Saak'ak, Viceroy Gunray and Settlement Officer Rune Haako launched the invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY. At the time, DFS Starfighter Squadron was embarked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, landed in Saak'ak's hangar as negotiators, shortly after the dispute arose, sent by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum to help resolve the blockade Once on board, they were greeted by TC-14, a TC-series protocol droid. Unfortunately, when the Trade Federation learned the Republic had sent Jedi as negotiators, they ordered the immediate termination of their guests under orders from Darth Sidious using Dioxis gas. Fortunately, although their ship Radiant VII was destroyed by Jull Dremon's gunnery team, the two Jedi escaped, as the OOM security battle droids led by OWO-1 proved no match for the power of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they escaped, they went down the corridor and Kenobi ducked into a service closet to work the controls to open the door at the end of the hallway. Proceeding through the next hallway, Kenobi unlocked the doors in his way. The two then try to break onto the bridge of the battleship, but were disrupted by two destroyer droids. They ran off and went into the vessel's extensive ventilation shafts. Kenobi fell through into an air vent and ran through. He saw the Radiant VII explode. Kenobi continued in the ship's underbelly and defended himself from several Trade Federation maintenance droids and used a control panel to open one door, which he went through to use another button to open a door nearby. He continued further into the air vent, and fell through the grating and into a corridor. Kenobi went into a generator room and took out several battle droids. There he met a Neimoidian controller who told him he needed to destroy a power generator to open the door to the hangar, which the young Jedi did before continuing to the hangar. In the corridor, he faced three droid starfighters. After that, he met back up with Jinn, who ordered him to stowaway on separate landing craft. Kenobi went along the upper catwalks, defending himself from the droids stationed there, and hit switches to maneuver himself over one of the landing craft and enter it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After escaping from the conference room, the Jedi fought through the next corridors. They then went through a command center. They traveled along a conveyor and Force Jumped over the gaps, ending up in a hangar, where they destroyed a Loader Droid. After taking several lightsaber strikes, the Loader Droid malfunctioned and crashed into the wall. The two Jedi traveled through the hole and went deeper into the ship near the static discharge chamber. The two Jedi then traveled through a corridor filled with electronodes. They then jumped across a series of large pistons and went into the next corridor. They then came out on the upper catwalks in the hangar. They were engaged by a droid starfighter. After deflecting its blasts back at it, the Jedi destroyed the starfighter's thrust dampers, forcing it to chance to its walker mode. The starfighter continued to strafe them, eventually falling prey to its own deflected blasts, allowing the Jedi to continue their mission inside the Saak'ak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Jedi fought their way through the flagship to reach the ship's bridge to discover why the Viceroy wanted them dead. Leaving the conference room, they moved through the hallways and to the hangar, where they came under fire from the hangar turret.

Three droid starfighters harassed the Jedi from the side of the hangar. The two Jedi then moved into a cargo bay and went through a battle droid factory. In the factory they faced two more droid starfighters and bomb droids. In the next hallway, they were trapped by force fields. Jinn ordered Kenobi to jump up into the ventilation shafts. The two fought through the shafts, traveling along by riding the updrafts at two points, and came out in a walkway, where they found the invasion fleet in the hangar. They ended up in in an observation deck before going to the bridge. Kenobi covered Jinn while the latter cut through the blast doors.

Jinn decided to stow aboard separate landing craft. To cover for the buildup for the invasion from customs officials in the Galactic Republic when the ship was inspected beforehand, the Neimoidians convinced the agents that the suspicious hardware was next-generation and expensive binary loadlifters, although the Jedi knew better when they witnessed the preparations. The cavernous hangars of the ship were also cleared of all cargo specifically to prepare for the invasion.

Aboard the battleship, the player may interact with TC-14 and other characters; although they have a choice of dialogue and may in fact kill these characters, their interaction has no affect on the outcome of the mission.

They escape using the game's telekinetic \"Force powers\" and travel through the battleship's hallways, fighting through battle droids. Rooms off of the first hallway are not part of the required path but offer hidden features. At the end of the hallway, the protocol droid TC-14 can be switched to and controlled to access other parts of the level. To enter the next room, the players must use their \"Force powers\" to open the door. In the next room, more battle droids attack. In the room's lower level, the Jedi face two destroyer droids The last area is blocked by a shield. The Jedi must jump over the shield; the switches are on the other side, which both players must step on to open the shield and let TC-14 through. The droid can access the switch to open the MTT stationed there, which the Jedi enter to finish the level. The game's characters during the first playthrough are Jinn and Kenobi.
