Every Jedi was required to meditate at this gate before entering the academy grounds, usually while focusing their attention on the fountain. There were no exceptions to this rule as Leia Organa Solo found out during the Dark Nest Crisis, when she was hurrying to get a jar of Fizz to Cilghal but was stopped from from entering the grounds by her Master Saba Sebatyne and told to meditate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
