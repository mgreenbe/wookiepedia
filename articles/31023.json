Her vessel's passengers included General Organa and Captain Poe Dameron; it was one of the transports that made it to the surface of the planet Crait. During planetfall they were comforted by General Organa, who reflected that the pilots would soon feel survivors guilt. On Crait, the Resistance made a last stand against the First Order in an old Rebel Alliance outpost, with those who survived escaping in the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon. She wore a white helmet with a yellow flight suit made of flame-resistant material with a white harness and brown boots. An Aurebesh inscription on her pilot helmet read \"Hello nasty\".
