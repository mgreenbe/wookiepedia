The protocol droid was owned by a noble who was treating his droids cruelly, so 5-3P7 united his owner's other droids, as well as the droids of other nobles, and they all stopped working. The nobles responded by deactivating and destroying droids, but the remaining droids refused to yield. Eventually, the noble gave in and agreed to treat his droids better."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the incident, the Idle continued to re-surge from time to time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
