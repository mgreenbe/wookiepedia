While on Opop Hibbedit, Q5-7070 fell out of his squad's Multi-Troop Transport due to unsecured straps, landing in the jungle below. The battle droid attempted to make his way back to his squad, but was attacked by the creatures of the world. He eventually rejoined the squad, but was unable to report the problem to the squad's lieutenant, and thus fell back out again as they moved positions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
