Repulsorlifts provided the ER-1 with mobility, and the model was also outfitted with high-end sensor, recording, and communications devices. The ER-1 carried twelve deployable biosensors, along with a set of repulsor-powered sensors and recording devices, slaved to the main unit. The peripherals were designed to transmit all data collected back to the droid for analysis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master of Sciences Graf Zapalo used three ER-1s designated ER-1A, ER-1B and ER-1D, to help map the planet's mysterious ocean tunnels. A fourth ER-1, carried by a Mantaris Medium Transport, was dispatched to Ohma-D'un, where it aided in the colonization efforts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much like the N-1 starfighter, the ER-1 droid was carefully crafted, and therefore was not suitable for mass production.
