In a climactic duel with his former flame, Fable Astin, Jaalib inadvertently forces his love from the top of a tall precipice. Fable's body is badly shattered on the rocks below, and she is dangerously near death. However, Jaalib cannot bear to have his one true love die at his own hand. Harnessing the power of the dark side, Jaalib saved Fable from death and healed her, but at great cost to himself, causing him to be captured by New Republic forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
