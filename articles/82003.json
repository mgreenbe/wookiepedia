However, due to creative differences the story was never published. Nevertheless, the events of the story survived through a brief mention in the novel Dark Apprentice by Kevin J. Anderson. Other sources would go on to mention these events, including The Essential Chronology, The New Essential Guide to Characters, and The New Essential Chronology. The Dark Empire II audio drama depicts a lightsaber duel between Skywalker and Solusar at the Space City, in which Skywalker ends up the victor and turns Solusar to the light side. It remains unclear whether this duel was Lightsider or something entirely different."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
