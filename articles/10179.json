The raiders hoped to steal the advanced new technology used in the TIE fighters, which were being piloted by Imperial cadets including Onyx Two Lyttan Dree and Onyx Nine Han Solo. During the attack, Solo saved Dree after Onyx Two became separated from the rest of the squadron, but crashed into a Cantwell-class Arrestor Cruiser in the process. For disobeying direct orders from Flight Officer Ubbel during the battle, Solo was reassigned to the Imperial Army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
