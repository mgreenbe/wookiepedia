The barrels were designed with soldiers in mind, to give increased range and accuracy to rifles, but were also popular with assassins and bounty hunters. Marksman barrels were two meters long and contained upgraded static pulse adapters and a denser Galven circuitry pattern. Although made of lightweight material, the barrels made weapons awkward to carry and impossible to conceal due to their lengths. Models of barrel available included Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc.'s KX756 marksman barrel, SoroSuub Corporation's WQ80 barrel and Arakyd Industries 3300 Hawkeye sharpshooter's barrel, all of which sold for 1200."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marksman barrels were first mentioned in the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
