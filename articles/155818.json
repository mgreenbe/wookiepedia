The Totem Master would give the totem pole as a gift to unsuspecting villages. When night fell over the village, the Totem Master would release the creatures from their stationary position, and they would proceed to rob the village. After they had completed their task, the Totem Master would order the three individuals back into their totem configuration."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3 ABY, the totem containing this individual was given to the Ewok Wicket Wystri Warrick by the Totem Master, who hoped to rob Bright Tree Village. Despite warnings by his friend, Princess Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, Wicket brought the totem back to his village, and when the Ewoks had gone to bed, the Totem Master released his slaves, who proceeded to ransack the village. The blue biped made his way into a hut containing the young Ewok, Teebo, who awoke when the creature tried to steal one of his bags. Teebo tried to alert the village to the robbery, but the Totem Master stopped the Ewok by turning him into a Totem Slave. Following the group's retreat from the village, the Totem Master added another Ewok, Latara to the group, and put the two Ewoks on top of the totem pole. The Totem Master then stopped in the Strutter Village, hoping to pull the same caper. However, during the attempted theft, the group was disrupted by Wicket and Kneesaa who had come to rescue their friends. The Totem Master ordered his servants to attack the two Ewoks, but Wicket was able to turn the Totem Master's powers against him, turning him into a totem himself and freeing the blue biped. Along with his two companions, the trio celebrated their freedom and ran off into the forest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
