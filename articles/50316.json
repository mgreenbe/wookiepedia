In an era of Sith domination, a number of bronzium statues honoring the Four Sages were made. In the waning years of the Republic, the politician Palpatine, who was secretly a Sith Lord, owned several such statues."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Practices and beliefs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Four Sages of Dwartii were philosophers and lawmakers whose ideas influenced the Galactic Republic, a pan-galactic democracy. Although the Four Sages were noted for possessing much arcane wisdom and legal acumen, their views and decrees were regarded as coldly unsparing, and often generated controversy, especially to species new to the Republic. One of them, Sistros, was accused of pandering to the multitude for selfish ends. Another, Braata, was known to have encouraged the study of the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Four Sages were called Sistros, Braata, Yanjon, and Faya. They hailed from the Dwartii system, located in the galaxy's Inner Rim. They were active in the earliest days of the Galactic Republic, which was founded more than twenty five thousand years before the Galactic Civil War. Their world was part of Nouane, one of the Republic's Allied Regions. At the time, Nouanese ministers commonly ascended to the highest spheres of power in the Republic. For that reason, the Four Sages' merciless political philosophy was influential in the galactic state, if shrouded in controversy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during a time period when the galaxy was dominated by the Sith, an order of malevolent Force-wielders, a number of bronzium statues of the Four Sages were created. Much later in history, some of those statues entered in the possession of Palpatine, a Human politician from Naboo who was secretly a modern-day Dark Lord of the Sith. When Palpatine served as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, his effigies of the Four Sages resided in his office suite in the Republic Executive Building on Coruscant. In the ceremonial office area, two statues stood on either sides of the Chancellor's official desk. One depicted a hooded Sistros with a long-sleeved cloak, and the other depicted a helmeted Braata with the head resting on the tip of a long staff. Two other statues, one of which was a different depiction of Sistros, flanked the doorway to Palpatine's private antechamber. That second Sistros statue had a lining of neuranium under its bronzium exterior, and housed a cylindrical cavity undetectable by security scans. It allowed Palpatine to hide his hand-built lightsaber in it. The weapon lay dormant in the statue for a long time until finally used against four Jedi Masters on Empire Day. During the Galactic Civil War, a number of statues of the Four Sages were available throughout the galaxy. In addition to effigies similar to the ones owned by Palpatine's, there also existed a statue of Faya that depicted the philosopher resting on a large sword."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bronzium statues of the Four Sages of Dwartii first appeared in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, but were first identified as such in Star Wars: Complete Locations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
