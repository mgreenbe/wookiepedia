As Han was loading, Chewbacca started following a short walking plant, who led them onto Mux's ship. The two discovered Mux was stealing and hatched a plan to deal with the Arcona. Chewbacca would gather the walking plants onto his transport while Solo distracted the miner. Solo told Mux they had to take back the new delivery because they were diseased. At that point, Chewbacca stole the ship. Mux ordered Solo to bring his ship back . Solo shot Mux's K4 security droid and fled the planet in the Millennium Falcon. The two ships docked in orbit. Solo and Chewbacca took sixty kilograms of gems to give to Jabba, allowing the walking plants to take the ship to Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Torkil Mux proved to be a greedy criminal willing to steal from Jabba the Hutt.
