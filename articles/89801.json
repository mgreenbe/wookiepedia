They were an indiscreet way of triggering small, targeted explosions, and were equipped with a timer to add to their effectiveness. One such microdetonator was used by the former bounty hunter Brand, by then a soldier of the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry, to destroy a chemical barrel inside the Galactic Empire's Distillery on the Mid Rim jungle planet Coyerti in 3 ABY. This caused a significant distraction, redirecting the attention of Imperial personnel inside to a potential saboteur and the chemical leak. After the detonation, Brand's squad was able to destroy the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Microdetonators appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
