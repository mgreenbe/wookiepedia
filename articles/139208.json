During 10 ABY Takara had stolen a Global Communications Transponder from Ka'Pa which allowed him to listen in on the Hutt's communications. In the process of negotiating a deal on behalf of the New Republic, Mara Jade agreed to attempt to re-obtain the item for Ka'Pa in exchange for supplies for the New Republic forces. After attempting to track Takara's Lieutenant, Abron Mar, through the streets of a spaceport on the planet Katraasii, Jade was subdued and delivered to Takara's stronghold on another planet. Mara managed to escape using her Jedi powers, fought through Takara's guards and his rancor, stole the GCT, and returned the device to Ka'Pa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Takara was first mentioned in the 1997 video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith.
