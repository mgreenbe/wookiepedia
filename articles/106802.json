These lightsabers were unique as they could fold at the middle, so that they could be clipped to Krell's Jedi utility belt. Seeing a double bladed lightsaber was rather rare in this time period, which made Krell one of the few Jedi within the Order to wield double-bladed lightsabers, and more notably, two twin versions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lightsaber's massive size and the low pitched 'buzzing' sound it made when it was swung suggests it would qualify for the category of lightclub, which was a much larger version of the standard lightsaber. Another notable wielder of a single bladed lightclub was the dark Jedi Gorc."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lightsabers could be activated whilst in the folded position as shown when General Krell countered Fives's insubordination with the blade. During the Battle of Umbara, the 501st Legion under his command discovered that General Krell was secretly sabotaging the Republic effort in an attempt to appease the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus after foreseeing the Great Jedi Purge and Order 66. The 501st and 212th Attack Battalion joined forces and immediately set out to capture the former Jedi, and when they caught up with him, they managed to disarm him of one of his lightsabers for a short time before he regained it. He wielded his dual double-bladed lightsabers with deadly precision, spinning them like buzz saws for devastating effect and was capable of easily defending himself against the clone troopers of the elite legion. Although he was undermined by his own overconfidence and the ingenuity of Trooper Tup, Krell easily massacred scores of clones with a combination of deadly lightsaber techniques. Krell used his lightsabers against a vixus, but was stunned, arrested, and eventually shot to death by Dogma."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
