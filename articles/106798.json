It was located not too far from the edge of Republic space, and so was postulated to be a good place to drop off Resistance-friendly passengers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ponemah was entirely covered in desert, making for a harsh environment. The planet's south polar region, known as the Sea of Sand, was the harshest region on the planet, containing electromagnetic storms and giant sand worms. The planet's sand worms could grow to more than ninety meters in length, and were extremely dangerous. They were most common in the Sea of Sand, which, due to its extremely inhospitable environment, was generally avoided by visitors to the planet. Ponemah Terminal was one of the end points of the Burke's Trailing smuggler's hyperspace route, which connected the world to the planet Jakku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Obrexta III, a cruiser in service to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, crashed on the planet during the Clone Wars, while carrying a clone trooper named Kix, who had been frozen in stasis.
