Searching the Taris system in the Oroko, Ying found Carrick and Hierogryph aboard the junk hauler Last Resort, hidden in the Taris asteroid belt. The Oroko brought The Last Resort aboard with its tractor beam. In the ship's hangar, Hierogryph negotiated a deal for his freedom, along with that of Last Resort owners Jarael and Gorman \"Camper\" Vandrayk, in exchange for the entry codes to the Snivvian's Taris storehouses. Meanwhile, Ying would take Carrick alone in the Oroko's shuttle to the Taris surface and turn him over to the authorities.

Discovering that the Jedi Masters had actually killed the Padawans and framed Carrick, Ying attempted to leave the room quickly but instead was killed by Jedi Master Lucien Draay.
