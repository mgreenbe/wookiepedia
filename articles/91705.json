Three of his blockade runners and two pilots from Phoenix Squadron distracted the convoy's TIE escorts and the three freighters while the Spectres attacked the main ship to knock the cargo into space. Hera Syndulla then piloted the Ghost to capture the cargo. Two Arquitens-class command cruisers then arrived to fire on the rebels. Commander Sato ordered a retreat after the blockade runner's shields were disabled. Syndulla captured the cargo and the rebels fled into hyperspace. When they rendezvoused later, they discovered that although the cargo held vital supplies, it did not have shield generators as their intelligence suggested."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Rescue of Kanan Jarrus, the Spectres learned that they were part of a larger network of rebel cells. One of the group's leaders Captain Hera Syndulla had withheld this information from her fellow rebels in order to prevent the Galactic Empire from learning about the rebellion. However, the enigmatic rebel leader \"Fulcrum\" ordered a change in policy in the light of Kanan's rescue. After learning that \"Fulcrum\" was the former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the Spectres agreed to help the Phoenix Cell, which had rescued them from Imperial forces in the Mustafar system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The heist"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After receiving intelligence about an Imperial convoy carrying deflector shield generators, the Spectres helped the Phoenix Squadron to attack the convoy. Besides the Spectres' starship Ghost, other rebel forces involved in this raid included Phoenix Squadron and three CR90 corvettes. While heading towards an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser, the Ghost and its A-wing escorts Phoenix One and Phoenix Two were pursued by several TIE fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phoenix One and Two provided covering fire by shooting several TIE fighters that were docking with another Gozanti cruiser. After jokingly telling Phoenix One to save some for them, Ezra managed to shoot down another TIE fighter. While flying the Ghost, Hera and Kanan chatted and discussed their differences about joining the rebellion. While Kanan preferred working alone, Hera insisted on sticking with their new friends. At that point, the Ghost narrowly avoided a charging Imperial TIE fighter by flipping on its belly; causing Garazeb Orrelios to fall into the storage compartment. During the battle, Chopper helped man the helm beside Hera."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Working in coordination with the Ghost, Sabine used the auxiliary starfighter Phantom to fire on the targeted Imperial freighter; dislodging several pieces of cargo. Before Hera could pick up the cargo, Imperial reinforcements arrived in the form of two Arquitens-class command cruisers. Sabine then covered Phoenix One by shooting an approaching TIE fighter while Ezra exchanged fire with the Imperial starships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that point, Commander Sato's cruiser was hit and its deflector shields were disabled. Sato then ordered a retreat but Hera also insisted on taking the cargo along. While Zeb used the Ghost's tractor beam projector to pick up the cargo, Kanan destroyed three TIE more TIE fighters.
