In an effort to make their exports more profitable, they engineered a faster hyperspace route that made a stop off on Belsavis. Because the planet's atmosphere was unstable, IE was forced to create a consistently hospitable area on Belsavis for its ships to make berth. A huge dome was constructed over the Plawal Rift to provide a stable atmosphere. In order to fund this massive project, IE joined forces with Galactic Exotics in return for the exclusive rights to the planet's local fauna."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
