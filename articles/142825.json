Chrin, a security officer, interrupts\u2014much to the dismay of Captain Typho\u2014and says that battle droids are unlikely, as sensors would have detected them first. Boss Nass argues that their sensors may not be adequate. Typho volunteers to take a patrol squad down to the valley and report back; and the Queen agrees."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the valley, Chrin still thinks there is nothing there, because sensors didn't detect anything, but Typho argues that the distance from the palace and the unreliability of the sensors in the valleys may have masked anything that was there. Suddenly, a security officer spots three B1-Series battle droids on STAPs and a tactical droid on a Flitknot speeder bike. Chrin shoots the speeder bike with a missile launcher, destroying it. One of the droids dismounts from its STAP and fires its blaster pistol. Captain Typho instantly reacts and shoots the droid through its head, disabling it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Typho contacts Queen Neeyutnee and Sio Bibble, Naboo's governor, via a hologram.
