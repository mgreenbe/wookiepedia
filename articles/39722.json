She had Haazen lead Barrison into the Ansharii Caverns on the pretense that a Sith base was hidden there. She then detonated a bomb that resulted in the death of Barrison Draay and Haazen's ultimate fall to the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Haazen awoke after the blast, he screamed in agony as he saw how disfigured he was.
