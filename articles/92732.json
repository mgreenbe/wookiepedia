They formed an extrasensory organ capable of sensing the movement of physical objects around them within a scope of up to 25 meters (82 feet). The montrals of a Togruta grew taller with age: in adolescence, they looked like mere bumps on the head, but they jutted high above the head by adulthood. Male Togruta possessed larger and more angular montrals than females. On the planet of Kiros, the buildings of the Togruta colony led by Governor Gupat Roshti were shaped like montrals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "On Kessurians"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Kessurians, montrals were located above their elongated ears and served to increase their senses.
