A vaapad attacked by striking its prey with its tentacles so quickly that they were nothing but a blur to the naked eye. There was no way to tell how many tentacles it had unless it was dead. The number of tentacles varied; most had at least seven, while the largest specimen ever examined had twenty-three."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mace Windu developed a lightsaber style based upon the vaapad. The style used quick and deadly strikes to overcome the enemy, much like how the vaapad would use its tentacles on prey.
