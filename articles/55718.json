They were also called protoplasmic slugs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were large, carnivorous gastropods that hung from tree branches, waiting to fall upon prey below. Wrapping its body around the prey, a slug would smother its prey and exude digestive juices, dissolving its prey to absorb nutrients. It was not only surely lethal to be attacked and slowly eaten by this creature, but it was extremely slow and painful. Most of the creature's deadliness came from the fact that it was nearly impossible to remove from its prey once it had attached itself. They could grow to many times the length of a Wookiee. The slugs, usually brown in color, were excellently camouflaged against the wroshyr trees on which they lived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jacen Solo once enlisted a giant slug to defend his group of young jedi from Zekk and his Shadow Academy stormtroopers.
