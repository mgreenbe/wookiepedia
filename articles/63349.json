The First Order, hoping to find Skywalker and eliminate him so he could not bring about the return of the Jedi and defeat their plans, also searched for Tekka to find the map he had that led to Ahch-To, the planet on which Skywalker was believed to have made his exile. Using information recovered from Hevurion Grace, a ship that belonged to a First Order collaborator and New Republic senator named Erudo Ro-Kiintor, General Leia Organa\u2014leader of the Resistance and twin sister of the missing Jedi Master\u2014sent Commander Poe Dameron to find Tekka. The mission first brought Dameron and his team, Black Squadron, to a planet where he discovered the Cr\u00e8che, a religious people with whom Tekka had once dwelled. The First Order also tracked Dameron to the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dameron and the Resistance eventually found Tekka living on the desert world of Jakku, where he lived in the spiritual village of Tuanul with other members of the once-forbidden Church of the Force. Tekka gave Dameron the maps in the hopes of ending the despair in the galaxy, as he believed the Jedi were essential to maintaining balance in the Force. The First Order also tracked Tekka to Jakku, where the dark warrior Kylo Ren killed Tekka and brought Dameron into custody in the hopes of finding the map. Dameron, however, had given the map to his astromech droid, BB-8, who returned it to the Resistance base on D'Qar with the help of a Rey, a scavenger; Finn, a stormtrooper who defected from the First Order; Han Solo, the famed Rebel Alliance General; and Solo's friend and co-pilot Chewbacca. After being given the final piece of the map from the droid R2-D2, Rey followed the map to Ahch-To where she found the fabled Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the years following the Battle of Endor and the defeat of the Galactic Empire at the Battle of Jakku, Luke Skywalker set out to restore the Jedi Order. Skywalker, the last Jedi Knight, had help from Lor San Tekka, a member of the Church of the Force who helped Skywalker find Jedi sites and lore that the Empire tried to suppress after the fall of the Jedi Order. Skywalker began training a new generation of Jedi, but his attempt to restore the Order was thwarted when one of his apprentices, his nephew Ben, turned to the dark side of the Force and destroyed the Jedi. After Ben's betrayal, and his adoption of the name Kylo Ren, Skywalker felt responsible and went into exile. Those closest to him believed that he went in search of the first Jedi Temple. Unbeknownst to most, Tekka had a fragment of the map that could lead to Ahch-To, the world in which the ancient temple was located."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, the First Order emerged from the Unknown Regions as a successor to the old Galactic Empire. After the New Republic failed to take the threat of the First Order seriously, Leia Organa\u2014a member of the Galactic Senate, twin sister of Luke Skywalker, and mother of Kylo Ren\u2014formed the Resistance to combat the emerging threat. She hoped to bring her brother out of hiding so he could help in the fight against the dark side once more, but she did not know his location. After Commander Poe Dameron, a Resistance pilot, led a mission that resulted in the theft of the Hevurion Grace, a ship that belonged to a First Order collaborator and Republic senator named Erudo Ro-Kiintor, the Resistance learned that the First Order was attempting to locate Skywalker;Snoke, the Supreme Leader of the First Order, feared that if Skywalker was to re-emerge it would bring about the return of the Jedi and threaten his plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hoping to find Tekka before the First Order, General Organa assigned Dameron the mission to discover his whereabouts. She hoped that, because the First Order was unaware that Tekka was alive, it would give the Resistance the advantage they needed to find Tekka and Skywalker in time. Organa gave Dameron broad authority to execute the mission however he deemed fit, and he put together a team of other pilots that included Captain Kar\u00e9 Kun, L'ulo L'ampar, Jessika Pava, and Captain Temmin \"Snap\" Wexley. Dameron also flew with his personal astromech droid, BB-8.

The squadron surveyed the area after they arrived, with Dameron piloting his personal X-wing, Black One, deep into the canyons. He flew through an underground cave system and set down inside, where he encountered a group of people called the Cr\u00e8che. The Cr\u00e8che greeted him with suspicion, believing him to be a potential threat to the spiritual egg that they were protecting; the Cr\u00e8che believed that the egg, which they would guard until it hatched, was essential to the fate of the galaxy. Dameron soon learned from a Cr\u00e8che elder that Tekka had once lived with the Cr\u00e8che, so the pilot hoped the Cr\u00e8che would tell him what they knew about the one they called \"the explorer.\" Although the Cr\u00e8che had once told Tekka their secrets, that was after he had lived with them for a long time and he earned their trust. Dameron was still an outsider."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having briefly lost contact with Dameron, Black Squadron was finally able to reestablish communications with Black Leader and he informed them that he was safe inside the dangerous cavern system. BB-8, who had detected a signal earlier, realized that there was a homing beacon on Black One. The Cr\u00e8che mistook the beacon that Dameron held as a detonator and nearly started a firefight in the cavern, but the fighting came to an end when Dameron explained what the device truly was and the Cr\u00e8che worried that a fight would harm the egg. Because of the tracker, Dameron was concerned that the First Order would find them on the planet, but Black Squadron discovered that the First Order had already arrived and was amassing troops. Dameron plead with the Cr\u00e8che to trust him\u2014whatever their reservations were about him, he said that the First Order would not hesitate to destroy what they had worked for."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly later, First Order forces led by Agent Terex arrived above the Cave of the Cr\u00e8che. Poe instructed his fellow pilots to give him \"leverage\" while he hid in the Cave. Terex and his stormtroopers forced their way into the Cave. The First Order agent demanded to know Poe's location but the Cr\u00e8che elder feigned ignorance. When a stormtrooper picked up Poe's tracker, Terex threatened to torch their giant egg. Unwilling to see innocents suffer, Poe surrendered himself and told Terex that they had a stalemate; referring to his squadron's activities. Black Squadron attacked Terex's TIE fighters and First Order landing platform. Unperturbed, Terex ordered his flametroopers to torch the Cr\u00e8che egg and revealed that he had brought reinforcements including the Maxima-A class heavy cruiser Ravenous and more TIE fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Poe and Terex haggled, the Cr\u00e8che egg hatched, releasing a giant blue winged creature, which proceeded to attack the Cr\u00e8che and Terex's stormtroopers. Meanwhile, Temmin Wexley convinced his fellow pilots to fly into the canyons and caves in an attempt to lose their First Order pursuers. When that did not worked, Black Squadron regrouped for a head-on attack. Back in the Cave, Poe with BB-8's help managed to steal Terex's blaster. Poe tried to force Terex to call off the attack. The blue winged creature was then attacked by a black winged creature, which killed the former."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Poe managed to disarm Terex a second time and forced him to call off his attack. While the Cr\u00e8che cultists restrained Terex and his men, Poe and his fellow pilots refueled their starfighters. Unwilling to provoke a war between the New Republic and the First Order, Poe released Terex. The Cr\u00e8che cultists then departed on the back of the black winged creature, which they regarded as their savior. Before leaving, the Cr\u00e8che elder revealed more information about Lor San Tekka to Poe. After leaving, Poe and his fellow pilots radioed for Terex's cruiser to pick up the defeated First Order agent and his surviving men."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rescuing Grakkus"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to the Resistance base, Poe and Black Squadron traveled to Megalox prison on the planet Megalox Beta. Megalox Beta was a high gravity world and the prison was surrounded by a gravity field created by an orbiting space station. From the Cr\u00e8che elder, Poe had learnt that Lor San Tekka had met someone named Grakkus the Hutt, who collected various objects related to the Jedi. With General Organa's help, Black Squadron managed to bribe the prison's Warden Luta into granting them access to the prison. However, the First Order had learnt about Poe's mission and dispatched Agent Terex to obtain the information from Grakkus. Terex bribed Luta into abandoning Black Squadron in the dangerous prison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Terex's machinations, Black Squadron managed to fight their way into Grakkus' fortress. Seeking to escape the prison, Grakkus offered to reveal the information to whoever helped him escape the prison first. To gain leverage over Terex, Poe instructed BB-8 and the other astromech droids to sabotage the prison's gravity field generator. Despite encountering the prison guards, BB-8 and his team managed to access the control chamber. Meanwhile, Terex convinced the gangsters Kan Be, Papa Toren, and Isin to storm Grakkus' compound in return for helping them escape. Terex wanted to kill Poe, his fellow pilots, and Grakkus after he had extracted the necessary information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, a security droid attacked the astromech team and destroyed Pava's astromech droid. Despite this opposition, BB-8 managed to disable the security droid, allowing the droids to proceed with their mission. With the gravity field disabled, Terex and his criminal allies were overwhelmed by the high gravity. Donning gravity belts, Poe and his team rescued Grakkus. They then convinced Warden Luta to let them leave the prison with Grakkus in return for restoring the gravity shield."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to the space station, Black Squadron reunited with their droids with the exception of Jess' astromech. Black Squadron then escorted Grakkus' shuttle into space. Before they could jump into hyperspace, a vengeful Terex attacked the Megalox space station, disabling the gravity shield for good. When Terex attacked the escape pods and shuttles, Temmin convinced the squadron to turn around and engage Terex's ship Carrion Spike. After returning to the Resistance base, Grakkus provided information on the worlds that Lor San Tekka had visited. Before Poe could proceed with the mission, General Organa tasked Poe with investigating whether the First Order had a spy within their ranks."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Retrieving the map"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dameron and the Resistance eventually learned that Tekka was living in the village of Tuanul on the desert world of Jakku, where he had retired and dwelled with a number of other adherents to the once-forbidden Church of the Force. Dameron and BB-8 traveled there and found Tekka, who gave Dameron the partial map to Ahch-To. Tekka said that giving the Resistance the map would begin to help make things right for a despairing galaxy, and that he believed there could be no balance in the Force without the Jedi. As the two spoke, the First Order arrived to claim the map for themselves. Dameron fled with the map just as First Order stormtroopers began attacking the village. He attempted to retreat in his X-wing, but the craft was damaged so he gave the map to BB-8 and sent the droid away from the village."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As BB-8 fled with the map, Kylo Ren arrived on the scene of the battle. Tekka was brought before him, and Ren demanded that the old man hand over the map. Tekka, who knew the dark warrior when he was still known as Ben, refused to give him the map. For his reticence, Ren struck the retired explorer down with his lightsaber. Dameron used his blaster rifle to fire on Ren, but the dark warrior used the Force to freeze the blaster bolt mid-air. Dameron was brought before him and Ren realized that Tekka gave the map to the pilot, so Ren had Dameron taken aboard his shuttle to be returned to his Star Destroyer, the Finalizer. Before leaving, Ren ordered the stormtroopers to kill the remaining villagers. The stormtroopers, with the exception of FN-2187, complied with the order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "BB-8 ventured across Jakku before finding and meeting Rey, a scavenger with whom he took refuge. Dameron, meanwhile, was interrogated aboard the Finalizer before escaping with the help of FN-2187, who defected from the First Order.

Finn believed that Dameron died during the crash\u2014the pilot actually survived and was able to return to the Resistance\u2014and eventually met Rey and BB-8. Together, they escaped from the First Order forces on Jakku aboard the Millennium Falcon, which was soon rediscovered by the famed smugglers and Rebel Alliance war heroes Han Solo and Chewbacca after they lost the ship years earlier. This began a journey that culminated in the map being returned to the Resistance base, where the astromech droid R2-D2 soon discovered that he had the rest of the map in his possession. Rey, who had come into the possession of the lightsaber that once belonged to Luke Skywalker and his father, Anakin Skywalker, followed the map to Ahch-To.
