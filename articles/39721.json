When Rey was a girl, R\u00e6h became an important figure in Rey's life, with the young scavenger dreaming up stories about what R\u00e6h was like and where she might have come from. Rey created a fighter pilot doll using a flight suit she recovered from a cargo container, and she often wore R\u00e6h's flight helmet. Together, Rey and \"R\u00e6h\" went on adventures by exploring Rey's home, the downed All Terrain Armored Transport called Hellhound Two, as well as the sands outside of the AT-AT. Rey eventually grew out of playing with the doll, but she kept the memory of R\u00e6h alive by keeping the doll and her helmet in her possession throughout her years on Jakku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although R\u00e6h herself did not make an appearance in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, her flight helmet did."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
