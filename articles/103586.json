Born on the planet Contruum around the year 20 BBY, he was taught both morality and starfighter combat by his father, Airen, whom he followed into the Rebel Alliance during his teenage years. Cracken enrolled at the Galactic Empire's Vensenor Flight Academy under a false identity to hone his skills, and after graduating, he led an entire wing of TIE fighter pilots in defecting to the Alliance. The members of the newly-dubbed Cracken's Flight Group were assigned A-wing fighters and given patrol duty at an Alliance base on the planet Xyquine II, which was eventually abandoned when the Empire attacked. During the evacuation, Cracken ordered all personnel to subtract the number two from their assigned hyperspace coordinates and then led his flight group in destroying the Victory-class Star Destroyer Exsanguinator. The former maneuver shook the pursuit of eavesdropping Imperials and became famously known as the \"Cracken Twist;\" both maneuvers turned Cracken into a legend."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Alliance became the New Republic, the pilots of Cracken's Flight Group began to view their leader as an invincible hero, and Cracken requested a transfer to the legendary Rogue Squadron in 7 ABY so that he might reassess his skills. One of his first missions with the Rogues was a covert insertion onto the Empire's capital world of Coruscant in order to gather intelligence prior to a New Republic siege of the planet. Cracken flew a Z-95 Headhunter when the Rogues disabled Coruscant's planetary shields, and the New Republic successfully captured the world. Rogue Squadron spent the subsequent weeks obtaining bacta in order to combat the deadly Krytos virus left on-world by the departing Imperials; after a cure was developed, all the Rogues save for Cracken resigned their commissions and initiated a guerrilla war against former Imperial Head of State Ysanne Isard. Cracken remained with the New Republic due to his father's role as Director of Intelligence, but he lent Rogue Leader Wedge Antilles aid and led an A-wing squadron into the battle that toppled Isard.

The cruiser was destroyed during a strike at the Yuuzhan Vong\u2013held Bilbringi Shipyards, and Cracken and the surviving crew were taken prisoner on the planet Selvaris. While incarcerated, Cracken and the legendary commando Judder Page received vital information from the intelligence-gathering Ryn Network and arranged for four prisoners to escape and deliver it to Galactic Alliance High Command. Their efforts allowed a Galactic Alliance strike force to rescue them, but two subsequent battles brought Cracken to Caluula Station, where he was again captured and taken to enemy-occupied Coruscant. There, a group of heretical Yuuzhan Vong Shamed Ones rescued him from being sacrificed to the Yuuzhan Vong gods. The Galactic Alliance soon thereafter struck at the capital, and Cracken was rescued and recruited into Page's Katarn Commandos as they stormed the citadel of the Yuuzhan Vong's Supreme Overlord Shimrra.

The Crackens were a family of rebels who actively resisted the Galactic Empire, and during Pash and Dena Cracken's childhood, their father led a group known as Cracken's Crew that fought a guerrilla campaign against Imperial occupation of their homeworld. Airen instilled his son with morals, impressing upon him that the Empire was tyrannical and evil, and the young Cracken became eager to join the resistance. Some of his childhood was spent in Z-95 Headhunter holosimulators, and Cracken's father quickly realized that he was a talented pilot. Airen encouraged his son's interest in flying by providing him access to additional simulators and teaching him the basics of starfighter combat. Cracken defeated several skilled pilots in simulator battles, and Airen eventually allowed him to fly real starfighters. The younger Cracken took his first solo flight before he reached the age of thirteen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Cracken's teenage years, his father's rebellion successfully liberated Contruum from Imperial rule.

The elder Cracken suggested that he enroll in the Imperial Vensenor Flight Academy, a branch of the Imperial Academy located aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Vensenor. It had proved a fertile recruiting ground for Imperial defectors to the Alliance, and Pash Cracken enrolled under a false identity, as his father had already become a famous Rebel general. The younger Cracken found that he was a better pilot than most of his instructors, and though he excelled in all of his studies, his top marks came in classes that involved starfighter tactics. His approach to piloting was unorthodox, innovative, and often reckless, and in repeated combat simulations, it was unbeatable. His instructors were astounded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time at the Imperial Academy, Cracken became a capable commander who inspired devotion in his teammates. Their squadrons flew TIE fighters in battle simulations and constantly completed missions without losing a single pilot. When his comrades fell behind in their academic studies, Cracken forced them to leave the simulators and open their books. He attracted considerable attention from his fellows, and Cracken assembled a group of pilots whom he could trust. His plan was for the group to defect to the Alliance following their graduation. When that time came, Cracken had surpassed all of his instructors in piloting ability, and he graduated in the top one percent of his class. He was immediately commissioned into the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Becoming a legend"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cracken became the Wing Commander of a seventy-two-ship\u2013strong fighter wing of TIE fighters.

The incident took on a nearly mythical quality within both the Alliance and the Empire, but the former organization kept the details of the defection officially classified for years. To the Empire, it was a scandal that rocked the highest echelons of the Imperial Navy, and the Imperial Sith Lord Darth Vader took a personal interest in it by placing a new commander in charge of the TIE Wing's former Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The former TIE Wing became known as Cracken's Flight Group, and they switched to A-wing fighters, becoming some of the first squadrons in the Alliance Starfighter Corps to pilot the new ships. The flight group was assigned to an Alliance base on the planet Xyquine II, from where they performed many successful hit-and-run operations against Imperial shipping. Cracken retained his rank of Wing Commander. When the base was discovered by an Imperial probe droid at some point between 0 BBY and 3 ABY, the Empire attacked at a time when an unusually high number of important Rebel operatives were on-station. As an Imperial fleet approached, Gingal, the base's Watch Commander, ordered a standard evacuation.

He reasoned that their exit vectors would be accurate enough to fool the eavesdropping Imperials, yet inaccurate enough to send pursuers in the wrong direction by several light-years. Cracken then requested permission to lead his flight group against the Imperial fleet, and when Gingal consented, Cracken's Flight Group attacked the Victory-class Star Destroyer Exsanguinator. They destroyed the Star Destroyer without suffering a single casualty, and every single Rebel transport safely jumped to lightspeed.

Around the same time, Cracken also participated in several space battles between Rebel and Imperial forces that were fought in the Corellian, Dantooine, Karthakk, Naboo, and Tatoo systems. In each battle, a Rebel EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate squared off against an Imperial Lancer-class frigate, and Cracken was one of many pilots who made up the Rebel starfighter complement."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Going Rogue"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A change of pace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Alliance delivered a crippling defeat to the Empire at the Battle of Endor, and the victors soon thereafter reorganized into the New Republic.

The flight group was added to Wing Commander Varth's fighter wing, and Cracken was promoted to the rank of captain. The pilots serving under him were eager to always follow his lead, believing that he was an unbeatable hero who would lead them to victory in every battle. Attrition gradually wheedled away at the flight group's numbers, and although Cracken knew that he was leading his pilots to their deaths, the survivors blamed those who died for making fatal mistakes. Cracken felt that his flight group was getting increasingly careless, and he grew worried that a single mistake on his part would see them all die."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Cracken learned that the New Republic Starfighter Corps' legendary Rogue Squadron was seeking pilots to fill recently opened vacancies, he applied to join their ranks. The Rogues flew X-wing fighters rather than A-wings, but they were led by New Republic hero Wedge Antilles and considered to be some of the New Republic's best pilots. Cracken's perceived mythical status had caused him to lose perspective on his own abilities, and he hoped that serving under Antilles in such a fabled squadron would help him get a more realistic measure of how well he actually was able to fly. Cracken additionally hoped that his flight group could reassess how they operated in his absence. He was accepted into the Rogues, and he traveled to the planet Borleias to meet with Antilles, leaving his flight group under the leadership of Varth.

On Cracken's suggestion, they approached Vengeance Derra IV's position over Mrisst via that planet's south pole in order to avoid any astronomical observation posts. After catching a first glimpse of their target, the Rogues spotted an additional vessel: Contruum's Pride, a transport that Cracken, due to naming conventions on his homeworld, realized was posing as a capital ship. Nunb broadcast orders for the Imperials to surrender, but when twelve TIE fighters and interceptors were launched instead, One Flight engaged them while Cracken led Two Flight in an attack on Vengeance Derra IV. The four X-wings of Two Flight avoided the lasers of the freighter's gunners before launching four proton torpedoes in tandem, which brought down the freighter's forward and aft shields and left it derelict in space.

Cracken helped Antilles convince skeptical Rogue Corran Horn\u2014a former member of the Corellian Security Force\u2014that allowing particularly dangerous criminals to run loose would cause effective damage to the Empire. Twelve hours later, the Rogues launched from Borleias and arrived at Kessel. There, they performed a flyby of the planet's Garrison Moon and neutralized the remaining defenses of a former Imperial base shortly before doing the same to a landing zone on Kessel itself. While Antilles, Horn, and Ven negotiated the release of prisoners with facility administrator Moruth Doole, Cracken and the rest of the Rogues flew cover for Tycho Celchu, the squadron's executive officer.

Although all members of Rogue Squadron were in fact part of the mission, they were separated into small groups for security reasons, and none of them save for Antilles were aware of any other group's presence on the planet. Cracken was paired with Antilles and given the job of assessing Coruscanti citizens' loyalty to the Empire; the two were fitted with disguises by New Republic Intelligence for their insertion onto the capital aboard the Dairkan Starliner Jewel of Churba.

The three spent the next week touring Imperial museums and other public facilities in an effort to discern how Imperial propaganda was received by the general populace, and Cracken kept an eye out for what kinds of souvenirs were purchased by museum guests. After a week had passed, they made it to the Galactic Museum, where Cracken purchased a miniature statue of the late Emperor Palpatine and two holopad display disks of his life story. They were the gift shop's two most popular items, and Cracken decided that they would make humorous gifts for his father. The group began to suspect that Coruscant's citizens had accepted Palpatine's death and would similarly accept a new government taking control of their world. As they left the museum satisfied, Antilles was suddenly embraced by his old friend Mirax Terrik, a smuggler who had lately been working closely with the Rogues."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wessiri and Terrik quickly assumed the roles of window shoppers, and Cracken and Antilles followed silently in their wake as they slowly descended through Coruscant's cityscape, stopping at various women's clothing stores to appear casual and to watch for pursuers.

Cracken and Antilles realized that the Imperials were wise to their presence, and Wessiri summoned fellow Intelligence agent Winter to debrief Terrik. After Winter revealed that all of Rogue Squadron was on-world, Antilles noticed laser flashes outside the room and tipped the group's couch over seconds before a speeder bike crashed through the window. The vehicle's driver was a Black Sun thug, and the group soon after relocated to a new safehouse inside a cantina known as the Headquarters. There, they learned that Corran Horn\u2014on a bike of his own\u2014had sent the other driver through the window while fleeing from Zekka Thyne, one of the criminals who had been freed from Kessel. Soon thereafter, a communication from the New Republic's Admiral Ackbar informed them of a change of plans: due to an attack on Noquivzor by Warlord Zsinj, the Rogues were now to bring down Coruscant's planetary shields themselves in advance of a New Republic invasion.

Also with them were several Black Sun members, who had agreed to work with them despite bad blood between Thyne and Horn. The three groups brainstormed potential attack plans against Coruscant's central computer, and they ultimately decided to use the Alien Combine's access to a memory core manufacturing plant in Coruscant's Alien Protection Zone to slice into the computer and gain clearance codes for the planetary shield maintenance programs. Cracken was part of the team assembled to slip rigged cores into the computer system, and he traveled to a warehouse at the plant along with Antilles, Alien Combine member Portha, and Gavin Darklighter, Rogue Five. Posing as plant workers, they delivered the rigged cores to an Imperial technician while several other Rogues waited in the warehouse's shadows.

A repulsorlift vehicle piloted by M-3PO, the squadron's quartermaster, retrieved Cracken and the others and took them to another safehouse. Celchu's presence on Coruscant was a surprise to all save Antilles, as the executive officer had been a dejarik piece that the Rogues' Commander had not wanted to play until absolutely necessary. The Rogues gathered in Celchu's safehouse to revise their plan, where they were joined by Wessiri, Terrik, Portha, Portha's ally Asyr Sei'lar, and Inyri Forge, a former girlfriend of Thyne who had killed him following his betrayal of the Rogues."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darklighter and Sei'lar proposed using an Orbital Solar Energy Transfer Satellite to vaporize a water reservoir, which would produce concentrated humidity and create a thunderstorm, thereby leading to a total power grid collapse.

Cracken was assigned to fly cover for the assault in one of Celchu's six Headhunters, with Rhysati Ynr, Rogue Seven, as his wingmate. When Sei'lar volunteered for Headhunter duty, a shuffle paired her with Cracken and Ynr with Erisi Dlarit, Rogue Eight. Horn served as leader of the ersatz Hunter Squadron, and, after the pilots investigated their fighters, Cracken observed Celchu tell Horn that he had made a special inspection of his Headhunter.

Four days after the battle, the two Crackens sought out Antilles at Horn's crash site and informed him of Celchu's charges. Although Antilles was enraged, Cracken assured him that Celchu had expressed a complete willingness to let Horn fully investigate him after the battle. Positive news came in the return of Aril Nunb, who had escaped from Imperial custody after being used as a test subject for the Krytos virus.

Zsinj had recently seized a bacta convoy traveling from the planet Thyferra to Coruscant, and the New Republic desperately needed the medicinal substance to battle the effects of the Krytos virus. The Rogues were therefore tasked with hitting the Yag-prime space station in the Yag'Dhul system, where Zsinj had taken the bacta.

As Linna believed that the A-wing's speed rendered it superior to Horn's preferred X-wing, Cracken helped ground her confidence by moderating a round of good-natured boasting between her and Horn. Not long afterward, Antilles devised a plan to lure Isard's Star Destroyers to Yag-prime while his forces attacked Thyferra. When the Lusankya and the Virulence arrived in the Yag'Dhul system, Booster Terrik\u2014Mirax Terrik's father\u2014trapped the former in a gravity well projector and a series of tractor beams, but the Virulence moved in front of it and allowed the Lusankya to return to Thyferra.

Cracken contacted Antilles, who granted him permission to attack, and Ace Squadron pounded the Lusankya with concussion missiles while using their speed to avoid the warship's defensive batteries. Compounded damage prompted the ship's crew to mutiny against the stubborn Captain Drysso and surrender. Meanwhile, Dlarit's fighter was destroyed by Horn, and a shuttle believed to be carrying Isard was taken out by Celchu. After the battle, Airen Cracken arrived at the Lusankya with an Intelligence team to search the ship's massive prison, where they discovered that every inmate had been relocated prior to the battle.

Cracken served as a major in the Galactic Alliance Defense Fleet, but combat attrition saw him promoted to an acting rank of general. Stationed at the Alliance's temporary headquarters on the planet Mon Calamari, Cracken attended several military briefings, one of which revealed the existence of the intelligence-gathering Ryn Network.
