As an adult, she was large enough to be capable of destroying the Colossus platform by herself. She attacked the platform trying to retrieve her child after he had accidentally been brought on board inside of a wrecked Z-95 Headhunter and adopted as a pet by Neeku Vozo. Her attack had been foreseen in dreams by Eila, who told Vozo that the only way to stop the attack would be to return Bibo. Vozo was initially reluctant, as he and Tamara Ryvora mistakenly assumed that the mother intended to eat Bibo. Eventually, Vozo realized that Bibo and his mother were the same species and returned him, after which the mother departed peacefully."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
