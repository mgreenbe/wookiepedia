Under the supervision of his training officer, Captain Beri Tulon, Tantor led a force that took back several mines captured by the Rebels and seized a Rebel base before passing through a choke point of Rebel turrets. From there, Tantor recaptured the computer facility.

Fortunately, Dellis discovered a cache of remote relay beacons in the facility. Brenn smashed through the remaining Rebel positions, clearing the way for Dellis to lay a network of beacons to an uplink tower three kilometers away. From there, the information was quickly beamed to Inquisitor, where it was determined that the Rebels had seized several energy collectors on Sarapin. Brashin and the Tantors continued there minus Tulon, who was reassigned by Brashin after he promoted Tantor over Tulon's head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
