The tactic consisted of two flights of starfighters closing with the enemy; one would make a direct run at a formation of TIE/LN starfighters while the other would hang back, staying out of sensor range while still closing with the enemy. The initial pair of snubfighters would close on a vector head-on to the enemy craft, but just before reaching effective combat range they would execute a hard bank. Ideally this would draw the incoming enemy pilots into a pursuit maneuver going after the first flight, whereupon the second flight of Alliance ships would then pounce on the confused Imperials and destroy them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
