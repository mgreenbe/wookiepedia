Too large for any typical starfighter to carry in large numbers, the Silent Thunder was designed to lock onto a target and use its onboard fuel supply to travel long distances and destroy the enemy starship. Only two L04 missiles were typically required to destroy a single enemy craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
