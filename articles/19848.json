It was home to the sentient Gargantelle species, noted for their large stature. When the planet was discovered at some point before the end of the Ductavis Era, the Hutts attempted to enslave the species. After the Gargantelles repelled seven invasions and four diplomatic missions, the Hutts convinced the Electric Caliphs of Boz Pity's neighbor world Mourn to exterminate the species. The Gargantelles were slowly driven to extinction over the next decade, but erected a substantial amount of enormous gravestones to their fallen.

When the planet was discovered by the Hutts of Nal Hutta between 15,000 and 9000 BBY, they identified the Gargantelles as viable slaves, largely due to the species' massive stature. A series of missions were launched to attempt to enslave them\u2014seven invasions by Niktos, followed by four diplomatic attempts by t'landa Til\u2014but they all ended the same way: the Hutt servants were eaten by the natives. This infuriated the Hutt overlords, and prompted them to concoct a new plan. Instead of enslaving the Gargantelles, they would exterminate them. A legal team of Nimbanels was sent to Boz Pity's neighbor world Mourn to recruit the services of the Electric Caliphs\u2014ten-millennia-old droids that once belonged to Sultan Nastuonodon. By appealing to their sense of obsolescence, the Nimbanels successfully convinced the caliphs to rid Boz Pity of sentient life. Over the next decade, the Gargantelles were slowly driven extinct. The species erected enormous monuments to their fallen, which would later contribute to Boz Pity's reputation as a \"graveyard planet.\" When the last Gargantelle died, the caliphs returned to Mourn and set the planet's crust on fire, killing themselves."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Boz Pity was occupied by the Confederacy of Independent Systems to serve as a staging point for raids on the Galactic Republic's borders.

The plan backfired, however, and the ensuing Battle of Boz Pity proved bloody. The Intervention crash-landed on Boz Pity, where the Jedi found themselves in a land battle against forces under the command of the Confederacy leader Dooku, as well as General Grievous. Republic naval officer Denn Wessex commanded the Venator-class Redoubt in the battle over the planet.

A list put together by Alderaanian Viceroy and Alliance member Bail Organa named Boz Pity as a viable location for a new base. After sending a survey team to the planet, the Alliance established a base among the ruins of the Gargantelle buildings. The base would prove short-lived: not long after it was established, the Alliance's elite Renegade Squadron was tracked to the planet through an Imperial tracking beacon. The Empire immediately launched an attack on the base, deploying a large amount of stormtroopers, several All Terrain Scout Transports, and one All Terrain Armored Transport. However, in the ensuing battle, Renegade Squadron was able to keep the Imperial forces at bay long enough for the Rebel Alliance to evacuate the planet. Between 4 and 8 ABY, Boz Pity was under the hegemony of Imperial warlord Treuten Teradoc's Greater Maldrood faction. Between 25 and 26 ABY, the Boz Pity system was attacked by the Yuuzhan Vong, an extra-galactic species. The system remained under their control until between 27 and 29 ABY, when New Republic forces arrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gargantelles were the only sentient species native to Boz Pity. They were a particularly large species; individuals could reach a height of twenty meters, and they were equipped with six arms. These traits made them desirable slaves to the Hutts. They were fierce warriors, able to resist almost a dozen attempts at enslavement through sheer force. One of their traditions was to erect very large gravestones for their fallen.
