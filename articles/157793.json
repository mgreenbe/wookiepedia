At sometime during his posting there he was wounded and taken to the Triage unit to be healed. He was treated by Jedi healers Barriss Offee and T'ra Saa who was an old friend of his. As he was being treated both he and T'ra sensed something approaching. Seconds later the unit was attacked by the bounty hunter Nazzer and his team of bounty hunters, riding speeder bikes, who were trying to claim the reward for killing jedi posted by the Crimson Nova chapter of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. The Bith Jedi was killed during the following battle along with several others when one of the first shots fired by the bounty hunters caught him in the chest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
