Armed with two giant ion pulse cannons capable of wiping out entire fleets, the heavy cruiser\u2014under the command of the Confederate General Grievous\u2014was on its way to destroy the medical station from which the Sanctuary III and its sister ships were evacuating the wounded clones. This clone along with his ship completed his part of the mission and was gone from the facility before the arrival of the Malevolence, which was ultimately destroyed by Republic forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
