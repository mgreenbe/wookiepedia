One of its divisions operated Ukio's planetary shields. The service was active when Ukio was attacked by forces under Grand Admiral Thrawn during his campaign against the New Republic. After the attack, an official, believed to be from the shield operation division of the service, claimed that the X'Cal, a creature from Ukian mythology, had taken part in the attack. The service was later mentioned in a TriNebulon News report about the attack and the official's claims."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
