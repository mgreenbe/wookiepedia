First proposed and extrapolated by Ambak, the limit sought to define the distance from an established celestial body within which natural satellites could not form out of matter from a major impact. Within the limit, any nascent satellite would be crushed by the planet's gravitational pull, but beyond the limit, natural satellites could form the gathering material and eventually enter a stable orbit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In real-world astronomy, this distance is known as the Roche limit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
