He became a part of the Tierfon Yellow Aces, a squadron based out of the rebel launch base on the Mid Rim planet Tierfon. The squadron flew sortie after sortie from the base until their successes led to increased Imperial activity in the sector and encroaching Imperial patrols forced the Alliance to scuttle the base. The Aces squadron was broken apart and reassigned to other outposts. Grek was moved to the Alliance's headquarters in the Great Temple on the moon Yavin 4 along side fellow Yellow Aces Zal Dinnes, Jek Tono Porkins, and Robich Duggsin; the largest contingent of pilots from the squadron to be assigned to the same location."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grek and Duggsin became part of Blue Squadron under the command of General Antoc Merrick, while Dinnes and Porkins joined Red Squadron. In 0 BBY, Blue Squadron was among the forces scrambled by Admiral Raddus to aid a group of rebels attempting to steal the plans to the Death Star superweapon on the planet Scarif. With Grek flying a T-65B X-wing starfighter under the callsign Blue Six, the Alliance Fleet dropped out of hyperspace in the Scarif system and engaged the Imperial forces stationed there. Raddus gave the order for Blue Squadron to support the ground forces during the battle, meaning the squadron would need to pass through the Imperial Shield Gate that acted as the only entry point through Scarif's planetary shield."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Race for the gate"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Merrick gave the order for the squadron to form up on him, and the pilots began racing through the gate before it could be shut. Grek and Barion Raner, flying as Blue Four, lagged behind some of the other pilots as part of a second wave, but were determined to make it through; however, as Grek shouted at his engines to speed up, Raner realized they were not going to make it. Pulling up, he called a warning to Grek over comms, but Blue Six kept going and, alongside another pilot, he crashed into the gate, which had finished closing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first fleet casualty of the battle, Grek was killed as his vehicle exploded into a bright ball of fire, leaving Merrick to wonder if the pilot had kept his X-wing at full speed the entire time or whether another second of acceleration might have made a difference.

The adult novelization of Rogue One incorrectly states that Grek is the only pilot to crash into the Shield Gate, when a second vehicle crashing is clearly visible in the film."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
