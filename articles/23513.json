Each card contained a small, electronic chip which would randomly change the value of the card while it was held in the hands. The way to nullify the change was to lay the cards flat on their backs within the shallow interference field of the gaming table. A cheater could be used to transform card values at will."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
