During this time, the Caamas Document crisis nearly crippled the New Republic, and Gavrisom vainly attempted to unify the shattered coalition. He pointed out that Organa Solo was only on leave from the position of Chief of State and that she could be reinstated by a majority vote of the Senate. But she declined his offer to stand aside, on the assumption that changing the voice of the New Republic in the middle of the crisis would be a bad move."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In orbit at Bothawui, Han and Lando discovered the three cloaked Star Destroyers waiting to pounce on the ships after the battle. Leia took control of the Ishori war cruiser she and the President were on to go to aid Han. A move made retroactively legal when the President, his faith in her unshaken, used an obscure law in order to take command of the ship. When the Imperial fleet revealed itself, Leia advised Gavrisom to find a leader both sides of the Caamas argument could rally behind. Gavrisom reinstated General Lando Calrissian, who led the combined fleet in forcing the Star Destroyers to retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few weeks later, Gavrisom signed the peace accords with Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, ending the Galactic Civil War.
