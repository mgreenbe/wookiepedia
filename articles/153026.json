A hermaphrodite like the rest of the Hutt species, Hetuu's client held a gladiatorial tournament annually on the planet Nal Hutta, and the Hutt intended for the queen to be the highlight of the tournament. However, when Hetuu arrived to deliver the creature, the Hutt and Hetuu were both killed when the hunter opened his cargo bay: around four hundred k'lor'slugs which the queen had spawned poured out and ate them both. The incident inspired the term \"a Hutt's cry,\" a reference to the sound made by a swarm of k'lor'slugs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hutt was first mentioned in the Codex entry for k'lor'slugs in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011, but the entry did not specify the Hutt's name or which gender the Hutt's personality was."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
