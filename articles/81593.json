Its rolling whitecaps were home to yammal-jells and coufee eels; favored prey of the native hawk-bat. The lake also contained y'luubi, which Mara Jade Skywalker enjoyed at a dinner meeting held by Aryn Thul at Yuza Bre in 36 ABY. On one of its shores, yorik coral bluffs marked the edge of the park."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
