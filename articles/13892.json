The battle was part of General Jan Dodonna's campaign to prove that starfighters were the most versatile military asset possessed by the Alliance, and that their tactical use would bring victories and undermine the Imperial control of space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle began when BTL Y-wing starfighters, under the command of the Rodian Grisserno, attacked the Victory-class Star Destroyers of the Imperial Fourth Attack Squadron. The squadron was arrayed in two wings, and the Alliance ships methodically concentrated their fire on each one in turn, defeating each one at a time. Since the Victory-class Star Destroyers were equipped with the slow LF9 ion engines, the two wings were unable to move fast enough to support each other."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
