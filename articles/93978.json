The abode was constructed from a hollowed out tree stump. It had several windows and a door at its entrance. The lair was located in a swampy region near the Dulok Swamp on the Forest Moon of Endor. Murgoob rarely ventured from his home, and when visitors came to seek his counsel, his advice was punctuated by pillars of gray smoke shooting from his lair's windows and roof."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
