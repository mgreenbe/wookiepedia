She first requested the spacer to check all the government drop boxes in Coronet City. She then asked the spacer to recover a stormtrooper armor stolen from an Imperial officer in the Capitol. She was very satisfied when the spacer brought back the armor even before the officer could notice the robbery. Eventually, Handerin tasked the spacer to find a missing government courier. However, the courier was assassinated by the criminal Preens B'oola in order to steal the government documents that the courier was carrying. B'oola asked for a huge ransom of 1,000,000 credits but the spacer killed him and recovered the documents. For all those services, Gallura Handerin then recommended the spacer to Brantlee Spondoon, the aide to the Diktat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gallura Handerin was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mack Jasper was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005.
