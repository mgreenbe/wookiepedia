Around five years before the Battle of Yavin[source?] he was partnered with TK-626 and charged with patrolling an Imperial airfield on the planet Lothal. During a patrol, MB-223 encountered the Mandalorian Sabine Wren who was planting a paint bomb on a TIE/ln space superiority starfighter in the airfield. He and his partner tried to shoot her, but she managed to evade them and set off the explosives, destroying the TIE fighter and splattering MB-223 and his comrades with purple paint. Several months later, MB-223 and TK-626 were on night patrol duty again when they encountered Sabine. During that incident, Sabine and her rebel comrades stole a transport and destroyed an entire row of parked TIE fighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The artist"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male stormtrooper designated MB-223 served in the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire on the planet Lothal. Around five years prior to the Battle of Yavin,[source?] MB-223 and another trooper designated TK-626 were assigned to patrol an Imperial airfield on Lothal filled with newly produced TIE fighters.

Weapons drawn, they discovered Sabine Wren, a girl in Mandalorian armor, spraying the starbird emblem onto wing of one of the TIEs. MB-223 questioned the girl, and when she didn't stand down the pair began shooting at her; however, Wren was able to dodge the shots and began weaving through the TIEs in the field to escape the troopers. During the chase TK-626 contacted their commander and asked for reinforcements, after which the pair lost Wren, who began taunting them. Reinforcements then arrived and all of the troopers fanned out to find the Mandalorian, before Wren attacked one, drawing them all to her location, which was next to the fighter she had painted her graffiti on. TK-626 then realized that a graffiti-bomb had been placed in the middle of the starbird, which then exploded destroying the TIE fighter.

Sabine escaped on the transport but before leaving triggered a bomb which destroyed an entire row of TIE fighters.
