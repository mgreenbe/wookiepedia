She was known for her temper, and as a result was grounded by General Carlist Rieekan on Hoth, with Wedge Antilles saying it was because everyone feared she would fly her T-47 airspeeder into a mountain. Following the Battle of Hoth, Tarheel was chosen by Wes Janson to be recruited into the rebuilt Red Squadron, led by Antilles. She was assigned the callsign Red Twelve and flew as Will Scotian's wingmate in an attack on a nearby pirate base, that threatened the safety of the Alliance's rendezvous point."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
