While the main force mounted a direct assault on the front led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, Beta Squadron took an alternate route to the base perimeter where they waited on the opposite side of a force field gate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Alpha Company blasted there way into the site, they engaged the remaining Separatist forces while Kenobi destroyed a power generator, lowering the gate and allowing Beta Squadron inside. With the fighting over and the site secured, Dooku took the opportunity to present himself in the open in the hopes Skywalker would pursue - which he did. As Kenobi called after his padawan, a Protodeka revealed itself and quickly destroyed the republic forces in the area, including all of Beta Squadron. After a tense skirmish, Kenobi managed to destroy the massive tank in which he was then briefed by troopers that the Separatist had already found whatever they were searching for."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
