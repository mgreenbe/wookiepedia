The deformed Sith howled like beasts and hunted with spears, and they revered Glovoc as a sleeping deity. They established an altar in the Steamfields, a geologically active region of Nyriaan, and they remained in relative seclusion and were were hostile to native Nyriaanans, whom they occasionally encountered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rogue Galactic Republic intelligence agent Yrssk developed an understanding with the Children of the Tempest, after he plied them with trinkets and sacrificial victims.
