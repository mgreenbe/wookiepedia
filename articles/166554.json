In the book, Yde was introduced as an astronomical object that was the site of the location Desultori. The latter was given as the home of the alien inventor and scholar Aanxi Raanxi Laanxi, who chaired four subcommittees for the University of Desultori."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucasfilm employee Leland Chee, who maintains the Holocron continuity database, has indicated that information contained in Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas is non-canonical with respect to the Star Wars Legends continuity. However, Jason Fry, co-author of the 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas, has stated that the star systems listed in the book's Appendix section are named after the most prominent planets or celestial bodies located in those systems. This article therefore considers the existence of Yde to be canonical with respect to the Legends continuity. The Essential Atlas placed the Yde system in grid square M-7."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
