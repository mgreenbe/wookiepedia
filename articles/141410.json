The discreet entrance was half-concealed somewhere along the establishment's eight walls. The room's only ceiling was a disorganized web of ventilation ducts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The place featured a filthy bar whose Hapan barkeepers handed out datapads with drink recipes featuring beverages like the Red Cloud and the flat-tasting Gizer Ale which was both served in mugs to guests."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cantina's clients were exclusively Human and Near-Human who sat clustered in groups of three or four together around corroded, rust-stained durasteel-tables. The male patrons were handsome but scroungy looking with three-day beards whereas the Hapan women dressed to look tough and available. The pirate station used to be a prominent hotspot for outlawed ships to pick up on supplies because the place was not on the radar of Hapan Security."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although it was allowed to bring in weapons, droids had to stay outside.
