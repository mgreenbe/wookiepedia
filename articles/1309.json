Scout troopers in the 39th Recon were equipped with 74-Z speeder bikes that were used for reconnaissance purposes, as well as rapid transportation in combat zones. The unit was also outfitted with some AT-ST recon vehicles for hit-and-run tactics. When compared to the 27th Elite Recon, the speeder bike detachments were not as accurate in combat but their AT-ST units were stronger offensively."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
