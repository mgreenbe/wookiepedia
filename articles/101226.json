Fives pleads his case that the chips are part of a Separatist conspiracy that cause aggression in the clones, rather than inhibit it as Nala Se claims.

As a squad of shock troopers from the Coruscant Guard arrive and begin to check IDs, Fives approaches Kix in the refresher and gives him coordinates to arrange a meeting with Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex.

Fives becomes angry that Skywalker and Rex don't believe him, and insists the Chancellor is in on the plot, having told him in the medical bay that he had orchestrated it. Commander Fox and his troops enter the warehouse and order Fives to stand down, but he reaches for Rex's pistols forcing Fox to shoot him.
