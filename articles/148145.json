Named for the word tracyn, meaning \"fire\" in the Mandalorian language of Mando'a, the volcanic Tracyn Island was occupied by a clan of Mandalorians during the Galactic War. Led by Shae Vizla, the Mandalorians moved to the island after they split with the Nova Blades pirates, and they built an island-wide enclave to keep a number of creatures to test themselves against. Shortly before the Battle of Rishi, a group of independent operatives traveled to Tracyn Island and bested the clan's challenges in order to speak with Vizla."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tracyn Island appears as the main location in \"Blood Hunt,\" a Flashpoint added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in the 2014 Digital Expansion Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
