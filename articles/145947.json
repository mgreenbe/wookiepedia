It sported mosaics created from broken dricklefruit jars, and it contained a large audience chamber for the king. This was three meters high and cluttered with sparkly objects and artwork. One mural (made entirely from Imperial Tax Stamps) on the ceiling illustrated a needle ship surrounded by garbage and approaching a green planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a group of Rebel Alliance operatives helped the Squibs steal a gravity-well projector from the Ugors in the Paradise system, Ebareebaveebeedee added murals of the system's descent into chaos and the Rebel heroes.
