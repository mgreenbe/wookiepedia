Prior to 5000 BBY, they expanded to and colonized hundreds of planets near their own. One such colony was Ilos Minor, which was used as a transfer point for foodstuffs and minerals from planets along the Ilosian Spur hyperlane, along which Ilos itself was located. The population of the planet Alee, another planet on the Ilosian Spur and homeworld of the Vippit species, also included a significant minority of Ilosians. By 5,000 BBY, the Ilosians' colonies and homeworld had been engulfed by Hutt Space, a region controlled by the Hutt species. The Ilosians were eventually enslaved by the Hutts, but they retained more individual freedom that most of the Hutts' client species due to their economic and technical prowess."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War, a conflict from 25 to 29 ABY in which the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong species invaded the galaxy, the Ilosians suffered great losses at the hands of the invaders when the Vong advanced down the Ilosian spur to the planet Chalacta between 25 and 26 ABY. Ilos and Ilos Minor were still considered part of Hutt space by 137 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ilosians were first mentioned in The Essential Atlas, a 2009 book written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
