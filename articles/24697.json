During the Clone Wars, a series of conflicts fought between the Galactic Republic and the breakaway Confederacy of Independent Systems, it was bombed on the orders of Count Dooku, the Separatist Head of State, to sabotage peace talks between the two factions, resulting in large fires and a planetwide blackout on Coruscant. After receiving confirmation that the Separatist were responsible for the attack, the Republic Senate rejected their peace offer. While Coruscant's power grid was eventually restored, mandatory blackouts were put in place to help conserve energy and some districts were rarely ever provided with electricity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coruscant's central power distribution grid first appeared in \"Heroes on Both Sides,\" the tenth episode of the canon animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' third season, which first aired on November 19, 2010."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
