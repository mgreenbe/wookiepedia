He was cold, calculating, and arrogant, and was feared by opponents of the Exchange. Skillful with a blaster, his own henchmen included Matu and Nahata, two of the best and most ruthless Exchange thugs on Telos. Benok, while on Telos, threatened Meetra Surik in the cantina only to be killed by her later as she stormed the Exchange offices. Wearing reinforced fiber armor for protection, Benok also had a custom blaster with an additional ion cell, which Surik may have taken from Benok's body as a trophy after he was killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
