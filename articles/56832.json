The Great Stair was large and it linked the Grand Terminal's various docking bays. At some point between 1000 BBY and 0 BBY, a bagman for the shipping magnate Brevis Taug traveled to the Grand Terminal while transporting some funds that Taug was sending to the Zygerrian Thanda clan. A group of spacers who were tracking the movement of Taug's funds staked out the Great Stair and they followed the bagman to Docking Bay 112."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
