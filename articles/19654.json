Built without the knowledge of the New Republic, it served to keep tabs on the mission of the CR90 corvette FarStar, and on the provisional government installed on the sector capital Kal'Shebbol following the successful ousting of the warlord, Moff Kentor Sarne. The outpost also served as a base for a small patrol formation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
