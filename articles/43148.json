Little was known about them other than their history of conflict with the Gungans and the monuments they left behind. Archaeologists were unsure whether the Elders' giant statues were representations of themselves or massive icons devoted to their deities. By the time of the Invasion of Naboo, the Elders were long gone. Several Gungan and Naboo chroniclers surmised that the Elders failed to live in harmony with the planet's delicate balance and were consumed by their own greed. One of their monuments, located north of Lianorm Swamp, became a sacred gathering place for the Gungans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
