In 137 ABY, the two of them accompanied the Emperor as he retook the planet Bastion from the Sith Lord Darth Krayt's Imperial forces, the fortress world having been wrested from Fel's control following the conclusion of the Sith\u2013Imperial War seven years prior. Krieg and Draco soon after disobeyed a direct order from Fel and traveled to Vendaxa, where the Emperor's daughter, the Princess Marasiah Fel, was being pursued by agents of the One Sith. After joining forces with two Jedi and the pirate crew of the starship Mynock, the Imperial Knights were able to fight off the Sith and bring the princess back to Bastion.

The team journeyed to the Deep Core world of Had Abbadon and set a trap for Darth Krayt, hoping to assassinate him and destabilize his Sith Order. Krayt took the bait laid by Skywalker and nearly died in the ensuing battle, and Fel afterward sent Krieg to the planet Kiffex to retrieve Rae, who had been mortally wounded while fighting Krayt and then been taken to Kiffex by Skywalker to be healed.

Undercover and posing as a bounty hunter, Rae confronted Skywalker as he visited his uncle \"Bantha\" Rawk on Iego. Because of her status as a former Jedi Padawan and a childhood friend of Skywalker's, Rae was able to learn of the existence of the Jedi Order's Hidden Temple. As she prepared to follow the Mynock to the temple in her ship, she relayed its coordinates to Krieg, Draco, and Marasiah, who waited nearby in a ship of their own.

After the Mynock was locked in a tractor beam, and Vao and Skywalker sensed the presence of a Force-user on the ship, the crew set out to explore the derelict vessel. Skywalker ordered Krieg and Draco to investigate the corridors connected to the hangar bay, where they found several bones, some of which had been gnawed on. After Skywalker, Rae, Vao, and Jariah Syn were attacked by beasts known as Rakghouls, Krieg and Draco were joined by Deliah Blue and located Syn and Vao in front of a locked door, along with several apparently tame Rakghouls.

The tender moment was interrupted by Draco, who brought new orders from their Emperor: obtain the Muur Talisman. Seeing the Sith device as evil and disgusted by the order, Rae stormed off, prompting Draco to remark that he would have to kill her if she compromised the mission.
