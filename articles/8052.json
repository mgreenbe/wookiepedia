It was the highest class establishment in Drepplin, and it was frequented by the most corrupt individuals in the government, something that allowed anything done within its walls to remain a secret as part of an \"old, corrupt politicians\" network. Meals at Aramand's were very expensive at 50 credits per person, but were considered definitely worth it. The chefs were all trained as gourmets, familiar with the most exquisite dishes. Aramand's was attached to a hotel, the Orchid, and the whole complex was owned and operated by Glova's governor, Tegist Byrg."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
