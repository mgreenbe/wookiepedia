Dramath the Second was the son of Dramath the elder, who ruled the world of Medriaas prior to the Great Hyperspace War.

After killing their father, Tenebrae sought to destroy Dramath the Second as well, but the Sith Lord fled Medriaas with a group of followers, and made a new life on the snow-swept world of Rekkiad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dramath the Second eventually died on Rekkiad, and his disciples entombed him in a hidden crypt found in the first of the two plateaus that comprised the Twin Spears.
