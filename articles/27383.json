In a subplot, the Rebel Alliance fakes Luke's death so they can move their rebel base from the volcanic planet of Mustafar to the icy planet of Hoth.

Meanwhile, the Rebel Alliance has established a temporary base on the volcanic world of Mustafar. Luke Skywalker's X-wing starfighter is patrolling the skies above Mustafar when it is shot down by Vader's TIE Advanced fighter. R2-D2 survives the crash and is picked up by Jek-14 in his starfighter. Luke, Leia Organa, and Admiral Ackbar then reveal that it was a hoax to convince the Empire that Luke is dead.

Back on Mustafar, Admiral Ackbar tells the rebel pilots that \"Operation Fool Vader Into Thinking He Has Destroyed Luke\" was a success. Leia believes that this ruse will buy them enough time to evacuate the entire base to icy Hoth. While the rebels are euphoric, Luke is despondent because he believed that he should have been out there to fight Vader. He is greeted by an emphatic \"No\" from the other rebels. Leia advises Luke to lay low so that they can evacuate to the new base and advises him not to be so mopey. Leia tells Ackbar about finding Luke a hobby.

However, Admiral Ackbar over-hears the conversation and warns Biggs and Porkins not to brag before a battle, lest they doom themselves. Meanwhile, a mopey Luke and R2 sit together watching a holocron recording of Luke's father, Anakin Skywalker, in training. Luke whines about sitting around, unlike the mobilised Jedi of old. In frustration, Luke throws the holocron onto the floor, only for it to relay a recording of Yoda, Kenobi and Skywalker embarking on a Clone Wars mission to rescue a Governor named Bibble from Count Dooku and his battle droids.

Luke proposes attacking the Imperial fleet to enable the rebel fleet to escape into space. While Jek-14 is unsure that Luke's plan will succeed, the young Jedi points to a lesson he learned in his holocron. Meanwhile, on Hoth, C-3PO, Han, and Chewie are left hanging upside down in the wampa's cave. C-3PO baits the wampa by telling rude jokes about his mother. Provoked, the wampa grabs Han, who takes the opportunity to retrieve his blaster. Han shoots the wampa and flees with C-3PO and Chewie out of the cave.

In space, Luke leads the Star Destroyers into an asteroid field which badly damages most of the Star Destroyers. Vader recognizes this as the same stunt he had pulled on Naboo years ago when he was still Anakin. Meanwhile, Palpatine's damaged Star Destroyer is attacked by Ackbar and several X-wings. Meanwhile, the rebel fleet approaches Hoth and Leia contacts Han about the location of the landing area. Han tells her he is on his way only to discover that the keys to Hoth Base were left behind in the wampa's cave. Chewbacca solves the problem by lighting up the ammunition in his bandolier and using them as flares to guide the rebel ships. Leia's LAAT gunship is the first rebel ship to land on Hoth. Biggs and Porkins disembark from the transport only to be chased by the same wampa that had pursued Han, possibly dooming themselves just as Admiral Ackbar had warned earlier.
