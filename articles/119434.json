That year, the Sith Lord Tarnis\u2014who was posing as the Republic scientist Doctor Eli Tarnis\u2014approached Salarr with an offer to secure the criminal gang's services in exchange for advanced Imperial weapons and armor. Salarr agreed to the deal, and the Sith had Salarr hire the Rodian thief Vistis Garn to steal superweapon plans from a military warehouse. When Tarnis felt that his cover was in danger of exposure, he had Salarr arrange for his own \"kidnapping\" by Black Sun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Salarr's forces infiltrated the Senate Tower and incapacitated Tarnis's guards before escorting the scientist to the nearby Senate Plaza taxi station. Salarr's lieutenant Zeer led the group to the nearby Coruscant Spaceport, where they barricaded themselves in one of the docking bays as a distraction for the Coruscant Security Force. Meanwhile, Tarnis himself left his Black Sun allies at the taxi station\u2014but instead of heading to Black Sun territory as planned, he headed to the territory of his other allies, the paramilitary Justicars' Brigade. When Zeer was finally captured, he gave up Tarnis's supposed location, so CSF Sergeant Nidaljo led a special tactical unit to rescue the doctor. Salarr's men easily repelled the CSF forces with their Imperial weaponry, driving off the police officers who attempted to set up a perimeter around the gang's headquarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Salarr was enraged when a young Jedi Knight arrived to aid the CSF officers. After deactivating the base's security systems, the Knight and police officers stormed Salarr's headquarters from opposite directions.

The Knight and the Jedi's astromech droid, T7-O1, reached Salarr first, and, though Salarr signaled one of his men to shoot the Jedi in the back, Nidaljo's unit arrived just in time to dispatch Salarr's man before the Knight was shot.
