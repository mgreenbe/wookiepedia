It was based on the Active-class fast attack frigate, with a hull that resembled that of the Vindicator-class heavy cruisers, while the bridge and primary sensor arrays were in a structure resembling the bridge of a Bellator-class dreadnought."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vessel carried both a full squadron of starfighters and a decent armament for a craft its size, but its primary mission remained reconnaissance. To support these efforts the class was equipped with powerful sensors and signal interception systems along with a stealth system that aided in concealing the frigate's location even while active scanners were in use."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These vessels were most commonly deployed in Imperial Navy formations that were based in The Core and Mid Rim regions of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
