It was designed to fire Micro-grenades quickly and with minimal training for the user. It could be mounted on another rifle and be used as a separate weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The MGL-1 acted as a sort of gauss gun, using magnetic rings to propel each grenade at high velocity with minimal scattering. A computerized firing system allowed for increase accuracy thanks to its target recognition system, which combined with its low recoil and soundless operation made it a favorite of bounty hunters. However the magnetic rings would eventually require replacement, otherwise causing the launcher to jam and leaving an armed grenade stuck in the barrel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
