He eventually hired the scientist Treun Lorn to help advance the project. After Lorn hired the assassin droid IG-72 to retrieve a pair of outdated IG-100 MagnaGuards to serve as N-K's bodyguards, the dark side Prophetess Merili led the two scientists to one of Emperor Palpatine's secret storehouses on Utapau, where she provided them with the mechanical body of the cyborg Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After placing an advanced droid brain in the mechanical body, Kinesworthy dubbed the completed project \"N-K Necrosis,\" and renamed the aging MagnaGuards \"NK-3.\" The NK-3s instructed Necrosis on how to fight with a lightsaber, with Necrosis wielding a double-bladed lightsaber that contained the Bane's Heart crystal.

In 1.5 ABY, however, a group of spacers investigated the depths of the Myyydril Caverns during the height of the Galactic Civil War, at the behest of Kinesworthy. During their investigation, the spacers found the cave where Necrosis had been stashed, which was protected by a watchful B1-Series battle droid. The droid gave the spacers a quest to find a special crystal, which had the ability to bring Necrosis to life. After the spacers retrieved the crystal in another region of the caverns, the battle droid gave the spacers access to the cave where Necrosis was kept. Inside, the spacers spoke to Lorn, who demanded they hand over the crystal. After the spacers complied, Necrosis and his two NK-3 bodyguards appeared and engaged the group in a fierce battle.

Along with the considerable fighting prowess that he had acquired through training with the NK-3s, Necrosis also acquired an almost Human penchant for analysis, and often wondered whether he was in fact superior to Grievous and not simply a shell of him. Necrosis found himself pondering who Grievous had been, feeling something akin to envy toward the living intelligence that had once inhabited the body. While serving under Lorn, Necrosis referred to him as \"master.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "N-K Necrosis was highly advanced in melee combat and used the same lightsaber techniques that Grievous once taught his MagnaGuard bodyguards during the Clone Wars. Unlike other lightsaber crystals, Necrosis's, the Bane's Heart crystal, was alchemically-treated, thus making the overall weapon more powerful. Both Necrosis and his NK-3 guards favored melee combat over a ranged variant. Since Necrosis had stronger armor, he was more powerful than his NK-3 droids. Necrosis's droid body, made of duranium alloy, had the appearance of a Krath war droid.
