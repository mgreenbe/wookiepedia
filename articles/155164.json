Six months after the start of the war, the Trandoshan and eight other bounty hunters intercepted a diplomatic package meant for Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Galactic Republic. However, while on the planet Ord Mantell, where the bounty hunters planned to sell the package to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, they were attacked by two squads of clone commandos, who were dispatched by the Republic to retrieve the package. The Trandoshan managed to kill one of the pursuing commandos, before being shot to death by another. Ultimately, the surviving commando, RC-1013, successfully retrieved the stolen package."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
