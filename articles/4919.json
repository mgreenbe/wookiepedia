An elderly ground crew chief of Shadow Wing by the time of the Battle at Chadawa, he had tried to retire three times before the Battle of Endor already. In 5 ABY, he took part in the mission to Netalych with Yrica Quell, Jeela Brebtin, Fra Raida, Nord Kandende and Agias Rikton. He argued for Quell's death after her comrades found out about her time in Alphabet Squadron. He returned to Shadow Wing aboard the ship Quell had found on a planetoid in the Cerberon system with only the TIE fighter pilot Jeela Brebtin. Shortly before Colonel Soran Keize left the 204th before the Battle of Jakku, he visited Mirro and told him he'd never forgotten his promise to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alchor Mirro appeared in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
