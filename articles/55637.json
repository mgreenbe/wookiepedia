At a young age, the Artiodac chef, Strono \"Cookie\" Tuggs, discovered ancient holovids of Gormaanda and was inspired to become a culinary artist, as he considered her to be a great galactic chef. Tuggs, a physically unattractive Artiodac, considered her a force of nature and was touched by the way Gormaanda was able to take the most plain and even ugly foods and turn them into something beautiful. After viewing her holovids, he felt that if she could do that with food, she could do it for him also. The way that Gormaanda shared her recipes instead of keeping them a secret encouraged him to do the same. When he published The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook after the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, he paid tribute to his inspiration and included an old recipe for Gormaanda's glowblue noodles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the new Star Wars canon, Gormaanda was first mentioned in the 2016 short story \"A Recipe for Death\" written by Landry Q.
