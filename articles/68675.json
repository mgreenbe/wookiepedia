He and his tribe encountered the habitable Calliope Station, inhabited by Siv and her daughter Torbi. Jagnar and his people were welcomed into the station, but had been deeply affected by their experiences. Jagnar took control of the tribe, imprisoning Siv and Torbi in the facility's brig. When the Resistance spy Vi Moradi visited Parnassos to rescue Siv and Torbi, she instead met Jagnar and his people, who kept up a pretense of civility until Moradi questioned where the facility's former inhabitants were. As Moradi and her small crew escaped Calliope Station with Siv and Torbi, Jagnar threatened the life of Moradi's associate Kriki, ordering her to take him offworld with them. Rather than attempting to reason with Jagnar, Moradi shot and killed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
