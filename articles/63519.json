He was a Detective Sergeant in the Kura City Guard and was partnered up with Detective Biller in 44 ABY. They received word of the whereabouts of pop singer Ledina Chott, who had been kidnapped by Wraith Squadron, from the man who had tracked down the signal of her transponder, Kadd Yinkle, to one of Galactic Alliance General Stavin Thaal's warehouses, where the General ran his criminal activities from. In spite of briefly mentioning how funny Yinkle's name was, Husin nevertheless took his job seriously as he and Biller, along with their backup officers, successfully recovered Chott from the warehouse alive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
