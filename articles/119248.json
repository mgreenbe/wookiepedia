The planet was inhabited by swamp farmers as well as clans led by marsh-lords. Despite Safrifa's nature, the Safrifans maintained extensive farms in the marshwater, raised by mud and decaying vegetation, growing crops such as kru-kru. Novian ore can be found on the planet. During the High Republic Era, the former Jedi and mercenary Ty Yorrick was hired to liberate the son of a marsh-lord from a rival clan, who compensated her with novian ore for the job. After returning the son safely, Yorrick intended to leave Safrifa, but she was approached by two Safrifan farmers, who requested that she help them deal with a creature that had been killing children and wrecking their plots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
