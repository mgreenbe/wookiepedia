The great city of Taris covered more than half the planet's surface rendering farming virtually impossible; kelp harvests and the sea creatures were the only food source."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was at this time that a self-sufficient colony beneath the Undercity was discovered, which was the only part of Taris that was not urbanized, and in which farming was possible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Abandoned by the Republic, the Tarisian industrialists began to use the power source of their wish, which produced a form of toxic waste. The pollution levels rose enough to poison and kill most of the oceanic fauna and flora, and the planet was swept with famine.

Here, walking the original surface of the planet that never saw the sun due to the shadows of Taris' massive skyscrapers, they endured a lifetime of horror marked by starvation, rakghoul attacks, and rakghoul infections. Even their descendants were forced to suffer the punishment of their parents, even though they themselves had done no crime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
