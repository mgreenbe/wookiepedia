During the trip, Nikolo and some of the other tourists, the Humans Nia Reston, San Herrera and Philinda, and the Sullustan Tret, were recruited by the droid LN-73 into assisting him at sabotaging the production facilities. LN-73 did this by lying to them by claiming that HG-211, Uffel's head of security, had been corrupted. Nikolo and the rest of the group then attacked the Heroes of Cularin, who LN-73 falsely claimed were sabotaging the droid factories. During the resulting firefight, Nikolo failed to set his blaster to stun, like the rest of his group had."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
