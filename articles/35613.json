They covered every astronomical body in their home system with pyramids and other constructs made from a plastic that was both indestructible and iridescent. In a brief period of expansionism, the Sharu planted pyramids on other planets in the galaxy as far Coreward as Aargau, a world that was still in its prehistory. The sharp-edged pyramid they built on that world would later become known as the Dawn Pyramid of Aargau. The Sharu later withdrew to their home system, buried their cities, and drained their intellects, an act some believed was in response to the threat of the Celestial civilization that controlled much of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Aargau's own civilization grew, the Dawn Pyramid inspired the planet's architectural theme. It had been standing on for ninety millennia when the historian Vicendi composed the Arturum Galactinum commemorating the Galactic Republic's 15,000th anniversary. Vicendi added the Dawn Pyramid to his list of Twenty Wonders of the Galaxy in the Arturum Galactinum, a list that focused on sentient-built items as opposed to natural phenomena. The list was later criticized for its focus on antiquity and prolific Core Worlds items\u2014two categories within which the Dawn Pyramid of Aargau definitely fell\u2014and much later, a rewritten version titled Glorius Imperica became part of the Galactic Empire's Human High Culture propaganda through the Imperial Ministry of Education."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dawn Pyramid of Aargau has thus far been mentioned only in one canon publication, 2009's The Essential Atlas, which was written by Jason Fry and Daniel Wallace.
