He was stationed at the Republic shipyards near the planet Foerost when the Krath and Mandalorian forces arrived and took them over, and was killed during the battle. His son Saul had a grudge against Captain Dace Golliard ever since, because the captain had fled the battle, which resulted in the slaughter of Craddock and the other worker by the Krath and Mandalorians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
