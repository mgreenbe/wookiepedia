Several Imperial troops were wounded or killed when the rebels attack an Imperial facility, before being routed and captured by Imperial forces. Imperial reports claimed that civilians killed during the incident died when the fleeing rebels turned their weapons on the populace. News of the incident led to citizens of Rampa I also rising up against the Empire, while Imperial Moff Sarn Shild launched a crackdown on smugglers operating in Hutt Space after weapons used in the incident were traced to that sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
