He is portrayed by Ahmed Best, who also portrayed Jar Jar Binks. In an interview with Anthony Carboni on The Star Wars Show, Best stated that the showrunners Steve Blank and Scott Bromley, and executive producers Christine Beebe and Mickey Capoferri, had given him considerable flexibility in developing Kelleran Beq's histories, mannerisms, and even lightsaber color. Best confirmed that Beq was related to Achk Med-Beq, whom he had portrayed in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, though no canonical source has yet confirmed the relation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a later interview with Kristin Baver, Best confirmed that Beq's purple lightsaber color was an intended homage to Jedi Master Mace Windu. He also stated that other aspects of Beq's character were inspired by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and the Shaolin monks from Best's childhood favorite Kung fu movies. Best described Beq as the first Jedi dedicated to teaching, adding that he had been inspired by Kenobi and Yoda's nurturing kind of mentorship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Best posted on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0that the pieces of Kelleran Beq's lightsaber are pieces that are available to everyone at Savi's Workshop. His philosophy when it comes to teaching is that all types of learning should be accessible to everyone. Even lightsaber learning. Ahmed says that at Kelleran Beq's core he is a teacher. He said that part of the rationale behind this was his desire for Beq to be relatable to the audience rather than apart from them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
