The Aing-Tii took the relics to their homeworld and placed them in the Embrace, a series of caverns on the planet. They were forbidden to touch the sacred relics, but outsiders were not. For this reason, the Aing-Tii often enlisted the help of others, such as Jorj Car'das, to retrieve the relics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 43.5 ABY Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker and his son, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, traveled to the Kathol Rift to find the Aing-Tii in hopes of learning more about Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side of the Force. They were taken to the Aing-Tii homeworld by Tadar'Ro, who eventually took them to the Embrace, with the hopes that they would find a revelation from the relics that would settle the tensions that had recently risen among the Aing-Tii. Luke touched the Codex, a relic that could increase the Force-sensitivity of the user. This caused the Lost Tribe of Sith, a group of Sith marooned on the planet of Kesh about 5,000 years earlier, to sense Skywalker's presence and hear his name through the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The relics revealed no revelation to the Skywalkers, and the Aing-Tii were left to solve their internal problems on their own."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
