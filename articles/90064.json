Near the end of the New Sith Wars, he had three sons. The four were salvagers on Ambria. While scavenging, one of his son's found Mandalorian armor. When the other son commented that the Sith Lord's were gone, the man told his children that the Sith had been thought extinct multiple times yet they always came back. His youngest son Mikki found Darth Bane's lightsaber. The man told Mikki to throw it away. Suddenly, the lightsaber rose into the air and ignited, beheading the eldest son. Darth Bane rose from the rubble and telekinetically slew the other son. The father held Mikki close and pleaded with Bane to spare Mikki. The Dark Lord killed Mikki, fueling himself on the father's pain to survive his synox poisoning by Githany before killing him as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
