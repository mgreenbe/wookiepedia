The mouth-operated weapon required no hands to fire and was useful to Laboi who left their homeworld for the greater galaxy. Nevertheless, such technology was incredibly rare and extremely expensive; during the Galactic Civil War, it cost at least ten times the price of a comparable hand-operated weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The second edition of Galaxy Guide 4: Alien Races mentions the mouth-operated gun as a possible piece of equipment for Laboi characters in West End Games's Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. The book, updated by Chuck Truett from the original edition by Troy Denning, marks the first mention of such technology. The source fails to specify whether such weapons used blaster technology, slugthrower technology, or something else."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
