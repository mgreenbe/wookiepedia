As the Galactic Alliance's elite hyperspace pursuit unit, Twisted Star Squadron used the Jumpstar's advanced sensors and computing systems to pursue fleeing ships through hyperspace. After chasing an escaping ship, the squadron would proceed to attack the vessel directly or report their position and call for aid. Twisted Star Squadron was known for the quick thinking of its pilots, a trait that was required to make snap decisions and calculate potential jump positions nearly instantly. The squadron's name was derived from the radical maneuvers that were often required to achieve the correct pursuit vector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Battle of Caamas in 130 ABY, the last major engagement of the Sith-Imperial War, Twisted Star was deployed in anticipation of following damaged Imperial vessels as they fled the combat zone, with the Galactic Alliance believing they were assured victory.

The dual-engine fighter employed one of two methods to track targets through hyperspace. The most reliable method involved tagging the target with a hyperspace tracking device, while the other, less reliable method was to analyze a fleeing ship's departure vector, engine output, and other data to estimate a potential destination. The pilots often had to make educated guesses and assumptions when given a list of possible destinations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twisted Star Squadron was first mentioned in the 2009 Wizards of the Coast roleplaying game sourcebook, the Legacy Era Campaign Guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
