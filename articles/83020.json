They were multi-purpose craft that could be used for combat, search and rescue, transport, or other purposes. Longbeams were constructed at the Republic shipyards on Hosnian Prime. Their shape reminded Nautolan Captain Finial Bright of the hammerfish of Glee Anselm: a blunt \"skull\" tapering into a sinuous shape reminiscent of a tailfin. Longbeam armaments included a total of six missiles. Many of the ships, including Bright's Aurora IX, were used during the Republic and Jedi effort to save the Hetzal system during the Great Disaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
