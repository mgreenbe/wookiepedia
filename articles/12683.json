They protected their homeworld of Dorin and were famous for their well-honed precognition skills, which enabled them to launch early evacuations in cases of deadly storms and advise government officials. For centuries, the Jedi Order recruited Dorin's strongest Force-sensitives, which ultimately caused the Baran Do order to fall into obscurity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The teachings of the Baran Do were organized into three branches inspired by natural elements: the Guided Wind, the Guided Lightning, and the Guided Stream. The Sages were entirely subservient to the will of the Force, and sought to only act at precisely the right place and time to avoid undesired consequences. Even though they focused on patience and meditation\u2014to the point that other Kel Dors found them apathetic to suffering\u2014some of them trained in quarterstaff combat and mastered powers of the elements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
