Trained in the Sith Academy on Korriban, as part of her final trial Kagan was sent by Overseer Harkun into the Valley of the Dark Lords to retrieve the helm of Tulak Hord along with a group of other acolytes, which included Greck, Bensyn and Lana Beniko. Upon entering the Tomb of Tulak Hord the group was overwhelmed by k'lor'slugs, which left Greck dead and Kagan severely wounded.
