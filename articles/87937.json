Constructing a yellow-bladed lightsaber and growing strong in the Jedi arts under the tutelage of Grand Master Yoda, Zane achieved the rank of Jedi Master and was appointed as an instructor at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. As the threat of separatism grew in the Galactic Republic's Senate, and the discovery of the reemergence of the Sith on Naboo loomed large, the Jedi High Council saw a need to expand their training program across the galaxy. Selecting a group of Jedi Masters, the Council dispatched them with groups of Padawans to open new academies. Master Zane was selected and tasked with leading a group of students to the forested world of Kashyyyk, where she would instruct her students in the ways of the Force."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Kashyyyk"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Traveling aboard a Consular-class cruiser with her students, Zane and her charges arrived on Kashyyyk where they met with Masters Yoda, Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Together, Yoda and Zane oversaw the younglings' training. Shortly after their arrival on the world, the chapter house and nearby village were attacked by Trandoshan slavers and the armies of the Commerce Guild. During the first assault, a group effort by the Jedi and the Wookiees scattered their attackers and bought time for the Jedi to regroup. Master Yoda used the lull in the fighting to return to Coruscant in hopes of divining the political causes of the attacks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after Yoda left, Zane and her students were forced into battle again. Assisted by a Wookiee named Chewbacca a small group escaped the attack, but Zane and many other students were taken captive. After a brief encounter with the Sun Guard, the students who'd escaped boarded a ship called the Starrunner, and flew into space to chase after the slavers holding Zane and the other Jedi captive. Receiving a transmission from Masters Yoda and Windu via hologram, the Jedi were notified that Zane and the other captives had been taken to a prison facility above the planet Felucia."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Felucia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard a Providence-class capital ship, Zane managed to free herself while her escaped Padawans fought their way through the ship's hangar bay to the other imprisoned students. Soon, the Jedi discovered that the Commerce Guild was amassing a huge army to stage an attack on one of the Core Worlds. Realizing that the information needed to reach the High Council, Zane was able to meet up with the Padawans and ward off an attack by Sun Guards and IG-100 MagnaGuards. Upon destroying the ship's reactor core, Zane and her students boarded the Starrunner, escaping.

The native Felucians, under the leadership of a Human named Mak Pra, planned to storm the enemy's base.

Discovering that Mai hoped to weaponize the dangerous chemical Trihexalon for an attack on Coruscant itself, Zane and her students attempted to escape the compound with this knowledge but were captured by the Gossam.
