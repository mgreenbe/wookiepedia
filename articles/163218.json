One of its endpoints lay at the northern end of the Path of the Houses\u2014a route connecting the home planets of Chiss Ruling Families\u2014within the core territory of the Chiss Ascendancy. The route then headed toward the Redoubt, its eastern terminus. The other terminal point of the route\u2014the planet Schesa\u2014was home to a former Ruling Family, which eventually found itself on the losing side of a civil war before the Swarm War, while another world along the route, Pesfavri, was a CEDF base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Way of Schesa debuted in The Essential Atlas, a 2009 reference book written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry.
