At some point between 22 and 19 BBY, this clan fought a war with their rivals, an Er'stacian clan whose warriors wore green armor. Both sides wanted possession of the Venerable One, or Megalith, a giant statue representing the primordial forebear of all Er'stacians on the planet Er'stacia. However, the Jedi Master Mace Windu arrived before the hostilities could escalate into an all-out genocide. When he hacked the Megalith into pieces with his lightsaber, the two clans resolved their differences in order to put it back together."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
