After graduating from the Temple's academy, the respected Jedi Master Sora Bulq selected Mira as his Padawan and together they traveled the galaxy for several years. While Bulq was a famed lightsaber duelist, Mira did not demonstrate any prowess with the lightsaber, instead focusing her energies into maintaining her Jedi calm and her skill in peacekeeping. Eventually, Mira passed her Trials of Knighthood and was made a Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Separatist Crisis between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems erupted in the Clone Wars, Jedi Mira invoked the Right of Denial, refusing to return to Coruscant to receive the rank of General in the newly formed Grand Army of the Republic. Mira met with like-minded Jedi shortly after the Battle of Geonosis and was selected to represent them when a meeting was called on Ruul. The meeting, called by Master Bulq and Master Mace Windu, was meant to open negotiations between the High Council and the dissident Jedi in hopes of preventing another schism within the Order. Arriving at her former master's estate, Mira joined fellow dissenters Master K'Kruhk, Sian Jeisel, and Jedi Rhad Tarn while Masters Windu and Bulq prepared for the meeting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Walking amongst the moon's gardens, Mira felt a disturbance in the Force and rushed to a cliff side to see her former master under attack by the Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress. Unaware that her master was indeed in league with Ventress, for he had fallen to the dark side of the Force in the weeks leading up to the meeting, Mira leaped down to assist her former mentor. While Ventress and Bulq were in league, the Dathomirian woman did not take orders from the Weequay and easily overpowered Mira before killing her. Shocked by her sudden death, Bulq carried his former Padawan's corpse up to his estate and mourned over her body. While there, Master Windu confronted Bulq about his betrayal and revealed the Weequay to be in league with Ventress and the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mira was a gentle soul who hated conflict and was determined to settle things peacefully.
