The backbone of the Galactic Republic's naval forces, the Venator was a versatile capital ship capable of serving as a troop carrier, a cargo transport, and a warship for ship-to-ship combat. Its front section contained a large flight deck and hangars to accommodate a complement of Republic starfighters and gunships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic deployed the Venator-class Star Destroyers across the galaxy during the conflict with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Often utilized as flagships by the Jedi Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Venator-class was closely associated with the Jedi Order as a result. Venators served in several major engagements of the Clone Wars, including the Battle of Christophsis, the Battle of Sullust, and the Battle of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Order 66 and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Venator-class Star Destroyers remained in service to the Imperial Navy during the early days of the Imperial Era. Ultimately, though, the Venator-class was decommissioned and replaced by the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, a larger warship that was modeled on its Republic predecessor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "General characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Venator-class Star Destroyer costed 59,000,000 credits and was manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards for the naval operations of the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars. Spanning between 1,137 and 1,155.0 meters in length, the Venator was defended by powerful deflector shields and sturdy armor plating on its hull, while possessing an assortment of armaments. It was also equipped with a long-range sensor suite, as well as a navigation computer and corresponding systems. Venator-class vessels generally carried a crew of 7,400 personnel, including officers, pilots and enlisted crew, but could also hold some 2,000 troops in addition. 7,000 metric tons of cargo could be transported aboard the Venator, as well as sufficient consumables to last two standard years."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hangar space"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early period of the Clone Wars, the Venator-class Star Destroyer featured a wide array of hangar space. The forward section of the Star Destroyer featured a passage down the middle, with bays for starships on either side. It was mainly accessed by large doors on top of the ship. At the fore of this passage, at the bow the ship, was a collection of hyperspace transport rings. Towards the aft of the passage, doors in the floor could open, leading to a space where Republic frigates could dock. If no cruiser was docked, however, the space could be used by personnel to jump out of the Star Destroyer directly onto the battlefield, or to deploy walkers without the need for dropships. Overseeing the passage was a raised command station positioned at the aft. Even further aft, the Venator-class had two independent docking bays on their port and starboard sides, again protected by blast doors."}]}
