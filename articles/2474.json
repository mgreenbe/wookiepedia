When the ship's abusive Imperial captain belittled AP-5, Chopper sprung to his defense and managed to knock out the captain. The two droids then joined forces to seize control of the ship. Later on, AP-5 aided the rebellion by warning the rebels that the Yost system, their original jump destination, was not safe because an Imperial fleet had already been dispatched there.

Due to his experience working aboard a class four container vessel, AP-5 was able to advise the Lasat warrior Garazeb Orrelios when planning the mission.

AP-5 tried to solicit Zeb and Chopper's help but the two were not interested in such mundane work.

Zeb had taken pity on the \"stray\" droid and got AP-5 to charge up the droid. Due to the emergency protocol, the protocol droid began to revive quickly and started scanning its surroundings including the depot, Zeb, and Chopper. Impressed, AP-5 decided to take on the stray droid as his inventory assistant.

When AP-5 suggested contacting Hera, Zeb refused because they did not have enough time and vowed not to fail the rebel leader. After finding a wrecked astromech droid that had been drained of its power and stripped of its spare parts, AP-5 cautioned that Chopper was unable to track down the Infiltrator Droid because it was low on power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three rebels then discussed their plan to capture and disable the Imperial droid.

Chopper managed to freeze the droid's timer before it could detonate its proton warhead. Following a discussion with Zeb and Chopper, the rebels decided to send the Infiltrator Droid back to the Empire but with its proton warhead rigged to explode.

However, Zeb reassured AP-5 that he done his great job. Despite not being on good terms, AP-5 commended Zeb for his admirable work.
