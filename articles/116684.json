There was a metal mound in the center of the platform, which had a canopy above it supported by metal pillars. Scattered around the camp were a number of crude metal barricades, built for defence against Kazdan Paratus' droid army. This area was protected by the aforementioned Rippers and Heavy Defenders, but also by Jawa scavengers. Furthermore there was another section of the camp, protected by a shield generator. There was also a loading elevator, which led down underneath the camp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
