The planet's day lasted twenty-eight standard hours, and its year consisted of 389 local days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet had standard gravity and a breathable Type I atmosphere. Although the climate on Trevi IV was temperate in general, the temperatures were high in the Trevi City settlement, particularly during the day. The terrain of the nondescript planet included barren plains, deserts, plateaus, and urbanized areas. Trevi IV's hydrosphere was dry, but there were at least two bodies of surface water on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, a caravan of Truishii traders passing the Trevi system experienced an accident in hyperspace.
