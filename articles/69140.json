Jannik assigned the strike team to expose Beldiss for the evil Sith Lord he was by hacking defunct Voss comm relays which he used to communicate with his spies in Voss-Ka.

Once the hero managed to rescue the spy, Jannik discovered that Beldiss had been recruiting failed Voss Mystics to become Sith. He sent the hero into a Voss ruins in search of Beldiss, but the Sith Lord invited the hero to his location himself instead. However, when his Voss acolytes considered joining the Jedi, Beldiss showed his true colors and lashed out at the hero, only to be defeated and killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, when the hero returned to base, Jannik was receiving worry from a Jedi Master Delsa who believed that the Voss acolytes were too dangerous to train and underestimate the dangers of the dark side.
