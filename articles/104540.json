Persappa featured bubbling brew pools on its surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rakatan tribe that settled Persappa also brought guard creatures there, including rancors, a species of carnivorous reptomammals originating on the Outer Rim Territories worlds of Dathomir and Ottethan. Due to overbreeding, however, the rancors on Persappa eventually mutated into a variant that was blue-spotted and amphibious, and the creatures lurked in the planet's brew pools."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Persappa was introduced in The Unknown Regions, a sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game that was developed by Wizards of the Coast.
