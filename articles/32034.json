As a mechanic, he relied especially on a treadwell droid to assist him in his repairs, as he found the many appendages and arms of this type of droid highly useful. He would show his treadwell to others, informing them about its usefulness. He was known for doing favors, such as modifying R2 units, in return for pilot training. He also hated factory-new X-wings, because they had a tendency to malfunction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He did, however, have a tendency to lie about how much it would take to fix them, so that Wedge Antilles would think he was working harder than he was.
