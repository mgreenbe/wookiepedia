It was produced as a modified version of the popular DH-17 blaster pistol. The weapon capitalized on the DH-17's success, but despite its increased durability, it never became as successful as its predecessor due to reduced range, strength, and stun capability.

A modified version of the popular DH-17 blaster pistol, the DH-23 had an improved heat radiator shroud and a tighter body construction making it far harder to damage or break, although at the cost of reduced range, and strength. Weighing one kilogram, the weapon had a stun setting, although it was less effective than that of the DH-17. The DH-23's maximum firing range was 80 meters, and the pistol could fire 100 shots per power pack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DH-23 was produced by BlasTech Industries, in the hope of capitalizing on the huge success of the DH-17; however, the more durable weapon never reached the levels of popularity seen by the original.
