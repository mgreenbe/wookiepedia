Its roots could only grow in water, and therefore all Cambylictus grew in lakes and oceans. The roots of the tree had healing properties, and were used by Gungans and Ewoks as medicine. The Cambylictus trees proved useful in the Gungan's colonization of Ohma-D'un, as their bark provided major resources for the construction of Gungan shelters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trees produced Camby berries, which were given by Ewoks as gifts, during their Festival of Love.
