They were responsible for handling the extra energy produced during power surges, keeping an even power flow. Without the correct power dispersion unit, power built up in the vehicle, resulting in extra speed. However, if the excess energy produced was not used, the system would overload."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
