The former Jedi Caleb Dume severed his connection to the Force in the aftermath of the Great Jedi Purge in order to remain hidden from the newly established Galactic Empire and start his new life as Kanan Jarrus. Likewise, former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano distanced herself from the Force, trying to prevent herself from accessing her Force abilities in order to hide and also to avoid the pain of her past life as a Jedi. After Jarrus embraced his role as a Jedi Knight in service of the Spectres, he would be blinded by the former Sith Lord Maul on Malachor. In the aftermath of the injury, Jarrus claimed he had distanced himself from the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After she was captured by the Inquisitorius, Jedi Knight Cere Junda escaped the Fortress Inquisitorius by using the Dark side.

However, the Force still tried to reach Skywalker through dreams and even sometimes reached him when he was awake, despite his efforts, offering messages or warning.
