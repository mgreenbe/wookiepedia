They were fully-articulated, polished chrome, 1.9 meter tall humanoid droids, which were slim and graceful. Their method of storing weapons was rather unique in that they were magnetically attached to the outer casing of the droid. When they were activated, their eyes glowed with a deep fluorescent green. They were not designed with much self awareness, and all had a sub-program which do not allow them to act against the interests of the Combine. They were efficient killers, dealing death gracefully and with minimum effort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One particular droid of this model was X."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
