Binary is a computer language consisting of two signs in combinations, analogous to yes and no, on and off. The Binary language in the real world uses logic; the logic code is between 0 and 1. In short, CBell-1 is a basic form of two-sign audible binary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While this causes conflict with interpretations of \"binary\" and \"droidspeak\", the description of CBell-1 is consistent with actual binary meaning."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
