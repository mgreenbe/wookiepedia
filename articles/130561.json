The 2017 addition of material to promote The Last Jedi would bring in more Sequel Trilogy content to create a full experience focused around the era as a result of criticism of the Jakku segment mismatching with the rest of the attraction.

While the attraction itself does not provide precise data about its chronology, the exact dating of the new Star Tours can be narrowed down by cross-checking with other sources. In The Adventures Continue, the Rebel Alliance is shown to exist.

Since Ackbar was only freed from Imperial slavery in 1 BBY, The Adventure Continues necessarily happened at some point between 1 and 0 BBY.

According to the droid, Yavin 4 was already the site of the Rebel headquarters at the time in which the attraction takes place. According to the 121st issue of The Official Star Wars Fact File, the Alliance only retrieved the key to the Massassi Temple in 1 BBY.

In one scene, riders are confronted by Darth Vader, and encounter Finn in the next, even though Vader would have been long dead by the time of the events presented in the latter scene. Thus, it can be assumed that the events presented in these scenes are non-canon within the Legends continuity. Further Sequel Trilogy additions in 2017 would smooth out some of these issues by creating a new Kylo Ren intro and a reworked version of the Stormtrooper intro featuring the First Order stormtroopers. The attraction is still randomized, but each flight includes either original content entirely based around Episodes 1 to 6, or entirely based around Episodes 7 to 9.
