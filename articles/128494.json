It purported to instruct non-Neimoidians how to speak their guttural native language known as Pak Pak. That text was included in the packaging of a special vocabulator that was sold to alien species wanting to be able to communicate in the heavily accented language of the Neimoidian people. The document was later included in Baobab's manual Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide, which was published in 6 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
