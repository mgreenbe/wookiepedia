From a nearby pod, Jedi Master Plo Koon and a small group of clones watched as the droids cut open the pod, sending the two clones inside hurtling through space. The droids' attention then turned towards the Jedi Master, however, and they attempted to infiltrate the pod. Koon, with the help of clone troopers Sinker and Boost engaged the droids in combat.
