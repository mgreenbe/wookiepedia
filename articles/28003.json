The name Cloudland derives from the way the mountains seem to \"pierce the sky.\" The higher elevations were shrouded in cloud and mist, and the peaks frequently rose above the cloud cover entirely. Temperatures at these levels ranged from \u201310\u00b0 C in the day to \u201345\u00b0 C at night. These treacherous peaks attracted adventurous climbers from Corellia and other star systems and were one of Selonia's only tourist spots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
