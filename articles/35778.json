The module was ten centimeters wide by sixteen centimeters long and was a dead crimson in color. Higher forms of life caught in the module's effects were injured by the effects. All of the life energy from those caught in the field was absorbed by the module's wielder. One of these modules was in the possession of Moff Sarne's forces on the planet Binaros. When his forces withdrew from the planet, the MSE-6-series repair droid MSE-X-PR6 stole the module."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
