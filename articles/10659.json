She was present on Tatooine, where she watched the Boonta Eve Classic podrace, during the Trade Federation's invasion of the planet Naboo. During this time, she also became acquainted with Weequay pirate captain, Hondo Ohnaka. After the outbreak of the Clone Wars and the death of fellow bounty hunter Jango Fett, Sing trained Fett's son, Boba Fett, and helped him in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Jedi Master Mace Windu, who killed Jango on Geonosis. After parting ways with Boba, Sing took jobs from Ziro the Hutt and Cad Bane. Sing's bounty hunter career, however, ultimately came to an end with her death at the hands of Tobias Beckett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born to a father she never knew and a mother too poor to raise her, Aurra Sing was a feared Palliduvan bounty hunter known for her chalk-white skin and built-in comlink antenna, Aurra Sing was an expert sniper and trained assassin who would work for anyone who paid her. She was a known associate of Jango Fett and was at one point involved in a relationship with Hondo Ohnaka. On Nar Shaddaa, she and fellow bounty hunters Cad Bane and Vorhdeilo met Sith Lord, Darth Maul. Sing picked up a transmission that Jedi were on their way to Hutta Town to investigate. Together with Bane's group, despite Sing's suspicions about Maul, they attended Xev Xrexus's Cartel's auction of the Jedi Padawan Eldra Kaitis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the auction, Sing, Bane, and Vorhdeilo spoke with Maul aboard their ship. Together, they planned to take Kaitis from Jee Kra, who had successfully won the padawan in the auction. Sing and her compatriots killed Kra's crew. Sing, Maul and the others met Kra and Kaitis at his ship. After Maul subdued Kra and his remaining crew, Sing spoke with Bane about about leaving or killing Maul after their job was done. Having discovered the theft, Xrexus ordered the ship shot down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the group crashed onto the moon of Drazkel below, Xrexus allowed the rest of the bidders to hunt them down for sport and offered Kaitis to anyone who captured her. Maul and Kaitis split off from the group to distract the hunters, instructing the bounty hunters to steal a ship. Turning the tables on the hunters, Bane, Sing, and Vorhdeilo set a trap. Bane lured a group of Trandoshan hunters into a kill zone, where Sing sniped them from a distance and Vorhdeilo attacked them at close range. The group then stole a Ohnaka Gang starship and picked up Maul, who promised they would be compensated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ten years before the start of the Clone Wars, Sing was on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine during the time of the Boonta Eve Classic podrace.

All identifying authentimarks were scrubbed from the hologram, making it impossible to confirm its legitimacy, but if true, the image suggested Sing had a hand in Kee's demise. Divo developed a theory that Farwan & Glott, the original manufacturers of Kee's podracer, hired Sing to take out Kee so that they could acquire the podracer customization secrets that he refused to reveal."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Joining Boba Fett"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Sing joined up with Boba Fett to kill Mace Windu for revenge for Boba's father, who Windu had killed on Geonosis. Boba, under the name of \"Lucky,\" boarded the Endurance as a clone cadet. After his first attempt on Windu's life failed, he contacted Sing to ask for advice. Sing told him to blow up the reactors, much to Boba's surprise. After Boba successfully destroyed the Endurance's reactors, sending it crashing towards Vanqor, he got into one of the escape pods along with several of the other cadets. Once they were away from the plummeting vessel, the pod was docked by Slave I. Bossk and Sing entered the pod to confront Boba. After telling him that the other cadets must be launched into space, due to the fact that they were \"living witnesses,\" Boba reluctantly came aboard Slave I and jettisoned the pod from Slave I's docking area.

After Skywalker and Windu triggered their bomb in the crash site, Boba convinced Sing to go back there and get the two Jedis' heads to bring to Count Dooku, who might pay them for their trouble. Sing, along with Boba and Castas, went to the crash site. Due to the ship falling apart, and R2-D2's interference, Sing decided to blow up the crash site. As they left, Bossk contacted Sing, telling that a explosion happened near where the Jedi landed. Sing then ordered Bossk to jam all transmissions from the planet. When Sing and her team returned to Slave I, they saw Windu's Jedi starfighter taking off. Unbeknownst to Sing, only R2-D2 was aboard. Though Slave I took out the Jedi fighter's communications, Artoo reached the hyperspace rings and escaped.

During a visit in the bar with Hondo, Sing overheard Castas communicating via hologram to a friend on Coruscant. After hearing him calling her an old hag, she shot him. Plo Koon and Ahsoka Tano later caught up with her. After having a quarrel in a room, Sing fled, leaving a discouraged Boba behind. Tano chased her, but after getting an order from Koon, she went to free the hostages. Sing got suspicious, so she went to go and stop the Padawan. After Tano pursued her, she fled on Slave I, but because of a wing failure caused by Tano, the ship crashed. Sing was presumed dead by the Jedi.

After Bane eliminated the remaining Senate Commandos, Aurra shot a dying trooper who was lying on the ground. Later she aided Shahan Alama in searching for the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, whose presence in the Senate Building threatened to thwart Bane's plan.

Despite this, she was also selfish, and she abandoned Fett to save herself after the boy was captured by Plo Koon. Sing also tried to serve as a mentor to Fett, as shown by when she tried make him to murder the helpless Clone Commander Ponds and, when he hesitated, she simply shoved him aside and killed Ponds herself. Aurra Sing also had a romantic relationship with Hondo Ohnaka, and though they were no longer lovers, Ohnaka still referred to her as \"My Dear.\" Consequently, after Sing and Boba arrived at Ohnaka's base, he asked if Boba was his son.
