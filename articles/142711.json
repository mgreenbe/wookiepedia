Many bounty hunters from the Guild accepted the job. Karga later informed the bounty hunter Din Djarin of the job after he turned in his previous bounties, which he accepted. The guild master then contacted the Client to let him know Djarin was coming to meet him, describing the hunter as the best in the parsec, but also expensive."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The meeting"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian met with the Client in a building guarded by a TT-8L/Y7 gatekeeper droid, and four armed stormtroopers stood with the Client while he sat at a desk during the meeting.

Reacting to the scientist's sudden entry, Djarin immediately drew his weapons, prompting the stormtroopers to do the same.

The Client then requested that he see Grogu with his own eyes, but was informed by Karga that it was asleep. He was then interrupted by a call from his superior, Moff Gideon, who asked him if Grogu was secured. The Client confirmed that he was in their hands, but Gideon told him to inspect the pram again.
