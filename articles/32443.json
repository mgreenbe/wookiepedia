The moon had an expansive cloud cover, and an orbital debris ring. It featured Weapons Factory Alpha, an Imperial weapons factory considered the largest in the galaxy, and one of the most heavily-guarded bases in the Empire. The area consisted of extensive refuse fields surrounding a complex of industrial buildings rising towards the rust-colored sky. Automated sentries patrolled the garbage, and a native species called the trash fields home. Within the factory complex, machines worked non-stop to construct TIE fighters and other armaments for the Empire. Although Overseer Aggadeen claimed the factory was fully automated, it made use of slave labor, and kept prisoners of multiple species on its lower levels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
