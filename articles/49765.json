The Gardens, located in a caldera of an extinct volcano, were originally cultivated as a royal retreat for the court of the Empire of Xim the Despot. All who entered without permission were put to death, and legend had it that the Gardens were cultivated by a cadre of slaves blinded at birth. Traitors, failed Tionese military officers, and defeated enemies were said to have been executed there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Xim's defeat by the Hutts at the Third Battle of Vontor in 25,100 BBY, the Forbidden Gardens were allowed to fall into ruin. However, they were included on a list of the Twenty Wonders of the Galaxy by the historian Vicendi. In the centuries before 0 BBY the ruins were opened to the public, and Jabba Desilijic Tiure once visited the Gardens. The ruins could be the hiding place for delinquent Cronese children, however, which could complicate tours, as the historian Bleys Harand discovered during his visit to the Gardens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
