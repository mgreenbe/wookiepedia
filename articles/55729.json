Due to the severity of his disease, most of Vidian's body parts were replaced with cybernetic parts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebuilding himself as Count Denetrius Vidian, the former safety inspector reestablished himself as a respected management guru over the next five years. Seeking revenge against the mining companies that had wronged him, Vidian bought shares in the comet-chaser industry. Four years before the fall of the Galactic Republic Vidian purchased Minerax Consulting and issued a critical report that ended all surface thorilide mining on Gorse.

As a result, Gorse's pristine sanctuary moon of Cynda was opened to thorilide mining by the Galactic Empire, which had replaced the Republic. Thorilide was a crystal that was used as a shock absorber for shielding starships against turbolaser cannons. The thorilide mining operations on Cynda were opposed by Skelly, a veteran of the Clone Wars and a dissident miner who had compiled research which showed that the mining operations weakened the moon's fragile surface. Due to the rapid expansion of the Imperial Navy, the Gorse system fell behind the Empire's quota.

Hetto contacted the rebel operative Hera Syndulla via HoloNet and arranged to meet her at a cantina in Gorse City called The Asteroid Belt, which was run by Okadiah Garson.

Vidian also destroyed the laggard freighter Cynda Dreaming in order to sent the local freight haulers a clear message that the Empire would no longer tolerate delays. Vidian began his tour by visiting the mines on Cynda. Some of his first actions were to order the arrest of known trouble-makers under Security Condition One and to implement an age cap on the work force.

Unfortunately for Skelly, his remarks were picked up by the surveillance team Myder's Mynocks. The team's Sullustan leader Zaluna Myder reluctantly forwarded the incident report to her supervisor, who contacted the Empire.

Vidian's problems were further compounded when his rival Baron Lero Danthe informed him that the Emperor had doubled Cynda's weekly output.

The Imperials were unconcerned about the potential environmental catastrophe that Cynda's destruction would bring to Gorse. Under Vidian's orders, stormtroopers planted explosives in Zone Sixty-Six which destroyed the mining facilities on Cynda and killed many miners including Kanan's friend Okadiah.
