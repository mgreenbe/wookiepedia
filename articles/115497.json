It was named after the deceased Jedi Knight Ganner Rhysode who died in combat against the Yuuzhan Vong. A large room centered by an expensive roo-wood serenity table flanked by flowfit chairs, the room was greatly contrasted by the sparse decor of the academy. It was here that Leia Organa Solo intended to present the delegates from Ithor possible new home planet she and Han Solo discovered. Ooamu Waoabi, the eldest of the Ithorians, would have accepted her offer except for sudden arrival of Chief of State Cal Omas. To prevent possible Killik-Chiss war, Organa Solo mentioned their discovery. Omas with all presented Jedi then agreed to give newly found world to Killiks as replacement for planet Qoribu that was source of previous dispute."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
