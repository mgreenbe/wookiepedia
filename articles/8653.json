It is bordered by the Corellian Run which many used to travel from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim and Wild Space. It was also crossed by the Triellus Trade Route, which led into Hutt Space. A subset of the sector were the Regency Worlds, a relatively prosperous region on the Corellian Run formed around the former Arkanis Regency. Unfortunately, this prosperity rarely extended to other parts of the sector, with only a mild boost in trade (and a significant one in crime) as Hutt interests moved in towards the end of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, after rescuing and returning Rotta to Jabba on Tatooine, the Hutts allowed the Clone Army to pass through the Arkanis sector, as well as the neighboring Hutt Space, unlike the Droid Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Imperial rule, it was governed by Moff Alexander Julstan IV.

It is unknown whether this is a misspelling of \"Arkanis sector\". It also bears noting that according to the novel, Arkonis sector is located in the Outer Rim while Arkanis sector (in contradiction to previous and later sources) is said to be located in Wild Space. On pages 251 and 263 of the hardcover edition of Death Star, the region in which Tatooine and the Arkanis sector are located is stated to be Wild Space. This also contradicts previous and later sources which establish the Outer Rim Territories as the region in which Tatooine and the Arkanis sector were located. The \"Arkonis sector\" does not appear in the later published The Essential Atlas, its associated maps, or the supplemental The Essential Atlas Online Companion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
