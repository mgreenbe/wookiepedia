It was stationed aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer that served as Jedi General Adi Gallia's flagship. In the year 20 BBY, R5-L26 was among the non-essential personnel ordered to evacuate from the Star Destroyer when the vessel was crippled and boarded by Separatist forces under the command of General Grievous near the planet Patitite Pattuna. As the droid approached a BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber, it was bumped out of the way by fellow astromech R2-D2, who boarded the starfighter in R5-L26's stead and used it to escape the cruiser with his protocol droid counterpart C-3PO in cockpit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manufactured by Industrial Automaton, R5-L26 featured a tall, cone-shaped head typically found on R4 units.
