They were half a meter long and had knife-like teeth. Like garrals from Wayland, they were attracted by repulsorlift engines, that is why repulsorlift vehicles were banned everywhere around Vorrnti City, and facilities such as spaceports or junkyards were surrounded with high solid walls or thorn hedges, as scrap rats could gnaw landing gear or other equipment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
