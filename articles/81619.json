While on a quest to hunt the rogue Sith Darth Wredd, junk dealer Ania Solo and Imperial Knight Jao Assam discovered that another rogue Sith Darth Luft and his pirate associates had started a slaving ring operating in the Mon Calamari Shipyards above the planet Dac, which had been rendered lifeless during the Second Imperial Civil War. Jao Assam informed his superior Yalta Val, who convinced the Galactic Federation Triumvirate Admiral Gar Stazi to liberate the Mon Calamari and Quarren slaves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A joint Galactic Alliance Navy and Imperial Knight force was dispatched to assault the Mon Calamari shipyards. During the fighting, the Galactic Alliance Navy used the tanker Trand Cappa to flood the shipyards, neutralizing the pirates. Imperial Knights and seatroopers then liberated the shipyards and apprehended the pirates. Ania Solo and her companions also succeeded in closing space doors to the shipyards, saving many Mon Calamari and Quarren slaves. Jao Assam also dueled and killed Darth Luft. Following the battle, the liberated Mon Calamari and Quarren slaves settled in the flooded shipyards. However, Jao and Ania quickly discovered that they had merely played into Darth Wredd's hands by eliminating Darth Luft. This brought Darth Wredd closer to his goal of destroying the One Sith and reinstating the Rule of Two."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Background"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Genocide on Dac in 137 ABY, the One Sith scientist Vul Isen unleashed a deadly viral spore which poisoned the planet Dac's oceans, killing billions of its inhabitants within weeks. The Galactic Alliance and the Fel Empire succeeded in evacuating millions of Mon Calamari, Quarren, and Whaladons but the planet was rendered lifeless. The poisoning of Dac created a large outflow of Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees into many neighboring worlds and systems. Following the defeat of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, the new Galactic Federation Triumvirate helped resettle many of the displaced Quarren and Mon Calamari refugees."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Dac Genocide, the Calamari system became a haunt for criminal elements. In 138 ABY, an enterprising Sith Lord named Darth Luft and his pirate associates started a ship-building operation in the abandoned Mon Calamari Shipyards. To recruit forced labor for their shipyards, Darth Luft and his pirate associates sent news out to the refugee communities of a project to renew Dac. Many Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees fell victim to this scam. Once aboard the Mon Calamari Shipyards, the adults were forced to work as shipbuilders for the pirate fleet. To ensure cooperation and compliance, Luft and his pirates imprisoned their family members as hostages, threatening to throw them out through the airlock. The enslaved Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees were regularly beaten and maltreated by their captors."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rescuers"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Carreras Incident, the Imperial Knight Jao Assam received a Force vision that the rogue Sith Darth Wredd was planning to kill Galactic Empress Marasiah Fel. Together with the junk dealer Ania Solo and an Imperial comm droid, Jao embarked on a quest to hunt down and stop Darth Wredd. They managed to track his henchman Dieben to the planet Nalyd where they learnt that Dieben had been planning to rendezvous with \"some powerful friends\" in the Calamari system. Believing that Darth Wredd was in the Calamari system, Jao and Ania traveled there. Upon arriving, they discovered that Darth Luft had established a slaving operation in the Mon Calamari Shipyards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jao and Ania managed to make contact with the enslaved Mon Calamari environmental engineer Luen and Tikin and discovered the full extent of Darth Luft's pirate operation. Jao managed to used his Imperial comm droid to send a distress signal to Jao's mentor Yalta Val in Coruscant, who was the master of the Imperial Knights training facility. Jao and Ania and their guides were discovered by Darth Luft and his pirates and then thrown into an escape pod, which was then jettisoned into the poisoned oceans of Dac. Fortunately, Jao and Ania were plucked from Dac's oceans by their companions: the Mon Calamari engineer Sauk and the assassin droid AG-37. Following their rescue, Jao wanted to go and confront Darth Luft in the hope of finding Darth Wredd. However, Ania, Sauk, and AG-37 disagreed and wanted to return to AG-37's freighter and wait for reinforcements. Meanwhile, Tikin refused to endanger his young son Tilin and returned to the shipyards. Unable to resolve their differences, they parted company."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Yalta Val received word of the pirates' slaving operation in the Calamari system. He attempted to convince the Galactic Triumvirate leadership to intervene but was rebuffed by Empress Fel, who refused to take Jao Assam seriously since she regarded him as a deserter. However, Admiral Gar Stazi was troubled by the plight of the Mon Calamari and Quarren slaves and raised his concerns with Yalta. In the end, the two men agreed to assemble a force to deal with the pirates and to free the slaves. Stazi and Yalta mustered a fleet of warships, Imperial Knights, and seatroopers. Back at the Mon Calamari Shipyards, Tikin informed Luft about the presence of the intruders in the hope that the Sith Lord would release his son. However, Luft killed Tikin and threw his body down into the shipyard. Unfortunately, Luft's actions sparked a slave revolt and the slaves attacked their captors. The Mon Calamari and Quarren slaves were reinvigorated by the arrival of the Imperial Knight Jao Assam."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unable to resolve their differences with Jao and Tikin, Ania along with Luen, AG-37, and Sauk had left the hangar bay but were pursued by pirate starfighters and pirate droids. However, their pursuers were destroyed by a Galactic Triumvirate task force that had exited hyperspace. Under Admiral Stazi's orders, the tanker Trand Cappa docked with the shipyard's ring and unleashed a torrent of flood water that swept through the shipyards. The deluge overwhelmed the pirates and enabled the Mon Calamari and Quarren slaves to gain the upper hand over their captors. The Imperial Knight Yalta Val then led a boarding party of Imperial Knights and seatroopers who apprehended the pirates. Meanwhile, the Imperial Knight Jao engaged in a lightsaber duel with Darth Luft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unwilling to concede defeat, the pirates opened the detention blocks holding the Mon Calamari and Quarren dependents and elderly to zero gravity space. However, an ice plume was created by the reaction of water meeting zero gravity, temporarily blocking the exits. Ania and her crew took advantage of that small window of opportunity to send the Imperial comm droid to rig the controls and shut the doors. Through their efforts, Ania's crew were able to save the lives of many Mon Calamari and Quarren children and elderly. Meanwhile, Darth Luft managed to use the Force to push Jao under a heavy piece of wreckage. Luft was then set upon by two Imperial Knight cadets who attempted to fight him. However, Jao managed to break free of the wreckage and use the force to impale the rogue Sith with his lightsaber, killing Darth Luft."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the liberation of the Mon Calamari shipyards, Yalta Val's stormtroopers loaded the pirates onto a ship. Meanwhile, the surviving Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees settled in the flooded compartments of the Mon Calamari shipyards. Out of kindness, Aunt Luen adopted Tikin's young son Tilin. Luen attempted to encourage Ania's Mon Calamari crew mate Sauk to stay but the latter declined since he preferred the company of his friends. There were also reports that a number of Whaladons were planning to settle in the flooded shipyards. Jao Assam also had a brief reunion with his mentor Yalta Val, who attempted to persuade the younger Knight to return to his post. However, Jao was committed to finding Darth Wredd. Despite their differences, the two men departed on good terms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Jao and Ania's crew departed on AG-37's freighter. While traveling through hyperspace, Jao received a hologram recording from none other than his quarry Darth Wredd. Wredd revealed that he had deliberately led them on a trail through the galaxy. By killing Darth Luft, Jao had helped Wredd progress his plan to destroy the One Sith and to restore the Rule of Two. Wredd also attempted to tempt Jao with an offer of a place in his new Sith Order. While Jao was despondent at learning that he had inadvertently helped Wredd to advance his goals, Ania assured him that they had liberated the Mon Calamari Shipyards and saved the lives of many Mon Calamari and Quarren. If they could do this, she reasoned that they were up to the task of taking down an \"arrogant\" Sith like Wredd."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
