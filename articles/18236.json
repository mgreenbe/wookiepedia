The blorps owners did not appreciate it being friendly with other patrons of the castle and repeatedly beat it, until trying using electricity to discourage the blorp from making further contact with the world outside its box. The electricity put the creature into a frenzy and it busted out of its cage, growing much larger in size and swallowing its keepers. The blorp then became a problem for everyone else as well, as it threatened ravaging through the castle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
