The appearance of the Glory in a battle after Zaarin turned traitor was much like the rogue admiral's personal calling card\u2014it indicated that he took an active interest in the battle himself, and would usually withdraw before being heavily engaged. The Glory's few appearances in battle including the attempted capture of the Emperor, where it suffered significant damage from loyalist forces led by Maarek Stele, and supervising the destruction of the TIE Defender research facility in the Parmel system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While in the Outer Rim, Zaarin was able to keep his rival, then, Admiral Thrawn, stalemated and his flagship unscathed for months. This was made further difficult because Zaarin used other smaller vessels or sent hyperdrive-capable starfighters to make attacks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn, realizing that he had to play a different game if he was going to force Zaarin to blink, played on his enemy's undue reliance on technology. Thrawn developed a new starfighter called the Missile Boat, not only to combat Zaarin's TIE Defenders but to police an attempt to proliferate them by Nami Pirates lead by Crime Lord Ali Tarrak. When the Missile Boat proved to be an effective trump card, Thrawn dangled his project by producing convoys containing the fighters to lure Zaarin into a trap with them. After the first attempt at Serenity failed because the convoy was a decoy, Thrawn decided to use a real convoy to lure Zaarin out. But Thrawn underestimated Zaarin, who ambushed his most important component of the trap, the Interdictor Whirlwind. Although the Whirlwind was saved by Maarek Stele in a Missile Boat, the cruiser was damaged and hopelessly behind schedule, and Zaarin sent a strike force earlier then predicted. Stele was once again able to protect the missile convoy from Zaarin who came in the Glory to try and capture the shipment with a Nebulon-B frigate Thinin and Carrack-class light cruiser Yaai. However the attempt was unsuccessful and only the Glory escaped harm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon afterwards Zaarin learnt that the Vorknkx Project, which was to create a cloaking device on ships and had currently managed to cloak a Corellian corvette of the same name and sent a strike force to attack and secure the project. When that failed, Thrawn knew that the project test bed could be used as bait to lure him out again. The plan worked and Zaarin brought the Glory into harm's way in order to retrieve the prototype technology from To-phalion Base, an exhausted Asteroid Hanger. Though he was initially successful in capturing the project's corvette, Thrawn was able to follow him into hyperspace due to a tracking device in the corvette. As the loyalist Imperials came with much greater forces, including the Interdictor Corvus, the Glory was destroyed under heavy fire. Zaarin escaped in the corvette Vorknkx but he was unaware of the device's unstability when the device is used in conjunction with hyperdrive engines and thus the corvette exploded when he activated it while entering hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
