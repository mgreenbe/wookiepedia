At some point, Jedi recovered one of their own holocrons which carried historical information on the Sith Empire-aligned House of Thul's past crimes and cruel acts. Eventually, one Imperial individual managed to retrieve it back, before the Jedi could release the holocron's contents to the public, and delievered it to Lord Urduun. Urduun quickly examined the holocron and stated that it was an old holocron, predating House Thul's exile from Alderaan, and that its gatekeeper was still intact. Ultimately, he declared that all its information and secrets belonged to the Empire and rewarded the Imperial individual who had retrieved it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
