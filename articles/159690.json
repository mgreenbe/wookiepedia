In the year 3643 BBY, Vastil joined the Espelar branch of the Citizens' Militia, the regional militia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after Vastil joined the militia, a Republic-allied individual was sent by the former Jedi Galen Besk to stop Imperial saboteurs from destroying Espelar's trading post. The individual defeated the saboteurs and traveled to Espelar itself, where they spoke with Mayor Airen. Airen asked them to talk to Junter Galt, the head of the Espelar branch of the militia, and the individual offered to help train the new recruits. The individual led Vastil and two other recruits into the Wastes, where they fought the native Tusken Raiders to increase the recruits' combat skills."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the group returned to Espelar, they received a distress call from Cole Darba. A member of the militia, Darba and his men had been stationed at Manister Base to the south, which had been overrun by a hive of Geonosians from the nearby planet Geonosis. The individual led Vastil and the others to Manister, where they found Darba and his men holed up in one of the base's buildings. Many of Darba's forces were injured, and Darba didn't believe that they would be able to withstand another assault. When the individual told Darba that they would push back the Geonosians while the militiamen fled to Outpost Largona to the south, Vastil thought that he and his men should stay behind and help. However, the individual knew that Vastil was still inexperienced, and that he would likely die in the attack, so they refused to let the recruit help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the individual drove back the Geonosians from around the building and recovered what was left of the base's supplies, Vastil and Darba led the remaining militia to Outpost Largona. The group headed to the settlement's medcenter, where the injured were treated by the Bith Doctor Aidarro. Later, the individual would arrive at Largona to check up on Vastil and his men, who informed the individual that the group had made it out safely, and that the militia would head back to Espelar as soon as possible. Vastil also told them that thanks to the individual's training and efforts, Vastil was to be fully initiated into the Anchorhead militia. That was a choice of which the individual approved, and told Vastil to continue the work that he had been doing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A fair-skinned male Human with blond hair and blue eyes, Vastil joined the Anchorhead militia to protect his family and fellow settlers.
