In addition to standard refueling and repair facilities, the station boasted a drydock, a rarity in the Outer Rim at the time. Prior to the establishment of the station at Heriston, Imperial vessels operating in the area were often forced to travel closer to the Core if they required the services of a drydock. Two sectors over, the Imperial station located at Eriadu offered comparable facilities, but was rarely a viable option, as it was often fully engaged in maintaining the Seswenna sector's defense fleet. The station at Heriston was well-protected by a number of space platforms, as well as multiple starfighter wings and system patrol craft. At one point during the time between the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Hoth, the Star Destroyer Adversary underwent routine maintenance and repairs there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
