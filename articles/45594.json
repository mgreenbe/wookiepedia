It allowed him to use the dark side of the Force to focus his anger to survive injures that would normally kill him. Sion used the power on numerous occasions, which left his body in a heavily scarred state. Sion was only defeated when a Jedi known as the Exile eroded the Sith Lord's will and convinced him to succumb to death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
