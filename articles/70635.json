Coming from a well-to-do family, Jerjerrod was an ally of Republic Supreme Chancellor Palpatine; this association provided the Admiral's family with many connections. Jerjerrod filed multiple reports with Naval Command that cited his concerns with the Navy's procurement procedures of the time; when the contents of these documents were leaked to the media, the Admiral was summoned to testify before the Senate Naval Subcommittee's Procurement Panel.

The Admiral filed several reports regarding the matter with his superiors and colleagues within Naval Command; many of his reports were subsequently leaked to the media.

V'troren was not convinced, believing the Admiral to be the only one with the motivation required to release the reports to the media.
