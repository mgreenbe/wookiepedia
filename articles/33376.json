He was very idealistic, joining the Rebel Alliance in order to bring back the Republic and end the Galactic Empire. He was a member of Rogue Squadron, befriending Thane Kyrell shortly before the Battle of Hoth. Before the battle, he was very excited to work with Luke Skywalker, the hero he had heard so much about. He served as Skywalker's gunner and died in the battle. Shortly after his death, their snowspeeder was shot down and crash landed in front of an AT-AT. Skywalker escaped the wreckage as the walker's foot stomped on the speeder, crushing Ralter's corpse inside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dak Ralter first appeared in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, which was released in North America in 1980.
