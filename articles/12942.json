Similarly, it does not indicate whether Warren was married to either woman when the children were born. With no birth dates listed for the hybrid children, the source also leaves ambiguous the era in which each woman lived and coupled with Warren, whether during the latter years of the Galactic Republic, during the Galactic Civil War, or both."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
