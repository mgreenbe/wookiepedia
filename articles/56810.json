It started at the Rynmar system then went through the Zalori system, the Terephon system, the Reboam system, the Dreena system, the Calfa system, and the K'Farri system. From the K'Farri system it continued through the Nantuker system, the Stalsinek system, the Jodaka system, and the Divora system. The hyperspace lane finally ended after going through the Wodan system, a junction off to the Algnadesh system and one last jump to the Relephon system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
