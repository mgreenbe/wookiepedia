When Biala protested, Darth Wredd intimidated her by threatening to bring the power of the new Galactic Federation Triumvirate down on her and told her to focus on fixing the G51 communications array. Construction on the Carreras communications array was slow due to problems with the field generators. Impatient at the slow progress, Darth Wredd almost strangled one of Biala's Shifala subordinates.

As Governor, Biala commanded all of the security forces within that star system. In 138 ABY, Galactic Empress Marasiah Fel embarked on an ambitious project to construct the G51 communications array, a communications network which would improve communications throughout the Outer Rim Territories. The Carreras system was designated as the farthest outpost of this communication and a communications array was established in the system.

While traveling through the Surd Nebula, Val's starship became stranded on the mysterious floating world of Mala. There, all of the Imperial crew and passengers with the exception of Val were killed by an unidentified Sith master and his apprentice Darth Wredd, members of the One Sith order which had been driven underground following the death of Darth Krayt. After killing his own master, Darth Wredd took Yalta Val captive and impersonated him, stealing his armor and forcing the captive Knight to wear a helmet, that was designed to drive its users to the dark side of the Force. However, Wredd was unable to recover the Knight's lightsaber which drifted through space until it was recovered by a Mon Calamari engineer named Sauk and his Human friend Ania Solo, who operated a junk yard on Carreras Major."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As planned, Darth Wredd's escape pod was picked up by the Carreras security forces and brought to the Carreras communications array. As the commanding officer of the station, Biala was tasked with the responsibility of greeting the Triumvirate emissary. While Biala was aware of the difficulty with interstellar travel through the Surd Nebula, she was surprised that the Imperial Knight's starship had crashed. Seeking to make amends for the Imperial Knight's difficult travel experience, she ordered her men to show the Knight every courtesy, stressing that they had to rectify the situation before the communications relay went life. During their first encounter, the false \"Yalta Val\" requested a private meeting with Governor Biala at her office.

Biala attempted to disagree but was interjected by the Sith impostor, who went on to claim that the Sith had attacked his ship and murdered his entire crew.

Biala suggested contacting the Triumvirate authorities on Coruscant to request for more reinforcements including Jedi to deal with the Sith threat. However, the Sith impostor claimed that there was not enough time and that they would not be able to contact Coruscant until the array was functional. He claimed that the Triumvirate would not arrive in time to deal with the Sith threat. Biala disagreed and replied that they had to try to keep the communications array."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before she could continue, she was interjected by Darth Wredd who insisted that as an Imperial Knight, he was more than equal to the job of hunting down the Sith.

Without allowing Biala to give a response, Darth Wredd then demanded that she cede him personal control over all of her security forces. He claimed that no one else but him was equipped to deal with the Sith threat. Biala reluctantly complied with the false \"Yalta Val's\" demands, not wishing to create trouble with Coruscant. While the Sith impostor had his back turned to Biala, his eyes began to glow yellow and red, revealing his dark side affiliation.

When Biala angrily confronted the false \"Yalta Val\", he criticized her for her lack of concern at the Sith presence in the system. The impostor then added that the Sith could be anywhere in the system and insinuated that Biala was to blame for the failure of her security forces to catch Ania, whom he dismissed as a mere \"girl with a lightsaber\".

Despite some misgivings, the engineers reluctantly activated the primary power. Since the communication array's systems had not yet been fully fixed, the internal engine systems overloaded.
