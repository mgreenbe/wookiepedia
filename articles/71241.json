Her mother went by the name of Ryoo, after a flower that grew in the vicinity of the city of Keren, but her father's identity was forgotten in the passage of time. On her bountiful homeworld, the young Jobal began with a secure and happy childhood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When she became a young adult, Jobal met Ruwee Naberrie, a teenaged member of the Refugee Relief Movement, a non-profit resettlement agency. Impressed by Naberrie's social acumen, Jobal fell in love with him shortly after they met. Unbeknownst to the young woman, her mother and Ruwee Naberrie's mother Winama knew each other well and had been plotting for an arranged marriage between their offsprings. The two mothers were genuinely surprised when they learned that Jobal and Ruwee had actually fallen in love."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After their marriage in 51 BBY, Ruwee and Jobal Naberrie played an instrumental role in the founding of a new village in the mountains close to Theed, the capital of Naboo.

Her way of life instilled very strong compassion and selflessness into their children, which was obvious from Padm\u00e9's career."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 33 BBY, Jobal, along with her husband who was the President of the Refugee Relief Movement at the time, had the surprising visit of Senator Palpatine at the RRM's Coruscant headquarters. Palpatine had come to try and convince the Naberries to have Padm\u00e9 run for the throne. Ruwee and Jobal were pretty hesitant at first, not wanting their just-turned-thirteen-year-old daughter to go through all of this and lose."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being Princess of Theed for two years, Padm\u00e9 was elected Queen of Naboo with a landslide victory.
