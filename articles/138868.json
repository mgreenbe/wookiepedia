Working under an Imperial major, he assisted the major in interrogating Santo, an Imperial informant on the rebel elements located in the sub-facility. When Luke Skywalker, disguised as an Imperial colonel attempted to commandeer TX-567's repulsorcraft, the trooper refused his request, due to the needs of the sub-facility task force having precedence over mainline troops."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TX-567 was created by Troy Denning and appeared in one of the role-playing strands of the 1990 West End Games role-playing supplement Jedi's Honor. The fate of TX-567 is up to the reader, who can choose to force TX-567 to turn the repulsorcraft\nover to Skywalker. If this occurs, TX-567 and the Imperial major are killed by Skywalker with his lightsaber and then hidden in an access panel to keep from arousing suspicion. If Skywalker listens to TX-567 and decides not to commandeer his vehicle, the stormtrooper and his comrades continue their duty and are not encountered again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
