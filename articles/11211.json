However, he did not anticipate the Galactic Alliance's support of the Imperials, and thus lost the Battle of Borosk.

This surprise, as well as Pellaeon's taunting, made Vorrik distracted enough during the Battle of Esfandia to become susceptible to the proposal of the Jedi Tahiri Veila, who suggested that he send a portion of his forces down to the planet itself while the battle was still continuing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon was able to destroy the divided Yuuzhan Vong forces easily, and enraged, Vorrik attempted to ram Pellaeon's ship, the Right to Rule, with his own command ship. However, the Imperial fleet destroyed Vorrik's ship well before he reached his target, killing him and everyone else on board. Shortly thereafter, the rest of his fleet met the same fate.
