This distinctive hull, combined with the long, electromotive tentacles that flowed from the back of the vehicle and spun for propulsion, gave the bongo an appearance that resembled that of an exotic squid. The hull was also heavily armored against potential attack by dangerous sea creatures found in Naboo's oceans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bongo submarines also possessed long, twisting, tentacle-like turbines which gave the vessel an unusually high speed. The vehicle was also equipped with a number of hydrostatic bubble shields which kept the cockpit and cargo areas dry and filled with air. These shields could be switched on and off to allow access to the vehicle. Bongos apparently have no limit to the maximum depth achievable by one, as they can always withstand the crushing depths of the waterways of Naboo. Despite this, they're usually found to travel at a standard depth of 500 meters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A forward driving plane also jutted from the front of the cockpit module.

However, upon moving underwater, they learned of the mysterious deep-water plant species known as the Locap that took plasma from rocks it burrowed into. Using special harvesting bongos with a front-mounted siphon, the Gungans could then extract plasma from a Locap plant. Even though harvesting the plasma was a dangerous task, the plasma could be extracted and then be put to use in the underwater civilization they would come to develop."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Invasion of Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Gungan bongo submarine was used in 32 BBY by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Gungan Jar Jar Binks during the early stages of the Invasion of Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn and Kenobi, having failed in their attempt to negotiate with the Trade Federation regarding the blockade of Naboo, land on the planet to find an invasion already in progress.
