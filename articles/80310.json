The corvette attempted to break through the Imperial blockade on Edan II, but was crippled, crashing onto the planet's surface with the loss of all hands. The wreckage of the ship slid precariously close to the edge of a plateau, perched directly above a ravine. The ship was discovered by a small group of Rebels, who salvaged what was left of the corvette's supplies. The Dark Jedi Teles Jalahafi later ambushed the Rebels inside the ship, and the ensuing battle sent the wrecked hull into the ravine, killing Jalahafi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
