However while Tomaas Azzameen, piloting the Vasudra, was delivering bacta to the Rebels, The Star Destroyer Corrupter and a pair of Lancer-class frigates, Cascade and Blue Hawk, dropped out of hyperspace and began a TIE Bomber bombardment of the hospital. Shadow then joined in the hasty defense of the station and engaged the Corrupter, helping to buy time for at least two-thirds of the station's personnel and patients to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shadow's fate is unclear, as it is possible for the vessel to escape, or be destroyed, depending on a number of situations made possible by random events in X-wing Alliance's AI, as well as the actions of the player.
