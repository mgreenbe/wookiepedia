The guid's massive frame was supported by their muscular arms and smaller hind legs, supporting their weight on their knuckles as they walked. Dominating the mountainsides of their homeworld as they grazed on the grassy open spaces, the guid's only natural predator were the primitive sentients known as Flesh Raiders. All other predators on the planet, including the manka cat and horranth, were not intelligent enough to pose a threat to the massive beasts and their strong arms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3640 BBY guids could also be found on the ice planet Ilum."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
