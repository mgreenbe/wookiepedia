She served aboard the Consonance, a Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvette that participated in the Battle of Scarif in 0 BBY. In the battle, Buscon's duty was to monitor transmissions between the ships of the Alliance Fleet. However, due to the Imperial Shield Gate that covered Scarif in an impenetrable deflector shield, rebel communication between the planet's surface and the orbiting Fleet was impossible. During this time, Buscon eavesdropped on Imperial communications that she was able to pick up, some of which were the final transmissions made before the Death Star destroyed the Imperial security complex on Scarif. The Consonance was one of the few ships in the Alliance Fleet to escape unscathed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
