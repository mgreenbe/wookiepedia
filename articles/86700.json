However, he was eventually arrested on the planet Sacorria on charges of petty theft, and he was incarcerated in the Dorthus Tal Prison. In a bid to escape, Korrin managed to smuggle out the prison a message that he hoped would make it into the hands of sympathizers of the Rebel Alliance and persuade them to come and rescue him. Unknown to Korrin, the prison's warden, Kedar Blackgate, detected the message but permitted it to be delivered, so that any attempt to free Korrin could serve as a test of the prison's security."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
