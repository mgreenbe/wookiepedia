Publicly, the Foundation aimed to emancipate droids and grant them the same rights as sentient beings, viewing restraining bolts as a symbol of droid oppression. However, in reality, the Foundation wanted to turn public opinion against droids, and it increased fear and suspicion of droids by highlighting droid rebellions. At some point after the Clone Wars, the replica droid Jolor Oron became the leader of the Droid Equality Foundation, and he planned to use the organization to destroy all of the droids in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
