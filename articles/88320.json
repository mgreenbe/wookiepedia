It was made of gold and attached to a brown ribbon, as it was designed to be draped over the head and worn around the neck. It was presented to members of the Alliance who had displayed a great feat of bravery in battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 ABY, for their efforts in destroying the Death Star, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo were awarded this honorable medal during the Royal Award Ceremony. At first, Solo was reluctant to accept the award, arguing that the ones who deserved medals were the ones who didn't make it back. Princess Leia Organa, who was asked to preside over the ceremony, was very moved by the Corellian smuggler's words, and she spoke to him as a comrade, prompting Solo to accept the award."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The medal presentation ceremony was held in the Grand Audience Chamber, the topmost room of the Great Temple, a huge ziggurat that hosted the Rebellion's primary base on the moon of Yavin 4. Chewbacca, who was Solo's best friend and copilot, did not receive a medal during the official ceremony, as Wookiees do not place any meaning in such tangible awards. However, at the request of Solo, Chewbacca was presented with his own medal in private, during the feast that followed the ceremony. Princess Leia, who was too short to put it over the Wookiee's neck, stood on a table to award this final medal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after Arvel Crynyd's death in 4 ABY, which led to the destruction of the Star Dreadnought Executor, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Bravery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Medal of Bravery first appeared during the triumphal end sequence of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope in 1977.

In an interview recorded shortly after the release of A New Hope, George Lucas explained that Wookiees do not care for medals. However, a large contingent of Alliance officers were sent to the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk for a memorable celebration. Despite this, however, he later claimed in an interview with the Official Star Wars Fan Club that Chewbacca did claim a medal, but not during the formal ceremony because Leia was too short."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the early comic book The Day after the Death Star!, Chewbacca did receive a medal, but not at the same time as Solo and Skywalker.
