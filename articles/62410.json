Aucellis Park was secretly an Imperial re-education facility that used the drug pleaz-mo to influence the minds of visitors and after a shipment of the drugs went missing while en-route to Aucellis Park, Grym hired the smuggler Balthazar Sim to cover up all evidence of the missing drugs, to prevent them from being linked with Aucellis Park and causing the Imperial re-education center to be exposed. Sim carried out the assignment and traveled to the park, to meet with Grym. However, Evin Telbre, a businessman who had a score to settle with Sim, tracked the smuggler to Aucellis Park and dispatched a team of agents to track Sim down. The agents confronted Grym and Sim inside the park's re-education center and subsequently engaged the pair in combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
