By engaging the cutout, a starship operator could temporarily deactivate the ship's weapons. This might be done for several reasons: as terms of surrender after a battle, as compliance with safety procedures, or as a condition to gain permission to enter systems or planet where starship weapons were forbidden, such as Alderaan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ugors of the Paradise system personally engaged the override cutouts of any foreign ship to visit their territory. The Ugor customs inspector placed a customs seal over the cutouts to prevent them from being disabled without permission. According to Ugorian law, trying to deactivate these seals was punishable with death. The seals themselves were programmed to explode should they be tampered with."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
