He brought it to Akiva for the meeting of the Imperial Future Council, and when the New Republic found the fleet in space above the system, fought in the Rebellion on Akiva. It was the only Imperial Star Destroyer to survive the battle of three; the two lost were the Ascent and the Vigilance. As her ship the Vigilance was destroyed, Admiral Rae Sloane and Morna Kee escaped to the Vanquish in a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, quickly taking the Star Destroyer to hyperspace and abandoning the battle. She then rendezvoused with Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax in the Vulpinus Nebula."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
