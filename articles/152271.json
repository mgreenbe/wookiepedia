At this time, Tapal conducted some Jedi training with Kestis, and one exercise consisted of the Clone Commander firing his weapon at Kestis so that Kestis could deflect the harmless blaster bolts, although he surprised him with the timing. After Kestis finished the exercise and met with Tapal and the Commander in the training room's observation platform, Tapal informed Kestis that they were going to be relocating to Mygeeto and participate in the battle there."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Order 66"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, Tapal sensed a disturbance in the Force as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic Sheev Palpatine, secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, relayed Order 66, turning the clones against the now treasonous Jedi Order. The Clone Commander received a hologram transmission from Palpatine on his holoprojector, and after acknowledging the order, raised his blaster upon Tapal. Reacting to the threat, Tapal deflected the bolt and sliced across the Commander's chest, killing him. Kestis, in a state of confusion, asked why the Commander attempted to kill them, to which Tapal responded that there were no answers to his questions and instructed him on how to escape, with a skirmish erupting on the Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of Jango Fett, the Clone Commander was a human male who stood at 1.83 meters and had brown eyes and tan skin.

When Order 66 was enabled, the Clone Commander did not disobey the command, although this was not his fault, as activating his Inhibitor-chip made it virtually impossible to defy Palpatine's order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone trooper officer, the Clone Commander was trained in combat and leadership."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The commander wore standard Phase II clone trooper armor with markings similar to the military unit led by Jedi General Chiata.
