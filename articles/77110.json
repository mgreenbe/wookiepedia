The valley was set between two cliffs and filled with abundant forest land, with a bridge that connected one side to the other. More than two hundred years before the onset of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Polvin Kut was killed on the bridge overlooking the Koban Gorge by Advozse warriors rallied under the banner of the warlord Tulak. A century later, the native Koban people reconstructed the bridge and through it memorialized Kut, whose likeness was carved into the structure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
