Not designed for subtlety, these weapons were mainly used as a frontline weapon due to their very high firing rate combined with the firepower typical of all Mandalorian weapons. It is also known that Canderous Ordo wielded a personal heavy repeater which he had heavily customized to increase the firepower, the accuracy and the rate of fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
