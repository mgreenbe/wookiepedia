As a submersible, it outclassed most military submarines, and could withstand high pressures, allowing it to dive to great depths. Alternately, a pair of retractable walker legs could be used to propel the craft through shallow water or over land as needed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although a military submarine by design, the Crestrunner was primarily used as an operations vehicle during the clean up efforts after the Battle of Calamari. When entering a battle, the L9 could carry more than 38 passengers, its crew included, along with a one ton cargo capacity; the vessel was fully armed with ten torpedoes and four fire-linked blaster cannons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
