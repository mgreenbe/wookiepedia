It was considered Makem Te's most famous feature, and was included in the list of the Twenty Wonders of the Galaxy by the historian Vicendi in his 10,000 BBY publication Arturum Galactinum. Originally, the Tract, made of polished stone bases, was mistaken for an ice cap covering 10% of the planet's surface during the first orbital survey.
