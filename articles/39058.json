It produced small flowers that were sensitive to touch. When disturbed, the dola's flowers withdrew into thin shoots; however, if tenderly coaxed out, the flowers could be harvested for the thick juice they exuded. The Aruzans then processed the juice into a fluid used as an antibiotic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
