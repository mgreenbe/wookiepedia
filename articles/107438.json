Seeking to overthrow Duchess Satine Kryze and her pacifistic New Mandalorian government, in order to restore Mandalore to its widespread warrior ways, Vizsla secretly allied himself with Count Dooku and his Confederacy of Independent Systems. While governing Mandalore's moon, Concordia, and maintaining loyalty to Kryze in public, Vizsla led the Death Watch in secret from several Concordian mining camp bases. The Death Watch's terrorist attacks on Mandalore came to a head when Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived on Concordia with Kryze to follow leads on the Death Watch. When Kenobi discovered the Death Watch's secret base, Vizsla confronted them with several warriors and revealed himself as the renegades' leader. After engaging Kenobi in a short duel, Vizsla forced him and Kryze to flee Concordia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vizsla conspired with Mandalorian Senator Tal Merrik to capture Kryze during her journey to Coruscant, where she intended to plead her case directly to the Galactic Senate, but Merrik was defeated before he could complete his assignment. Amassing an army of Death Watch troops on Concordia in preparation to take over Mandalore, Vizsla was forced to wait until his and Dooku's plot to turn Mandalore against the Republic was completed. Vizsla dispatched a Death Watch assassin to Coruscant to kill Kryze, as her death would remove the opposition to the Senate's upcoming vote to have Republic troops occupy Mandalore\u2014an occupation which would allow the Death Watch to gain the support of Mandalore populace and \"liberate\" them from the Republic. However, the assassin failed to murder Kryze, and the plot itself fell through, with the Senate voting against occupying Mandalore. With this turn of events, Vizsla was forced to postpone his attack on Mandalore, as his forces would be unable to hold the planet without its people's support."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Vizsla and his soldiers came across an escape pod lost in deep space which held the stranded Sith Lords Darth Maul and his brother Savage Opress. Harboring a common hatred of Obi-Wan Kenobi for his actions against them, they planned on having their revenge after their planned conquest of Mandalore. Gathering an army of criminals including the Hutts, the Pykes, and the Black Sun, Vizsla and Maul attacked Sundari, allowing Death Watch to act as heroes to a desperate population after the Duchess's forces failed to stop the criminals. With the support of the Mandalorian people, Vizsla ousted Satine and appointed himself Prime Minister and claimed the ancient title of Mand'alor. He also betrayed his Sith allies who were imprisoned but who managed to escape. Maul challenged Vizsla to a duel to determine the true ruler of the Mandalorians.

By around 22 BBY, Vizsla had become the leader of the Death Watch splinter group in opposition to the pacifist Duchess Satine Kryze and her peaceful New Mandalorian organization's political dominance on Mandalore, a government that Vizsla believed dishonored the Mandalorians' generations-old warrior traditions. While secretly leading the Death Watch, Vizsla publicly supported Kryze, seemingly renouncing his clan connections, and became one of her trusted allies.

Many Jedi subsequently died to its blade. Vizsla desired to reignite the feud between the Jedi and the Mandalorians, as the two factions had previously been enemies. In order to overthrow Duchess Kryze and her New Mandalorians, Vizsla sought the allegiance of Count Dooku and his Confederacy of Independent Systems, which promised their support to Vizsla in his fight to undermine Kryze's rule and take over Mandalore. The Death Watch began to engage in acts of terrorism on Mandalore in the New Mandalorian capital city, Sundari, and on the neighboring world of Kalevala to undermine Kryze's rule and breed discord among the people.

Learning of Kenobi's presence on Mandalore, Vizsla holographically contacted Count Dooku from the Death Watch's secret Concordian military camp, perturbed by Kenobi's presence. Vizsla initially could not understand Dooku's apparent unconcern with the Jedi Master's arrival, reminding Dooku of his promise to help overthrow Kryze and her government and stating that if the Republic intervened now, the Death Watch would be unable to take over Mandalore. Dooku himself advised patience, proclaiming that the Republic's continued involvement in Mandalorian affairs, combined with the Senate's impending order to send troops to keep the peace on Mandalore, would spread discontent amongst the Mandalore populace, causing them to rebel. Vizsla then realized Dooku's plan was to set up Death Watch's role as the people's liberator, and strengthen the renegade faction's insurgency."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Governor Vizsla and several of his guards greeted Kenobi and Kryze in the hangar of a Concordian governmental complex when the two came to Concordia in a Mandalorian shuttle to deliver the dead body of the instigator behind a Death Watch bombing of Sundari's memorial shrine. After being introduced to Kenobi, Vizsla attempted to refute the rumors of Kryze's alliance with the Separatists, to which Kenobi replied that his only instructions were to \"seek the truth.\" Vizsla then took possession of the bomber's remains, who himself had chosen to die instead of being captured, and left with his men to attend to it. Later, while Vizsla was writing a condolence letter to the man's family on his datapad in his residence on Concordia and making arrangements for the body to be retrieved, he was joined by Kryze, who stated that Kenobi would be present shortly, as he needed to meditate. Over refreshments, Kryze shared her concerns that someone was feeding misinformation to the Republic that the Death Watch was taking over Mandalore and suspected that an external force was assisting the Mandalorian renegades. Vizsla himself speculated that the party would have to be very influential in the Separatist Alliance and mused that Kryze herself was being targeted for her role as leader of the Council of Neutral Systems, which directly conflicted with the Separatists' conquest of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As time passed, Vizsla noticed that General Kenobi's meditation was taking longer than he had expected and suggested that they should begin dinner without him, but Kryze\u2014who had, in fact, been secretly contacted by Kenobi, whose investigations had led him to be captured by the Death Watch\u2014excused herself from the governor's company. Kryze stated that she needed some fresh air and politely refused Vizsla's offer to escort her outside. Again assuming his position as the Death Watch's leader, Vizsla arrived in full Mandalorian armor at the mining base where Kenobi was being held. When Kenobi\u2014having been rescued by the Duchess\u2014and Kryze emerged from a mining shaft close to the camp where Vizsla and his men were waiting, the Death Watch immediately opened fire on the pair. Vizsla ordered three more of his men forward to stop Kenobi, and the trio activated their JT-12 jetpacks, flying toward the Jedi Master's position and focusing their fire on him. However, they were unable to complete their task and were stopped before they could cause the enemy pair any harm. Resolving to take care of the matter personally, Vizsla ordered the rest of his troops to evacuate Concordia. Once three of the Death Watch's Kom'rk-class transports had departed, Vizsla and several of his men advanced toward the outcrop where Kenobi and Kryze had taken refuge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As he approached, Vizsla shot one of his men that had been unable to stop Kenobi, disgusted by his subordinate's failure. Kenobi emerged from cover and Vizsla continued forward without his guards, removing his helmet and revealing his identity as the Death Watch's leader. Ignoring Kryze's shock at learning of her ally's betrayal, Vizsla addressed Kenobi, proclaiming that Kryze tarnished the very name Mandalorian with her peace-seeking government. Returning Kenobi's lightsaber, which his men had confiscated earlier during the Jedi's capture, Vizsla drew and activated the Darksaber. A lightsaber duel erupted, with both parties slashing at the other and dodging and blocking his opponent's attacks. Vizsla was twice forced back by Kenobi, first by a Force-push that hurled him backward several meters, then again by a kick that sent his weapon flying. Undeterred, Vizsla continued at Kenobi, using unarmed combat techniques to create a temporary gap in the fighting to retrieve his fallen lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This time, Vizsla used his jetpack to employ greater altitude as an advantage in the fight, but Kenobi simply jumped up and intercepted him in the air, battering him back down to the ground, where his jetpack and lightsaber deactivated. Getting back on his feet, Vizsla chose not to pursue Kenobi again and instead ordered his warriors to finish the Jedi Master themselves. The three Death Watch members each launched a missile from their rocket packs, and Kenobi and Kryze were forced to retreat, jumping back down into the mine shaft to avoid the explosives. The three warriors inspected the damage and inquired if they should pursue Kenobi; Vizsla ordered them not to, as there was no time, but noted that they would catch up with the Duchess soon enough."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After escaping Concordia, Kenobi and Kryze returned to Mandalore, from where they then departed for the Republic capital of Coruscant under Republic escort aboard Kryze's starship, the Coronet, so that Kryze could plead her case directly to the Galactic Senate. Vizsla schemed with Mandalorian Senator Tal Merrik, a Death Watch agent and one of the Coronet's passengers, to capture Kryze. Merrik eventually reported his success in taking Kryze hostage to Vizsla and requested reinforcements so that he could transport her away. Pleased with Merrik's exploits, Vizsla replied that additional forces had been dispatched to cover his escape. In the ensuing battle aboard the Coronet, however, Merrik was killed, stabbed in the back by Anakin Skywalker, one of Kryze's Jedi escorts. Kryze was able to safely reach Coruscant, leaving the Death Watch with another failed attempt on her life."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Preparations for battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the unsuccessful attacks on Kryze, Vizsla mobilized a Death Watch army at the Concordian base in preparation to take over Mandalore. The force was mainly comprised of Death Watch warriors but was also backed up by a number of Separatist Armored Assault Tanks. With his army in place, Vizsla used a comm station to contact Dooku, who was elsewhere in space with a Separatist fleet. Vizsla was impatient, as both he and his men were anxious to fight, but Dooku recalled the plot that they had set into motion of manipulating the Republic Senate into ordering an occupation of Mandalore\u2014which would subsequently cause Death Watch to appear as \"liberators\" when they struck back at the Republic occupation force and would thus gain Death Watch the people's support. Dooku ordered Vizsla to send a Death Watch assassin to Coruscant, as Kryze had to die if the Senate vote was to move forward and their plan was to succeed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After failing twice to kill Kryze, the assassin reported to Vizsla that he had killed an informant that appeared to have handed something off to her. Vizsla reiterated the need to find her, emphasizing that whatever Kryze was carrying might compromise the plan. Eventually, however, word reached Vizsla and his Death Watch army that the assassin had failed to kill Kryze and that the Senate had voted against sending an occupational force to Mandalore, nullifying the Death Watch's opportunity to gain the Mandalore populace's support during the invasion. Livid about having to postpone his attack, Vizsla angrily strode through his men\u2014who had been ordered to stand down and were rushing around the base\u2014to a comm station and contacted Dooku. Seething, Vizsla used the Count as a target for his frustration and stated his intention to continue with the invasion. Dooku advised against such a rash action\u2014despite the Death Watch's capability of conquering Mandalore, they would only be able to hold the planet for no more than a day if they did not have the people's support.

Vizsla managed to rile Dooku to the point of where the Sith Lord released his lightsaber and slashed Vizsla across his left cheek, leaving a prominent scar across his face. Furious, Vizsla broke ties with Dooku and the Separatists and vowed to kill the Count. On the run, the Death Watch found refuge on the planet Carlac, holding the local Ming Po hostage while pillaging their villages for women and supplies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vizsla found alliance with Lux Bonteri, a young Separatist from Onderon who also held a personal vendetta against Dooku for killing his mother, Mina. Vizsla sent Bonteri to Mandalore, where peace talks between the Republic and Confederacy were being hosted by Duchess Satine. By openly accusing the Count of treachery during the peace summit, he was able to provoke the Count into confronting him via hologram; this allowed Bonteri to use a holotrace device, revealing the Sith's whereabouts. Bonteri rendevouzed with the Death Watch on Carlac, where he was to present Vizsla the Count's coordinates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To Vizsla's surprise, however, Bonteri brought the Jedi Ahsoka Tano, who was masquerading as Bonteri's betrothed, and her droid R2-D2.

At a feast later that night, Vizsla was approached by several members of the Ming Po, who demanded Death Watch to release the native women who were keeping as servants and then leave the planet. Vizsla appeared to comply to the cheiftant's demands, swearing to leave the planet by morning. In reality, Vizsla was planning the slaughter of the natives; when he arrived at the Ming Po village to present the captured women, he ordered his men to burn the village and the people in it, much to Bonteri's horror."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano revealed herself as a Jedi, taking out several Death Watch members before being subdued. Upon return to the Death Watch camp, Vizsla expressed his disappointment in Bonteri for bringing a Jedi. Despite Bonteri's pleas to spare her, Vizsla was adamant to execute her. Bonteri accused Vizsla of murderous dishonor; Vizsla then retorted to the young boy that he was no different, having a blood lust against Dooku. Bonteri insisted that he wanted justice, not revenge, yet Vizsla would not have it. Vizsla then stated that like Bonteri wanting justice for his mother's death, Vizsla would execute Ahsoka for the Jedi Order's crimes against Mandalore, which in Vizsla's eyes, was justice as well. Before Vizsla could execute Ahsoka, R2-D2 entered the hut, creating a diversion and arming Tano with her lightsabers. After freeing herself by jumping and decapitating four Death Watch warriors, Vizsla dueled her for a time; but after the Jedi's saber caused Vizsla's jetpack to explode, she and Bonteri escaped."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Skirmish on Carlac"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after Tano's and Bonteri's escape, the Republic followed a Munificent-class star frigate to Carlac.

A Jedi Knight joined the battle, destroying the three camps, killing Sergeant Kellov and infiltrating a village that the Death Watch held captive, threatening to destroy it if the Republic did not recall it's forces from the world. The Jedi Knight infiltrated the village, however they were detected and the Death Watch started to burn it. The Republic dispatched a LAAT/i to douse the fires, although it raged on.
