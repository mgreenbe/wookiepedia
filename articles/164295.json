The species's name is used by the in-universe narrator of the work, Voren Na'al, in his description of Mara Jade. The line is reprinted in The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook, published in 1996, a collection of the three supplements that deal with the Thrawn Trilogy series of novels. The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, published in 2008 by Del Rey, mentions the Wind Dancers in its entry for Galloa II, which establishes the full name of the species's homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
