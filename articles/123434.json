According to the tale, Seward dispatched Inspector Vane\u00e9 to Fortress Vader on Mustafar to investigate why at least a dozen Lava Troopers had gone mad. When the inspector arrived outside of the bacta tank chamber of Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, Vane\u00e9 reported to Vader that he was dispatched by Seward to investigate the situation. Vane\u00e9 then succumbed to the same reactions of madness due to the gases within the fortress, and pledged to serve Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
