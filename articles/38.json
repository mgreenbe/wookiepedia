The \"Flash\" 4 was fitted with a cautionary pulser grip that vibrated in the user's hand when the power pack only had five shots remaining. \"Flash\" 4s cost between 695 and 750 credits, with replacement power packs costing 25 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Alliance to Restore the Republic soldiers preferred to carry heavy blaster pistols such as the \"Flash\" 4.
