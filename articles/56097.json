Identifiable by their three eyes and goat-like snouts, Gran also had small antennae-like nubs on the tops of their head and thick, bulky hands that could either have six large digits or five suction-cup-like digits. Members of this species included the Podracer pilot Mawhonic, the Galactic Republic senators Ask Aak, Philo, Kharrus, as well as the criminal Ree-Yees, who worked for Jabba the Hutt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gran were a sentient humanoid species who were identifiable from their goat-like faces and three eyes. Their heads were topped with four antennae-like nubs, two of which were short and straight and another set that were longer and curved. Gran could be found with two distinct body shapes, one being fat-bottomed and rotund at their mid-section and the other being skinnier and have proportions similar to a human. The former type also had hands that carried six slender digits. The latter type Gran either had smaller, human-like hands or fatter hands with thick digits that ended in flat suction-cup-like appendages. The Gran had two stomachs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gran hailed from the planet Kinyen but as a colonial species, they had migrated and adapted to dominate many worlds. Their most prominent colony was Malastare where they subjugated the Dug species. The Gran of Kinyen were known for their peaceful agricultural pursuits and for raising Houjix while the Gran of Malastare and Hok were known to engage in more greedy and dangerous pastimes such as underworld dealings and podracing. By 32 BBY, the Gran had integrated with the larger galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kinyen was represented by the Gran in the senate, with Philo and Kharrus having served as senators at different points during the Clone Wars. Although the Dug controlled Malastare's natural fuel reserves, it was the Gran that represented the world in the Galactic Senate after the Republic awarded them ownership of the planet, with the Gran Ask Aak serving as senator shortly before the Clone Wars. The Gran on their native homeworld mainly worked as farmers and made a living selling their foodstuffs to locations across the galaxy. Other Gran, mostly those born off Kinyen, were more opportunistic or aggressive in their pursuits and worked in various other jobs across the galaxy, including bounty hunters, mechanics, and professional podracer pilots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Gran in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several Gran held notable positions within the political sphere of the Galactic Republic, including Malastare politicians Ainlee Teem, Aks Moe, and Ask Aak. Senator Kharrus of Kinyen specialized in handling matters of diplomacy, including ransom missions. Philo was a Gran senator from Kinyen who worked with like-minded senators Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Bail Organa to oppose legislation. During 32 BBY, Teem attempted to run for Supreme Chancellor, but lost to Sheev Palpatine. When a crisis on Naboo was brought to the senate's attention, Moe agreed with the accused Trade Federation representative Lott Dod that a survey should be conducted in order to validate the Naboo queen's claims. During the intergalactic Clone Wars, Kharrus led a ransom mission to the planet Florrum, but was killed when his shuttle was shot down by pirates. Philo was murdered by the bounty hunter Cad Bane when Bane took members of the senate hostage in a bid to free the imprisoned Hutt Ziro."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One famous Gran was the Podracer Mawhonic from Hok, who flew in the 32 BBY Boonta Eve Classic Podrace. Mawhonic flew a green Podracer that was maintained by a Gran pit crew, but despite a strong starting position, Mawhonic crashed in the first lap of the race due to the aggressive, combative racing style of the Dug pilot Sebulba."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One female Gran senator was killed when a speeder fell on her and her partner while they were in a park on Coruscant during a fight between Darth Vader and two Inquisitors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several Gran were known to have worked for the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. When Jabba's son Rotta was kidnapped during the Clone Wars, Jabba hired a Gran bounty hunter to retrieve the Huttlet. Along with several other bounty hunters, the Gran made it to the planet Teth, but was decapitated by the kidnappers and had their head returned to Jabba. By the year 4 ABY, the Gran Ree-Yees became a member of Jabba's court and was killed onboard the Khetanna,  Jabba's sail barge, when it was destroyed by the Jedi Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
