Its main purpose is to deploy troops on various points on the battlefield, and not to be a heavy-duty gunship, which was why its only weapons were two to four laser cannons on either side of the cockpit, which could sometimes double as blasters for the stormtroopers. The transportation vehicle could seat four to five Imperial stormtroopers as well as their respective gear, but it usually only carried three stormtroopers and a shadow stormtrooper pilot. The pilot had the option to both land the craft in a traditional manner and wait for the troops to disembark on their own, or the pilot could detach the troop compartment, allowing the craft to exit the landing zone quicker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 0 BBY, at least one Imperial dropship was present on Tatooine, where it encountered Han Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, another dropship was present on Tatooine where it encountered a Rebel Scout Speeder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Dropship was a LEGO model in the 7667 Imperial Dropship set from 2008.
