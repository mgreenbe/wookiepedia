As the larvae of the wasp grew and began to feed on the brain cells of a host, the host experienced dementia, then severe seizures and spasms, as if suffering from a head injury. In general, wasp fever only lasted three or four days, which was the incubation period of the larvae. Any Korunnai stung by the fever wasp was generally considered dead on the spot, and their body was burned to prevent the larvae from hatching and causing more damage. Wasp fever affected people who chewed thyssel bark more as fever wasps also fed on it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
