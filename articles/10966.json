This drift brought with it the Red Nebula's lone inhabited planet, as well as the species that lived on it. The cataclysm brought two gems to the planet, which the species' cadre of priests dubbed the Great Life Jewels. It also created a large field of meteors around the world, which created a constant barrage of debris to impact on the world. Only the power of the Great Life Jewels protected the Untouched Valley and the temple therein from harm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
