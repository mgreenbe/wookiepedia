The craft sacrificed speed in favor of the incredible altitudes it could attain. On planets where crime was a concern, some models had defensive weaponry. On Tyed Kant, however, the volatile atmosphere made energy weapons more of a risk than any criminal, so the craft went unarmed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Eib Model-D was designed by Huegu Eib, founder of Gryseium Incorporated on Tyed Kant. Gryseium was best known for its foodstuffs, but that did not stop the company from producing the Model-D, which was still in use long after Eib retired from Gryseium and left the planet. When the Mynock virus struck the planet an Eib Model-D was lent to a group of rebel agents who were investigating the crisis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
