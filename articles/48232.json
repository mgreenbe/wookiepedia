Elements of Chief of State Cal Omas' staff, a large contingent of Jedi and much of the waning New Republic's strategic resources were rumored to be hidden there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unbeknownst, however, to the Yuuzhan Vong and Peace Brigade spies to whom this information was leaked, no such base existed. Meticulous planning on behalf of the New Republic Intelligence Service had uncovered the Yuuzhan Vong spy network on Mon Calamari and fed it false information, hoping that the Yuuzhan Vong would reach the conclusion that this last bastion of the New Republic could be caught unaware and destroyed. In this they were successful; Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane, persuaded by his executor Nom Anor, ordered Warmaster Tsavong Lah to take a task force and wipe out the base.Admiral Ackbar's resulting trap led to the Battle of Ebaq 9, the devastation of Lah's task force and the death of the warmaster himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
