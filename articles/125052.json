It involved couples twirling together with their arms outstretched, with the man switching between facing his body away from, and towards the woman. The woman would wear glowing spheres on the ends of her fingers, which would create trails of light as the couple spun. The King of Shu-Torun encouraged his ore-dukes to take part in the ceremonious ball in his palace's subterranean abyssal rooms, which included the dance, as it helped to keep the nobility compliant with the authority of the royal family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 0 ABY, the Sith Lord Darth Vader's traveled to Shu-Torun representing the interests of the Galactic Empire as an emissary of Emperor Sheev Palpatine. The king's daughter, Princess Trios, ordered the dance to begin as she and Vader entered the abyssal room, and explained its importance to Vader when he claimed it was unnecessary. The waltz was interrupted when Vader refused to dance with Bixene, the daughter of Duke Rubix, and twirled the duke in the air using the Force when he continued to insist. Vader was then attacked by a number of the king's men, causing the other guests to flee and putting an end to the dance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Shu-Torun counter-bore waltz first appeared in Darth Vader Annual 1, a comic book written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Leinil Francis Yu for publication in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
