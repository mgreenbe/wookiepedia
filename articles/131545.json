On the rocky world of Enujut, Peacekeeper Evor Haris welcomed all visitors, most recently a ship of one-legged gray Zemerin, a species of one-legged beings who could fix anything from starships to food replicators.

The blue droid took off with the ship and the Zemerin aboard. Watching with a pair of macrobinoculars, Haris smiled as the ship disappeared from view.
