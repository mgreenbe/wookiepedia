Hours after the First Battle of Geonosis, the loadmaster was directing clone troopers on the Outer Rim planet Geonosis onto gunships, which were transporting the weary and wounded troopers onto the Implacable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the ill-natured Duros barked commands at the troopers, he had a short exchange with clone commando RC-1136 \"Darman,\" who was waiting for his squadmates. The loadmaster irritably ordered Darman aboard the gunships without his squad, to which the commando responded by placing his vibroblade under the loadmaster's chin. After the exchange, the Duros quickly became submissive to the clone, referring to him as \"sir\" and treating him with a newfound deference."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The loadmaster appeared in the 2004 novel Republic Commando: Hard Contact, written by Karen Traviss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
