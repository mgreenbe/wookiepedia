Gramm was the mayor of Mos Taike, a small city on the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chastina Rile was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the species of Chastina Rile changed each time a player performed this quest. Under her spawn template, she would either appear as a black haired, brown eyed Human female, or as a yellow eyed female Twi'lek. The quest dialogue given by Gramm Rile established Chastina as his wife. Although Gramm Rile was a Human, it cannot be said with absolute certainty that the Human depiction of Chastina is canon. In the Star Wars universe, it is not unheard of for Humans to mate with other species, including Twi'leks. Therefore, Chastina could have either been a Human or a Twi'lek."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Targeting Chastina simply identified her as Mrs. Rile, yet Gramm Rile referred to his wife as Chastina in the quest dialogue. Therefore, the full name of Chastina Rile can be inferred. Furthermore, although not mentioned in the quest dialogue, examining her revealed her to be an entertainer. However, it should be noted that this was primarily due to game mechanics, as a result of Chastina being placed under the randomized entertainer spawn template appearance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
