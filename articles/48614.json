Seven pieces of the starship emerged in the Ab Dalis system. While six of them passed through the star system harmlessly, the seventh struck a glancing blow to Ab Dalis, destroying a city on the planet and killing approximately twenty million people. The devastation led Larence Garello of Garello Technologies to evacuate his employees and research from the planet; however, the convoy was attacked by the Nihil pirates before they could make it out of the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
