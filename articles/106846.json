Simply gazing upon it allowed Force visions, including the sight of the Throne of Balance.

The Pool began to show images of the Sith's homeworld of Kesh, then of a Jedi Queen on the Throne of Balance. Taalon demanded to know who the Jedi queen was, as he believed that Jedi might prevent the Sith from ruling the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Skywalkers attacked the Sith to protect the identity of the queen, who was actually their own relative, the daughter of Jacen Solo.
