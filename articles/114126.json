By the time of the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, however, the Republic had devoted fewer resources to law enforcement, which led to a rise in available criminal bounties. Hunters of the Guild were given access to numerous bounties on targets of higher value, including Separatists such as Count Dooku, Asajj Ventress, and General Grievous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
