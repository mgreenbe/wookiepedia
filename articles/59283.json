It was named after Am-Shak, a Weequay deity and the god of thunder. The Hand of Am-Shak was stolen by the pirate queen Rane Mahal after Gwarm landed it on Sakreen, attempting to discover Mahal's supposed lost treasure. However, Han Solo, whose own ship had been sabotaged by Gwarm using an ion scrambler, disabled the Hand of Am-Shak with the same device, leaving both Mahal and Gwarm's crews stranded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}]}
