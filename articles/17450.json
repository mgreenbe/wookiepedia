Black Ice was manufactured by Rendili StarDrive and was assigned to the Imperial Replenishment Fleet DK-209 as a key part of the support fleet. Black Ice was roughly five Imperial-class Star Destroyers in length, and each fuel sphere could hold 110 million tons of fuel each, in total nearing one billion tons of starship fuel.
