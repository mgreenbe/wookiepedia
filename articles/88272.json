They featured two sickle-shaped rear legs that terminated in single-claw feet, and a pair of articulated double-clawed guidance limbs. Gyroscopically balanced, the chair's metallic surface was covered in etchings modeled after the shell ornamentation of Neimoidia's sovereign beetle. They were noted as being uncomfortable to sit on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Viceroy Gunray's own mechno-chair was fitted with a holoprojector encrypted to a secret channel maintained by Darth Sidious. This chair was made on the planet Charros IV by the Xi Char, and customized with a HoloNet secret link and security systems that emitted toxic dioxis gas. It also had a self-destruct mechanism that could be instructed to initiate remotely."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dark Lord communicated with Gunray via his mechno-chair during the Invasion of Naboo, and later during the Clone Wars. When the Grand Army of the Republic laid siege to his fortress on Cato Neimoidia, Gunray fled the planet, but accidentally left his mechno-chair behind. Seized by Republic forces, the mechno-chair, with its holo-recording of Sidious, provided the Jedi with a valuable clue in the search for the elusive Sith Lord in the days prior to the Battle of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the reorganization of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, mechno-chairs were employed by Baron Merillion Tarko, a Moff ruling Cato Neimoidia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during the Galactic Civil War, several mechno-chairs were released to the public, some even being looted by various spacers.
