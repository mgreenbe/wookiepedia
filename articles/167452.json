Used by planetary defense forces and mercenaries, the Z50 was a rifle-sized launcher that could send grenades into the center of enemy formations to maximize casualties. It possessed a rotating, revolver-style magazine that could up to six specialized grenades, and was capable of firing slug-like grenades for a launcher of its size, which meant that a variety of payloads were available from manufacturers. The Z50 also came standard with a forward vertical grip and shock-absorbing stock to aid in firing stability, as well as a range-finder optic to help shooters gauge target distance and optimal trajectory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Z50 grenade launcher was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon in Gadgets and Gear, a 2019 supplement to Fantasy Flight Games' series of Star Wars Roleplaying products.
