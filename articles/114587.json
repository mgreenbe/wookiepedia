The campaign comprised two incidents; the Mission to Jabba's Palace and the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon. Ideally the skirmish at the Great Pit of Carkoon would never have taken place and the foray into Jabba's Palace would have entailed several potential phases."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Infiltration of Jabba's palace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first phase had Lando infiltrate Jabba's Palace, disguised as the guard Tamtel Skreej, as a contingency should anything go wrong. The second phase involved sending R2-D2 and C-3PO to the palace to peacefully offer Jabba the opportunity to release Han, with the droids themselves as a gift. When this failed, phase three involved Leia, posing as the bounty hunter Boushh, delivering a supposedly-captured Chewbacca to Jabba for a bounty. Leia would have then freed Han in the night, released Chewbacca and escaped with them and Lando. When Jabba saw through the attempted rescue and captured all three (excluding Lando, who remained in disguise), they were forced to move to the final phase. Luke Skywalker entered the palace and, by means of several Force techniques made his way to Jabba's throne room. He underestimated Jabba however and, after killing Jabba's pet rancor, wound up captured and sentenced to death, along with Han and Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Trip to the Pit of Carkoon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being condemned to death in the gullet of the sarlacc, Luke, Han and Chewbacca were taken to the Pit of Carkoon in the Dune Sea.

Once there, Luke was able to free himself with the help of R2-D2, and after a pitched struggle that saw the destruction of Jabba and his criminal empire, as well as the supposed demise of Boba Fett, Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, Lando, and the droids escaped unharmed and made their way back to the Rebel fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rescue of Han Solo first appeared in the beginning of the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, the final installment of the Star Wars original trilogy.
