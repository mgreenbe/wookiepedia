Following the death of Sergeant Fektrin during a raid on an Imperial heavy freighter in 3 ABY, Mzun stepped in to take charge of the late sergeant's squad. Following the loss of their captain at the Battle of Hoth that same year, and the other Twilight officers during an infiltration of their CR90 corvette, the Thunderstrike, on the same day, Twilight Company hid on the pirate backwater planet Ankhural to repair the corvette and its escort, the Braha'tok-class gunship Apailana's Promise. Mzun participated in the meetings held between the most senior of the company."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After First Sergeant Hazram Namir was informed that a number of soldiers were considering deserting, including recruits from the Mid Rim planet Haidoral Prime and some of Fektrin's old squad, he consulted the matter with Mzun and the other senior Twilight members in one of their meetings. Mzun let out a series of babblings in a different language, which Namir thought might have been outrage. The man decided to solve the problem by splitting the group up assigning them to different roles. The next matter brought to light in the meeting was holding a funeral for Twilight Company's late captain, captain Micha Evon. As the other attendees agreed, Mzun said something which Namir could not understand, but he concluded that the vote was was in favor of holding a funeral."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Evon's funeral, Everi Chalis, a former Imperial governor and now an asset to Twilight Company, hosted another meeting to propose a new plan for the company. The campaign, named Operation Ringbreaker, would target a series of lightly defended imperial worlds before it's sole objective, the Kuat Drive Yards. The fall of these shipyards orbiting Kuat would be a crippling blow to the Empire's fleet production. As she finished her presentation, Mzun debated the tactics of the shipyard invasion with Gadren and Carver. As Chief Medic Von Geiz asked for all those in favor to speak, only Mzun, Gadren and Quartermaster Hober remained silent, with the other Twilight members making the vote in favor of Chalis' plan."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Operation Ringbreaker"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first target in Operation Ringbreaker was warehouse world Mardona III. Mzun was among the troops landed on the planet, who were tasked with planting thousands of ion mines along the tram network. When armored vehicles were reported to be sweeping the sectors around the tramways, Namir called all of the squads to cluster under a housing block. He intended to occupy the block and establish a fallback position. Mzun, Gadren and Sergeant Zab expressed their worries for the citizens living there, but Namir went along with the plan regardless. Thus, the squads sealed off the majority of the entrances to the housing block and set up defenses. Namir then established terms with the residents in order for them to be less of an obstruction to Twilight Company. After six days on Mardona III, they had completed their mission and were picked up by the Thunderstrike and Apailana's Promise again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Mardona III Twilight Company wrecked the dockyards of the gas giant Najan-Rovi and destroyed the Imperial garrison on the sea moon Obumubo. The company then attacked the planet Nakadia's, where numerous soldiers fell casualty to bio-weapons. Once their point of origin was located, Namir led a dozen aliens, including Mzun and Gadren to destroy the warehouse holding the toxins. They were successful, and Twilight Company subsequently won on Nakadia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After three more battles, Twilight Company captured the Inyusu Tor mineral processing facility on the manufacturing planet Sullust. However, the Thunderstrike was shot down before it could pick up the company again, with the Apailana's Promise retreating with its X-wings.

Although they were likely going to face an unbeatable army from the Empire, Mzun, Gadren, Namir and the soldier Carver pretended that the battle that they were to face was winnable.
