Notably, before the start of the Clone Wars, Jango Fett would personally train the first batch of Alpha class ARC troopers for the Republic on Kamino. Fett instilled these clones with Mandalorian values, including having each clone memorize the Vode An. Other clones, including Clone Commandos, were taught the Vode An by their various Mandalorian trainers. This group of Mandalorians were brought to Kamino on Jango's request to train many of the more advanced clones, they were known as the Cuy'val Dar. The song referred to them as the \u201cWrath of Coruscant\u201d which had a dual meaning since they were being used by the Republic and Coruscant was the original homeworld of the Mandalorians. The chant was famously sung by the clone troopers with the accompaniment of drums and horns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Lyrics"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mando'a"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kote!\nKandosii sa ka'rta, Vode an.\nCoruscanta a'den mhi, Vode an.\nBal kote, darasuum kote,\nJorso'ran kando a tome.\nSa kyr'am nau tracyn kad, Vode an."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kandosii sa ka'rta, Vode an.\nCoruscanta a'den mhi, Vode an.\nBal...\nMotir ca'tra nau tracinya.\nGra'tua cuun hett su dralshy'a.\nAruetyc talyc runi'la solus cet o'r.\nMotir ca'tra nau tracinya.\nGra'tua cuun hett su dralshy'a.\nAruetyc talyc runi'la trattok'o.\nSa kyr'am nau tracyn kad, Vode an!"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Basic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glory!\nOne indomitable heart, Brothers all.\nWe, the wrath of Coruscant, Brothers all.\nAnd glory, eternal glory,\nWe shall bear its weight together.\nForged like the saber in the fires of death, Brothers all."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One indomitable heart, Brothers all.\nWe, the wrath of Coruscant, Brothers all.\nAnd...\nThose who stand before us light the night sky in flame.\nOur vengeance burns brighter still.\nEvery last traitorous soul shall kneel.\nThose who stand before us light the night sky in flame.\nOur vengeance burns brighter still.\nEvery last traitorous soul shall fall.\nForged like the saber in the fires of death, Brothers all!"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Excerpt"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vode An is heard throughout several parts of the 2005 video game Star Wars: Republic Commando, including the main menu and several battle sequences.
