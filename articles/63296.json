After a long reconnaissance mission with Princess Leia Organa, their ship was forced to enter Imperial space in need of supplies. When Darth Vader's Star Destroyer detected their ship, the Princess insisted they stand and fight. Unwilling to sacrifice the leader of the Rebellion, Hume knocked the princess unconscious and put her into a gossamer glider.
