During the trip, Philinda and some of the other tourists, the Humans Nia Reston, San Herrera, the Rodian Nikolo and the Sullustan Tret, were recruited by the droid LN-73 into assisting him at sabotaging the production facilities. LN-73 did this by lying to them by claiming that HG-211, Uffel's head of security, had been corrupted. Philinda and the rest of the group then attacked the Heroes of Cularin, who LN-73 falsely claimed were sabotaging the droid factories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the incident, San Herrera developed a romantic interest in Philinda and began to refer to her as \"the hot one\". He talked about her regularly to his friend Nia Reston and kept suggesting that he and Reston call Philinda and see if she knew about any new jobs that were available. Reston mentioned Herrera's feelings for Philinda to the reporter Yara Grugara while the pair were being interviewed for Eye on Cularin. Upon Grugara's inquiry, Herrera claimed that he and Philinda were a couple, while Reston denied that they were."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Philinda later left the Cularin system, to visit her parents on the planet Coruscant.
