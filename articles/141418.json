The pair had an infant son by 19 BBY. As a result of frequent attacks by the native Tusken Raiders, the moisture farmer Orrin Gault set up the Settlers' Call, a fund which provided weapons and vehicles for the mutual defense of its members and the Bezzards were among its subscribers. In 19 BBY, Tyla's father, Lotho Pelhane, was forced to move in with the Bezzards to recover after an apparent Tusken Raider attack on his own moisture farm. Only weeks later, however, the Bezzards were attacked by Tusken Raiders. The Bezzards were saved by the arrival of Settlers' Call members led by Gault, but not before Pelhane was killed. In the aftermath of the attack, the Bezzards temporarily left the farm and were put up by Annileen Calwell, a merchant at the nearby Pika Oasis. Bezzard soon returned to the farm, however, leaving his grieving wife and their son safely at Calwell's."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
