As Tano entered the turbolift, one of the police officers fired at the lift's controls, causing it to begin plummeting towards the ground. The child was surprised and scared. Tano, thinking quickly, began cutting a hole in the top of the lift with her lightsabers. The child tried to tell Tano that the button would stop the lift, but she was too focused on cutting the hole. He then simply pressed the button, bringing the falling turbolift to a halt and embarrassing Tano. Tano proceeded to cut a hole in the turbolift's door and jumped down to the ground with the child in her arms, reuniting him with his mother after landing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twi'lek child first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"To Catch a Jedi,\" voiced by Nika Futterman, who also voiced Asajj Ventress in the episode as well as throughout the series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
