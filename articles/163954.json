These stars could no longer sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen, and only gave off faint light from their residual heat. Ardos, one of two stars of the original Hutt homeworld Varl, became a white dwarf star around 15,000 BBY, at the end of the Hutt Cataclysms. Around the same time, Ardos's sister star Evona was swallowed by a black hole, and the resulting devastation rendered the entire Varl system uninhabitable. The story later became a Hutt legend about the two stars, which were considered gods by the Hutts; according to the legend, Evona was lured into a collision with a small black hole and died, causing the systems' planets to violently mourn their death and crush each other into asteroids. In agony, Ardos began to self-destruct and transformed into a white dwarf. However, inconsistencies in the story led many to believe that Evona's destruction and Ardos's transformation were caused by the Hutts themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
