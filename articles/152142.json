Nine Trandoshan bounty hunters had intercepted a parcel meant for Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and the commando's squad, alongside another squad of commandos, was given the task of retrieving the package. After setting a trap in an Ord Mantell city for the bounty hunters, the commando and two of his squad-mates tried to flank the Trandoshan speeders after they had stopped in a street due to a fabricated roadblock. When the first speeder was destroyed, the third speeder spun around, running over the commando and his brothers before they could attack. As the speeder fled, the backseat passenger threw an arm full of grenades at the stunned commandos, which exploded and killed them. Despite this, the mission was a success, thanks to commando RC-1013, who retrieved the package."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like his squad-mates, the commando wore blue and white Katarn-class commando armor, and wielded a DC-17m Interchangeable Weapon System."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone commando was created for the short story The Package, which was written by Ryan Kaufman.
