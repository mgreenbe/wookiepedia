Around 3641 BBY Poz was stationed at the Meltwater Outpost in the High Security Section on Belsavis, where she investigated the Rakata teleportation technology and theorized that the teleporters might not be capable of actual matter transmission but instead replicating matter of a subject or even perhaps functioned as fixed dimensional pathways.
