Meanwhile, the Confederate Head of State Count Dooku ordered General Grievous\u2014the commander of the Malevolence\u2014to target the Republic's secret Outer Rim medical center, which was located near the Kaliida Nebula and was treating over 60,000 wounded Republic clone troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker and Shadow Squadron were able to intercept the warship before it could destroy the medical base. Damage to the Malevolence's massive ion pulse cannons caused them to explode, inflicting further damage to the warship. Several Republic Venator-class Star Destroyers arrived under the command of High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Admiral Wullf Yularen, and the cruisers initiated an assault on the Malevolence. Unable to retreat to hyperspace because of damage to the warship's hyperdrive, Grievous was forced to call in reinforcements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Confederate fleet was dispatched to aid the fleeing Malevolence and prevent the warship's destruction at the hands of the Republic Navy forces. However, Senior Jedi General Luminara Unduli intercepted the Confederate armada with a fleet of her own and engaged the enemy fleet in battle. Skywalker contacted Unduli, seeking reinforcements for the continued attack on the Malevolence. Unduli informed Skywalker of her situation, but despite her inability to provide immediate assistance to comrade, she still planned to help his forces once she had dispatched her opponents. Unduli was later able to defeat the Confederate reinforcements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the course of the Republic's attack on the Malevolence, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala was tricked into traveling to the battlefield. Upon her arrival, she was pulled aboard the Malevolence, as Grievous intended to use her as a hostage to guarantee his and the warship's escape. Skywalker and Kenobi boarded the Malevolence to rescue Amidala, while Jedi General Plo Koon and Commander Ahsoka Tano\u2014who had accompanied Skywalker and Shadow Squadron to the nebula\u2014contacted Unduli via holotransmission for support against the Malevolence. Once Amidala had been rescued, Koon's fleet would need reinforcements to destroy the Confederate warship. Unduli promised her support, heading over to the nearby Republic armada. Skywalker was able to sabotage the warship's navicomputer, and he escaped the warship with Kenobi and Amidala. Before Unduli arrived with her reinforcements, the Malevolence attempted to jump to hyperspace, and Skywalker's sabotage caused the warship to crash into a nearby moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle near the Kaliida Nebula was first mentioned in \"Destroy Malevolence,\" an episode in the 2008 first season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series.
