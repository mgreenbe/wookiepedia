The lizard had already been stolen once by her current possessors, the Rhokai gang of thieves, and the criminal Roland Durand hired the information broker Cid to steal the lizard for him. Cid sent the Bad Batch, a group of renegade clone commandos who now worked for her as mercenaries. The squad managed to recover the lizard from the Rhokai's base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Subsequently, the Batch's starship, the Havoc Marauder, was pursued by three Rhokai starfighters. The shuttle's hyperdrive had come offline, and Tech flew while Echo worked on fixing the drive. Hunter manned the ship's rear gun, firing back at their pursuers while inquiring about the hyperdrive. Wrecker had put the cage containing the lizard on one of the jump seats while he strapped himself in, but the cage came loose and the lizard ran free, causing Wrecker to panic. Omega, a child clone who was the youngest member of the group, told Wrecker to stop because he was scaring the lizard, surprising him when she revealed she had named it in the process. Echo managed to get the hyperdrive back online just as Omega secured Ruby back in her cage, and the Batch successfully escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Batch returned to Ord Mantell, where Cid operated out of, with the lizard, presenting Ruby to Cid. When Cid paid Hunter far less credits for the job than she had said it was worth, he, Echo and Tech protested, but the Trandoshan said they owed her a significant amount of money for various expenses they had incurred, in addition to having failed to retrieve a tactical droid head during a job on Corellia. Part of the expenses included multiple cartons of Mantell Mix purchased by Wrecker and Omega, who had taken to treating themselves to it after successful missions. When the Batch shortly travelled to Bracca as a favour to their friend Captain Rex, Hunter attempted to find valuable salvage on the junk planet which would square their debt, but the group found themselves escaping Galactic Empire forces sent to hunt them down after their presence was discovered. The Batch's debt was eventually paid off after Omega discovered a talent for dejarik while the rest of the squad was on another mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Roland Durand later got himself involved with the Pyke Syndicate and, trying to make a name for himself in the crime world, took over Cid's Parlor with his goons. Omega made the acquaintance of his pet Ruby again in the process, as Cid attempted to steal spice Durand owed the Pykes to get him in trouble with them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
