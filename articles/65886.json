The design was unveiled by Cantwell alongside his original design for what would eventually become the Imperial Arrestor Cruiser in Solo: A Star Wars Story on Instagram. According to Cantwell, when asked if the Delta Wing type influenced the design of the attack craft, he acknowledged that NASA designs at the time he made the concept art played a role in the design of the attack craft, due to it requiring a design allowing it to enter the atmosphere to invade planets. Contrary to popular belief, its design was not derived from the real life F-117 Nighthawk aircraft, as the latter would not enter development until 7 years after Cantwell made the design (and would not be revealed to the public until nearly twice that amount of time)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
