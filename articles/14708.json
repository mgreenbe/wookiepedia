During the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic established a base there, defended by anti-orbital ion cannons. Around six months after the Battle of Yavin, the base was discovered by the Galactic Empire. They attacked with a force of two fighter wings, including one containing the elite pilot Lieutenant Ranulf Trommer. Trommer destroyed the Rebel anti-orbital ion cannons with a salvo from his starship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, Trommer was transferred to the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Ravagor and fought in the Battle of Aguarl 3.

The battle helped establish the credentials of Ranulf Trommer as an elite pilot. The battle was later mentioned in the Star Wars Encyclopedia (1998), under the Spefik entry. This entry was repeated verbatim in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia (2008). Given the time frame of the battle, and its location in the Atrivis sector, it is likely the Rebel forces belonged to the Atrivis Sector Force, which coordinated Rebel activity in the sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
