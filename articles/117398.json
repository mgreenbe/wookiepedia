The company operated several stores around the planet. The storefront showed the company's name in Aurebesh symbols. The fa\u00e7ade was decorated with a neon sign which read \"hot\". Sometimes, the shops would sell their goods at a lower price than usual, whereupon a neon \"sale\" sign would be put up in order to attract customers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ross was created for the animated television show Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The name is never spoken in the series, and the establishment is only identifiable through the Aurebesh signage. In \"The Zillo Beast Strikes Back\", a neon sign seen above a sign advertising \"sale\", shows a woman in a dress/coat. This, and the signs used by the shops to attract customers, suggests that Ross is a clothing store."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
