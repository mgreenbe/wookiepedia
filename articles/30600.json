The CSF's training academies existed since the early days of the Galactic Republic. When the Senate Guard expanded its role from a bodyguard detail to a full police force and took charge of policing the Legislative District, it attracted many of the CSF's best police officers and academy recruits. The subsequent rivalry and power struggle between the CSF and the Senate Guard would last throughout the history of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Coruscant Police training academies were first mentioned briefly in Galaxy at War which was published on September 15, 2009 by Wizards of the Coast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
