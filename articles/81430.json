The Leviathan was given expanded hangar bays to allow it to carry sixty starfighters and, under the command of the Alderaanian Captain Trence Vosh, the Leviathan was sent by the Galactic Senate to patrol trade routes and enforce the Republic's trade laws. However, during the Republic's last years, the Senate often was unable to reach a consensus as to where the Leviathan should be sent and as a result, the ship frequently had no official mission other than to patrol the galaxy in search of pirates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
