He was a member of a species that possessed chin tentacles. Prior to the opening of the Republic Fair on Valo, Jedi Padawan Ram Jomaram had slyly mentioned that one of the security team's speeder bikes was out of commission and that there were no mechanics available to fix it. Kunpar hesitantly allowed Jomaram to repair the vehicle in his garage instead of attending the fair preparations.
