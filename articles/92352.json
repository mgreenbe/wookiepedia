It was so strong it could hold while being barraged by an Imperial Star Destroyer's turbolasers. To create the armor, dense metals were softened or liquified by ion fusers. Then, as the resulting alloy cooled, it was bombarded by charged-particle vibrating waves. This dramatically improved the bonding strength of the molecules and gave the armor incredible resiliency."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
