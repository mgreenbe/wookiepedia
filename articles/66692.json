Due to a natural disaster, a group of mysterious spacefaring benefactors relocated them to Iskalon, within the Trans-Nebular sector. On this planet, the Inleshat became part of the Iskalonian School, a community of unrelated aquatic species who shared a unique cultural identity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With time, the Inleshat became the dominant species within the School. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, an eldery Inleshat named Primor had become the spiritual leader of the Iskalonians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A water-breathing species, the Inleshat were sentient fishes, and they hatched from eggs. They were humanoid in shape. They had a torso with a head, two arms and two legs. They usually had three digits on each of their webbed hands, though some individuals were known to have four or even five fingers. Most Inleshat were tall and muscular. The species had two sexes: male and female. Male individuals sometimes sported tendrils that descended from the cheekbones and chin in the manner of fleshy \"beards\". Females were physically distinguished by their breasts and thinner build."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The top of the Inleshat's heads were covered with long, silky hair, ranging in tone from white to green, and a marked V-shaped growth of hair descended towards the center of their foreheads. Their noseless faces featured wide, pupilless eyes of the color yellow, red, blue, or green. They had poor eyesight out of the water, but their long and pointed ears could hear underwater sounds from kilometers away. The Inleshat also possessed a set of white, properly lined-up teeth that made up a brilliant smile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inleshat were water-breathers, which means they had the natural ability to extract dissolved oxygen from water. When taken out of the water for too long, they could not breath air and would die from an abnormally low amount of oxygen in their body. In the event of prolonged exposure to open air, Inleshat wore tanks filled with water."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inleshat comprised the majority of the School, the interracial Iskalonian society. They were a spiritual and principled people, ready to defend a cause they knew to be upright. Highly political beings, they were concerned with the common good. Even the young Inleshat named Mone, who was considered an \"irresponsible pleasure-skeer\", spent much of his time trying to content others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of this species were easy-going and friendly to strangers, although in a way that could seem awkward to other races. When Mone greeted the heroes of the Rebellion, he splashed Chewbacca with seawater, thinking the Wookiee must have been hot and miserable with all that fur. Chewbacca first saw this behavior as an outrage, and both his friends Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker had to hold him down before he fell upon the poor water-breather. Much to the amazement of Humans like Leia Organa, the Inleshat did not have the concepts of shyness or physical privacy. The lovers Mone and Kendel would hug and exchange sweet words in public, with no shame or embarrassment whatsoever. Similarly, the concept of spying was a foreign idea on Iskalon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite possessing their own Iskalonian language, which they shared with other races within the School, most Inleshat commoners could speak Galactic Standard fluently."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inleshat evolved in the seas of Drexel II, located in the Outer Rim Territories. Thousands of years before the Galactic Civil War, a series of cataclysms on Drexel II put its inhabitants, the Inleshat, in jeopardy. When all seemed lost, an unidentified species of space travelers reached out to the Inleshat and helped them relocate to another planet. Now established on the world of Iskalon, the Inleshat united with other aquatic species and contributed to building the Iskalonian School, the cultural fusion of seventeen distinct races that made up the Iskalonian civilization."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
