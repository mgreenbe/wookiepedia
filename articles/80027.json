Since that article was released outside of the Lucas Licensing process, its canonicity within the Star Wars Legends continuity was never confirmed. The 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas subsequently placed the Lar system in grid square L-17, relatively far from the galaxy's Core Worlds, and the StarWars.com Online Companion to the book further overrode the Voyages SF 13 placement by establishing that the system was situated in the D'Aelgoth sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 1998 Star Wars Encyclopedia claims that the tectonic activity on Mima II was caused by a nearby planet named Lar, which contradicts the first edition and the 1994 second edition of Galaxy Guide 4: Alien Races, both of which state that it was the star Lar that exerted its gravitational influence on Mima II.
