The walker was armed with twin forward-facing laser cannons, with one installed at each side of the ground vehicle. From the walker's seat, the pilot could manipulate each laser cannon individually, rotating the ranged weapon to point downwards and upwards to strike both airborne and ground targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Riot Control Walker was first included as a LEGO toy set released in 2017 as merchandise for the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
