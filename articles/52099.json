For example, one Rebel Alliance pilot once spotted the Death Star at coordinates -340.11, -79.72, 1.06. By convention, the system was centered not on the actual galactic center, but on the planet Coruscant, which was dignified with the coordinates 0,0,0. The coordinates of Batuu were -401.72, -561.84, 004.32."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
