He was employed as a scout in the Onderon military. Along with Colonel Tobin and the majority of the Onderonian military under Tobin's command, Laane was part of the Onderon separatists following the commander-in-chief of the military, General Vaklu, who opposed the rule of pro-Republic Onderonian Queen Talia. In 3951 BBY, the separatists had allied with remnants of Darth Malak's Sith Empire and were required to partake in the elimination of Lost Jedi. In that year, the first battle of the Onderon Civil War began when the Onderon separatists' space forces fired on a small freighter, the Ebon Hawk, which carried the former Jedi Knight Meetra Surik, after they located the ship among the blockaded ships above Onderon. The attack damaged the Ebon Hawk, and the ship was forced to land on the planet's orbiting moon, Dxun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Colonel Tobin sent Laane and a team of scouts to the surface of the moon to find Surik.
