They were native to the planet Shaymore. Though skilled at combat and stealth, they had very little modern technology, and were thus easy prey for the Galactic Empire, who stole most of the planet's hydrocarbons. The Sessehshellah were freed by the Rebel Alliance, who supplied them with modern weapons to better fight the Imperial Stormtroopers and destroyed the Empire's main refinery, leading the Imperials to abandon Shaymore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
