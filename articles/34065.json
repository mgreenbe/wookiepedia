Soon afterward, a group of individuals looking for the people who had disappeared themselves to join the Cularin resistance came to the irstat following clues left by the missing people. Dariana sensed a disturbance to the balance of nature around Cloud Mountain, and pointed them in the same direction as she had the irstat's friend. At this point, the Metatheran Cartel was secretly cutting down ch'hala trees and, although Dariana's friend knew it, he or she did not tell Dariana because the Tarasin would start a violent bloodshed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, another of Dariana's sisters, Liriana, turned up leading a group of Tarasin dark side witches calling themselves the Wyrd.
