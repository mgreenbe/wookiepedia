The Separatist forces attempted to halt the invasion by using a group of Armored Assault Tanks to ambush Windu's forces, leading Clone Commander CT-411 \"Ponds\" to call on the support of Lightning Squadron at the general's command. Utilizing their AT-RT walkers, the squadron's ARF troopers charged toward the enemy and although they successfully defended the army, Windu's forces sustained casualties during the skirmish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the ambush, Windu scouted ahead taking the ARF troopers \"Razor\" and \"Stak\"\u2014both of Lightning Squadron\u2014with him.

Before commencing with the main attack on the capital, Windu infiltrated Lessu and distracted the battle droids while Razor and Stak made their way to the control room and reactivated the plasma bridge, allowing both clone troopers and rebels to enter the city.
