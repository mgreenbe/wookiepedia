One Ewok who was determined to enjoy Horville's attraction was Wicket Wystri Warrick. Wicket, who loathed having to watch the too cute Tumble bunny show with the Woklings, persuaded his reluctant friends to accompany him to the Hut of Horrors. There, Horville greeted them and gave them a small preview of what they would find inside. After entering, the Ewoks were soon seen fleeing in terror. As a result of this frightening experience, Wicket ended up having nightmares that included a phantom of Horville chasing him through the forest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
