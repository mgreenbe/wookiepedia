The ambush occurred during a ceremony arranged by Imperial General Irrv and the Culroon leader Kloff, who was expected to allow the Empire control of his planet. The ambush began after Kloff received a ceremonial sword, with which he calmly stabbed the Imperial Colonel Jeffers, an action that signalled for thousands of Culroon warriors to attack the gathered stormtroopers. Lieutenant Maximilian Veers, commanding an All Terrain Armored Transport, was able to defeat many of the Culroon and save the Imperial forces. When General Irrv demanded a court-martial for Veers, he was shot by Commander Grath, who immediately had promoted Veers to the rank of major."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
