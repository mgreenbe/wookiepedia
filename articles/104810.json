Shortly before the Battle of Kirrek in 5000 BBY, Sith Lords Saes Rrogon and Yaru Korsin harvested the Lignan from the moon for use in the upcoming Sith invasion, exterminating all life on the moon, along with much of the crust. They were ambushed, however, by Relin Druur and Drev Hassin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
