On sight, they attempted to kill him, but he escaped and found Asajj. Finding that she was strong in the Force, he began training her as his Padawan. Together they united armies and brought peace to the planet. Unfortunately, the warlords feared them and united together to kill the pair; they only killed the master. In her rage, Asajj captured and/or killed every warlord responsible for her master's death and established a totalitarian regime over the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most of the planet was subjugated by the Stunger state."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was here that Count Dooku first discovered and recruited Asajj as he watched her emerge victorious at the gladiatorial death matches of The Cauldron.

Mercenaries often come to this world, but are stranded by the planet's failed infrastructure.
