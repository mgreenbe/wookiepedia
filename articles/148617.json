Some smuggling ships, such as the Millennium Falcon, were capable of transmitting false transponder codes. The droids of Luke Skywalker's Jedi temple sent out automatic transponder signals when on missions, so that the vessel they were aboard could be found if an issue arose. Transponder signals could be utilized to unlock starships from the outside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
