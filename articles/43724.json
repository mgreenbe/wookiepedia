As Solo, who had stood watch over the battle for nearly forty-eight hours, remained fixated on the contested world through a viewport on his Star Cruiser's bridge, Colonel Elzian reported to the commanding officer of their apparent victory, giving a brief assessment of the battle; Elzian was certain of their opponent's defeat, remarking that their forces were evidently and decisively trapped. Han Solo agreed, although he was unsatisfied of the Imperials' intent of fighting to their deaths, stating his aversion to creating unnecessary casualties."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Turning to the colonel, Han Solo ordered the retreat of naval forces and the deployment of ground forces. Colonel Elzian then began to remind General Solo of his lack of rest, though Solo interrupted to acknowledge his subordinate's concern.

Before Solo could rest, however, he was contacted via viewscreen by a Republic officer who exclaimed that the general was needed in the ship's command center, eliminating Solo's chance for rest.
