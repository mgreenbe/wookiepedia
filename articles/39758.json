While entering the base, AP-5 reminds Chopper to follow his lead, sparking another round of arguments. Meanwhile in space, the Imperial Information Office crew of an Imperial IGV-55 surveillance vessel receive the sensor's transmission. The communications officer 3-9 informs the Imperial Controller LT-319 that an unauthorized droid has entered the ISB base on Killun 71.

The communications officer confirms that the droid that triggered the alarm arrived on that shuttle. The controller checks archival data on unidentified rebel droids and recognizes Chopper as an outdated C1-series astromech droid.

PZ-7 meekly accepts AP-5's explanation, leading him to marvel that he is of the same model as those Imperial drones.

When 3-9 reports that no base coordinates were stored on the droid, the controller decides to use Chopper to lead them to the base instead. He tells 3-9 to initiate the takeover.

The female comm officer informs the controller that the inventory droid has accessed the Lothal orbital access codes from the main computer, and warns that there is danger. However, the controller responds that the rebels only have a 31% chance of using the codes.

Wedge, relieved by Chopper's polite behavior, thinks it will be a smooth flight back to base. When AP-5 asks Chopper what he is up to, Chopper talks back in Imperial Code 16, leading AP-5 to deduce that he is on standby mode.

He then asks AP-5 what is the matter with him. Chopper then offers Wedge a carton of blue milk.
