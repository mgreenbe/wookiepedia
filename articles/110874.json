A GR-75 medium transport docked with the Imperial ship and evacuated the prisoners. A number of TIE fighters were patrolling the area, and upon receiving a battle alert rushed towards the battle scene."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After completing its docking, the first Rebel transport moved at top speed away from the battle to escape safely into hyperspace. Several TIEs gave chase, but Antilles drove them off. As that happened, a second rescue transport was inbound.

Antilles docked with the prison to steal a TIE Bomber to pick him up, as the rescue craft required an accommodation for two. Antilles had to dodge the hundreds of Bakura surface heavy missile batteries and turrets littering the surface. Using his TIE bomber's concussion missiles, he managed to break through the defenses and pickup Hobbie."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just before picking up Hobbie, Wedge picked up some advanced proton bombs from one of the domed towers that he destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arrival back in orbit, Antilles noticed that debris littered the area.

The space station was based on a rough concept based on some sci-fi movies they saw, and was rendered to be more in-line with the Star Wars universe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flying the TIE bomber in the mission is a mini-game unlocked upon reaching silver medal status. Destroying the missile launchers within a certain time limit is necessary to unlock the TIE Bomber as a flyable craft. Alternatively, if the player receives bronze level status, an FMV will play showing arrival of the Imperial Escort carrier and the re-capture of the scientists and the destruction of the Rebel Transport. It was largely created as a reward for the player for putting up with the difficulties of choosing their own path in the mission.
