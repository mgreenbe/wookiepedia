The sandcrawler visited Tosche Station, near Anchorhead, to sell stuff to the warehouse manager Janus. It then visited Zef Ando at the Lars homestead. After leaving the farm, Sand Crawler 345 was attacked by Tusken Raiders in the Western Dune Sea and destroyed. Some Jawas and the FA-2PO managed to escape and took refuge nearby. As the cargo from Tansarii Point Station interested both Imperial Commander Barrezz and Rebel Captain Bastra, spacers were looking for the sandcrawler when it was attacked. The spacers received FA-2PO's emergency call and headed to the survivors of Sand Crawler 345. The spacers attacked the Tusken Raiders and rescued FA-2PO and the Jawas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "FA-2PO was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
