Surviving until the end of the war, Jedi Gel was able to escape the deadly execution of Contingency Order 66 by the treacherous Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. The order, commanding all clone troopers in the Grand Army to turn against their Jedi leaders, effectively wiped out the Jedi Order and sent all survivors into hiding. Going to ground, Gel fled to Dalicron-4 where he fathered a child and started a farm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The farm, centered around an ancient tree, was contained inside a dead spot in the Force. In fact, the tree contained the spirit of the ancient Jedi Master Duumas, who had taken up residence in the tree in order to protect a long ago foreseen \"Child of Light\". This child of prophecy was in fact Gel's grandson, Caeleb, who lived with his family including his sister, Jhara. While Caeleb grew up ignorant to the Force, Gel still feared that one day Palpatine and his Galactic Empire would find and kill his family. Therefore, when the Alliance to Restore the Republic proclaimed Luke Skywalker as their own Jedi Knight fighting to destroy the Empire, Jedi Gel sent word to Skywalker that he had a Force-user in need of protection. While Skywalker was considered too vital to the war effort to be spared for such a mission, the Alliance dispatched a team to recover Caeleb and escort him to an Alliance stronghold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, before the Alliance could arrive, Gel's home was visited invaded by the Dark Jedi Tol Skaros, the Whiphid apprentice to Thaum Rystra. Skaros disarmed the old Jedi and interrogated him for the location of Caeleb, the object of Master Rystra's desires. Gel refused to give into Skaros' techniques until the Whiphid convinced the aging man that he was going to kill his granddaughter Jhara. Loosing his composure, Gel gave into the Dark Jedi and revealed the location of the Force void and the farm it concealed. Skaros had no mercy on the broken Jedi and fatally wounded Gel, leaving him to die alone on his small farm before hunting down Caeleb. While the Dark Jedi killed both of Caeleb's parents, the Alliance operatives were able to rescue Caeleb and kill the Dark Jedi before his mission was completed.."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
