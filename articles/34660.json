By doing so, all the acolytes emerged victorious from the trial. Though this angered her Overseer, the other students threatened to kill the overseer if any harm was done to Krovos. This unique approach to her trials caught the eye of Darth Decimus, who took her as an apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an apprentice, her victories following Korriban gained her recognition and she fought alongside the Empire's most notorious Sith such as Darth Marr and Darth Malgus.
