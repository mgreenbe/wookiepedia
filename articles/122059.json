He chanced upon Jedi Master Maks Leem, who had lined up for his station. The Jedi Master at that time was working undercover for a mission along with her companions, fellow Jedi Master Jai Maruk and his Padawan Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy, Leem's own Padawan Whie Malreaux, and Grand Master Yoda, who was hidden inside an R2 droid as a disguise. Charpp took Leem aside after scanning the Jedi and told her that he recognized the unique signature readings of her hidden lightsaber, thus deducing that Leem was a Jedi. When Leem confirmed her identity, Charpp became excited at the opportunity of meeting an actual Jedi and readily offered his help on her mission. Faced with an overeager admirer, Leem pretended that the Order knew Charpp was a loyal supporter of the Jedi; and that they specifically chose his security line for her to go through, knowing that he would not blow her cover. Ecstatic that he was able to help the Jedi on her mission, Charpp allowed Leem to go on her way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
