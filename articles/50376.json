Known to the galaxy by the Ruusan Reformation of 1000 BBY, the species was distinguished by its lack of cellular structures and thus midi-chlorians, symbiotic life-forms that lived inside cells and allowed their host to detect the Force. This characteristic earned the fractal urchins a mention in the Jedi trainee guidebook The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, first published as early as the year 990 BBY and still in use during the Clone Wars that began in 22 BBY. Authored by a Jedi biologist, Bowspritz, the \"Galactic Bestiary\" section of the book described fractal urchins as an example of animals that were connected to the Force despite their lack of midi-chlorians. More detailed information on the species was available in the Jedi Archives on the Galactic Republic capital world, Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first and thus far only mention of fractal urchins in Star Wars canon comes from The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, a reference book written by Daniel Wallace and published in 2010."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
