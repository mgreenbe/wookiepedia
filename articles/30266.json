It could be used in the player's home as a decoration, and was made by collecting all the parts for the \"viewscreen printer\" item which can be looted from various enemies in the game. When all were collected and combined, it produced one of three random paintings, the others being Cargo Port Blueprint and Freedom. With the introduction of the New Game Enhancements in 2005, several items required for the viewscreen printer were no longer obtainable, making these paintings valuable collector's items within the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
