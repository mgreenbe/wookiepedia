The Human took part in a skirmish on the Outer Rim planet Ragmar V against the clone armies of the Galactic Republic. The battle was originally planned to be set against a detachment of clone troopers and their Jedi commander, Joc Sah. The fight suddenly took a different turn, however, when the clone troopers were ordered to execute Order 66; a directive that labeled all Jedi as traitors to the Republic and that they were to be executed immediately. The settlement leader, a Human named Gaan, made peace with Joc Sah, and together with the other settlers they repelled the clone troopers. The girl took her place on a roof with one other outcast for the duration of the skirmish. Once the battle had been momentarily won, the girl and the other outcasts welcomed Joc Sah as one of their own. The outcasts then proceeded to counter another force of troopers that arrived to ensure Sah's death. The girl made use of two blasters during the second battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
