It was a short track that was overlooked by Jabba's Palace. First the track would split with two caves. The left one would bring you to an open dune sea. The right one would lead to glass-shaped rock formations that would lead to the end of the first path or you could go through a hole that would go past jabba's palace. Either way, both paths will lead to a narrow path with very tall sand acting as walls. Then it again splits into two small paths which lead to another narrow path leading to the finish line. Anakin Skywalker favored this track."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
