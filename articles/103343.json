It was very large, with abundant natural vegetation, and a number of several story-high waterfalls that poured more water in. While Zeltrons and a number of other species could dive off them, it was considered too high to be safe for the average Human. Nevertheless, Cade Skywalker and Jariah Syn jumped off it, with Cade using the Force to slow them down. Skywalker later remarked that his Master, Wolf Sazen, would kill him if he saw him using the Force for thrill seeking."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pirate Rav, an associate of Skywalker, his crew, and Jool arrived with some henchmen while they were partying. Jool told Cade that while she loved him, his rowdiness in her cantinas were becoming costly, and asked him to keep the damages to a minimum. He obliged, knocking them out by throwing one henchman off the waterfall and chopping the other in the neck in a pool. Rav then offered Cade and his crew a mission on Wayland for one million credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
