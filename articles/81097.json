Its largest continent was Basin. The capital city was Hreas Port City. It was the headquarters of Galladinium Galactic Exports, one of the galaxy's largest shipping corporations, founded by Galladinium around 50 BBY, from which it published annuals of Galladinium's Galactic Datalog of Fantastic Technology. The Galactic Empire banned the Datalog since it was being used by the Rebel Alliance to purchase weapons. Hreas contained the Commerce Concourse, where a series of gang-rivalry riots broke out shortly before the Battle of Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
