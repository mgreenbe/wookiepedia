The man who eventually earned the distinction of the being the Empire's first new Grand Moff, Odile Vaiken, emerged as a critical figure in these dark years.

This nascent but efficient army courageously battled the powerful native creatures on Dromund Kaas to carve out the space for a secure civilization. In later years, as the new Sith Empire grew in size and strength, Vaiken went on to establish the foundation for the modern Imperial navy and set the standards for constructing a fleet that would one day emerge from exile and crush the Republic. For common Imperial citizens, Vaiken became a model for their highest aspirations, proving that even non-Force users would play a vital role in restoring the Sith Empire to prominence and power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "|pl=Timeline 11: Rebirth of the Sith Empire\n|ru=\u0425\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f 11: \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\n}}"}]}
