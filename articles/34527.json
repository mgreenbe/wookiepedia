The primary continental mass consisted mainly of softly rolling hills. Most of the small settlements spread across the planet's surface managed to maintain a level of homeostasis with the surrounding environment. It was, at one point in its history, under the control of Imperial Governor Bellows, who ruled from the capital city of Symt. The Imperials were able to keep order with a minimum of strong-arming, and the travelers along the trade route did little to bother the natives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
