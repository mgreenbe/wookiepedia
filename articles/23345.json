The Page's Commandos, led by Lieutenant Judder Page, were dispatched by New Republic High Command onto the planet, where they destroyed a shield generator that powered cannons, placed an electrified net over a hangar launch chute and grounded a wing of TIE fighters, and penetrated the Imperial Governor Nistola's heavily armed flying fortress, forcing his surrender. A New Republic invasion force led by General Garret then landed and was able to take the capital without firing a shot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
