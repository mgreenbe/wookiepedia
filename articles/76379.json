He was considered a handsome man, with stony features and a jagged scar starting at his lip and running past his nose. His hair had turned white by the time he reached his fifties. Vo-Shay's trademark was an obsidian pendant, which many people believed was a mystical artifact and the source of his good luck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 50 BBY, Vo-Shay piloted his freighter, the Ashanda Ray into a dangerous region of space called the Tyus Cluster. There, he was trapped in the island of stability, at the center of a cluster of black holes. He would have died there, had he not met the ghost of a previous victim, a Jedi Master named Aryzah. She taught him a little about the ways of the Force, and somehow helped Vo-Shay escape the cluster. Aryzah's ghost came along with him when he escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though some fifty years had passed to the outside galaxy, the gravitational fields of the Tyus Cluster had distorted the flow of time in Vo-Shay's frame of reference. As Vo-Shay put it, \"time was nonexistent\" at the cluster's center: he did not age a day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vo-Shay promptly returned to the gambling tables, skinning a Herglic named Doune out of a quarter of a million credits. The single credit he had bet at the beginning of the sabacc game had been provided by a farmboy named Nyo, who hoped to use his share of the cash to buy a lightsaber. Nyo got his lightsaber, and Vo-Shay decided to sign him on as the first mate of the Ashanda Ray, where Aryzah decided to teach Nyo the ways of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
