As neither Gos of Iit were skilled at astrogation they used the last set of coordinates put into the starship's Navigation computer as their destination, bringing them to the planet Jakku. On Jakku, Gos began working as a salvage merchant in Blowback Town using the freighter, which he then renamed to Beloved Bophine. Iit, who began working as a scavenger on Jakku in 14 ABY, introduced Gos to the pilot Poe Dameron in 34 ABY, who needed to get off Jakku in order to reunite with the Resistance he served. As the pilot had helped Iit escape from an encounter with the criminal Strus clan, Gos agreed to help and transported Dameron to the moon Yavin 4 in the freighter. Dameron later looked into the pasts of Iit and Gos and wrote about them and the Beloved Bophine in his flight log."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Beloved Bophine was first mentioned in Poe Dameron: Flight Log, a reference book written by Michael Kogge and released on November 1, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
