After spending four years studying the technology of the ancient Rakata species on Belsavis, Godera worked with the Republic Military to develop powerful superweapons, though he would resign before most of his ideas were put into action. The Planet Prison, Death Mark laser, Power Guard Enhancement System, and the Shock Drum were all created by the initiative using Godera's notes and research."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
