Skeezer was dispatched by Admiral Termo to the Yavin system to determine the fate of the first Death Star in 0 ABY. There, he was shot down by Rebel forces and captured. To extract information from the perfectly healthy Imperial Han Solo posed as a doctor and told him that he would need to be treated with bacta from the Death Star. Unbeknownst to Skeezer the entire supply of bacta had of course perished with the station. The panicked Imperial revealed that the Death Star's supply had in fact been contaminated. Upon learning that \"Doctor\" Chewbacca would have to operate, Skeezer fainted. The Rebels then imprisoned him, but he escaped to Yavin 8 where he was killed in a fight with a Rebel pilot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skeezer was a male captain serving in the Imperial Navy. Around the time of the Battle of Yavin, he was stationed aboard the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Liquidator while it waited in the Delrakkin system for a communication from Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. The last that had been heard from the Grand Moff was that he was heading into the Yavin system with the Death Star battlestation to destroy a key Alliance to Restore the Republic base on the moon Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Admiral Termo, who was utilizing the Liquidator as a command ship, was concerned by the fact that he had not heard from Tarkin since, and had Skeezer sent to the forward launch bay and make ready to depart for the Yavin system. The captain was to take his modified and downsized Carrack-class light cruiser to Yavin, and Termo personally briefed Skeezer in the launch bay. Skeezer's remit was to determine what had happened to the Death Star and Tarkin, deal with the situation if applicable, and then return to the Liquidator. The admiral instructed Skeezer to refrain from making any hyperspace transmissions lest the Alliance be listening. In addition to the cruiser's four crewmen, Skeezer would command a detachment of three stormtrooper squads, and three TIE pilots, who would fly the TIE/LN starfighters mounted on the cruiser's external rack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skeezer rarely betrayed any emotion in his facial expressions, although the prospect of his mission to the Yavin system gave him cause for concern."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
