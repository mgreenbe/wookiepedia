However, unlike its modern equivalents, the autoblaster fired a salvo of wild bolts, powerful but not extremely accurate. The autoblaster was reintroduced during the Galactic Civil War, now as an updated version of blaster technology. Designed for the B-wing fighter, this modern autoblaster had an even higher rate of fire than other blasters, but was not available to other models until after the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
