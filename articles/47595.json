Femi checked into Coruscant Control, reporting that there was nothing in her vicinity, and shared a brief conversation with the dispatcher. She then noticed Sith ships in her area and asked the flagship for clearance codes. The Sith and the Republic were meeting at Alderaan to discuss terms for ending the Great Galactic War, a galaxy-wide conflict that had been taking place between them for decades, and the unexpected arrival of their fleet caught the duo off-guard. Rather than transmit a response back to her, Angral, a Sith Lord from the Empire and leader of the assault, ordered his ship to fire on the satellite, killing Femi and her co-worker. This began the Sacking of Coruscant, a battle between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. The conflict ended with the Treaty of Coruscant, an agreement that forced the Republic to abandon long-time allies and give many outlying worlds over to the Sith and put an end to the Great Galactic War in favor of the Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This male was light-skinned with brown hair and worked aboard a satellite orbiting Coruscant for the Coruscant Security Force.
