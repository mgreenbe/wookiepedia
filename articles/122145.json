At some point, the pair flew the ship from the planet Fhost to a star system in the Unknown Regions, where they planned to salvage a derelict ship. However, the crime lord Reegas Vance also planned to salvage the derelict and to prevent Faal and Idi-Shael from interfering with his plans, he fired upon the Seeker with his YT-2400 light freighter Blackstar, disabling the Seeker. Faal and Idi-Shael then donned space suits and abandoned the Seeker, while Vance led a boarding party over to the stricken vessel. Faal and Idi-Shael subsequently stole the Blackstar and departed the system, leaving Vance stranded aboard the Seeker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
