At some pint during the last decades of the Galactic Republic, Nimmel was dispatched to the planet Longwind to monitor the activities of the residents of a former prisoner settlement on the world. While on patrol, he was attacked by the Trandoshan bounty hunter Agnuk, who broke the Jedi's arm, though Nimmel ultimately succeeded at killing his assailant. Moments later, Agnuk's son Cradossk stumbled across his father's corpse and in a rage, he sprang on Nimmel and broke his legs, then sank his teeth into the Jedi's neck and murdered him. Cradossk later wrote about his encounter with Nimmel in his autobiography Making a Killing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
