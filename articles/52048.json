A single Venator-class Star Destroyer carried four full fighter wings, which amassed to more than 400 starfighters. Although officially part of the Republic Navy, the Starfighter Corps was seen as an independent military branch. Despite this, Grand Army of the Republic ground units such as the 501st Legion jointly maintained their own starship units concurrent with the Starfighter Corps.

Flotillas could be led by an individual with the rank of captain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Additionally, naval squadrons were deployed by the Republic Navy, and were its fundamental combat unit. Squadrons utilized different formations during operations. Attack formation was when naval squadrons concentrated their fire on to breakthrough even the thickest defenses. Evasive maneuvers were used to juke along a wide path while maintaining a general direction, confusing target locks and manual firing. Running dark referred to when squadrons disabled transmitters, transponders, active sensors, and running lights to avoid detection. Sensor sweep was a formation used so that ships of the squadron separated in a wide area so that each vessel could scan to a unique arc to effectively sense all directions, while a screen formation was a tactic used by squadrons to arrange themselves in a tight formation in order to make full use of deflector shields and armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personnel"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Command"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the onset of the Clone Wars, the Republic Navy consisted of personnel from planetary defense forces of various Republic star systems as well as members of the Judicial Forces.

They were capable of outmaneuvering a single menacing warship as well as organizing the defense fleet of an entire star system. In due part thanks to many officers having to outwit pirates before the war, Republic Navy officers were also very familiar with hyperspace routes and were able to operate along dangerous obstacles that would trouble less experienced navigators. During the war, Republic Navy officers were a symbol to the crews they commanded, whether it was captaining a single starship or coordinating the attack of an entire armada. The successful naval officers not only ensured victory in orbital space battles, but they also paved the way for clone troopers to travel between worlds and undertake successful ground strikes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi officers worked closely Republic Navy officials to lead naval units.

After the Republic victory, a task force of Republic ships departed and participated in the Battle of Kashyyyk, where they destroyed Separatist ships in orbit and subsequently landed troops on the surface, with one Venator landing at Kachirho City. Around this time, a Republic Venator, the Albedo Brave, was involved in the Bracca Invasion, and General Plo Koon patrolled the skies of Cato Neimoidia with an ARC-170 starfighter contingent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Coruscant, Republic Navy forces deployed the 332nd Division which participated in the Siege of Mandalore in order to capture Darth Maul. When General Grievous was located on Utapau, Obi-Wan's fleet of at least two Venators launched an ambush in Pau City, initiating the Battle of Utapau. At this time, the Separatist fleet units that were locked in combat with the Bright Nebula Fleet for four months finally managed to break through on Lokori. Jedi General Chiata and her Venator participated in a battle against a Separatist dreadnought and, despite victory, were forced to crash on Zeffo following substantial damage.

The clone troopers attacked Tano on the bridge, although she managed to escape and free Maul as a diversion. Going their separate ways, Tano eventually managed to capture Commander Rex and conduct a surgery to remove his inhibitor chip, freeing him from Clone Protocol 66. Fighting broke out throughout the vessel when they looked for a means of escape, during which Maul sabotaged the ship's hyperdrive. This forced it out of hyperspace, sending the ship plummeting towards a moon. After Maul fought through clone forces and escaped on a shuttle, Tano and Rex managed to escape in a Y-wing after a prolonged confrontation in the hangar.

During the escape, Tapal managed to sabotage the Albedo Brave, but when they both reached the escape pod bay, they were confronted by a large group of clone troopers. After a brief firefight, Kestis and a fatally wounded Tapal managed to board an escape pod and launch towards Bracca, with the Albedo Brave self-destructing moments later. Jedi General Plo Koon was shot down by his ARC-170 escorts while in the skies of Cato Neimoidia following the battle there, and his fighter crashed into several buildings in a city.

Acting quickly, Palpatine consolidated his authority to ensure stability with his new position and set to reorganize the remnants of the Republic Navy and the Grand Army of the Republic under Imperial control. As such, the Republic Navy transitioned into the Imperial Navy, which eventually adopted the Tarkin Doctrine. Early in the Imperial Era, Venators were still used by Imperial naval forces, as were V-wing starfighters, ARC-170 starfighters, and Theta-class T-2c shuttles, but the process of adopting new craft began early into the Empire's reign. During these early months, Lieutenant Commander Orson Callan Krennic met with Admiral Tarkin aboard his Imperial-class Star Destroyer at a shipyard that had been ravaged during the Clone Wars.

With the end of the Clone Wars, Separatist holdouts were created throughout the galaxy. With some holdouts being well-defended, the Onager-class Star Destroyer was produced in order to swiftly defeat the Separatist remnants and enforce Imperial rule. The Republic Venator-class Star Destroyer Vensenor was decommissioned and placed in orbit above Arkanis and hosted the the Imperial Vensenor Flight Academy, led by Commandant Bythen Forrel, a former Republic starfighter ace.

In a desert world, destroyed Republic starfighters and gunships were scattered across the site of a battlefield. Other Republic Navy assets were simply abandoned, including a Haven-class medical station which became derelict and stranded.
