The first two, Philanthropy and Philosophy, were written by August Hahn and focused on the Confederation Rock Rush, the exploration of the Cularin system asteroid belt. The third adventure, Philology, was written by Morrie Mullins and Christina Nichols for use at Gencom 2002; in it, Len Markus stole the Darkstaff from the asteroid belt, which resulted in the Cularin system disappearing for ten years and so moved the campaign to the time of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Adventures"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Associated articles"}]}
