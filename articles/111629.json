That year, the Praetorite Vong vanguard of the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong ventured into the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy in what became the start of the Yuuzhan Vong War, making forays to the planets Sernpidal and Dubrillion and setting up a base on the ice world of Helska IV. In response, the New Republic dispatched a task force to eliminate the aggressors in the Helska system, led by the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Rejuvenator\u2014under the command of Commander Warshack Rojo\u2014and featuring six Ranger-class gunships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rojo intended to have the Ranger-class gunships hold off the Praetorite Vong coralskippers while the Rejuvenator took care of the enemy base. However, although the initial engagement went well, the alien capabilities of the enemy forces soon overwhelmed the New Republic's task force, with the Rejuvenator going down and three of the Ranger-class gunships being destroyed, two of which were smashed into a large coralskipper when it used a gravity-manipulating dovin basal to suck them in. The remains of the task force retreated, and, though a successful counterattack was launched that saw the destruction of Helska IV and the Praetorite Vong base, the commanders of the surviving gunships opted to wait for additional reinforcements rather than joining the second strike."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Action at Ord Mantell and Bilbringi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in 25 ABY, five Ranger-class gunships took part in another New Republic task force that aimed to protect the planet Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system against an imminent Yuuzhan Vong attack.

During the fighting, a pair of gunships dispatched dozens of coralskippers as they sought to outflank a Yuuzhan Vong warship.
