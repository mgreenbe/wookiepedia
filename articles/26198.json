The most prominent feature was a large dome amidships, thought by Alliance observers to house cloaking equipment, but for the most part the planes of the armored hull were as blank as an expanse of duracrete, interrupted only by recessed weapons mountings."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Offensive and defensive systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like most Star Destroyer designs, the Chiss capital ships were powerful, but were also vulnerable to a concerted starfighter assault.
