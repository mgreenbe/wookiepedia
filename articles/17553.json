Each behemoth claimed a personal territory and memorized the location of every tree, pool of water and vine. While not fast enough to keep pace with most creatures, it often fed after pursued prey became entangled in hanging vines or tree limbs. These creatures spent a great deal of time waiting in ambush. Once a black behemoth was aware that food was nearby, it sprang to life, ready for the hunt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
