Toons was a scarred veteran of a hundred battles, and his Y-wing squadron supported Alphabet Squadron in the hunt for the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, which included the attack on Pandem Nai and later the campaign in the Cerberon system. In 5 ABY, when General Hera Syndulla's New Republic forces caught up to the 204th in the Red Yars system, Toons and Chass na Chadic were the only New Republic pilots to loose shots, but neither was in range when the 204th jumped to lightspeed. Later, Toons fought at the battle over the planet Chadawa, where he and his fellow bomber pilots were tasked with destroying two Raider-class corvettes, in a stealthy mission to prevent the 204th from destroying planet that resulted in a victory. However, Toons was the highest-ranking survivor of only four Hail Squadron pilots to survive the battle. Toons and his fellow pilots were later present at a meeting, held shortly before the Battle of Jakku, in which their wing's commander, Wyl Lark informed the unit of his decision not to fight in the coming battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Pandem Nai"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Boyvech Toons served as a pilot in the New Republic. He flew a BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber for Hail Squadron, one of the squadrons serving in a battle group led by General Hera Syndulla. Hail Squadron was one of four squadrons based on Syndulla's flagship, the Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ship Lodestar, the other three being Meteor Squadron, Vanguard Squadron and Alphabet Squadron. Some weeks after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Hail Squadron, Toons included, took part in an attack on the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing at the tibanna gas mining planet Pandem Nai."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the attack, Hail Squadron helped provide a blockade behind a minefield protecting the inner Pandem Nai system along with Meteor Squadron, Vanguard Squadron and the Lodestar and its escorts while Alphabet Squadron attacked the 204th's base of operations at Pandem Nai itself. When the planet's gas clouds began burning, threatening civilization on the world, Syndulla ordered for the blockade to push through the minefield to assist in preventing the firestorm. The firestorm was ultimately stopped, although the chaos allowed a large portion of the 204th to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 5 ABY, Syndulla's battle group invaded the Cerberon system in the Deep Core. Toons and Hail Squadron took part in the campaign, where the squadron notably participated in an assault on the planet Troithe's capital city, which resulted in the death of the Imperial Governor Hastemoor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Chasing the 204th"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 5 ABY, Syndulla's battle group, with the New Republic refitted Star Destroyer Deliverance serving as the flagship, travelled to the Croynar sector based on information that the 204th had been presence in that sector. As part of the Deliverances's starfighter wing, alongside the New Republic's Flare Squadron and Wild Squadron, Hail Squadron traveled to the planet Midgor and found that the Imperial fighter wing had attacked the freighter Diamond Tor and its escorts. The Deliverance and its wing later found the 204th in the Ciaox Verith system by following a communications signal burst, but the Imperial group escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another comm burst led the Deliverance and its wing to find the 204th in the Red Yars system. Toons and the other New Republic fighters exited hyperspace readily deployed, but only he and the A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter pilot Chass na Chadic were able to fire shots at the enemy fighter wing before its forces escaped, both pilots being out of range regardless. The New Republic forces continued to pursue the 204th through a number of other systems, Hail Squadron taking part in the skirmishes. The pursuit arrived at the ancient manmade ocean world Chadawa, where the Imperial fighter wing became enclosed under the world's mechanical orbital rings, which channeled particle tides of radiation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hail Squadron and the rest of the Deliverance's wing skirmished with the 204th when the particle tides left openings for starfighters to pass through. It was soon discovered by Syndulla and her colleagues that the 204th's Raider-class corvettes were sabotaging satellites to culminate high amounts of radiation before plummeting down to the surface of Chadawa. In response, a plan was formulated to prevent Chadawa's devastation, which involved Hail Squadron, led by Alphabet Squadron's Captain Nath Tensent, carrying out an attack on the Raiders. The pilots of the Deliverance's wing prepared to deploy and rushed to their fighters. As they went to their fighters, Starfighter Commander Wyl Lark approached Toons and told him that there would not be another Alderaan, a planet destroyed by the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boyvech Toons appeared in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
