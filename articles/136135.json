In 6 ABY, the Human scholar, Ebenn Q3 Baobab recommended the dish as one of his favorites in his book, Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide and advised any Humans visiting the spaceport of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine to try it in the Hutt eateries found there. The dish was mentioned in the Huttese section of the guide, in which Baobab recommended that it be eaten with gloves. The section also explained that Huttese dishes were usually eaten casually in a random order, with utensils being optional and prices being high. In 19 ABY, strained keebadas were served at a feast held by the Hutt crime lord Popara Anjiliac Diresto in his penthouse on the planet Nal Hutta."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Strained keebadas were first mentioned in the book Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide, which was written by Ben Burtt in 2001.
