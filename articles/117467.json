During the Clone Wars, he was secretly kidnapped by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which was orchestrated by Count Dooku with help from Ziro, Rotta's great-uncle. The plot was meant to discredit the Jedi Order and scuttle negotiations between the Galactic Republic and the Hutts, but the Jedi were able to rescue him. He was kidnapped by Asajj Ventress and taken to the planet Teth. Then the Jedi came and got him. He then became sick and nearly died on his way to Tatooine, but survived thanks to Ahsoka Tano. After Anakin Skywalker and Tano evaded Dooku, who tried to kill Rotta and blame the Jedi, Rotta was returned to his father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rotta appears in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film, where he was vocalized by David Acord.
