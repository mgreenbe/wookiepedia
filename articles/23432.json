Once removed from the tube in which it was kept, the paste would set quickly and could be used as a type of molecular glue to repair broken bones in about five minutes. However, the paste was designed for use primarily by insectoids and when used by endoskeletal species, it was required for the paste to be injected directly into the damaged area of the body, which could be an extremely painful experience. In addition, if too much was injected into a damaged limb, the overdose could cause the limb to die."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
