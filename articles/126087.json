The army of the Sith Eternal was the culmination of an elaborate contingency that was meant to establish the everlasting reign of a new, resurgent Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Eternal's army consisted of a large number of legions of elite and loyal Sith troopers that drew inspiration from a dark and ancient Sith legacy.

To do so, the Sith Eternal used a military force that consisted of an expansive Sith armada working in conjunction with a vast army."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The army of the Sith Eternal was organized into several types of military units. Overall, the army was organized into legions, which used the ancient numerical definition of 5,000 soldiers. The legions, staffed by Sith trooper officers in the positions of commanders, the the legions themselves were then divided into squads of ten soldiers who were led by a sergeant. The squad then further composed of three triads, which were fire teams consisting of three soldiers. The triads were led by a lance corporal who led two corporals. Legions of the Sith Eternal's army were identified in two ways; by a numerical designation and by a namesake of an ancient Sith Lord. Several legions within the army were the 3rd Legion, 5th Legion, 17th Legion, 26th Legion, 39th Legion, and the 44th Legion. They were also respectively named after the Sith Lords Revan, Andeddu, Darth Tanis, Tenebrous, Phobos, and Desolous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another type of unit used by the Sith Eternal's army was battalion, with at least one, the 105th Battalion, being active. Squads of aerial infantry troops were organized into ten soldiers, and were named after weapons. Several examples included Lanvorak Squad, Parang Squad, and Warblade Squad."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Composition"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Composed entirely of Sith troopers, the dark side warriors were secretly cultivated on the Sith world of Exegol deep in the Unknown Regions. After the Sith's trial and error of clone troopers during the Clone Wars, Sith troopers underwent flash-imprinting and loyalty conditioning that was built upon and further advanced beyond Kaminoan clone trooper procedures. The result was that the Sith troopers were superiorly more loyal and machine-like than even the stormtroopers of the Sith Eternal's puppet government, the First Order, which were trained from childhood. Although they bore the name of the revived sect of the dark side, Sith troopers were not able to use the power of the Force. Rather, their red armor evoked an aura of dread, spilled blood, Sith lightsaber blades, and of the elite Imperials from the Sith-controlled Galactic Empire which once ruled the galaxy. Sith troopers who excelled and were considered the army's best, were elevated into a cadre of elite royal guards known as the Sovereign Protectors. These Sovereign Protectors were stationed in the amphitheater that housed the Throne of the Sith within the Sith Citadel on Exegol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An elite aerial variant of Sith troopers, designated as Sith Jetpack Troopers, were considered the next evolution of the standard jetpack infantry. Due to their intense training and advanced gear, Sith jet troopers were capable of intelligent, devastating, rapid strikes. Working alongside standard ground Sith troopers and being too small and too fast to be targeted by anti-aircraft weaponry, they provided efficient air cover for ground operations. Although similar in appearance to the standard First Order jet trooper, the crucial difference between the two types of warriors were in discipline, ferocity, and loyalty to an undying cause, which instilled Sith jet troopers with a fearless aggression."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sith Troopers were armed with ST-W48 blasters and red-colored FWMB-10 repeating blasters.
