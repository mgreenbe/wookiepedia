The Yam'rii, a species derogatorily called the Huk by the Kaleesh, had received backing from the Galactic Republic and the Jedi in their war against the Kaleesh, in which Grievous had been a leader. After the Yam'rii tarnished several sacred Kaleesh burial grounds, Grievous discarded his offworld responsibilities and returned to his homeworld Kalee for vengeance. At a landing site along with his Izvoshra, elite Kaleesh warriors, Grievous knelt before the Kaleesh individual, who believed the Republic ignored Kaleesh appeals and favoured the Yam'rii."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The individual called Grievous the \"last hope\" for their people, annointing the general by drawing red markings across his face with a finger. The Kaleesh blessed Grievous, calling for the spirits of his ancestors to watch over him and his soldiers, to which the General retorted that he would be fine as long as his troop carrier, the Martyr, held together.
