Vindican was trained in the dark side of the Force by his Sith Master, the legendary Sith hero, Darth Ikoral, and was widely believed to be the Lord's greatest student. Around 3712 BBY, Ikoral, a firm believer in the superiority of the Sith species, led an expedition into the Unknown Regions to find any surviving colonies of Purebloods. Now master-less, Vindican advanced to the level of Sith Lord and took an apprentice of his own\u2014the young and talented Human Malgus. The two served the Sith Empire during the early years of the Great Galactic War, and in 3681 BBY, the Sith Master and his apprentice joined the Empire's campaign to retake the planet Korriban, which had been under Republic and Jedi control. An armada of thirty Imperial battlecruisers, including Vindican and Malgus, jumped to Korriban space and engaged the small Republic force stationed there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vindican and Malgus detached from the Imperial fleet and boarded a shuttle to dock with the Republic's space station orbiting Korriban. After they landed in a hangar on the station, the Sith Master, flanked by Malgus, spotted two Jedi\u2014a Zabrak Jedi Master, Kao Cen Darach, and his Human Padawan, Satele Shan\u2014and confronted them. With his double-bladed lightsaber, Vindican attacked his Jedi counterpart, while Malgus fought Shan. The Sith Master advanced against Darach, whom he engaged in a swift flurry of swordplay before he unleashed a volley of Force lightning at Shan. After he was Force-pushed across the hangar by the Jedi Master, Vindican blasted lightning at an escaping smuggler's freighter\u2014the vessel in which the Jedi intended to escape the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shan boarded the departing freighter and left her master behind to fight Vindican and Malgus alone. The Sith Master engaged Darach once again, in an attack coordinated with the flanking Malgus. When the Sith Master unleashed lightning at the Zabrak, Darach deflected it with his and Shan's lightsaber toward Malgus. Darach's two lightsabers also struck the right side of Sith Master's head, which lifted his helmet off his face and left a scar over his right eye. Vindican was incapacitated when Darach activated one of the ends of Shan's double-bladed weapon through the Sith's abdomen. The Sith Master's fallen double-bladed weapon was taken by Malgus, who engaged and killed Darach with it. After Malgus returned to Vindican, he exchanged words with him, before executing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The aggressive Vindican had red skin and yellow eyes.

When the Pureblood Sith did not stop Darach's apprentice from leaving the station, his apprentice, Malgus, regarded him as a failure; however, Vindican believed that it was only the beginning of the Sith's reemergence.
