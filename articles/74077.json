In the middle of the battle, the Rebel leader Leia Organa sent a squadron of bombers to eliminate Vader, however they were shot down by Karbin's forces as he landed on the planet. While Karbin's forces attacked the Rebels, Karbin personally dueled Vader, believing that with four lightsabers against Vader's one, he would be victorious. Using the Force, Vader got the upper hand on Karbin and severed one of his arms. Eventually, Vader lured Karbin onto a natural bridge made of rock and had his minion Doctor Aphra crash her ship, the Ark Angel, into him. Karbin barely survived the impact, and was executed shortly after by Vader. In his last moments of life, he realized that Vader had a personal reason for pursuing Luke, but never knew what it was."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
