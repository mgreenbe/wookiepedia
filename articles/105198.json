They were the equivalent to an eye. Numbers of photoreceptors could vary depending on the size and model of a droid. For instance, R2-D2 had one, while EV-9D9 had three. Many droids, like C-3PO, had two. Some could have them in different areas. For instance, General Grievous' MagnaGuards had a built-in one in their torso to enable them to fight without their heads.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
