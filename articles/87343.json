In the game he served as an Imperial ultimate gear vendor, accepting only commendations as payment. Marvon's armor conceals what species he is in the game. He was later removed as a vendor and NPC in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, he remains in the game, as his character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
