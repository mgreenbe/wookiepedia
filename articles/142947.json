It was also known as the Mercevian Nagua maneuver after the pirate Mercevian Nagua who favored the tactic. Essentially a variation of the Barricade, the Dagger called for a saboteur to infiltrate the target vessel with the intention of disabling the hyperdrive. This allowed the saboteur to force the ship from hyperspace at a prearranged location. The Dagger was favored by privateer crews as it often accomplished the capture of a vessel quickly. Additionally, saboteurs caught in the act were usually only arrested."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A variation of the Dagger involved targeting ships with large, transient crew rosters and placing a number of infiltrators among the crew.
