Commissioned by the Galactic Republic to catalogue worlds around 532 BBY, Schmireland set out with a team and never returned to Coruscant, employing messenger droids to relay his discoveries. Avon Starros considered the almanac mostly useless as it gave information about worlds no one would want to visit, but uploaded a copy to her personal droid J-6 out of boredom. The almanac later came in handy after Starros was stranded on a jungle moon with several others, as it allowed her and J-6 to identify the moon as Wevo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
