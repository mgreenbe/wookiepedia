One of these examples was how Force Adepts felt when their masters died. Satele Shan, for instance, experienced a death convulsion upon her master's death at the hands of Malgus during a battle over Korriban. Years later, Aryn Leneer felt it upon the death of her own Master, Ven Zallow, to Malgus during the Sacking of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another example of a death convulsion was when many beings died simultaneously. One was created when Meetra Surik ordered the Mass Shadow Generator be used to end the Mandalorian Wars on Malachor V, and it was so powerful it rendered her and Darth Nihilus living wounds in the Force. Yoda felt this while on Kashyyyk when Order 66 was executed. Obi-Wan Kenobi also felt a death convulsion when the Death Star destroyed Alderaan, describing it as hearing the entire planet's population screaming, then being cut off suddenly. Students of the Jedi Praxeum experienced a convulsion when Kyp Durron destroyed Carida with his stolen Sun Crusher."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A third example of a death convulsion was triggered by the death of a particularly powerful Force-sensitive, or when a loved one was lost. Zekk felt this when Brakiss died as the Shadow Academy exploded. During a disastrous mission over Myrkr in 27 ABY, Jedi trained at the Jedi Praxeum and members of the Solo and Skywalker families felt Anakin Solo's death at the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong. The death of Mara Jade Skywalker at the hands of Anakin's fallen brother Jacen during the Second Galactic Civil War also produced a death convulsion, which was felt by Mara's husband, son, and sister-in-law. Jacen's own death to his sister Jaina also could possibly have caused a minor death convulsion, as Jaina and Tenel Ka Djo felt the Jacen they once knew die, rather than Darth Caedus, the Sith Lord he had become. Almost a century later, the death of Darth Krayt at the hands of Cade Skywalker caused his army of Sith troopers to go mad and commit suicide attacks against their fellow Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tsils of Nam Chorios produced particularly powerful death convulsions. Sith Acolyte Vestara Khai created a convulsion by killing a Tsil to help ensure the survival of her allies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
