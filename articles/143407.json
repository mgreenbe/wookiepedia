The region was extremely odd: mysterious lights were often seen, strange noises were common, and angry spirits were often spoken of. The region's animals were also unusually violent, even those that would normally flee at the presence of an intruder. The native group of Nightsisters named the region. The region amplified the Nightsisters' powers through death and sacrifice. After the Nardithi Nightsisters were killed in the Battle of Dathomir, Dathomir's wilderness reclaimed the land."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
