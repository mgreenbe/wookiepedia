Its makeup consisted of the fibers of the jung-ju tree bound together with synthetic materials, thus offering good, flexible protection. Fiber armor was especially designed to channel energy-weapon attacks away from the body. The fibers woven into its exterior caused it to absorb and harmlessly disperse energy damage. However, fiber armor was far from perfect; and lucky shots managed to pass through."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
