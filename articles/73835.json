In 3964 BBY Kamlin was slain by her own Master Raana Tey during the Padawan Massacre of Taris. After the only survivor of the class, Zayne Carrick, had cleared his name of the accusations of committing the massacre, he and Shel Jelavan founded Rogue Moon Project, an organization supposed to help refugees and wrongly accused fugitives like they themselves used to be. The families of other Padawans were brought together and Kamlin's sister began working at the organization."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
