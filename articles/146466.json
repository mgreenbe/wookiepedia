Time was measured with different concepts, such as millennia, centuries, and years. Time could be broken down even further into months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, though these divisions were used almost exclusively to refer to the duration of events, rather than the date or time on which they took place. Chronometers were used to track and indicate time through such units of measurement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Time travel was a hypothetical method of travel through time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Time keeping"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The last great conflict between the Jedi Order and the Sith resulted in a definitive Republic victory. Resetting its capital on Coruscant, history reset its chrono on this date from which the modern Galactic Republic was born. The time before this rebirth was forgotten as a dark age, lumped into a collective whole known as the \"Old Republic.\" As a result of this change, official calendars reset their zero year onto this date. The galaxy used this standardized dating system based off of the galactic capital Coruscant. On Coruscant, a year was made up of twelve months[source?] spanning 365 days of 24 hours each, with no leap years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During its reign, the Galactic Empire reset the dating system and utilized its own calendar. Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, Ithorian artist Gammit Chond used a calendar system that used the battle as the zero year from which to date galactic history. Dates before the Battle of Yavin were marked \"BBY\" and dates after the Battle of Yavin were marked \"ABY.\" Galactic Standard Time was a system of timekeeping used by the First Order.
