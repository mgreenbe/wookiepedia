In 3643 BBY, Jonkan's superior, Doctor Eli Tarnis, told the researchers that the Jedi were planning on shutting down the project, and Tarnis convinced his subordinates to bring him the prototype deep in the territory of the paramilitary Justicars' Brigade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, once they arrived, Tarnis revealed himself to be a Sith Lord and brutally murdered the researchers before escaping with the prototype. Jonkan was the only one still alive when a Jedi Knight and the Padawan Kira Carsen arrived, and Jonkan struggled to tell the Jedi everything that had happened. When the Knight offered to take the scientist to a medcenter, Jonkan refused, saying there was no time, and told the Jedi to track the Planet Prison by its heat signature. Since the weapon needed time to build up power, Jonkan urged the pair to destroy the weapon and save Coruscant. Thanks to Jonkan, the Knight was able to locate Tarnis and the weapon in the ruins of the Jedi Temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dark-skinned with brown eyes, Jonkan had gray hair by the time of the Cold War.
