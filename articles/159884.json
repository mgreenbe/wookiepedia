The Vehemence was in the Eriadu system to rendezvous with Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and take him on an inspection of the Death Star when his shuttle came under attack from Rebel forces. The Vehemence launched TIE/LN starfighters, but they were held off by Rebel Y-wings until the Rebels completed the boarding of Tarkin's shuttle. Tarkin, however was not aboard, having escaped shortly before the Rebels arrived, but the Rebels were able to rescue Tarkin's Mon Calamari slave, Gial Ackbar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Alliance would later use a recreation of the mission as a training simulation for new pilots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
