The speeder had eight built-in laser cannons that fired red blaster bolts, and its wings could be folded down for greater maneuverability during combat. It was also equipped with a hatch below its rear that could be opened to release a bomb. The repulsorcraft had a gray and blue paint-scheme with an inverted blue Confederate Roundel on both sides of its nose. During the Clone Wars, a blue-painted B1 battle droid used the Separatist droid speeder on the temperate moon Rugosa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Separatist droid speeder was released by Hasbro in 2011 as part of the second wave of the \"Shadows of the Dark Side\" toys, which in turn were a part of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars toy line."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
