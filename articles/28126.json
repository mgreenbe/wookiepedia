Automaton Rights Activists believed droids should be afforded the same rights as sentient beings, although their methods of protest varied greatly. While most Coalition members held peaceful demonstrations, there were known to have been several outright attacks on droid salvage yards. The Iron Knights attempted to gain the support of groups such as the Coalition of Automaton Rights Activists during the Clone Wars, but the politically-motivated actions of the Supreme Chancellor left the Knights with few allies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Coalition of Automaton Rights Activists had a more militant off-shoot, named the Mechanical Liberation Front."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
