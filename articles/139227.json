The Ranat pictured in this issue of Insider may in fact be Nevar Yalnal however this has yet to be clarified by Leland Chee. The confusion continues with both Takeel and Zutton reversed from their Decipher CCG images. In the Decipher cards Zutton is shown with a full head of hair while in the Insider image he now has patchy hair and a large hump. Takeel is shown by Decipher to have patchy hair and a large hump but in the Insider image he is shown with a full head of hair and a small hump. The identified images of Mosep Binneed and Tawss Khaa also differ from those used by Decipher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
