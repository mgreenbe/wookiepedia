Centuries before the Imperial Era, one of Noctu's moons was crammed to the core with resources, including gems, minerals, and spice. Because of the dangerous and extensive mining operations that exploited those resources, the moon ended up exploding, giving Noctu a planetary ring made of ice and boulders. Following that cataclysm, the Galactic Republic closed the mines down, deeming them too dangerous. However, when the Galactic Empire replaced the Republic, the new government reopened the mining operations, using convict labor to extract resources from the planet's ring."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
