After the Battle of Yavin, he created and took the leadership of the Nedgarr Bandits, named after himself. The criminals operated out of their hideout on the outskirts of Coronet City. Trae Nedgarr and the Bandits used to vandalize and rob local farms, such as Pol Handerin's farm. Circa 1 ABY, Lieutenant Mack Jasper of the Corellian Security Force dispatched a recruit to deal with the Nedgarr Bandits.
