In the years leading up to and during the Clone Wars, the agency fell victim to corruption and senatorial misuse. To counteract this, the organization's director met in secret with the directors of the three other major intelligence agencies, all of whom voted to quietly merge their agencies into a single organization. After the rise of the Empire, this combined agency emerged as Imperial Intelligence under the direction of former SBI head Armand Isard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
