Its design greatly resembled that of a J-type 327 Nubian starship. At some point following the destruction of the Death Star, Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker used the Breha to go on a secret mission to Tibrin, posing as diplomats from Naboo's House Berenko seeking to negotiate a trade deal. The Breha was blown into the water by Imperial forces during the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
