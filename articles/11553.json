Kemp's novel The Old Republic: Deceived, which was published on March 22, 2011. However, the name of the ship was changed to BT-7 Thunderclap after the novel's release, a fact which was confirmed by Kemp. The ship makes its first appearance as the BT-7 Thunderclap in the 2011 MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic where it is the ship utilized by members of the trooper class. In addition to being the trooper class ship, the BT-7 Thunderclap appears in many space combat missions for both Republic and Imperial-aligned players. Like all of the other player ships in The Old Republic, the BT-7 Thunderclap can be upgraded with various new weapons and defensive components that help the player survive increasingly challenging missions. The ship also has its own entry in the starships section of the Old Republic website's Holonet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
