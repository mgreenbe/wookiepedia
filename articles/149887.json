After months of discussion between the two sides, Tsillog traveled to the planet Coruscant to meet with the Mon Calamari ambassador Nuukol, and they developed a peace accord. To outline the proposals to their respective peoples, Tsillog planned to hold a press conference outside the Quarren embassy, while Nuukol would hold a similar conference outside the Mon Calamari embassy. However, Nuukol believed that Tsillog was not committed to developing a lasting peace between the two species, so the Mon Calamari ambassador hired the Rodian Loodux to assassinate Tsillog, hoping that Tsillog would be replaced by a more committed ambassador. However, a group of agents defeated Loodux and thwarted the attempt on Tsillog's life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
