She and her daughter, Klerin, attended the Republic Fair on the planet Valo, hiring the mercenary Ty Yorrick to protect them. Chekkat intended to offer to sell the prototype of a recainium-powered four-seven nullifier, a device that disrupted energy weapons, including blasters and lightsabers, to Senator Tia Toon for his Defense Force Program. Toon refused to buy the device, having both Chekkat and Yorrick imprisoned for the inventor bringing an illegal substance onto the world. The two managed to escape after Nihil marauders attacked the Republic Fair, and Chekkat located Klerin, parting ways with Yorrick in an attempt to escape Valo. However, the elder Chekkat was killed by a hragscythe that had escaped from the Lonisa City Zoo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
