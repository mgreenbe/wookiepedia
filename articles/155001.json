When Wraith pilot Hohass Ekwesh strafed the spaceport with his X-wing, it caused an emergency blackout throughout the spaceport. What the Wraiths didn't count on were the two TIE Fighters, piloted by Sun Leader and his wingman, that launched and proceeded to pursue Ekwesh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Simultaneously, the group of Garik Loran and Atril Tabanne managed to capture Bunker Aleph-One, the spaceport's command bunker. Pretending to be the controller killed by Tabanne, Loran issued the recall command for the TIE Fighters just when the wingman was about to vape Ekwesh's fighter. Upon landing their craft alongside the other TIEs that didn't launch, Loran's deception was caught and the information was relayed immediately to the wingman and Sun Leader. They tried to relaunch their fighters but were quickly shot down by the other two TIEs; piloted by Wedge Antilles and Falynn Sandskimmer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
