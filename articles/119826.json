As a result, Sand Rot was common on planets such as Tatooine. In 3643 BBY, Rowan Delk received the Sand Rot after being in Tatooine's vast deserts for a long period of time. Victims of the disease would often have symptoms of coughing, weakness, and a loss of feeling in their hands and fingers. Though it was treatable, the most widely preferred option was simply taking the patient offworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
