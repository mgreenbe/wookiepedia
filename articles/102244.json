Overseers were often Sith Lords, but holding that rank was not a requirement. Some of them were lower-ranking Sith who showed a talent for instruction. They were helped in their task by junior instructors known as Assistant Overseers. Some Overseers such as Overseer Ardran even took up their own apprentices."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
