He locates the missing Ewok children, and on the way back they investigate the shining object. The object is the Towani starcruiser, inside of which they find the human child Cindel. Outside, Mace attacks one of the Ewoks, and enters the starcruiser wreck with his blaster, where he threatens the other Ewoks, fearing that they are a threat and that they may have their parents.

He reaches inside the tree and is attacked by a temptor. After a struggle, he manages to pull his hand out with the help of the Ewoks.

They continue on their quest, but Deej stops to find Kaink the priestess, to whom he gives the crystal totem. Before she can join however, they must pass a test; Kaink hands Mace the crystal, which turns into a lizard.

He follows it outside, and an entire group of Wisties emerge from the ground. He calls for the other to come and look. Wicket instantly recognized them, alerts other tents to look.

Mace stands on one end, at which point Jeremitt and Catarine notice him. Chukha-Trok and Deej jump off a ledge onto the other end of the lever, which sends Mace flying up into the air, where he grabs hold of the cage containing his parents.

The idea emerged from his desire to make a movie for his young daughter Amanda, who was a particular fan of the Ewoks. Producer Thomas G. Smith pitched the idea to the major television networks, all of whom turned him down except ABC, who agreed on the condition that the project could fill two hours of television. Lucas later commented on the production: \"I hadn't done any TV and it was a chance to use many people in the company who hadn't had much experience with live-action production and experiment a little. The economics of TV are vastly different than the economics of film. It was done for very little money.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "John Korty served as director and cinematographer for the film, which was written by Lucas and Bob Carrau. Korty and Smith held auditions for most of the roles in Los Angeles and Marin County. The only roles which weren't auditioned were those of Warwick Davis and the other Ewok actors, who had already proven themselves in Return of the Jedi. Pre-production began in April 1984 and filming began that June, taking place throughout Marin County, California and the California Redwoods. The film shot for eight weeks, with a shooting schedule structured around child labor laws, as well as the children's school schedules. Davis had a tutor on set, with whom he studied for four hours per day. Lucas himself directed the film's re-shoots and edited some of the film's scenes. Davis also filmed one of the shots. After production was complete, Lucas and Smith oversaw post-production."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Lucas's suggestion, an actual hang-glider was built and flown in the film by an actor in an Ewok suit. Jon Berg designed the Gorax, which he portrayed with both a stop-motion model as well as himself in costume. A scene shot for the film but deleted had Mace come across a group of large flowers. He sticks his hand in one of them, which then tries to pull him underground. This was replaced in the final film with a scene of Mace sticking his hand into a tree. The film also originally had a different ending in which the characters dance in snow. Production Designer Joe Johnston commented on the film's special effects: \"The effects we did were pretty primitive. We did forced perspectives and glass paintings, back-to-basics things that had been around since the 1920s. George just told us to go out there and have some fun.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During production, Lucasfilm provided Warwick Davis and Eric Walker with a film camera, feeling that it would be educational for the two. Their on-set tutor had the idea for them to make a documentary about the making of The Ewok Adventure. Davis and Walker, calling themselves W&W Productions, proceeded to shoot behind-the-scenes footage, which they edited in their hotel room using Lucasfilm equipment. The documentary wasn't publicly released at the time, and was thought of as a private \"home movie\" for the two. When the Ewok films debuted on DVD in 2004, Eric Walker expressed his disappointment with the DVD's lack of extras, and felt that the Ewok Adventure documentary should have been included. In July 2006, Walker announced on his website that he would publish a book about working with George Lucas entitled Growing up on Skywalker Ranch. In 2011, he opened a Kickstarter project to raise funds to complete the book\u2014by then retitled Growing Up in a Galaxy Far, Far Away. The campaign was successful, raising well over the original goal. One of the gifts for donating to the project was a DVD of the Ewok Adventure documentary.

However, a sequel\u2014Ewoks: The Battle for Endor\u2014was filmed in the summer of 1985 and aired that November on ABC. It picks up not long after the first film, and focuses on Cindel and the Ewoks' battle against a group of pirates. In late 1985, Lucas told Starlog that further Ewok films were planned, and both Warwick Davis and Eric Walker believed that a third film was in the works.
