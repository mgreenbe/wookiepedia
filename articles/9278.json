Around 232 BBY, she was a member of a team sent to the planet Elphrona to capture the Blythe family so they could be held for ransom. While the pirates were transporting their captives to their starships, Asaria, sitting in the cart to watch the prisoners, was violently flung out when Ottoh Blythe, who had been feigning unconsciousness, whistled to startle the captured steelees the Nihil had been using as transportation. Asaria then died upon hitting the ground, with her head being split open."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
