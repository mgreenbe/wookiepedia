Horn, who had recently developed an enigmatic madness which caused him to believe that everybody he knew had been replaced with an impostor, had been taken to the Jedi Temple to be studied. However, he had quickly escaped and embarked on a destructive rampage through the galactic capital of Coruscant. The Galactic Federation of Free Alliances issued a warrant for his arrest, and several beings\u2014including Jedi, bounty hunters, and Galactic Alliance Security agents\u2014joined the chase. The Human bounty hunter was among the many hunters hired by Chief of State Natasi Daala to be a part of the Chief of State's special-missions force. She was partnered with the cyborg mercenary Vrannin Vaxx and the Quarren bounty hunter Dhidal Nyz. The three hunters rode in the bed of a cargo hauler, which was piloted by another being."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the chase, Horn, who had been flying in an antique X-wing starfighter, was attacked by Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker and forced to eject from the fighter. The cargo hauler maneuvered underneath the falling Horn and caught him in the cargo bed. The bounty hunters trained their weapons on the fugitive, but as Nyz ordered Horn to surrender, Jedi Knight Jaina Solo\u2014also hoping to capture Horn\u2014leapt down towards the cargo bed from a speeder above them. While the three hunters were distracted by Solo, Horn grabbed his ejector seat and jumped off the side of the hauler, rocketing away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo landed in the cargo bed, and Nyz fired his electric net gun at her. The net caught her and disabled her, causing her to fall over the edge of the hauler. Annoyed by his rash action, the female bounty hunter began to criticize Nyz. Her denigration was cut short, however, as a racing speeder shot by them, causing the hauler's pilot to veer to one side. The cargo bed tilted sharply, and Nyz was thrown off of the vehicle. The female hunter fell, but she quickly went into an acrobatic roll and came to a safe stop at the cargo bed's low railing. As they began to accelerate back up to speed, they were fired upon by former smuggler Han Solo and his wife, Leia Organa Solo, in their starship, the Millennium Falcon. Vaxx was hit, and the cyborg was sent flying into the control cab of the hauler. Smoke began streaming out from the cab, and, with their vehicle disabled, the bounty hunters were forced to give up the chase."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounty hunter remained composed when under pressure, although she was easily annoyed with the incompetence of her colleagues. Nevertheless, she willingly worked with a team of bounty hunters during the hunt for Valin Horn.
