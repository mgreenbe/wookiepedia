When she was captured by Darth Malak and became a Sith apprentice, she replaced the yellow crystal inside the lightsaber with a red crystal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In both of the Knights of the Old Republic games, all characters that wield a double-bladed lightsaber share the hilt of Bastila Shan's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights of the Old Republic II Prima Guide mentions the player being able to retrieve Bastila's lightsaber upon confronting and defeating Darth Revan's apparition in Ludo Kressh's tomb on Korriban.
