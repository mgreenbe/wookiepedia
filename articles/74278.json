In 13 BBY, he was stationed at the Imperial space traffic control station on Ryloth. After the rebel YT-209 freighter Eclipse breached the Imperial defenses above Ryloth and disengaged from the auto-control. This created a power glitch in the Imperial grid and Karris promised that his technicians would repair the systems.

In truth, the Tirion was actually the rebel freighter Eclipse, which was smuggling gattis-root extract to Lessu. After the Eclipse evaded Imperial forces and managed to deliver its cargo to Lessu, Mors ordered Karris to lock down the city and to order the warship Despot to intercept the YT-209 freighter. However, the Eclipse managed to evade Imperial forces and flee into hyperspace. When Mors ordered a full lockdown of the city, Karris speculated that the ship crew were smugglers. However, Mors replied that she was determined to obtain information on the freighter, the cargo, and its recipients."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
