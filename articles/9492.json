He had just been visited by Queen Daln\u00e9 of Naboo and Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, the two young women leaving Panaka's chalet mere minutes before it was bombed. On her way into the chalet, Organa took note of a civilian worker wearing a breath mask. She saw the worker fleeing the scene after the bombing. Leia's adoptive parents, Viceroy Bail and Queen Breha, were angry about Panaka's death, as despite Panaka's strong personal loyalty to Emperor Palpatine, he had still been a decent man, and the Organas thought they could have worked together to help vulnerable civilians. Panaka's death, however, prevented him from relaying to Palpatine his suspicions that Leia, adopted daughter of the House of Organa, was the biological daughter of the long-deceased Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
