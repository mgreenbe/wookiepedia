It was inhabited by Trins Evnar at the time of the Galactic Civil War. Circa 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force started an investigation against the Chirq Council. After the informant Lilith Laughlin revealed to the CorSec that Trins Evnar was a member of the Council, Captain Vitala Baize hired a spacer to eliminate him in order to infiltrate the Chirq Council using Evnar's identity. The spacer thus fought Trins Evnar in his house and killed him. After his death, the spacer assumed Trins Evnar's identity towards the underboss Jzoro Quanera and managed to infiltrate the organization, leading to the destruction of the Chirq Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trins Evnar's House appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
