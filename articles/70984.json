She was competent at repairing the droids brought to her, but awful at organization and relatively slow, leading to a build up of droids for her to work on as she was always willing to take on more work. This lead to the Sullustan always being exhausted and underestimating how long jobs would take her, meaning customers often ended up continually prompting her to finish their order, or having to pick up half-repaired droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jilaa San first appeared in 2013 in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
