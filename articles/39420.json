Aided by Anakin Skywalker and the 501st Legion, Doom and his unit engaged droid forces led by Separatist Admiral Trench aboard the space station orbiting Ringo Vinda.

The army was first pressed into service when Republic Jedi engaged the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems on the planet Geonosis, which sparked the start of the intergalactic Clone Wars. Doom was eventually placed under the command of the Jedi Generals Tiplar and her sister Tiplee, and the troopers placed under his command adopted a green color motif for their armor, along with a yellow triangle to represent their unit."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Ringo Vinda"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war, Doom, Tiplar, and Tiplee participated in a large-scale campaign to capture a massive space station held by Admiral Trench above the planet Ringo Vinda, which was currently under the command of Trench and his droid forces. Doom's unit was joined by the 501st Legion, led by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, for the battle, which at some point reached a stalemate. During the intense fighting that took place aboard the station, much of Doom's forces were exhausted, but after several more encounters with Trench's droids, the Republic troops captured a communications center. Skywalker began to pen the next stage of the battle and ordered Tiplar and Doom to take the remainder of their company down one of two passageways that led to Trench's command post. Doom noted that his men were few, which prompted Skywalker to assign ARC trooper CT-5555,\"Fives,\" and clone trooper CT-5385,\"Tup,\" along with ten other 501st troopers, to accompany Doom and Tiplar. Tiplee would follow Skywalker and the rest of his troopers down another passageway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic resumed their assault and began closing in on Trench's command center. Tiplar and Doom fought side-by-side as they advanced, and faced minimal casualties during their trip down the passageway. Eventually, they reached Trench's command center and regrouped with Skywalker and Tiplee. However, as the fighting commenced, Tup, having entered a trance-like state, unexpectedly shot Tiplar in the back of the head. Doom witnessed the murder but was forced to continue fighting with the arrival of destroyer droids. Meanwhile, Tup was apprehended by Fives while Tiplar's body was retrieved by Tiplee. The entire attack lost its momentum in the wake of Tiplar's death and Skywalker ordered a retreat. The defeated Republic forces regrouped in the command center they had previously captured, and Doom and his men gathered around Tiplar's body to mourn her death. Tup had killed Tiplar due to a Sith-implanted behavioral modification biochip in his head, a device which was actually installed into every clone trooper's head. Tup's chip had malfunctioned, prematurely invoking Clone Protocol 66, which was a command that forced clone troopers to execute all Jedi for acts of treason."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A skilled combatant, Doom was bred to be utterly loyal to the Galactic Republic and to obey orders unflinchingly.
