Four years after the Battle of Yavin, she and the rest of the Max Rebo Band performed for Jabba the Hutt at his palace on the planet Tatooine. The group played the song \"Jedi Rocks\" for the Hutt, who demanded that they repeat the performance, but then dropped his slave dancer Oola into his rancor pit during the performance, causing the band to stop playing. Greeata was visibly shocked when Oola was eaten by the rancor, and then witnessed Princess Leia Organa arrive in the palace disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh with the Wookiee Chewbacca as a prisoner. While on Tatooine, she wore an orange crest and gold jewelry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greeata Jendowanian first appeared in the Special Edition re-release of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi in 1997, played by Celia Fushille-Burke.
