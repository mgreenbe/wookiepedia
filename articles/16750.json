The three siblings regularly left their home and ventured out into the galaxy in search of the glory of the hunt; they followed an unknown calendar system and traveled to worlds decreed by their shamans. Around 3637 BBY, the trio arrived on the planet Rishi, though by this time Derrus has grown cynical and referred to his siblings as \"idiots\", abandoning the hunt. Meanwhile, Bez set out hunting on the Sky Ridge Island, welcoming passing individuals to join the hunt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bez Martilla and the Slayers Three appear in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan expansion, released on December 2, 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
