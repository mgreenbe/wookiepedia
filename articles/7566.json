They functioned by emitting intense harmonic interference waves that caused devices and systems to malfunction. When they were set on a higher level, anti-security blades could erase magnetic locks and allow the operator to gain access to nearly any door. When set to the proper frequency they could also be used to jam comlinks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounty hunter Boba Fett kept anti-security blades in his shin pockets.
