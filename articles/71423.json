The Death Star was rapidly approaching Yavin 4 and threatened to destroy the base, thus necessitating its destruction. As the pilots waited in the squadron's ready room to receive their assignments and man their starfighters, Branon and his fellow pilots discussed the chances of successfully destroying the Death Star with a precise hit from a proton torpedo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Branon asked Takbright what the new pilot, Luke Skywalker, had told him during the briefing; Takbright replied that he himself had loudly stated that it was impossible to score a hit on a two-meter target with, even with a computer. Takbright then asked Branon if he had the same doubts about the mission, to which Branon was ambivalent. As more pilots entered the room, Takbright told Branon to forget whatever had happened during the briefing. However, Branon was still insistent on learning what Skywalker had said, and Takbright finally relented; he revealed that Skywalker used to hunt womp rats in his T-16 skyhopper. After Dreis arrived, Branon was selected to fly in the attack on the battle station under the callsign Red Four alongside Harb Binli, flying as Red Seven.

In the Star Wars Legends continuity, the surname originated from the 2006 real-time strategy video game, Star Wars: Empire at War, and Branon also appeared prior to A New Hope in the 1976 novelization of the film, written by Alan Dean Foster.
