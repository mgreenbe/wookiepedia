The tradition began during a period of Bosph history in which they were mainly nomadic and used the maps to traverse the large plains of their homeworld Bosph, however after the Bosph were discovered by the rest of the galaxy Bosph continued the tradition whilst traveling away from their homeworld. Those Bosph who were Force-sensitive, and so considered Ela b'Yentarr and members of the Bosph government, had to wear such tattoos as part of the way of the traveler, although it was a choice for other Bosph. One Bosph who observed the tradition was the Bosph smuggler Bora Boru."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
