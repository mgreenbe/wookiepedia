Jedi Master Porter Engle used this ability to calm a group of steelees so they could be used as mounts during a Jedi rescue attempt of the Blythe family, who had been kidnapped by the Nihil. During the First Battle of Geonosis, Anakin Skywalker used the Force to tame a ravenous reek in the Petranaki Arena. At one point during the Clone Wars, on the planet of Ryloth, Obi-Wan Kenobi used that ability to tame and control a pack of voracious gutkurrs, luring them into a trap. Many years later, Ezra Bridger also used it with a dangerous fyrnock at Fort Anaxes. Bridger, however, connected with the dark side of the Force in summoning such a powerful creature and the experience left him drained. Taming a creature in such a way required letting go of one's inhibitions and opening oneself to the power of the Force. Later, Bridger mastered the skill, connecting with tibidee and purrgil alike. Bridger however was unable to connect with the krykna of Atollon, due to their sensitivity towards negative emotions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
