In 18 BBY, Jordo was assigned to work with Governor Wilhuff Tarkin, Major Rantu, and Colonel Bergon after tensions on the planet between the Empire and the Mon Cala monarchy flared up. On board the Sovereign, Jordo discussed non-military approaches, describing Mon Cala's society and that they could exploit tensions to make them fight each other with propaganda, offering to have the artwork drafted for Tarkin's approval. Tarkin dismissed that he would not need to approve the propaganda, as he trusted Jordo's expertise. When the shuttle of Imperial ambassador Telvar was shot down, killing all aboard, Tarkin ordered a lieutenant to inform Jordo to begin his phase of the operation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Dac City and overall Imperial assault of Mon Cala commenced, King of Mon Cala Lee-Char had fully evacuated his people from all surface cities, and subsequently deployed enormous ocean creatures which jumped above the ocean surface and crashed down near all Mon Cala surface cities, destroying them and all Imperial forces. On the bridge of the Sovereign, Commander Jordo expressed shock on the monarchy's decision to destroy all surface cities. Tarkin responded that they had destroyed nothing, as the surface cities served as outposts and that the entire civilization was situated under the ocean's surface, and was a thousand times more expansive. Tarkin continued, stating that the action they undertook minimally hurt them, while it made Imperial military operations extremely difficult as they could no longer use the surface cities as staging areas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarkin carried on, by stating to Jordo that they had just lost significant military resources, and questioned Jordo on how they did not know of the capability the Mon Cala monarchy had, since Jordo was the Imperial Security Bureau officer responsible for the planet. Jordo uneasily responded by stating that he had no explanation and no excuse, and that he would redouble his efforts and redeem himself. Tarkin left and warned that he hoped to see that he would, as it was \"a long fall to the ocean.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the death of Colonel Bergon caused by the Mon Calamari utilizing metal-cased missiles to penetrate the shields of her sky-base, Tarkin subsequently blamed Jordo for the Empire's lack of intel on the technology. Jordo tried to justify his failure by stating that he had been given insufficient time to ascertain a complete layout of the planet. Tarkin would have none of Jordo's excuses, and punished him by requesting stormtrooper armor for him and sending him to the surface. A pair of stormtroopers then dragged the protesting commander from the bridge to be sent into battle on the front line."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jordo was a human male with light skin and brown hair. After his failure of not knowing that the Mon Calamari had the ability to deploy gargantuan ocean creatures that destroyed all Imperial forces on the surface, Jordo was blunt in stating that he had no explanation nor excuse for his failure when confronted by Governor Tarkin. Jordo also sought to redeem himself, and prove to be a suitable officer under Tarkin, stating that he would redouble his efforts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Jordo failed a second time, to Tarkin's ire, Jordo made the excuse that they had only been in the system for several days and that Tarkin couldn't expect of him to have complete knowledge of the planet in so little time.

He was able to identify past social tensions that led to the Battle of Mon Cala and led his subordinates to exploit and reemerge those tensions so that they may work for the Empire's favor. In order to do so, Jordo suggested a targeted propaganda campaign of holograms and artwork to bring forth those tensions, and have the Quarren and Mon Calamari fighting each other rather than the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being able to identify exploitations on Mon Cala's society, Jordo was not able to become knowledgeable on all aspects of the water world. His failure to do so, allowed for the deployment of colossal ocean creatures by the Mon Calamari, which destroyed all surface cities and Imperial military resources. His shortsightedness in technological capabilities allowed the Mon Calamari to use their aquatic vehicles and destroy Bergon's aerial landing platform, killing her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jordo made his first appearance in the canon 2018 comic Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 13, written by Charles Soule and pencilled by Giuseppe Camuncoli.
