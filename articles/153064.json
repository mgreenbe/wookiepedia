Around 0.5 ABY, the Star Destroyer was assigned to transport the recently captured Rebel Alliance Admiral Ackbar to the prison colony on the planet of Kessel for interrogation. However, after the Star Destroyer\u2014escorted by a pair of Victory II-class frigates\u2014jumped out of hyperspace in the Kessel system, it was ambushed by the Alliance's new elite fighting force, Renegade Squadron, intending to rescue Ackbar.
