They came from the Gluss'elta Islands of Kintan, causing them to be natural sailors. They had white-gray skin, eye-horns like the Kadas'sa'Nikto, and fins similar to those of the Esral'sa'Nikto, but smaller. Xenobiologists believed the first Gluss'sa'Nikto to have been born of a Kadas'sa'Nikto who mated with an Esral'sa'Nikto."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
