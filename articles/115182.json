Named after the famous Jedi Revan, the Mythologies provided an extensive account of Jedi history, though some scholars considered Orpin's works to be derivatives of the Qel-Droma Epics, a similar set of mythical stories that spoke of the Great Hyperspace War and the Great Sith War. Many of the Mythologies featured the Rakata, and spoke of Jedi heroes who found Rakatan devices and were forced to choose between destroying them or being corrupted by their power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
