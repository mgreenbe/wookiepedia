By hopping between the Centrality Navy ships, leaving an image, and hopping out; they provoked the Navy gunners to fire upon the artificial skin. The energy beams would pass directly through the false shape, only to strike an allied cruiser. Many of the Centrality's warships were destroyed in this manner. The Oswaft initially thought this tactic was demeaning and below their dignity, due to its nature, but they were persuaded to employ this method by Lando Calrissian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
