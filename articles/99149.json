This oasis was often mistaken for a mirage, given its near-perfect circular shape. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a number of spacers visited this oasis, and considered it to be one of Tatooine's greatest vistas. The body of water was surrounded by palm trees and other vegetation. Though the water was mostly shallow, parts of it were deep enough to swim in. The water was also home to a number of lifeforms, particularly various fish varieties. Indeed, fishing at the oasis was possible for anyone who desired to do so."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oasis East was one of four bodies of water on the planet Tatooine in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
