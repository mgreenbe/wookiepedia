Clad in flexible black armor, they were generally armed with a DL-44 heavy blaster pistol, an E-11 blaster rifle, or a DXR-6 disruptor rifle. Additionally, they were equipped with stealth field generators that rendered them virtually invisible, allowing them to evade enemy defenses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saboteurs operated at various locations throughout the galaxy during the Galactic Civil War.

Together they foiled many of the saboteurs' plans, including attempts to crash a hover train into a station on Corellia, destroy a power facility on Bakura, and demolish an ancient stronghold on Yalara. Saboteurs were also employed to deter Korr as he escaped from an Imperial facility on Dosuun and hamper his search for Rosh Penin on Taspir III. It is not known whether any saboteurs survived the defeat of the Disciples of Ragnos and Imperial Remnant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
