In 3000 BBY, Rogoe had the bursas attack the city Otoh Sancture to attempt to kill Gallo, the city's leader who Rogoe had grown to fear, however Gallo was absent from his city and escaped its destruction. The bursas later constructed nests on the ruins of Otoh Sancture, but were driven out by Gallo, who went on to defeat Rogoe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
