Aphra's father has made his re-appearance in Aphra's life to reveal that he is the one who had her doctorate suspended, once he uncovered that she lied about her discovery of Abersyn symbiotes on Boothi XII. To Aphra's dismay, her father needs her help in his latest attempt in his lifelong pursuit of the Ordu Aspectu.

She invites her father aboard to discuss things further.

Rur, leader of the Ordu Aspectu, begs the Jedi to cease hostilities. Rur's lieutenant, a man named Amon, informs his leader that the Jedi have already breached the fortress. Reluctantly, they head into battle, but Rur orders Amon not to take life if he can avoid it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"Jedi,\" garbed in black, and wielding red lightsabers, have penetrated the fortress. The Ordu Aspectu, wielding blue lightsabers, meet them in combat.

One of the \"Jedi,\" a Togruta, strikes down Amon in the heat of the melee. Rur, desperate to avoid \"another lost eternity,\" reaches out with the Force and the Fortress of Garn, including both the \"Jedi\" and Ordu warriors, are suddenly swallowed up by the void."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back in the present, Aphra's father explains his reasoning for his urge to find the lost fortress of the Ordu Aspectu.

Followed by a massive explosion, the Jedi, dressed in white and wielding blue lightsabers, breach the fortress. The red of the Ordu Aspectu's blades flash as they and the Jedi engage in combat; lightning torments the captive Padawans. Amon activates a computer terminal, killing himself in the process, and the Fortress of Garn, as well as both Jedi and Ordu Aspectu, are swallowed up by the void."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back in the present once more, Aphra and her father continue their debate. Aphra believes the Ordu Aspectu's \"heresy\" had nothing to do with eternal life but the \"possessive infinite,\" an age-old argument between Jedi grammarians. She claims her father is \"chasing mist\" \u2014 a metaphor \u2014 but reluctantly agrees to help him, if only to prove him wrong. Meanwhile, BT-1 suggests that it would have been entirely plausible that the Fortress of Garn was in fact a colossal BT-1 assassin droid, a theory that Triple Zero hesitantly rejects."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yavin IV"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ark Angel hangs in orbit above the gas giant Yavin.
