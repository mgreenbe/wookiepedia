Around the year 20 BBY, Solok was selected to be part of a Jedi task force sent to hunt down the Sith Lord brothers Darth Maul and Savage Opress. The team tracked its targets to the planet Yellowblade's Landing, where the Jedi fought the duo but failed to capture them, losing Master Grohto in the process. Solok then accompanied Masters Bruu Jun-Fan and Plo Koon to the planet Pleem's Nexus, where they engaged the Sith again.

When the Dathomirian Zabrak Sith Lord Darth Maul resurfaced during the conflict, Solok was selected by Master Plo Koon to be part of a Jedi task force to hunt down Maul and his Sith brother, Savage Opress. Aside from Koon and Solok, the group included Masters Grohto, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Bruu Jun-Fan, as well as the latter's Padawan, Tatsu, and a group of clone troopers led by Clone Captain Mojo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The team first took a Consular-class cruiser to the planet Yellowblade's Landing based on data from several informants, who claimed the Sith were there. Solok and the others traveled to the planetary surface in a T-6 shuttle, and once there, they found the aftermath of the Sith's visit: the brothers' abandoned Turtle Tanker freighter and a cantina full of corpses. The bodies belonged to members of the Scourge criminal organization, and after sighting them, Koon ordered Solok and Grohto to organize a search of the surrounding settlement. The Jedi and clone troopers made their way to a cave that housed the local Scourge base, where they suspected Maul was hiding based on Jun-Fan's psychometric analysis of a blaster from the cantina massacre."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once at the base, Kenobi ordered Solok, Grohto, and Tatsu to remain in a chamber near the entrance to prevent the Sith brothers from escaping. The trio waited there while Kenobi and the others headed deeper into the base, where they located Maul and Opress but were attacked by wampas that the Sith had released from cages within the base. Maul, having evaded the other Jedi while they were distracted by the wampas, attacked Solok and his two companions. The Zabrak entered the chamber by leaping through a window and kicking Solok, after which he killed Grohto and injured Tatsu and Kenobi. Incapacitating the Jedi allowed the Sith brothers to escape aboard one of the Scourge's ships with a hostage, whom they had found incarcerated in the base. Koon and Jun-Fan analyzed a piece of jewelry that the brothers' hostage had dropped and discovered that the Sith's destination was the planet Pleem's Nexus, where the hostage lived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving their injured behind, Solok, Jun-Fan, and Koon flew to Pleem's Nexus.

The Jedi immediately engaged Maul and Opress in combat, and during the ensuing fight, Solok was killed when Maul threw his lightsaber through his chest.
