It was the legion that served under the command of the Sith Lord Darth Vader and was known as such across the galaxy due to their affiliation with Emperor Palpatine's right hand. Its members were recruited from the ranks of the equally renowned 501st Legion, a former clone trooper division that served in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic under Jedi General Anakin Skywalker throughout the Clone Wars. Those who failed to meet Vader's expectations were either transferred back to the 501st or summarily executed for failure. Kimmund, an officer of the First Legion, was the fourth commander in his particular unit, his predecessors having been either demoted or put to death by the Dark Lord of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Galactic Civil War, the First Legion deployed to the planet Batuu alongside the forces of Grand Admiral Thrawn. Their joint mission brought them into conflict with the Grysks, a warlike people native to the Unknown Regions. The First Legion fought the Grysks on several occasions during their time with Thrawn, the first of which was at Batuu where Kimmund's troopers infiltrated a Grysk long-range heavy freighter and captured several Grysk warriors. However, the prisoners that they brought aboard the Chimaera\u2014an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer and Thrawn's flagship\u2014attempted to steal the First Legion's transport, the Darkhawk, resulting in a battle that Kimmund survived with the help of Thrawn's personal bodyguard, the Noghri assassin Rukh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the failed prisonbreak, the First Legion fought the Grysks in the Battle of Mokivj with Darth Vader leading the ground assault in person. During the battle, Kimmund's troops rescued most of the Force-sensitive Chiss girls that had been abducted by the Grysks. Thrawn and Vader sought to retrieve all of the captives; therefore, they tracked the Grysks that escaped from Mokivj via hyperspace, leading to a another confrontation in which the First Legion succeeded in rescuing the remaining Chiss children.

Following the Battle of Atollon, the Emperor sensed a disturbance in the Force originating on the planet Batuu in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. Vader and Grand Admiral Thrawn were both sent to investigate; Commander Kimmund accompanied Vader along with a contingent of the First Legion. They traveled to Batuu via Thrawn's flagship, the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Chimaera.

The Noghri warrior made a habit out of boarding the First Legion's vessel unbidden; therefore, trooper Sampa rigged the ship's hatches with intrusion alarms to keep Rukh out. Despite their precautions, Rukh still managed to infiltrate the Darkhawk, this time making it as far as the electronics shop. Using trooper Jid's helmet to trigger the alarm, he alerted the First Legion and was promptly escorted off of the ship by Sergeant Drav and trooper Morrtic. Annoyed by Rukh's actions, Kimmund feared that the next security breach would result in either the Noghri's death or his own at the hands of the Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon reaching Batuu, Vader and Thrawn traveled to the surface while their subordinates remained onboard the Chimaera. Their arrival was followed soon after by a group of Grysk freighters, the largest of which was attacked by Kimmund's forces after Thrawn refused to reveal the Chimaera's location to the enemy. The Grysks, a warlike sentient species that came from the Unknown Regions, threatened the interests of both the Chiss Ascendancy and the Galactic Empire according to Thrawn. While Vader and Thrawn dealt with the Grysks' Darshi mercenaries, the First Legion deployed to the freighter via the Darkhawk. After the Grysk vessel's hyperdrive was disabled by a squadron of TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighters led by Vult Skerris, the First Legion boarded the freighter and attempted to secure it along with its holdings for the Empire. Kimmund personally oversaw their efforts to capture the cargo hold, in accordance with Vader's instructions to keep the cargo intact, but the Grysks used explosives to destroy their cargo along with themselves."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Defense of the Darkhawk"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite failing to secure the cargo hold, Kimmund's men were able to stun other Grysks before they could complete their suicide mission. The First Legion then transferred the prisoners to the Chimaera by order of Thrawn, who wanted to interrogate the Grysks. Thrawn had them confined to personal quarters typically reserved for TIE fighter pilots; in response, Kimmund and Sergeant Aksind decided to remain aboard the Darkhawk along with its pilot Tephan, having felt uncomfortable leaving their ship unguarded with the prisoners nearby. When the Grysk escaped from their makeshift prison, they attempted to escape from the Chimaera by stealing the First Legion's transport. A brief but intense skirmish ensued between the Grysks and Kimmund's companions, resulting in Aksind's death despite Rukh's timely assistance.

Kimmund, who had not been informed of his superiors' intentions, inadvertently ruined the plan by preventing the aliens' escape. If the Grand Admiral had not spoken in the Commander's defense, Kimmund believed he might have become the second officer of his unit to be put to death for failure. As a result of the Grysks' decision to steal a Clone Wars era vessel like the Darkhawk, Thrawn concluded that their base was an old Separatist droid factory located on the planet Mokivj."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Mokivj"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the Chimaera's arrival at Mokivj, Thrawn requested use of Vader's stormtroopers, intending to lead the ground assault in person.

They successfully infiltrated the factory where Vader created a ruse to distract the Grysks while Kimmund, Sergeant Viq, and trooper Elebe searched for the prisoners they had been ordered to rescue. The Grysks who guarded the prisoners were killed by Kimmund's stormtroopers, although the captives themselves surprised the Commander for they were young Force-sensitive girls\u2014three of whom were kept in hibernation chambers\u2014of Thrawn's species, the Chiss. Taking the children into their custody, Kimmund and his troopers headed to the factory's courtyard and cleared it of enemy units in order to rendezvous with the Darkhawk.

The trap was a success; with the engines disabled by Vader, the First Legion boarded the Grysk vessel. Aided by Rukh's tracking abilities, Kimmund's unit began their search for the remaining Chiss captives while two troopers remained with the Darkhawk to guard it. A few troopers perished during the mission and Jid was left behind after sustaining a direct hit from a Grysk lightning gun, but ultimately the First Legion was successful in its task, rescuing more Chiss from the Grysks."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Hoth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Galactic Civil War raging between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Darth Vader's Death Squadron was tasked with locating Alliance High Command's base.
