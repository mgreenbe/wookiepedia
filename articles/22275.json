Because of his clone designation, he was given the nickname \"Fives.\" Around 22 BBY, right about the time that the clone war had begun, Fives was assigned to Domino Squad, a unit of clone cadets that trained within the planet Kamino's clone military education complex, under the command of the Siniteen Sergeant Bric. Fives and his squad were required to pass a test in order to become battle-ready clone troopers. After the completion of their training, Fives, along with a number of other rookie clone troopers, was assigned to Rishi Station, a listening post located on the moon of Rishi. Fives was present when the Confederate General Grievous invaded the moon to take control of the Republic listening post.

Following the Confederate attack on Kamino, Fives and Echo were promoted to ARC troopers for their continuous efforts. As the war continued, both Fives and Echo joined Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in the rescue of Jedi Master Even Piell from the Confederate prison known as the Citadel. After they rescued Piell and his officers, the facility's warden, Osi Sobeck, released battle droid forces on Fives and the Republic group.

When Shaak Ti ordered him to present his evidence to the Chancellor, Nala Se drugged him and Palpatine faked an assassination attempt. On the run, Fives tried to convey his information to General Skywalker and Captain Rex. However, he was tracked by Commander Fox and a group of Shock Troopers. When Fives tried to defend himself, Fox shot him through the heart.

Around 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars, CT-27-5555 was assigned to Domino Squad, a unit of clone cadets. Due to his clone designation ending with 5555, CT-27-5555 preferred to be called \"Fives.\" The other Domino Squad clone cadets\u2014Cutup, Hevy, Echo, and Droidbait\u2014preferred to call him by his clone designation number, though Fives wanted to be called by his nickname. Fives and Domino Squad trained in Tipoca City, the capital of the planet Kamino. Their training at the clone military education complex was overseen by the Siniteen Sergeant Bric, who also watched the squad during their combat simulation practice tests. During their simulation battles, each clone cadet, including Fives, used non-lethal weapons, so that no clone could be injured during one of their simulations. Furthermore, all clone cadet squad members had to work as a team to successfully pass the simulation. The Domino Squad clones, however, rarely got along with each other as a team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one of their combat simulation tests, Fives engaged in several arguments with fellow trooper Droidbait, who was calling Fives by his designation number.

The training evaluators supervising the group\u2014Bric, the Arcona El-Les, and Jedi Master Shaak Ti\u2014took concern with Domino Squad's recklessness. Since Domino Squad could not work as a team, Fives and the rest of the squad failed the test, and the squad departed to the complex's barracks. After returning to the barracks, Echo and Hevy got into an argument and then a fight, but the brawl was broken up by the immediate arrival of Bric. The Siniteen Sergeant wanted Fives and the rest of Domino Squad to cooperate with each other, stating that they would be a waste of his time if they continued to disagree. The next day, Bric and El-Les rallied Domino Squad, as well as some of Tipoca City's other clone cadet squads, for a meeting outside the military complex on a hangar deck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clone Commander Colt, an ARC trooper, was to watch the clone cadets' final combat simulator test.

After Bravo Squad's test concluded, Fives and Domino Squad entered the simulation room and began their test, quickly completing certain parts of the simulation faster than their usual rate. As Fives, Echo, Droidbait, and Cutup took cover behind some barricades, Hevy, who was destroying droids with his Z-6 rotary blaster cannon, cleared a path for them. When Droidbait broke away from the group, however, a droid shot him in the back. Cutup noticed this and yelled out for Hevy to stop, though Hevy wanted his team to head for the simulation's citadel tower to complete the test.

However, Ti denied their request and revealed that she had faith within Domino Squad. Because she had confidence in the clone cadets, she gave Domino Squad another chance to take the test. The next day, Ti joined Bric, El-Les, and Colt in supervising Domino Squad's final attempt at passing the test. Fives and his comrades managed to reach the bottom of the citadel tower, at which point they noticed that the ascension cables in their belts were missing. The clones instead improvised and decided to climb the blaster turrets that acceded up toward the citadel's roof. Once Fives and the troops successfully climbed the turrets, Hevy himself lifted the pole on top of the citadel, which completed the test.

Under the command of Clone Sergeant O'Niner, Fives and the clone troopers, along with troopers Nub and CT-327, maintained the listening post to warn the Republic of any impending Confederate attacks on the nearby Kamino.

Grievous knew that if he attacked Kamino, the Rishi moon listening post would detect the attack, and the stationed troopers at the listening post would turn off the base's \"all-clear\" signal, which would alert the nearby Republic fleet to the invasion. Grievous therefore deployed BX-series droid commandos in Droch-class boarding ships to take over the listening post. Meanwhile, a clone trooper raised the listening post's shield to protect the base against what appeared to be an approaching meteor shower, which was actually the squadron of Droch-class boarding ships. The droids soon left their transports and began their attack on the Republic base. After three commando droids shot and killed O'Niner, Droidbait, and Nub, the remaining clone troopers\u2014Fives, Echo, Hevy, and Cutup\u2014evacuated the command center by exiting through a ventilation shaft, which led them outside the listening post."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving the ventilation shaft, the four rookie troopers were disheartened when a Rishi eel attacked and devoured Cutup, leaving only Fives, Echo, and Hevy to defend themselves.

The clone officers had arrived for the inspection of the listening post and were unaware of the droid attack. After the two were attacked by the invading droids, they escaped and met with Fives and the other rookie troops. Having encountered a commando droid disguised in clone armor during their skirmish with the droids, Rex demanded that the rookies remove their helmets to verify that they were indeed clones. After the three rookie troopers obeyed and removed their headgear, another Rishi moon eel attacked them. Rex used his DC-17 hand blaster to kill it with a single shot to the eye, a feat that impressed the rookies.

The Clone Captain successfully tricked units 07, 08, and 09 to open the listening post's main door, allowing Fives and the clone troopers to ambush the remainder of the commando droids inside the base. The clones defeated the droid units, including their vibroblade-wielding leader. Nevertheless, their victory was cut short when the clone troopers noticed that General Grievous's fleet had arrived above the moon. Due to the lack of response from the commando droids, Grievous sent more battle droids to the listening post. The clones, inside the command center of the listening post, were unable to turn off the \"all-clear\" signal because the droids had hot-wired it. Soon, a droid landing craft descended through the moon's atmosphere and landed at the listening post.

To destroy the base, Echo offered the use of highly explosive liquid tibanna, which was used as a fuel source at the station when the Rishi moon entered its freezing cycle. While Rex and Echo went to retrieve the plunk droids that stored the liquid tibanna, Fives, Cody, and Hevy grabbed weaponry from the listening post's supply room. With their new supply of weaponry, the clones attacked the invading battle droid forces, buying time for Rex and Echo to wire the three plunk droids together.

The Clone Captain contacted Hevy via comlink, but Hevy refused to evacuate the listening post until he was able to repair the detonator. Unwilling to accept Hevy's decision, the clones ran to rescue the rookie trooper. Before they were able to re-enter the facility, however, Hevy manually detonated the explosives. The listening post exploded, killing Hevy and all of the droid forces inside. Shortly thereafter, Rex, Cody, Fives, and Echo were picked up by an LAAT/i gunship that carried them off the moon. On board the Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute, Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker awarded Fives and Echo medals for their service.

When the Republic learned that the Confederacy was about to invade Kamino, Fives, along with Echo, Kenobi, and Skywalker, were dispatched to the world to prepare for the impending attack. While Kenobi and Skywalker met with Shaak Ti and Kamino Prime Minister Lama Su, Fives and Echo roamed through Tipoca City's military complex. The two clones soon spotted their old clone trooper friend, 99, who was glad to see them, but questioned Hevy's absence. When they revealed that Hevy had sacrificed himself to save the others on the Rishi moon, 99 showed the two Hevy's medal, and told them that Hevy had given it to him. Once Fives and Echo told 99 about the suspected Confederate invasion of Kamino, 99 departed to the facility's weaponry room to gather weapons for the clone troopers. Soon after the Confederacy began its assault on Tipoca City, Fives and Echo met with an ARC trooper in a docking bay at the military complex."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ARC trooper gave Fives and Echo the task of going outside on a platform bridge in sniper position to repel the invading battle droids. The two 501st troopers complied and left for the bridge, and once there, they situated themselves and prepared for battle. Separatist trident drill craft, led by the Confederate General Grievous and Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress, climbed the outside structures of the city. While the ships caused structural damage to the buildings due to their drills, they also deployed battalions of B1-Series battle droids and aqua droids, which attacked the stationed clone troopers. On the bridge, Fives and Echo utilized their DC-15 carbine blasters to shoot down the nearby droids. After 99 visited the two clones and resupplied them with ammunition and thermal detonators, battle droids stormed the area, though they were destroyed when Echo tossed a detonator at them. Not long after, a squad of clone cadets approached Fives, Echo, and 99, and told them that they were lost, since they had been separated from their group. With Fives and Echo, 99 offered to bring them back to the military complex's barracks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once there, Commander Cody and Captain Rex joined the group and told Fives, Echo, and the clone cadets that they were going to fight off the droids. However, the clone cadets disagreed, due to their training being inadequate. Fives tried to boost the clone cadets' confidence, though the cadets still remained hesitant about engaging the droids. 99 entered the conversation by telling the clones that he knew where the complex's armory room was: if the clones could gather enough weaponry and supplies, they would be able to hold off the droids. After gathering the supplies, the clones repelled Grievous's droid forces, which attempted to enter the barracks. Fives and the clones began to fire at the droids, and lured them inside the barracks room. The clones took defensive positions behind crates as the droids continued their pursuit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, however, the clones around the crates began to be overwhelmed by the droids. Rex used his comlink to alert the clone cadets, who were hidden inside the sleeping bunkers, to reveal themselves to the droids. As they began to fire at the droids, Fives and the others continued as well. However, 99 noticed that the clones were running out of thermal detonators. Despite being told not to retrieve more by Rex, since it was too dangerous, 99 ignored the order and ran toward a nearby door. Yet, battle droids fired upon the clone and killed him. After 99's death, Fives and his comrades destroyed the remainder of the droids. Grievous and Ventress were meanwhile forced to flee from Kamino, resulting in a Republic victory.

As they orchestrated a plan to free Piell, the team knew that any attack on the the Citadel, the Confederate facility in which Piell had been imprisoned, would be rendered useless due to its security. Skywalker, however, devised a plan of encasing the team in carbonite in order to avoid detection, as the facility's security utilized lifeform scanners. Soon after that, his astromech droid, R2-D2, along with a group of reprogrammed B1 battle droids, would fly the carbonite blocks to the Citadel. After the meeting, Fives and the team departed to the Temple's hangar bay, where a carbon-freezing chamber, maintained by Ugnaughts, was located. Because of the complexity of their mission, as well as noticing R2-D2's battle droid force, Fives told Cody and Rex his worries of entrusting their lives to the droids.

After passing through the prison's life-form scan check, R2-D2 and the battle droids landed the shuttle near a cliff by the Citadel. R2-D2 released the team from their carbonite blocks, and they regrouped. Leaving R2-D2, the battle droids, and the shuttle behind, Skywalker and Kenobi led Fives and the team closer to the cliff's edge. Noticing that they could not utilize ascension cables to reach the top of the cliff due to touch-sensitive electro-mines, devices that would sound an alarm within the prison facility, along the cliff face, Skywalker and Kenobi told Fives and the rest of the team that they would have to free-climb the cliff. Near the top of the cliff, the team noticed a doorway that led into the Citadel itself was being ray shielded.

However, when Charger grabbed Fives's hand, he slipped and free-fell down toward an electro-mine, which killed him and sounded the Citadel's alarm. Despite alerting the Citadel of their presence, Fives and the team proceeded into the prison. After entering one of the Citadel's detention area hallways, the team found out that the walls surrounding them contained hidden blaster turrets. Once the turrets revealed themselves to the group, the Jedi utilized their lightsabers to deflect the blaster fire, while Fives and the clones fired at the turrets. Despite the setback, the team continued on and found Piell inside a holding cell, and released him from captivity. Though they rescued Piell, the Jedi Master wanted to find his officers, who had also been taken captive by the Confederacy, as one of Piell's officers, Wilhuff Tarkin, held in his memory half of the coordinates of the Nexus Route; Piell was in possession of the other half. Piell and Tarkin had memorized the coordinates so that they would not fall into Confederate hands.

Sobeck, who was watching the fight via the prison's security camera system, released more droids and activated the hallway's magnetized ceiling, which took Fives and his team's weapons, albeit leaving the commando droids' weaponry intact. The clones tried to attack the droids with bare hands, while Kenobi, Tano and Piell used the Force, but neither tactic worked due to the droids being magnetized to the floor. Skywalker, however, disabled the magnetized ceiling, which allowed his team to re-equip themselves and finish off the droids. They soon located and freed Piell's men\u2014Tarkin and several clone naval officers\u2014from a holding cell. Believing that they might run into more trouble with Osbeck's prison guards, Kenobi decided the team should split up: Piell, half of his men, and Cody would go with Kenobi to create a diversion, while Fives, Echo, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Piell's other officers, including Tarkin, would stay together and find an escape route that would lead them out of the prison. With Piell and Tarkin separated, if one squad was to be captured, the enemy would only have half the information. As Kenobi's team detonated a series of explosives in one of the corridors, Skywalker cut his way through the wall to an old tunnel\u2014of which the strike team knew thanks to some old archive data on the Citadel\u2014and Fives and Echo resealed the entrance before continuing onward through the tunnels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker, having contacted R2-D2 and instructed him to land the shuttle near their location, led his group through the tunnels.

After Tano used more explosives to blow their way through the rock, Fives and the others proceeded toward a nearby pipeline. Moving on through the pipeline in search of a way to reach R2-D2's shuttle, Fives and the team soon arrived at an exit point from the pipeline. However, outside of the exit hatch, a battalion of battle and crab droids ambushed them. The group escaped, and Skywalker tossed a grenade into the fuel line. The resulting explosion destroyed the droids. Skywalker's team went to Kenobi's position, finding the Jedi Master and his men pinned down by droids that were guarding the shuttle.

When the clone picked up a fallen commando droid's shield to defend himself and attempted to reach the shuttle, the droid destroyed the Republic team's shuttle, killing Echo in the process. Despite Echo's sudden death, Fives and the rest of the team continued on, away from their destroyed shuttle. With the destruction of the shuttle, their only means of transport off Lola Sayu, the group contacted the Jedi Council for assistance. Plo Koon told them he would come to their aid, though they needed to proceed to a rendezvous point for extraction. Passing through the lower levels of the Citadel, Fives and the others made their way outside of the Citadel, albeit still nearby the facility itself. Still being hunted by Sobeck's droid force, R2-D2's battle droid force was determined to stay behind, while Fives and the rest of the team descended down a cliff with cables. They proceeded toward various cave structures before Sobeck's anoobas found and attacked the group. The anoobas grievously injured Piell, who gave Tano his knowledge of the Nexus Route prior to succumbing to his injuries and dying. Fives, as well as the remaining team members, were present during Piell's funeral by a molten sulfur pit. Fives and the team proceeded to the rendezvous on an island, though Sobeck and a team of droids soon arrived, mounted on separate STAP speeders. The Citadel warden attacked and his speeder was shot down by Fives. Sobeck attacked Tarkin in a fit of rage because he couldn't get the information out of him, but Tano killed Sobeck.

However, Tup's condition awoke concerns among the Kaminoans, and they decided to contact Master Tyranus. As it turned out, Tup's condition resulted from an organic biochip implanted in the brain of all clone troopers at an early stage of their embryonal development, with Tup's chip suffering an unexpected malfunction. The Kaminoans were told that the chip and the programming it contained (referred to as Clone Protocol, or, more famously, Order 66) was meant as a safety measure in the case the Jedi went rogue, so that all clone troopers would ultimately (and ostensibly) remain obedient to the Galactic Republic.

While trying to lose his pursuers, Fives ran into his fellow trooper Kix and tried to relay the horrendous news to him. Kix arranged a meeting with Anakin and Rex, the only people Fives still trusted, but Fives was spotted and tracked down to the meeting point. In the meantime, Fives tried to plead his case to Anakin and Rex, even trapping the pair in ray shields, but his drug-hazed state and his own agitation made his explanations about a conspiracy against the Jedi and the Chancellor's involvement sound incoherent. When Commander Fox and a platoon of Coruscant guards appeared to take Fives in, the desperate ARC Trooper tried to keep them away with Rex's pistol, but was fatally shot by Fox. Dying in Rex's arms, Fives reiterated Tup's last words about the \"mission\" and having found freedom at last."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike the other rookie clone troopers stationed at Rishi Station, who had been there for some time, Fives was sent to the base directly prior to Grievous' invasion. When he learned of his first assignment, he was proud to serve at a listening post that was critical to the defense of Kamino. At Rishi Station, Fives became acquainted with the rookie clone troopers and Sergeant O'Niner. He was able to cooperate with the other clone troopers when commando droids invaded the station. Fives showed eagerness to be on the front lines of battle, and, as the clones attacked the droids inside the Rishi Station, Fives's eagerness caused him to become injured, with a blaster bolt almost hitting his arm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fives's dedication and service to the Republic earned him a spot within the Republic's 501st Legion. Like all rookie clone troopers, Fives's armor was sleek white and had no dust or damage from fighting because of his lack of combat prior to the Rishi moon battle. He had a \"5\" tattooed on the top right side of his forehead. Fives also had a well-trimmed goatee and a standard clone hairstyle throughout the war, until prior to his death when he went bald to undergo a surgical procedure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Fives was born and trained as a standard clone trooper, he had somewhat higher creativity than his peers, earning him the title of ARC trooper.
