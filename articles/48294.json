The ground team boarded the hull of Pryde's command ship, with the Orbak Tribe covering the Resistance troopers as they exchanged fire with Sith troopers and Sith jet troopers sent from the Xyston-class Star Destroyers of the Sith fleet.

Finn was trained to believe that the New Republic was depraved and that the First Order was necessary to bring law to a lawless galaxy, and everything he had seen of the galaxy was filtered through his training; the First Order showed him only what they wanted him to see, but he did not doubt its truth. Though as a cadet he was eager to be deployed and see the galaxy so he could serve the First Order and Supreme Leader Snoke, he was nevertheless plagued by doubt. His confidence in the First Order was severely shaken after his squad's execution of miners on Pressy's Tumble. His doubt came to a head on Jakku, witnessing his friend FN-2003 killed by Poe Dameron and refusing to fire on unarmed villagers.

Finn formed a bond of deep trust and care with Poe, and they showed to be great partners working together. After their crash in Jakku, Finn was relieved to see that he had survived as the two of them ran to embrace each other. While they were infiltrating the First Order's Star Destroyer to rescue Chewie, Finn immediately stopped firing at the group of stormtroopers at the corridors out of concern for Poe after he was shot in the crossfire, and went to check if he was fine, which led them to be surrounded and captured. Likewise, Finn also developed a strong bond with Rey, and the two of them trusted each other implicitly. His plan to infiltrate Starkiller Base was driven by his desire to rescue Rey, and as soon as he awoke from his comatose state (a result of his unsuccessful duel with Kylo Ren), he shouted her name in concern, and inquired Poe about her wellbeing. He remained concerned for her until they were reunited on Crait, hugging her tightly upon their reunion.
