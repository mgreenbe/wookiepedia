At the time of the Clone Wars, Prime Minister Lama Su controlled Kamino from the city. Early on into the Galactic Empire's reign, Kamino's cloning facilities, including those at Tipoca City, were shut down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Design"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The capital city of Kamino, Tipoca City, was a network of stilt structures that held the city above the massive ocean covering the world. The city was distributed over one hundred and fifty kilometers near Kamino's equator. At the core of one of its larger domes, Tipoca City held an immense fusion generator in its heart, powering the city by extracting hydrogen from seawater. The generator was secured by insulator plating. A network of power processing units surrounded the generator, as well as exhaust vents. The central hub contained extensive cloning facilities and offices for members of Kamino's Ruling Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each large dome was designed with a streamlined outer shell used to shed water and wind during storms, with hatches on the sides that could be opened for maintenance or repair. Located near the top of the main dome which housed the fusion generator was a Kaminoan Planetary Defense substation, utilized by Kamino's defense network, and several static discharge towers to secure the city during electrical storms. Several turbolaser turrets were located around the top of the dome as a defense mechanism."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Amenities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the fusion generator were expansive troop barracks, as well as the Ha Zurh Library and Records Office, containing the city's records and a swath of information. The library was maintained by a droid librarian. At the bottom of all of the domes are support pylons which hold up the cities and supply seawater to the fusion generator and to desalination plants where salt was removed from seawater and the water was distilled and purified. At one such plant was a storage tank filled with untreated water, compressor units and tanks used for condensation or evaporation. At the tops of other domes were communications towers designed to warn Kamino Space Control of incoming spacecraft. Outside of the domes were extensive training grounds and rainwater collection ducts. Every room in the city was fitted with emergency access hatches in case they were to flood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Domestic apartments located inside the city were sparsely furnished, occasionally designed with furniture designed to descend from the ceiling on stalks, connecting to electromagnetic floor markings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tipoca City Military Complex was the largest portion of Tipoca City's structure, containing the Central Armory, a DNA room, the Egg Lab, an embryo room, and the Genetic Records Hall. All of these rooms contributed to the cloning facilities that Tipoca City was prized for. Weather vanes hung off the bottom of a part of the facility, designed to monitor outside conditions to provide storm warnings, or adjustments to atmosphere systems within the buildings. The facility also contained combat rooms and quarters for the clones during any stage of their training. The Military Complex also had many training rooms.
