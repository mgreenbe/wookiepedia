While the Republic troops tested speeder bikes, the battle droids of the Separatists attacked the peaceful Talz. This resulted in a Talz counterattack in which both the Glid Station Republic outpost and the droid forces were destroyed.

After cornering the clone troopers, Republic troops arrived and Thi-Sen ordered to halt the charge.

During the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, both sides, the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, sent an amount of troops to Orto Plutonia. While the Republic clone troopers tested some speeder bikes, the battle droids of the Separatists attacked the Talz. Thi-Sen took this as a threat to their territory and he counterattacked both sides eliminating the clone troopers as well as the battle droids and they wiped out both. However the attack at the Republic outpost brought, on behalf of the neighboring moon Pantora, an investigation, consisting of Pantoran Chairman Chi Cho and Senator Riyo Chuchi as well as Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While investigating the massacre of both troops, the Jedi noticed the Talz village where they were greeted by Thi-Sen's aide, Medcha Wanto, and brought to the Chieftain's hut. There, using a primitive form of communication, Thi-Sen told the Jedi what had happened and that he and his people only wanted to be left alone. The Jedi organized a meeting for him and Pantorian representatives, and Thi-Sen was gladdened by the prospect of a peaceful solution, giving Kenobi a bear hug before the Jedi left."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thi-Sen's Talz came to the meeting in the wreckage of some destroyed Confederate XT Beetle Transports and politely asked the Pantorans to leave his world. However, Chairman Chi Cho didn't want to lose ownership of Orto Plutonia and at the meeting called the Talz trespassers and savages, using the protocol droid C-3PO to communicate with the Talz. Once again, Thi-Sen said he and his people wanted to live in peace, and asked the Pantorans to pull their people off the planet. Cho, refusing to use diplomacy, deliberately provoked and offended the Talz. Thi-Sen stated that there would be war if the Pantorans didn't do as he asked, and Cho accepted the challenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With war officially declared, the Jedi left for the Republic base to request that Senator Chuchi make contact with the Pantoran Assembly to declare Cho out of order and strip him of power. Thi-Sen rallied his massive army and led his people against the Pantorans and Republic. Engaging the clone troopers assigned to protect the Chairman, Thi-Sen's forces quickly overwhelmed the Republic troops, mortally wounding Cho and killing several clone troopers. After the Talz cornered the surviving clones, reinforcements of the Republic arrived in LAAT/i gunships. Chuchi,who had been given authority to negotiate with the Talz by the Pantoran Assembly in the interest of peace, arrived and Thi-Sen chose to stop the attack. Chairman Cho, who had been struck in the back by a spear during the battle, appealed to Senator Chuchi to continue to fight the Talz, proclaiming that it was for the \"good\" of his people, and was shocked to hear that his authority had been overruled by the Pantoran Assembly, he died shortly thereafter. Chuchi along with C-3PO approached Thi-Sen and told him that it is a greater sacrifice to live for his people then to die for them. The Senator then offered to concede the sovereignty of Plutonia to the Talz and Thi-Sen agreed. The Republic troops left Orto Plutonia and the Talz were left in peace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thi-Sen was called the \"Son of Suns\" by the people of his tribe, and wore the headpiece made from the tailbone of a narglatch as a sign of his position of leadership. His weapons of choice were a spear and cudgel. Thi-Sen was willing to fight to protect his people and home, but unlike Chi Cho, he was willing, and prefered, to seek peaceful solutions to problems.
