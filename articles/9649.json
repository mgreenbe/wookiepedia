The hull featured a broad ridge that ran along roughly three-quarters of the dorsal face of the ship, ending just forward of the tapering fan-tail, which overhung the primary ion engines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In terms of size and power, the Assertor-class was second only to the Executor-class Star Dreadnought, which measured at 19,000 meters and was armed with 5,000 turbolasers among other weapons. As such, it was the largest vessel in the family of Imperial Navy dreadnoughts that included the Bellator-class and Mandator-class.

Twenty ventral twin battleship ion cannon batteries were also placed, along with ten port and ten starboard dorsal medium ion cannons, and twenty heavy tractor beam projectors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were also twenty forward, twenty port, and twenty starboard turret-mounted quad laser cannons, in company with thirty forward, thirty port, and thirty starboard concussion missile launchers.

The lead ship of the class, the Assertor, and its sister ship, the Wrath, were laid down at Kuat Drive Yards at some point prior to the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. During the Galactic Civil War, the Wrath was deployed with its own battle group, as was the Assertor.

The Assertor's own battle group at one point consisted of at least two Imperial II-class Star Destroyers and large scores of TIE/ln fighters, and was located near a light blue celestial body that was in proximity to a smaller, darker-colored terrestrial body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point during the Empire's reign, an agent of the Rebel Alliance was held captive aboard an Assertor, awaiting interrogation.

The Assertor was later pictured in the 2016 Star Wars Roleplaying sourcebook Lead by Example, which was published by Fantasy Flight Games for use with the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game system. The book's depiction of the ship was drawn by Steve Hamilton. The Assertor-class was originally a fan creation designed by Ansel Hsiao in 2010. Both Hsiao's design and the name Assertor-class Star Dreadnought were later introduced into the Star Wars Legends continuity in Jason Fry and Paul R. Urquhart's 2012 reference book, The Essential Guide to Warfare."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the heavy armament of the Assertor-class, Lead by Example suggests that player-characters should not be forced to directly fight an Assertor. Instead, the sourcebook provides an alternative way of using the vessel in roleplaying game adventures\u2014as a backdrop or the location of an objective that the characters must attain. An example given in the book describes a game-master player using an Assertor's weapons systems to target the player-characters' starships on each turn of the game while a space battle is being fought across the dreadnought's surface. A game mechanism is also suggested that allows for missed shots by the Assertor's weapons to instead damage ships of the characters' enemies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
