He was a nervous man and his nerves showed when he had to report to Rumbo that one of their cargo ships carrying Rodian flame silks had been captured by privateers that claimed to be employed by the Galactic Empire. The captain of the freighter had resisted and was shot so the co-pilot had to pilot the starship back to a spaceport. He commented that the previous shipments were left alone due to the X-Wing escort provided by the New Republic however the New Republic was withdrawing its escorts due to cost and need. When Rumbo suggested they hire cheap guards to catch the privateers in the act he protested however Rumbo ignored his objections and in the end Cuplatt or another Cosmohaul employee engaged Paxtrell Snoygal to hire the mercenaries which Rumbo had dubbed 'freelance marines'."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Felben Cuplatt was created by Thomas Bowling for the article Droids Defiant that was published in Star Wars Adventure Journal 9 in February 1996.
