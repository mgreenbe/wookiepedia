When not roasting ronto shanks over the establishment's converted podracer engine roasting pit, the droid used the thin strips of meat hanging around the pit to make Pitmaster's Choice, meaning it could contain a variety of meats including nuna turkey or luggabeast meat cooked till it's brown and black."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point following the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs included a recipe for Pitmaster's Choice in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook.
