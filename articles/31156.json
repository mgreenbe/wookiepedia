It was mostly underground and had a small tractor beam for snagging approaching ships. A massive metal door protected it from exterior attack and served as the only obvious entry and exit. Outside of the door were a number of long trenches as well as six V-120 and eight V-232 artillery emplacements to defend against enemy attacks. The base also had a shield generator that was powerful enough to prevent orbital bombardment. The base was protected by a series of artillery batteries and trenches, as well as being home to a large mineral mine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The rebellion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base was created before 3 BBY as an outpost of the early rebellion. After finding information leading to the planet, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan traveled to Crait on the royal yacht Polestar. Upon landing, she was taken to the outpost, where she discovered that her father Bail Organa was involved in the rebellion. Following the destruction of the first Death Star, Leia, Captain Han Solo and Luke Skywalker took a team to Crait to see if the location would work as a new base for the Rebel Alliance. Leia was then taken into the outpost's old mineral mines. However, Trusk Berinato alerted SCAR Squadron and the Rebels were forced to abandon the outpost after a firefight with the SCAR troopers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First Order\u2013Resistance war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Starkiller Base, the Resistance evacuated to Crait after their original base on the planet of D'Qar was discovered by the First Order.
