Obi-Wan discovered that it was the Queen's serving boy, Jono Dunn who was responsible, and was running through the palace's Royal reception room when he bumped right into the Queen's fiery son. Prince Beju. Playing on Beju's pride, Obi-Wan convinced him not to call the guards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beju pulled out a sword from a display case and challenged Obi-Wan to duel. He threw Obi-Wan a sword, but then attacked before he was fully ready, cutting threw Obi-Wan's tunic and drawing blood. The duel seemed to be in Beju's favor, until Obi-Wan opened himself to The Force, and managed to disarm Beju. Beju went to retrieve his fallen weapon, only to be interrupted by Viso, the blind Council Minister. Distracted, Obi-Wan scooped up the sword, ending the duel, and allowing the old man to talk some sense into the arrogant Prince."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
