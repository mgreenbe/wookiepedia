The planet's native Neimoidians saw the garhai as a symbol of obedience and \"dedication to enlightened leadership.\" Along with its twin symbol, the Spherical Flame, this was considered one of the two most powerful symbols in Neimoidian culture and as such they were often displayed on the walls of Neimoidian buildings. This included the grotto on Neimoidia where in 33 BBY Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray first introduced his advisors, legal counsel Rune Haako and Deputy Viceroy Hath Monchar to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Gunray would later compare the fish to the Confederacy of Independent Systems's manta droid subfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
