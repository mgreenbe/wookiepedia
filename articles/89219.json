After the Battle of Yavin, he was a sublieutenant of the Meatlumps, a group of fanatical anti-technology thugs, in Coronet. Around 1 ABY, Howzat discovered that the Corellia Times reporter Vani Korr was investigating the Meatlumps. Merkie Howzat and his stooges attacked the speeder of the reporter, overturned it while she was driving. Korr was thrown clear and knocked unconscious. As CorSec troopers arrived to rescue the woman, Howzat stole her viewscreen and ran away. A short time later, a spacer clashed with Meatlump stooges in Coronet. The fight turned into a violent firefight and some Meatlumps were killed. Merkie Howzat intervened to support his henchmen but he was also killed in the confrontation. The spacer then found Vani Korr's viewscreen on Howzat's body and decided to bring it back to its owner. The adventurer was eventually hired by Vani Korr and actively participated in her investigation about the Meatlumps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Merkie Howzat was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
