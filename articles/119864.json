The fur color ranged from black to brown.[source?] They ate plant roots, insects, and garbage if they lived in urban areas.[source?] They were considered pests, due to their habit of chewing through electrical cables (they mistook it for plant roots) and their tendency to carry disease.[source?] Harmless and easily caught by a quick, long tongue, it was one of the favored preys of the worrt. When under distress or frightened, they utter a high-pitched cry, similar to that of the Gorgs or Klatooine paddy frogs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sand skitter was named by the Lucasfilm-sanctioned Salacious B.
