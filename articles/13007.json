Offee used it to defend herself from the droids planting explosives in an attempt to destroy the temple.

When Anakin Skywalker came to her quarters, he took the lightsaber as he \"casually\" engaged Offee in inquisitive conversation before activating it and lashing at her. She was forced to defend herself using the lightsabers she'd stolen from Asajj Ventress, giving herself away. The two engaged in an intense duel, Skywalker using Offee's own lightsaber along with his own weapon against her. During the fight, Offee leaped from a ledge to attack Skywalker, the force of her attack knocking her former weapon out of Anakin's hand. It was last seen lying on the ground as Offee was disarmed and arrested."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes"}]}
