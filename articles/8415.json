During the early stages of the Great Jedi Purge, Arex was present on the moon with Jedi Master Kirak Infil'a and was tasked by Infil'a with preparing the mountains defenses when something dark was approaching. When Infil'a confirmed it was a Sith, the droid ran to intercept him, but before it could, Vader tooks its weapon, and threw the droid off the mountain. After Vader was thrown off the mountain by Infil'a, he landed near the droid, who had survived. Arex then told Vader that he was defeated, but Vader responded by crushing the droid, destroying it, and using its parts to repair himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arex first appeared in Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 3, a 2017 canon comic written by Charles Soule and penciled by Giuseppe Camuncoli."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
