Following the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, the Rebellion's fleet was divided in order to scatter their forces, and Grek was one of several commanding officers assigned to the Fourth Division.

However, Commander Ellian Zahra of the Empire had developed a signal analysis protocol, which she used to break the rebel codes, learning the location of both fleets. Sending some of her forces to destroy the Eighth Division, Zahra led an attack on the Fourth Division. The Fourth Division was unable to escape, blocked by a star on one side and the Imperial blockade on the other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A number of rebel ships were lost, including the frigate Tyvarex, but the freighter Millennium Falcon arrived at the rendezvous point, carrying a number of rebel leaders, including Princess Leia Organa.

The commanding officers called a meeting, informing the personnel of the Fourth Division of the situation they were in. As they were unable to contact the other rebel fleets, Organa proposed that the forces of the Fourth Division solve the problem themselves.

Grek was notified that their vessel had been boarded, sending teams to handle the intruders. However, Zahra defeated the rebels sent to stop her, making her way to the main reactor and disabling its safety controls. As alarms sounded, Grek insisted that a crew be sent to lock down the reactor immediately, but Zahra made contact with the ship's command, informing the rebels of the vessel's imminent destruction and her intention of targeting Organa. She informed the crew that if they wanted to survive, they would send Organa down to the reactor alone so she could face her. Organa agreed to the terms immediately, and despite Grek's objections, stated that her life was not worth the lives of the entire crew. Grek, knowing he could not persuade her to reconsider, wished her luck and allowed Organa to take his blaster to face Zahra."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A human male, Grek had black hair, dark skin, and dark eyes.

He accepted that their situation was problematic and that the task ahead would be difficult, but Grek believed that the forces of the Fourth Division would be able to succeed.
