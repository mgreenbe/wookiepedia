The series was illustrated by Hisao Tamaki and edited by David Land, and was specifically adapted from the screenplay of the movie by George Lucas. It was, of course, based on the original story, though slight differences between the manga and the movie do occur."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the fact that was an adaptation of the movie, it was treated in the same vein as the Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope novelization. It enjoyed a level of canon only slightly lower than G-level canon, and took precedence over other titles within the franchise's Expanded Universe, though these titles are now considered part of the continuity of Star Wars Legends and are no longer considered canon except to the degree that they align with the events of the original film."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Issues"}]}
