In approximately the year 1 BBY, Alrich Wren, held hostage by the Galactic Empire in order to ensure his family's cooperation, was moved there from Sundari to cut him off from allies he had in the Mandalorian capital. He did not remain there long, however, as he was placed on a transport back to Sundari in order to be publicly executed, as Clan Wren was engaged in open rebellion against Clan Saxon, who had been placed in charge of Mandalore by Emperor Palpatine. Alrich's daughter, Sabine, led a raid on the prison shortly after he was relocated, which the Empire intended as a diversion so that the convoy carrying Alrich could reach Sundari unmolested."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
