However, Zonama Sekot fought back with ships of its own. The battle was fierce, with the Yuuzhan Vong holding out against the planetary defenses for a while. In the end, the Zonama Sekotan defenses succeeded in overwhelming the Yuuzhan Vong force and hunted down the remaining ships. Towards the end of the battle, the Jade Shadow and the Imperial Remnant frigate Widowmaker arrived. Zonama Sekot than unleashed a wall of psychic energy that knocked the crew of the Jade Shadow unconscious. This wave did not target the Widowmaker though it caused some of her crew of headaches and spacesickness. Upon waking up, the Jade Shadow's crew found that they had landed on Zonama Sekot. They were greeted by the planet's Ferroan Magister Jabitha. Meanwhile the Widowmaker stayed in orbit around the living world where it would not be harmed. Commander Ekh'm Val, meanwhile, fled to Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane, and revealed to him Zonama Sekot's existence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
