Informing Red Leader Garven Dreis of his attack, Vander led the run, followed by Gold Two Tiree and Gold Five Davish \"Pops\" Krail. Vander ordered his pilots to transfer all power to their Y-wings' front deflector screens as a defense against the Death Star's turbolaser turrets observed by Krail, and to activate their targeting computers. When the turbolaser fire abruptly ceased, Krail advised his fellow pilots to stabilize their rear deflectors and watch for enemy fighters as Darth Vader's TIE Advanced x1 and his wingmen, flying TIE/LN starfighters, entered the trench. Vader quickly shot down Tiree, causing Vander to lose his composure, ordering Krail to loosen formation. Krail refused, insisting they stay on target, while Vander in turn was killed by Darth Vader.
