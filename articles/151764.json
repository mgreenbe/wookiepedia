He was among the few survivors of the Death Star's destruction. He reminded the few forces that remained under his command that his ship was still in need of repairs, much to the amusement of Tyber Zann. The captain berated the crewmembers of four traitorous Tartan-class patrol cruisers, saying that Darth Vader would know of their treachery. He was killed when the firepower of the Zann Consortium's forces destroyed his ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
