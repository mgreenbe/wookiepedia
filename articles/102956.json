They worked almost exclusively for Imperial Intelligence and had several facilities in the Invisible Sector of Imperial City. Their main production included the manufacture of essential memory cores for use in Imperial computer systems. To maintain a high rate of production, the company was given access to a \"disposable\" alien force that was constantly being replaced. Thus huge quantities of memory cores were produced at almost no cost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
