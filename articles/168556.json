Educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order at the Coruscant Jedi Temple, Zoi studied the Jedi arts during the Separatist Crisis. A member of a Initiate clan under the instruction of Grand Master Yoda, Zoi was eventually selected as a Padawan by a Jedi Master under whom Zoi constructed a lightsaber which he would wield in battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Zoi took up the rank of Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic. During the final year of the war, Zoi was stationed on Coruscant when General Grievous launched a surprise attack on the capital world. Alongside Padawans Iguni and Zeami, Zoi rushed out to join in the fray despite orders to remain at the Temple after being convinced by Iguni it was the right thing to do. Together with his peers, Zoi helped take out several B2 super battle droids, Octuptarra combat tri-droids and at least one DSD1 dwarf spider droid before both he and Zeami were injured. Upon seeing his friend injured, Iguni took hold of her limp body and created a whirlwind in the Force which surrounded the two of them and damaged everything nearby, including Zoi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was at this point that Iguni's master, Mace Windu, arrived and ordered Iguni to return to the Temple and take his friends with him, as he was causing more harm than good. Zoi was then taken to the Halls of Healing, where he was treated for his wounds. Iguni soon visited him to apologize for his actions and, though he forgave him, he vowed to grow stronger in the Force so that he could protect his friends. Zoi went back to his training along with his friends, where both he and Zeami would often check up on Iguni as he practiced his lightsaber techniques with Master Windu. It was soon after this that Iguni had a vision of Anakin Skywalker killing many Jedi and turning to the dark side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zoi only appears in the story Evil Eyes, published in Star Wars Manga: Black issue of Tokyopop's Star Wars Manga.
