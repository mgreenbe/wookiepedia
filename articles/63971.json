Those routes were regarded as safe, allowing starships to travel without colliding with a celestial body in realspace. Chains of important star systems formed runs, which were vital navigational routes for trade and transit, and such routes could cross multiple sectors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star systems could have several or a single hyperlane entrance/exit point, meaning that such points could be guarded and fortified, and ports of access monitored and controlled. Hyperspace beacons helped guide starships to star systems, refueling stations, and ports, and several beacons could act as guides through dangerous and less traveled parts of the galaxy. The destruction of such beacons could hinder travel to the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Major trade routes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Major trade hyperspace routes included the Corellian Run, Corellian Trade Spine, Hydian Way, Perlemian Trade Route, and Rimma Trade Route."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Minor hyperspace routes included the Ison Trade Corridor, among others."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Old Republic sent pioneering survey teams to explore and chart new hyperspace lanes with navigational beacons. The Tertiary Usaita system was one such system to undergo Old Republic exploration. As galactic citizens from the Core pushed outwards, star systems fought for hyperspace lanes to be charted through their systems, which brought with them trade, wealth, and prestige. As time passed, the laborious task of traveling through hyperspace beacons, which required numerous reversions to realspace, was replaced with new hyperlanes such as the Hydian Way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quickly attacking after the First Battle of Geonosis, which commenced the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems took control of major hyperspace lanes, separating the territories of the Galactic Republic from most of its Grand Army. A treaty established with the Hutt Clan granted the Republic access to their supply routes in the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mysterious Grysk used their advanced technology to move four of Mokivj's moons out of orbit and into the paths of several major hyperlanes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the months following the Battle of Hoth, the Rebel Alliance used the Sanctuary Pipeline hyperspace route to move their fleet from Sullust to the forest moon of Endor.
