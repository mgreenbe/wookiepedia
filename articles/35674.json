As a favor for Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit, Collerand went undercover, using the alias \"Mole,\" in the town of Tiquwe on Aloxor in order to learn about pirate gangs. During their mission to Aloxor, he encountered Lieutenant Eli Vanto, Assistant Director Brierly Ronan and two death troopers, Pik and Waffle, who had been captured by criminals while attempting to look into a conspiracy involving stolen components intended for Project Stardust.
