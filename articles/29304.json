The leitmotif is played when portals through time and space were opened, as well as during scenes relating to the key placed at the Jedi Temple on Kordoku and the connection or disconnection between sentients. The motif is sometimes played as a figure preceding John Williams' friendship motif, and a twisted, minor-key rendition of the motif plays in accompaniment to scenes of disconnection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The motif is played throughout the special, including throughout the final scene, when sentients and porgs gather to celebrate Life Day after Finn, using Rey's lightsaber, cuts a roast tip-yip in half along with the feast table in trying to let go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The combination of the connection and friendship motifs is first played in the first scene of the LEGO Holiday Special, when Yoda begins to narrate Rey Skywalker's journey on Life Day in the aftermath of the final battle against the Sith. The two motifs are later played when Rey Skywalker is taught by Jedi Master Yoda to be mindful of her connections with others, showing visions of the past of a master and an apprentice being not only learners in the Force, but also friends\u2014the most important thing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The combined motif is again played when Rey Skywalker creates a portal through time and space without the use of the key, having learnt the importance of connection. Later, the combination of the connection and frienship motifs is played when Rey and Luke Skywalker part ways aboard the second Death Star after defeating the Sith together by adhering to the Jedi tenet of letting go. The entirety of the two motifs is again played in the final scene of the Holiday Special, when Yoda narrates that Life Day was a time of joy\u2014friendship and family\u2014as celebrants gather together in a circle in the day of life, before transitioning into the end credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
