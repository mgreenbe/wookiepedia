Requiring a crew of 2, it could carry up to four passengers in enclosed duraplast \"cacoons,\" tended by a field medic charged with ensuring that the wounded survived long enough to reach the operating table. The Model 300 was the medlifter most commonly used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. Ubrikkian Transports' sister company, Ubrikkian Steamworks, originally designed its DD-13 medical assistant droid to be used aboard Model 300s, but when the airspeeders proved to be less useful, and, thus, less profitable than anticipated, the company transferred its DD-13s to Republic Mobile Surgical Units."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
