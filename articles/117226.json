The Roonan have blue or gray skin and they had a ridged forehead and cranium with large, almond-shaped blue eyes. Short in stature, they have big ideas and are notoriously easy to offend. They also have been known to take even the slightest slip-up as a deep insult. The Jedi Master Halsey was a member of this species, as were Senators Aang and Edcel Bar Gane. According to C-3PO, the Roonan had tiny teeth. They were reputed for being very picky and particular regarding details; the slightest error could be taken as a grievous insult."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
