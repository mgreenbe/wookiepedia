He previously instructed at the Academy of Carida, and taught Chancey Yarrow during his time there. Yarrow theorized on the creation of an artificial gravity-well projector that could force starships out of hyperspace, and was eventually ejected by the academy, which saw her ideas as being mad. Years later, after reports of the Nihil pulling vessels out of hyperspace in the Berenge sector, Wolk believed that Yarrow had gone to work with the marauders to realize her concept, and was intent on stopping her from doing so. Though his suspicions were correct\u2014Yarrow was responsible for the construction of the Gravity's Heart space station for the Nihil\u2014Wolk was unable to see his theory proven true; the professor was later assassinated while on the planet Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
