They lived a barbaric, yet strangely harmonious, existence filled with constant warring between the various divided nations on their world. During their pre-industrial age, by 30,000 BBY, the inhabitants of Korriban fought off an incursion from the Killiks. It was under the iron rule of King Adas that the Sith first became unified. He was declared the Sith'ari: the ultimate being. It was he who first formed a Sith Empire around the year 28,000 BBY, and his reign lasted for three centuries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The relative stability of this empire was first challenged in 27,700 BBY when the Sith were visited by the Rakata. These aliens from the distant Infinite Empire attempted to lull the ancient Sith King into their confidence by providing him with the knowledge to create Holocrons. However, their true motivation of conquest quickly became apparent. This led to King Adas bringing the full might of the Sith Empire to bear on the Rakata, and he succeeded in driving them away from Korriban at the cost of his life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the remains of the enemy craft, the once primitive Sith were propelled into a space age and were armed with the power of the dark side of the Force. Using these newly acquired tools from the Infinite Empire, the Sith Empire conquered other nearby worlds which became part of Sith Space and relocated their capital from ancient Korriban to the neighboring world of Ziost. A number of pure-blooded Sith also established a library-temple on the world of Krayiss Two around 14,000 BBY where they slumbered and their spirits continued to haunt the temple for the next 10,000 years. The reign of this empire was short lived, however, as it dissolved into civil war after the death of King Adas, leaving his people to regress into a more primitive state."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the year 7000 BBY, a civil war was initiated by Dathka Graush, which left most of the cities of Korriban in ruin. A group of Sith priests of the Kissai caste interpreted the death of Adas as a sign to reject the dark side dominated beliefs of their people. Labeled as heretics for their actions, these Sith were banished and settled the planet Tund, where they became the Sorcerers of Tund. The planet Arkania also fell under the dominion of the Sith, and by 7000 BBY, they had established a library known as Veeshas Tuwan on it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the year 6900 BBY, exiled fallen Jedi fleeing from the Battle of Corbos, which concluded the Hundred-Year Darkness, landed on Korriban, a desolate world inhabited by the relatively primitive but unusually Force-sensitive Sith people. Upon arriving, the Dark Jedi attempted to subjugate the Sith and take whatever knowledge they possessed. The Sith attempted to protect their secrets, but they fell to the superior training and technology of the invaders. Using their training in the Force, the fallen Jedi amazed the Sith, and elevated themselves to god-like status on Korriban, becoming the rulers of the Sith people. Over the next two thousand years, interbreeding occurred between the fallen Jedi and the Sith by means of Sith alchemy, which led to the term \"Sith\" being used to identify not only the original inhabitants of Korriban, but also their fallen Jedi masters. This intermingling between the two species continued across hundreds of generations, and the hybridized offspring of this union became the new ruling class of the Sith. Thus was the Sith Empire born, with Ziost becoming the capital, while Korriban became a sacred mausoleum-world. One of the first Sith Lords of this new empire was Ajunta Pall, whom the native Sith viewed as an incarnation of their primary god, Typhojem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the Exiles became Sith Lords, an overly ambitious group of their number, led by Baron Remulus Dreypa, decided to retrace their steps back to the Republic using a navicomputer from one of the ships that brought them to Sith Space.

While the greater Sith were unaware of their fate, this expedition did succeed in their goal and fought against the Jedi Order.

Long before the race reached their Golden Age, the Sith Empire fought in the Battle of Kalsunor, where Silooths were first used in order to subjugate the planet Kalsunor, which had long resisted conquest.

However, on occasion, ships that braved the Caldera were captured by the Sith, becoming slaves\nto ranking nobles in the empire. After generations, these slaves slowly forgot their origins and largely identified themselves as being Sith. It was through the entry of inhabitants from the Tapani sector that led to the influx of highly technical slaves that developed the Sith Empire's technological as well as medical base; millennia later, these Tapani humans formed the backbone of the Lost Tribe of the Sith. Also during this age, Sith Holocrons spoke of the legendary Muur Talisman which many desired to find and possess. While the Sith Empire had grown into a powerful force, they now faced potential self-annihilation. Having starved for centuries, the Sith sought to expand and conquer new worlds and enemies to subjugate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the Golden Age, the Sith Lord Ieldis created a slaver organization known as the Crucible which was tasked with capturing refugees displaced from war in order for them to be used as a slave army that would fight for the Sith Empire.

Ragnos would prove to be one of the last rulers of the original Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ragnos often placed his rivals against one another, manipulated them into challenging him openly, or simply had them assassinated. While many factions sought to expand beyond the confines of Sith Space, Ragnos forbid it, as he well remembered how his ancestors were defeated by the Jedi Order. He knew how powerful the Jedi were and he was not confident that the Sith Empire was strong enough to challenge them. After ruling for a century, his death caused a power vacuum within the leadership of the Empire which saw the isolationist Ludo Kressh and the expansionist Naga Sadow amass power in order to propel themselves onto the Sith throne."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Great Hyperspace War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In circa 5000 BBY, the isolation of the Sith was broken when two young hyperspace explorers called Gav and Jori Daragon stumbled upon Korriban by accident while they attempted to establish a hyperlane in an effort to expand their trade options. However, the feuding Sith had little interest in peaceful trade with the Republic and instead the pair were captured as spies whereupon they were imprisoned on Ziost whilst they awaited interrogation. By this point in their history, the Sith held little memory of the Republic who lived in distant regions of space compared to them. This saw Ludo Kressh and his conservative allies claim that the two travelers were the precursors of an invasion of their territory whilst his rival Naga Sadow held the view that the Republic offered new lands to conquer. In secret, Sadow also believed that focusing on conquest of the Republic would unite the strained factions of the Empire and distract the populace of the political problems they faced in their native territory. A tribunal of Sith rulers later sentenced the Daragon's to death but Sadow secretly had them rescued and sheltered at his own isolated fortress. However, he left behind evidence to suggest that the rescue attempt was done so by Republic agents and used this to galvanize the Sith Council by exploiting on their fears as well as their doubts. The Daragons proved to be the perfect scapegoats for Sadow who convinced comrades that an invasion was imminent and that they needed to conduct a pre-emptive attack against their enemy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Whilst the Daragons were kept at his fortress world, Ludo Kressh began to uncover signs that Sadow was responsible for freeing the two alien intruders. Thus, he gathered forces loyal to him in order to assault Naga Sadow's domain in order to expose him as a traitor and schemer. This was partly also an attempt by Kressh to take the mantle of leadership of the Sith Empire. However, this all fell into Sadow's plan as he was well prepared for his rivals \"surprise attack\" and in the resultant chaos; he convinced Jori Daragon to abandon her brother in order to escape into Republic space. Intending to warn the Galactic Republic of the dangerous Sith Empire; she fled in Starbreaker 12 at which point Sadow unleashed his own hidden forces that annihilated Kressh's with Ludo's own flagship being destroyed thus seemingly killing him. In the aftermath, Naga Sadow declared himself as the new Dark Lord of the Sith and revealed that he had secretly placed a transmitter on Jori Daragon's vessel thus allowing the Empire to trace her journey into Republic territory. After consolidating his forces, Sadow gathered his armies of bloodthirsty Massassi warriors in preparation of the upcoming invasion. Despite the little intelligence he had of his enemy, the Sith Empire's vast invasion force moved through the Daragon Trail into Republic space. Alongside the Dark Lord was his Sith apprentice Gav Daragon whereupon they sent their armada to follow his sisters tracking beacon leading to the surprise Sith onslaught starting at the Koros Major system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dark Lord was well aware that his forces would be insufficient in combating the Republic Navy but made use of the element of surprise to aid him and for a time, it worked. The Koros system fell to the Sith's might and the Empire's naval forces spread through the Koros Trunk Line to assault the shipyards at Foerost whereupon the Sith moved to assault Kaikielius, Metellos, Basilisk, Shawken and ultimately Coruscant itself. The Sith armies on Coruscant managed to march across the Legislative District and onto the steps of the Senate Hall itself where they were fought off by the defending Jedi forces. At Koros Major, the Sith proved relentless and unpredictable in their attacks which was necessary due to Sadow's limited knowledge of this region of space which led to the Republic not faring well in this conflict which became known as the Great Hyperspace War. Unknown to the Republic, Sadow had stationed his Sith Meditation Sphere around Primus Goluud where he employed Sith magic to create illusionary phantoms that made the Empire's enemies believe that the Sith had far greater numbers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the conflict, the Sith Lord Naga Sadow dispatched some of his forces to locate Lignan crystals which were to be used in the creation of advanced lightsabers for use against the Republic and the Jedi. One of the ships dispatched was the Omen, however, it later crashed on the primitive world of Kesh where the crew at first attempted to return to space but later adapted to life on the planet amongst the native Keshiri. During the war, several Jedi were corrupted and joined the forces of the Sith Empire, one of which included the Kaleesh Saes Rrogon who commanded the Harbinger. In the closing stages of the conflict, the newly trained Sith Valik Kodank diverted resources for the construction of her own Sith Temple located in the Tascollan Nebula. She would later leave the Sith Empire with a sect consisting of her followers in order to continue their existence elsewhere. As the conflict continued, it was known that the Jedi used the planet Ossus as a staging ground for raids into Sith territory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After learning of the Sith magic being used in the war, the Republic became emboldened to strike back against the Empire. This saw them being reinforced from the naval base at Anaxes which they used to push back the Sith armada to their beachhead at Koros Major. Their combined forces pushed towards Primus Goluud where they attacked the Empire's forces present in the region. By this point, Gav Daragon had turned against his Sith Master but Sadow had tricked him into being left behind on the Meditation Ship leading to Daragon dying at the hands of the Republic retaliating fleet. His act of betrayal against Gav Daragon also turned the young explorer against his master and he revealed to Empress Teta the hyperspace coordinates of the Sith Empire's territories. In an effort to destroy his enemies, Naga Sadow used his own Sith technology to cause the Primus Goluud star to erupt into a supernova whilst he made his escape back to Sith Space with what few forces he had left."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Naga Sadow returned back to the Sith Empire, he was greeted by an unexpected figure - his rival Ludo Kressh, who had not died in their earlier battle but was warned by his spies of the assassination attempt. Showing no mercy, Kressh's forces mercilessly attacked Sadow's battered fleet before they could recover and declared them traitors. However, Naga Sadow's forces fought with wild frenzy as they had nothing to lose, leading to both sides being devastated as a result at the second battle of Korriban. Kressh himself was killed when one of Sadow's battleships rammed into it, at which point the fleets of the Republic arrived and attacked the weakened Sith forces. The Republic forces decimated the remaining Sith fleets and brought about the downfall of their Empire in the resultant crossfire. In a final desperate gamble, Sadow gathered what few followers he could and fled from the battlefield whilst being pursued by Republic ships. Utilizing Sith sorcery, he had his lone warship fly through the Denarii Nova and caused solar flares that destroyed his pursuers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By this point, Supreme Chancellor Pultimo ordered Republic forces in an invasion of Sith Space which saw hundreds of ships piercing the Stygian Veil. The Sith Empire at the time was in complete turmoil after the death of Ludo Kressh and was unable to withstand the onslaught of these invaders that now arrived in their territory. With Kressh dead and Sadow missing, Shar Dakhan became appointed as the acting Dark Lord of the Sith. Sensing defeat and possible surrender being the only options available to them, he commanded his warriors to make suicidal attacks against the invading enemy fleets. This act led to heavy losses being sustained by the Republic and forced them into making a temporary retreat as a result. Ultimately, the Republic only won after many of the lower-caste Sith committed ritualistic suicide. Whilst the Sith by this point no longer posed a threat, the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic was still unsatisfied as to the outcome of the conflict. Thus, Jedi and Republic forces were sent to Korriban as well as other Sith planets in order to ensure that no remnants of the Sith Empire remained. This act forced a number of Sith to flee into space where they were led by a Sith who had arisen to take Naga Sadow's place as the new Dark Lord. Members of this exile fleet later settled on Dromund Kaas where they waited for centuries in order to get their revenge against the Republic. One of the last holdouts was that of Elcho Kressh who spent years developing a counterattack plan outside the Caldera where he made most of the few forces available to him. Utilizing a tactic used by Naga Sadow, he began recruiting groups that were hostile to the Republic which ranged from pirate bands to mercenary militias and other such species which allowed him to build an impressive force. However, on the eve of his planned invasion, Elcho suffered from a ruptured stomach after heavy drinking which killed him within hours thus ending any plans of revenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Empire was broken as a result though unknown to the Republic, Sadow had in fact escaped in the struggle.

The Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic worked to destroy any remaining strongholds of the Sith which saw the end of their once glorious empire which was now defeated. After their defeat, a group of Sith retreated to the planet Thule that was home to a stealth regiment where they worked alongside special forces in order to build up once more and set themselves up as an advance force for an eventual return of the empire.

Among the many locations destroyed, the ancient Sith library on Arkania known as Veeshas Tuwan was destroyed by a group of Jedi Masters. Jedi Shadows worked to destroy any Dark Side artifacts created by the Sith such as amulets and talismans. While the ranks of the Jedi Shadows destroyed most of these tainted artifacts, items such as holocrons were, however, kept in the custody of the Jedi Order though many others were left in the burial vaults of the Sith Lords. Any surviving manuscripts and books were later taken to the Galactic Museum at Republic City where they were stored in the Sith Hall for visitors to see.

This faction of the Sith along with other relics continued to influence and shape events in the galaxy for thousands of years. It was from that point onwards that the term Sith changed from being a name for the species to being a title given to those that practiced the Sith teachings. Among the many legacies of the ancient Sith were their various warbots that were deactivated after the defeat of the Empire. These few battle droids remained hidden with some emerging during various events such as the later Great Sith War and even during the Jedi Civil War.

The war resulted in the fall of the Alliance and the reestablishment of the Empire as the primary galactic government. The territories and bureaucracy of the Alliance were absorbed into the Empire, but the Galactic Alliance Core Fleet refused to surrender, and continued to fight the resurgent Empire. Shortly after the fall of the Alliance, the Emperor called upon the entire New Jedi Order to surrender and subject their will to the Empire, in which some of them did, becoming Imperial Knights, while the others remained to the will of the Force and retreated to Ossus. After the Alliance defeat and the Massacre at Ossus, the Sith under the command of Darth Krayt turned against Emperor Fel.

The Sith Empire was hierarchical, utilizing both a rigid caste system and a stratified rank structure to put its subjects in their proper place. Due to how long Sith society has separated the Sith into castes (across approximately 100,000 years), each caste was sometimes referred to as a sub-species of Sith. The Kissai were the priest caste of the Sith who also served as spiritual leaders that indoctrinated others into Sith teachings. This was most likely where the mages and other practitioners of their ancient and mysterious magic were placed. In contrast, the Massassi were the warrior caste of the Sith. They were unswervingly obedient to the Dark Lord of the Sith; they were also loyal to the individual Sith Lord they served, though this loyalty was secondary to their loyalty to the Dark Lord. The Sith Engineer Caste built and maintained Sith technology, including droids and starships. Sith slaves were the lowliest caste of the Sith. They worshipped the Sith Lords as gods, and were often used as sacrifices. The Sith Lords used them for slave labor and menial tasks, such as grooming their feet. Most citizens of the Empire lived in this meager caste driven structure where they toiled to build their rulers tomb or dying by the millions in internecine warfare. They were ultimately ruled by a military styled culture with a great reverence for the dead. When a Sith Lord died, his slaves were buried alive with his body in his tomb on Korriban."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Adas unified the Sith nations, he took the title of \"Sith'ari\" which, when translated, meant \"Sith Overlord\" in Basic.

Following the death of Adas, many claimed the title of Sith'ari and fought each other in constant civil wars, each ruling only a fief. Following 6,900 BBY, the current Sith'ari was killed and the Sith interbred with the Jen'jidai, resulting in a mix of Ancient Sith and baseline Human species traits, resulting in many losing the low-light vision which most Ancient Sith possessed.

Jen'ari were the greatest and most powerful of the Sith Lords who took the place of the Sith'ari in the Sith hierarchy. There was only one Jen'ari at a time, who was the head of the Sith Council, and ruler of the Sith Empire. The original Jen'ari were Jen'jidai; later Jen'ari were Sith Lords who assumed the title after the death of the previous Jen'ari, defeating any rival claimant to the title in combat (often resulting in death, or at least disfigurement). From 6,900 BBY to 5,000 BBY, the Sith Lords collectively ruled the Empire through a governing body known as the Sith Council, which the Jen'ari ruled over and commanded; each member of the Council had a personal fleet. Many Jen'ari had partial Jen'jidai ancestry, which was, in some, considered more desirable. After the fall of the Sith Empire, the title \"Dark Lord of the Sith\" was used by both the leader of the Sith Order (such as Exar Kun or Revan) and his apprentice (such as Ulic Qel-Droma or Malak), although it is uncertain if the title \"Jen'ari\" remained in use in any capacity, or was abandoned for the title \"Darth\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the formation of the Sith Empire, the Sith were engaged in constant warfare with one another though this was seen as an acceptable practice as they believed it to be a fundamental aspect of their existence.

Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society. After the arrival of the Exiles, only those that were Force-sensitive had the capacity to reach the upper echlons of the Sith Empire. Those that were blind to the Force were considered useless; fit for only common labor purposes or simple bureaucratic work.

Some Sith Lords even found value in the descendants of these foreigners such as those of the Tapani worlds due to their skills in science. Natural born Sith tended to focus on sorcery while the Tapani's excellence in the fields of science meant that they became valued members of the Empire and developed the industrial as well as medical infrastructure for several Sith Lords. Through such means as those presented by the Tapani, the Sith developed new lightsaber construction techniques that were more advanced than those produced by either Sith or Jedi.

This remained the case until the arrival of the Exiles who took interest in the species' techniques in drawing on the power of the dark side of the Force which they used to accomplish their sorcery. This practice was used by pure blood Sith who often dwelled in Library-temples where they sat in meditation as well as recorded their experiences as well as experiments. They also created many tools designed to enhance or project their power which was commonly seen in Sith talismans. These dark side empowered constructs were capable of a wide range of feats from being simple concentration tools to being a trap that turned other Force users to the dark side when being used or defensive tools that absorbed weapon fire and even being used for healing.

Early in their history, the Sith Empire came to realize the potential in the use of automated droids to enhance the combat performances of their military. Droids such as elite warbots, slayer droids, and sentries were often treated with alchemy in order to improve their construction materials and add to their combat capabilities.

These beasts were often treated with Sith alchemy and were part of centuries long breeding programs that were designed to create easily trained animals that responded to certain commands. To enforce control over these creatures, the Sith often used standard command coding in order to manage these animals in combat engagements.
