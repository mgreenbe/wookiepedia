They wore off-white tunics, khaki knee-length shorts, brown leather shoes, and tan socks. They carried blasters in hip-holsters, and were responsible for the day-to-day law enforcement on the planet while Imperial forces patrolled Spira's airspace. The Security Police answered directly to the Tourist Guild who ruled the planet under lease from the Empire, but cooperation between the police and the local Imperial garrison was regular and cordial."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
