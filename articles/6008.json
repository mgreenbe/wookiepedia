The Empire developed the Altor-class following the Clone Wars, and measured 4,600 meters in length. It housed a cluster of hangars and dry docks at its stern that could accommodate frigate-sized capital ships for deep space repairs, and contained seven powerful thrusters that were each encircled by eight auxiliary engines. The ship used six spheroidal fuel containers with multiple articulated arms that carried refueling nozzles that were able to refuel two capital ships at the same time, one on each side. Naval Station Validusia served as the base for one Altor-class ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
