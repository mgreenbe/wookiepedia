They were grown in hydroponic tanks and took the form of pale pink, precisely six-centimeter cubes. Although nutritionally balanced, bepps were flavorless, and, by 12 ABY, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker had yet to encounter anyone who enjoyed eating them. Due to being clones, all bepps were identical, which caused \"as alike as bepps\" to become a common phrase throughout the galaxy by the reign of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bepps were first mentioned in Children of the Jedi, a novel released in 1995 by Barbara Hambly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
