The Star Wars Legends reference book The Essential Atlas, published in 2008, originally placed the planet in the Core Worlds. According to Jason Fry, co-author of the book, the decision to place the planet in the Core was made when the only known information about Scipio was that it was the homeworld of Rush Clovis, so the authors felt that the Core was a fitting choice. However, once The Clone Wars went into more detail about Scipio, including how it was an important world to the InterGalactic Banking Clan, the planet was moved to the Outer Rim Territories near Muunilinst as it made more sense to have it within the geographic Banking Clan sphere. The 2015 reference book Ultimate Star Wars accidentally stated that Scipio is in the Core as a result of an editing mistake."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the real world, Scipio was the name of a prominent family in the politics and militarism of the Roman Republic, flourishing in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
