They left their post aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Reprisal after the leader of the group, Daric LaRone, killed Major Drelfin of the Imperial Security Bureau (ISB). The Major had threatened LaRone after accusing him of insubordination during a mission to the planet Teardrop, and LaRone was forced to kill the Major in self-defense. The four witnesses to the event\u2014Korlo Brightwater, Taxtro Grave, Saberan Marcross and Joak Quiller\u2014decided to desert with their friend as they feared the ISB would severely punish them for doing nothing to save the Major. They were able to steal a modified Suwantek TL-1800 freighter, the Gillia, which was outfitted with a substantial amount of military supplies and weaponry. Hoping to avoid capture by the ISB, the group traveled to Drunost, a planet controlled by Consolidated Shipping\u2014where they encountered and destroyed a swoop gang which was attacking a group of farmers, who in truth were Rebel smugglers\u2014and to Janusar city on Ranklinge, where they removed the corrupt Patroller Chief Cav'Saran from power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They first went by the name \"Hand of Judgment\" when on Ranklinge, when LaRone\u2014who had been chosen to be the group's spokesman\u2014was unable to come up with an authentic-sounding fake operating number.

They returned to Drunost, where they encountered Han Solo and Luke Skywalker\u2014two Rebels who were there to learn more about the fight between the five stormtroopers and the swoop gang, when the Hand of Judgment had inadvertently rescued Rebel smugglers. Together with Solo and Skywalker, who were also interested in tracking the pirates, the Hand of Judgment headed to the BloodScar's base on the mining planet Gepparin, where they found a link between the pirates and Barshnis Choard, the governor of the Shelsha sector. They followed the lead to Shelkonwa, where the crew of the YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon\u2014Solo, Skywalker and Solo's Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca\u2014also wanted to go as they had a friend who had gotten into trouble on the capital, Makrin City."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving the Rebels to search for their friend, the Hand of Judgment went to help a downed ship which had landed near them and encountered an Imperial agent, Mara Jade.

The group got into the palace and the Hand of Judgment arrested the Governor to stand trial for his treason. While separated from the stormtroopers, Jade had heard about a group of five stormtrooper deserters and realized that they were the Hand of Judgment, but when Darth Vader questioned the group, she covered them again, claiming they belonged to her.

When Jade found out that the Governor had been coerced to co-operate with the Rebels\u2014his family had been abducted under the orders of warlord Nuso Esva\u2014the Hand of Judgment took him under protective custody while she went after the kidnappers. With help from a group of alien refugees identifying themselves as the Troukree, led by their spokesman called Vaantaar who they had met in the capital of Poln Major, Whitestone City, the stormtroopers were able to ward off the attacks on the Governor's life by Nuso Esva's followers. When the Governor and his family had been secured, Vaantaar took the Hand of Judgment to meet his master aboard the Imperial Star Destroyer Admonitor. Senior Captain Thrawn was interested in having LaRone and his companions under his command in his shadow Empire within the Unknown Regions.

All the Rebels evacuated before the Star Destroyer arrived, but the Reprisal's Captain, Kendal Ozzel, still decided to deploy the troops to attack a city on the hills, which was suspected of having harbored the Rebels. LaRone, Grave, Marcross and Quiller were among the stormtroopers who participated in the attack while Brightwater was on patrol duty outside the city. Members of the Imperial Security Bureau, who were accompanying the task force, ordered the soldiers to shoot defenseless civilians. After the attack Brightwater told LaRone how the official reports would say there had been a Rebel ambush in the city, but the five soldiers suspected that there had been nothing of the sort and thus no legitimate reason to kill the entire population. During a conversation with LaRone, Grave suggested the ISB had only wanted to see if any of the stormtroopers would purposefully miss his shots. Grave and LaRone had also made the observation that the first people who were targeted were aliens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several days after the massacre, ISB Major Drelfin came across LaRone and his companions in a passage on board the Reprisal.

The confrontation ended when Drelfin threatened LaRone with a gun and the trained battle reflexes took control of the stormtrooper, who grabbed the weapon and shot the Major in self-defense when he pulled out his back-up gun. LaRone's four friends, who were present for the event, realized that he was in serious trouble, and that their own situation was also questionable as none of them had tried to stop LaRone. The death of an ISB major would soon be noticed, so the group came to reluctant conclusion that their only way out of it was to leave the Reprisal immediately. Following Quiller's advice, the group decided to grab one of the modified ships the ISB had brought on board, choosing the Suwantek TL-1800 freighter named Gillia as their vehicle of escape. To get out of the Reprisal, LaRone pretended to be Major Drelfin and tricked the ship into dropping out of hyperspace so that they could leave.

After the massacre on Teardrop\u2014combined with the rumors they had heard about the destruction of the planet Alderaan\u2014they had been wondering if the Empire they had served so loyally really was worth their allegiance. The large amount of money the ISB had stored aboard the Suwantek allowed the stormtroopers to survive for a while without finding work, so they decided to head for Drunost, a planet controlled by Consolidated Shipping and which thus had almost nonexistent Imperial presence, to buy fuel and provisions before they would try and find a more permanent hiding place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While LaRone and Grave were shopping on Drunost, a swoop gang attacked a group of farmers near where the stormtroopers' Suwantek was parked.

The incident, however, forced them to leave Drunost before they had gotten all their supplies\u2014they didn't want to wait for the Reprisal to track them there. The battle with the gang also forced the stormtroopers to think about their chain of command, as they knew battles required someone to lead while others followed the orders, and in the end LaRone was chosen to become the leader of their team."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Becoming the Hand of Judgment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After they departed from Drunost, LaRone's group headed to Ranklinge, a planet in Shelsha sector of the Colonies, where they intended to complete their shopping. When they landed in the city of Janusar, Sergeant Whisteer of the local patrol group tried to shake them down. The patroller also confiscated the two Aratech speeder bikes which had been found on board the Suwantek. When the patrollers were gone, a starport worker named Krinkins told them that the one behind the extortion was in fact the Patroller Chief Cav'Saran, who had taken the entire city under his control. Such a misuse of power angered LaRone and his companions, who decided to release the city with the help of few honest patrollers, who had lost their job when Cav'Saran had taken over. After a day of making plans and shopping, LaRone led his group to the Patroller Central, where their contact from the spaceport was waiting for them with the ex-patrollers and a sizable crowd. When LaRone confronted Cav'Saran about his actions, the Patroller Chief decided to make a fight for it with the support of his most loyal followers, but the five stormtroopers cut them down easily. After the corrupted patrollers had been dealt with, the former senior officer Colonel Atmino, who LaRone assigned to take charge of the city temporarily, asked the stormtroopers their operating numbers. LaRone told him they were called the \"Hand of Judgment\" because he had no better ideas at that time.

They noticed that both groups had suspicious connections with a pirate group called the BloodScars. They decided to return to Drunost to learn more about the swoop gang, but instead they found one of the farmers in close conversation with a suspicious group of people that included two Humans and a Wookiee. Believing that the group might be connected with the pirates, they followed their YT-1300 light freighter to the Purnham system, where they became allies of convenience with the group against two pirate ships. The pirates were attacking a ship that had been acting as bait in a trap planned by Han Solo, the captain of the YT-1300. After destroying one of the pirate ships, the Hand of Judgment boarded the remaining vessel, which had been incapacitated during the battle. From the two pirates they captured alive, the Hand of Judgment learned that the BloodScars had been gathering smaller groups under their command. The pirates also told them about a mercenary named Caaldra, who had been meeting with the leader of the pirates.

Solo was extremely suspicious of LaRone and his companions\u2014even though he had no idea they had Imperial background\u2014but they were still able to co-operate in tracking down a likely location of the BloodScar pirate base. LaRone decided to keep Solo, Skywalker and Chewbacca locked up in three of the cabins while they would follow the lead to the Gepparin system, where they expected to find the pirates. But when they arrived at Gepparin, in addition to pirates, the Hand of Judgment found the Reprisal. The Star Destroyer had gotten there slightly ahead of them as Captain Ozzel and his ISB associate Vak Somoril wanted to destroy the pirate base as an excuse to kill an Imperial agent, Mara Jade, who had infiltrated the place\u2014they were afraid that the woman had found out about the five missing stormtroopers, which would have been a threat to their careers.

In the command bunker they found a communications unit that was set to send messages to Shelkonwa, the capital planet of the Shelsha sector. Because Solo and Skywalker\u2014the latter had learned through the Force that their friend, Leia Organa, was in trouble on Shelkonwa\u2014also wanted to head that way, they decided to stay together a little while longer, even after both learned of the others' affiliations to the Empire and the Rebel Alliance.

The faked military registry information the stormtroopers had for the ship allowed them to land unchallenged at Greencliff Regional Spaceport. As the city was crawling with stormtroopers of Vader's personal escort from the 501st Legion, the Hand of Judgment decided to accompany the Rebels during their search to make sure they would not fall into Imperial hands. When they were nearing their target\u2014Skywalker had used the Force to locate Organa as well as roaming patrols they tried to avoid\u2014they saw how a small spaceship was shot down nearby.

They were also helped by Chewbacca, who was piloting the Suwantek and acting as bait, and Solo's group, who were attempting to return to the ship without drawing unwanted attention as they had already found Organa. Soon after the battle, official stormtrooper patrols arrived on the scene, but as the young woman noticed LaRone's reluctance to identify his group, she covered them, claiming that they were a special unit given under her command. After they left the scene together, Jade wanted LaRone to tell her all the things he had not told to the regular military, but he spun a story of half-truths to hide the fact that they were practically military deserters and she accepted it only demanding that the Hand of Judgment would, for the time being, take orders from her.

After they had located the door, Jade took command again and led them further away, where she was able to use her lightsaber to cut an opening in the wall. When they had gotten inside the Palace grounds, Brightwater separated from the others and headed to the main gate on his speeder bike to prevent any possible escape attempts, while Jade led the other four across the garden toward a side door, which opened into a kitchen.

There they attempted to arrest the Governor to stand trial for his treason, but unexpectedly Marcross turned against his companions. He had not told his friends before that Choard was actually his uncle. The stormtrooper handed over his weapon to the Governor, but the older man turned it against Marcross and revealed that he indeed had been planning to separate Shelsha sector from the Empire. Marcross had been suspicious of his uncle, but wanted to see the truth with his own eyes\u2014the weapon he had given to the Governor had only one shot left, which wasn't enough to do serious damage.

The arrival of the Dark Lord of the Sith and his private troops made LaRone uneasy, as he feared that their desertion would be revealed and they would be killed.

They traveled from one planet to another and continued to perform similar missions where they saw a need. However, playing heroes took its toll on the equipment and money the ISB had stored on board their ship, and after those two months the group had to start considering retirement. When they had taken out yet another mercenary hideout, they had to admit they could not keep up with it for long anymore. They considered the matter and concluded that they still had enough equipment to survive a couple more missions. They were particularly interested in stolen elections on the planet named Elegasso.

A group of Pineath accused Troukree weaponsmiths of selling poor quality items and the encounter threatened to turn violent. LaRone and his companions interfered and were able to sort things out without bloodshed. After things calmed down, the leader of the Troukree, Vaantaar, told the Hand of Judgment about a warlord called Nuso Esva. The warlord's expected attack on their homeworld had forced the Troukree to seek sanctuary in the Poln system.

Because the Hand of Judgment and their allies had expected the attack to come from that direction, they had set up their defenses accordingly and effectively. Because Grave was still in the bacta tank the attackers didn't consider him to be a threat and he took out a large number of enemies before they even noticed that he was there. When Nuso Esva's people figured out that they could not break their defense, they decided to blow up the entire tapcafe on top of the defenders. Their Troukree allies\u2014who had some back up waiting outside the tapcafe\u2014prevented the plan. They also turned off the jamming device their enemies had set up to disrupt the communications of the defenders. When LaRone and Marcross climbed up through the remains of the supply lift, they were surprised to find out that the Troukree had the situation under control. However, this revelation got them suspecting that their allies might not be the simple refugees they pretended to be."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Vaantaar joined them and his Troukree compatriots, the alien made it very clear that he wanted the Hand of Judgment to follow him. He also revealed that he knew who they were, and used that information to force LaRone and his friends to come with him to meet the mysterious master of the Troukree. When LaRone said that they might not be willing to go with Vaantaar's people, the Troukree made it clear they had no choice\u2014he was ready to use violence if necessary, but would prefer that the stormtroopers came willingly. After making sure that the Governor was safe, LaRone and his friends had no other option but to follow Vaantaar's group to the spaceport and board a vessel of unknown type.

LaRone, who had learned that they were on board the Star Destroyer Admonitor and who had studied the ship's reports of the battle of the Poln system, had figured out that the master was Senior Captain Thrawn, and he was not surprised to meet the only alien who had gained a high commanding rank in the Empire. However the plan the Senior Captain had for them was more of a surprise to all members of the Hand of Judgment. Thrawn was well aware how LaRone and his companions had become military deserters and wanted to make sure that the ISB, or anyone else who might want to punish them for that, would not know where they had gone. Instead of wanting to have them join his regular stormtrooper units, Thrawn wanted them to train a new generation of stormtroopers for his shadow empire. Among these new stormtroopers Thrawn employed aliens like Vaantaar and his Troukree, who were first in line to volunteer for training, and others who had allied themselves with the Senior Captain. When they learned about the threats lurking in the Unknown Regions\u2014according to Thrawn some of these were even worse than Nuso Esva, who they had just tangled with\u2014the Hand of Judgment soon decided to accept the invitation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having considered the matter, Grave suggested they should name their new unit as the 501st Legion, because they had always been considered to be the best.

When they all had agreed that they would accept the job Thrawn had offered, only Brightwater did not seem to be overjoyed by it. To explain his sour mood, he told the others that when he had lent his utility belt to Skywalker, the \"lucky coin\" he had acquired had been among the things. While he agreed that their new job was important, he wished that they had met with Skywalker again before leaving, so he could have gotten his druggat back. The mysterious vanishing act the Hand of Judgment had pulled on Poln Major had its effect on Jade as well. While she found herself missing the stormtroopers, her sense of duty as an Imperial agent overrode her sentimental feelings.

His decision not to shoot gave him a moral high ground\u2014at least compared to Marcross, who privately admitted to having shot civilians\u2014among his companions and his natural leadership abilities made him the spokesperson of choice for their team.

When things were calm and they had time to consider things, LaRone listened to any worries and objections others had and gave them fair consideration. While he found Thrawn's initial offer to be flattering, he knew that the entire Hand of Judgment had seen their fair share of front line duty and had become tired of fighting, and was prepared to turn down the job.

The stormtrooper team also earned their own entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, as did each individual member of the team.

This later happened in the novel Choices of One, published in 2011. The final conversation between the members of the Hand of Judgment was intended to show a connection between the team and later members of 501st, who appeared in Zahn's novel Survivor's Quest.
