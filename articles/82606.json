Instead of turning her over for prosecution, they offered her a chance to work for them, in a sort of indentured servitude. Naescorcom had been having problems with slicers, so wanted a skilled one on their side. As part of her work, Loa helped set up the security measures in the computer systems of Ipsus. She was not happy about the situation, and left backdoors in the systems she worked on so that she could gain her revenge later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
