For the Jedi, the festival entailed decorating the temple with carved pumpkins and cobwebs. For the Ewoks of Endor, the festival was an annual highlight characterized by revelry, costuming, laughter, and a large feast. During the Halloween of 3 ABY, a predatory creature known as a hanadak attacked Bright Tree Village but was coaxed into leaving when Wicket W. Warrick and other Ewoks placed pacifying blue dlock leaves upon it. Later during that same Halloween, a band of Duloks kidnapped the Ewoks' leader, Chief Chirpa, but Warrick and his friends Teebo and Kneesaa rescued the chief and allowed the Halloween festivities to continue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Halloween, also spelled Hallowe'en, was an annual festival celebrated by the citizens of the planet Coruscant and the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village on the Forest Moon of Endor. During the festival, revelers dressed in costumes. For instance, Ewoks dressed as ghosts or other creatures, such as hanadaks. The Ewoks also held a party with a large feast, rollicked through the forest, and scared one another. Halloween decorations included orange gourds with faces or other symbols carved into them, and cobwebs. The Ewoks considered Halloween to be one of the best events of the year."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Jedi Temple on Coruscant celebrated Halloween at least once. For the festival, carved pumpkins and cobwebs decked the halls. Some pumpkins featured the likenesses of Separatist leader Count Dooku; his enforcer, General Grievous; and his apprentice, Asajj Ventress; others featured the insignia of the Jedi Order. Another decoration featured a B1-Series battle droid propped up and dressed like a scarecrow. Meanwhile, clone troopers and Jedi Knights wandered about in masks and costumes. Among the masks available to visitors were Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Grievous, a Gungan, a Hutt, a golden protocol droid, a blue Ortolan, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and Jedi Master Yoda. Clone troopers wandered about in shiny, gold armor or were decorated like skeletons that wielded scythes. Jedi Knights dressed in pirate gear. A purple-furred wampa, a pink Tusken Raider, and a green Zillo Beast costume were also available. Even droids dressed up; protocol droids wore masks and fake arms to appear like General Grievous, and astromech droids wore sheets over their domes to appear like ghosts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the Halloween of 3 ABY on the Forest Moon of Endor, the Ewoks Kneesaa, Teebo, and Wicket W. Warrick noticed what appeared to be a hanadak, a savage predator, in their village. At first they dismissed it as another Ewok in costume, but, upon closer inspection, they found that it was the genuine article. Warrick led a group of Ewoks to drive the creature from the village, but the hanadak repelled their assault. Warrick then led the Ewoks in covering the hanadak in the leaves of the blue dlock, a pleasant-smelling plant. The leaves soothed the beast, which retreated back into the forest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During that same year's Halloween, a group of Duloks took advantage of the Ewoks' preoccupation with their Halloween party to raid the village's storehouse. There, they accidentally stole away with not only foodstuffs but also Chief Chirpa, leader of the Ewok village. Kneesaa, Teebo, and Warrick discovered that Chirpa was missing and followed the Duloks' tracks into the woods. Warrick sneaked up behind the Ewok leader, cut him free of his bonds, and allowed the chief to fight off the Dulok brigands. The Ewoks returned to their village, and the Halloween festivities continued."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The holiday of Halloween\u2014spelled Hallowe'en\u2014originally appeared in the story Chief Chirpa Kidnapped!, published in 1988 as part of the Ewoks Annual from Marvel Comics.

The Jedi Temple in which much of the game takes place was decorated, and players had the opportunity to purchase masks of Star Wars characters and species, costumes, Halloween decorations, and two Halloween-themed droids, K-3RNL and J-4CK.

In the book, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader takes his son, Luke Skywalker, trick-or-treating to the home of Rebel Alliance leaders Mon Mothma and Crix Madine. The book's setting is nebulous, as scenes such as this one seem to take place in the real-world as opposed to the Star Wars universe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
