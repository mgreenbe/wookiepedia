It was apparently carnivorous and would eat anything that wandered into its territory. Zombas appeared to run and chase prey using only their hind legs. Their front legs would then be extended in front of them as they tried to grasp their fleeing target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ewok Teebo crafted a zomba costume for use in his first Shadow Night Festival. The costume was so authentic that he was able to trick his friends Wicket Wystri Warrick and Latara into believing that he was a real zomba, chasing them through the forest for a time. Teebo would use the costume once more to sneak into the Raich's cave during the temporary return of the Raich."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
