At one point, a band of rebels from Lothal traveled to Osisis Station to obtain parts for their freighter, the Ghost, which had been damaged after raiding an Imperial supply yard. To obtain these parts, Hera Syndulla had to race the damaged Ghost against Vez's Splendour through a race course known as Fool's Run. Vez attempted to cheat out Syndulla by using asteroid thrusters to damage the Ghost. When Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger saw this, they used the Force to drive an asteroid into the Splendour to even the race, allowing Syndulla to win. Angry at not getting his way, Ves attempted to cheat the rebels out of their parts, and instead tried to capture them so he could hand them over to the Empire. The rebels quickly gained control of the station and left without their parts. Vez made sure to erase all footage of their presence, but he was unaware of the fact that Sabine Wren had painted the starbird insignia on the underside of the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Osisis Station first appeared in \"Ring Race,\" a 2015 comic strip written by Martin Fisher and drawn by Bob Molesworth.
