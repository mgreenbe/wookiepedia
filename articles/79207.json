It utilized a concussive energy charge that imploded on impact and created a 5 meter radius area of effect. Then the gun sent out a burst of energy. This often killed its target. The weapon was sometimes equipped with an EMP bayonet, which was effective at stunning and disabling droids, or electrocuting an enemy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rifle was often used by commandos in the Grand Army of the Republic, but lower quality copies were manufactured and employed by Trandoshan forces.
