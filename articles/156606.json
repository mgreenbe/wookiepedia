When the Jedi enclave of planet Ossus and its Great Jedi Library were brought to the ground by the Brotherhood of the Sith, that Jedi Master and three other colleagues were tasked with the construction of new headquarters for the Order. Together, the Four Masters established a new Jedi Temple on the site of the Sacred Spire, a natural peak located on the galactic capital of Coruscant, where earlier generations of Jedi had already erected small meditative chapels. The humanoid Master and his fellow founders were remembered through a series of four engraved pylons that ornated the formal entrance to their Temple. Those statues, however, were either toppled or destroyed at the end of the Clone Wars during \"Operation: Knightfall,\" when the Sith Lord Darth Vader stormed the Temple with a detachment of the 501st Legion's clone troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If their engraved effigy integrated into the Temple's fa\u00e7ade was accurate, the Jedi Master belonged to species of bulky, bald sentients with tapered ears.

However, that individual shared his pointed ears and bald head with the inhabitants of the Red Nebula shown in Star Wars 50, the fiftieth issue in the Marvel Star Wars series of comics.
