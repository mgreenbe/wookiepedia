Boba Fett already having killed the other courier, this bounty hunter hoped to collect the bounty on Mari's head. The hunter assaulted Mari and a group of spacers, who were assisting her, in the docking bay where the spacers' ship was parked. The hunter sneaked up on the spacers and tried to knock one of them unconscious, but failed and was eventually defeated. It remained unknown whether the hunter's heavy blaster pistol saw any use in this fight, and the exact fate of the hunter was also uncertain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This character appears in Rebel Escape as a villain NPC, and serves as one of the obstacles that the player characters have to overcome to complete the scenario.
