Because the planet dried up, it was abandoned. Betha II was resettled by smugglers millennia later, about 20 BBY. Since its surface was often swept dry by dust storms or sandstorms, the caves and canyons of the planet were expanded and connected with tunnels for subterranean habitation by the smugglers.
