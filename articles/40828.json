Written by John Williams and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, the leitmotif is played several times in The Empire Strikes Back. It is playedwhen Han Solo speaks to the droids at Echo Base, then again during the Battle of Hoth, when R2-D2 enters the X-Wing. It was played dramatically when Artoo was in the swamps of Dagobah and during the climactic \"Hyperspace\" cue. The melody re-appeared briefly in \"Battle of Endor I\" on the soundtrack to Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the 1998 video game Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, composed by Chris H\u00fclsbeck, the motif is played in the track \"Barkesh cargo delivery.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The leitmotif again sounds in the Star Wars Rebels episode \"Droids in Distress,\" accompanying scenes with C-3PO and R2-D2. In the next episode, \"Fighter Flight,\" the motif is used again when Garazeb Orrelios and Ezra Bridger sneak around an Imperial Troop Transport in trying to steal a crate of meiloorun fruit. As Zeb teases the aspiring Jedi on whether he could use the Force, the motif sounds. The descending notes are then played inverse when Bridger reaches out into the Force to take the crate, rising up and transitioning into the first notes of \"The Force Theme,\" which is played with a two low, augmentated notes as Bridger struggles using telekinesis. It ends as the Jedi-in-training fails as a result of a stormtrooper interfering with the meiloorun fruit crate, and another playful yet suspensful music piece sounds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Composer John Powell used the motif for Solo: A Star Wars Story, playing it as an ostinato as 11-3K viper probe droids are deployed on-screen. In The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special, scored by Michael Kramer, the droids motif is played when Finn trains with a Marksman-H training remote, as well as during the scene on Dagobah, when Rey Skywalker finds Yoda training Luke Skywalker with R2-D2."}]}
