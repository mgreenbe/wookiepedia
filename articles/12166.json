Located in the Balmorra system in the Colonies, the station served as a way-station for Republic ships during the Republic's attempt to reclaim the planet. As the world was under Imperial control during the early days of the war, Republic ships docked at the station and their passengers were forced to take shuttles to the Balmorran resistance's base at Farnel Outpost in Bugtown, a former genetic research facility that had become overrun by the insectoid Colicoids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Balmorra Orbital Station was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011.
