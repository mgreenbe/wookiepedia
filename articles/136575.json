The Essential Atlas, released in 2009, included Sinton on a map entitled \"Imperial Atrocities\" in a section of the book discussing the Galactic Empire's early military conquests, suggesting that the subjugation took place early in the Imperial Period. However, the map includes events from a wide range of years, leaving the Subjugation of Sinton's chronological placement largely ambiguous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
