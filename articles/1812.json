He was based at the Almas Academy, a Jedi academy that was situated in the city Forard on the planet Almas. In about 31 BBY, he was sent out into the city by the Jedi Master Seenlu Kir to locate some freelance agents with whom the Jedi wished to speak. 7-A39 located the agents and escorted them back to the academy, and Kir hired the operatives to help search for some missing Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 19 BBY, the Almas Academy was destroyed during an assault led by the Dark Jedi Garth Ezzar. 7-A39 suffered some damage as a result of the attack, and he lost both of his legs and lay abandoned within the academy's ruins. Around 17 BBY, a group of Ugor scavengers discovered the remains of the droid inside the academy, and they dragged 7-A39 out to the building's entrance. However, after the Ugors briefly left the droid unguarded, a crew of rival Squib salvagers claimed the droid for themselves. The Ugors and Squibs subsequently became involved in an argument regarding the rightful ownership of the droid; the Ugors deemed the protocol droid a holy artifact and alleged that they were entitled to him under Ugorian Divine Law, while the Squibs contended that 7-A39 was rightfully theirs under High Squibbian Law, because the Ugors had left the droid undefended. The Ugor SplrMuck and the Squib Jiminaldo-mabbramsti also engaged in a tug-of-war, pulling on the droid from either side in attempt to take it for themselves, much to 7-A39's dismay. A group of Alderaanian Resistance agents, who had traveled to Almas to search for a Jedi holocron, passed by the scene of the quarrel, and the Ugors called upon the agents to resolve the dispute."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The resistance agents negotiated with SplrMuck and the Squibs to purchase the droid, and the Ugors agreed to relinquish their claim to the droid in return for 2,000, while the Squibs were content to swap the droid for the agents' breath masks. Carried by the agents in a net, 7-A39 acted as a guide for the Alderaanian Resistance team while they explored the academy ruins. Shortly afterward, the agents discovered a fragment of a Sith tome in the facility's archive room, and 7-A39 translated the text for them. However, the droid's recital of the document triggered a groundquake that caused the room to shudder. The agents also visited the academy's control room, and there, 7-A39 accessed a computer and obtained a map of the academy's sub-levels for his new masters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A hapless, bipedal protocol droid, 7-A39 was fitted with silver-colored copper plating, which became tarnished when he was damaged following the attack on the Almas Academy.
