Their bulky bodies were covered with coral-shaped growths, and the hue of their scales shifted through shades of orange and purple. They had several barbels hanging from the lower jaw and six bulging eyes. These creatures had lengthy lower fangs that did not fit in their mouths, but rather projected back close to the eyes, while the upper teeth were somewhat shorter. A long, leg-like fin protruded from the back of their body."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, the Gungan Jar Jar Binks offered to take the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to his species' capital city of Otoh Gunga, located deep within Lake Paonga.

When Binks dove into the murky water of Lake Paonga, he scared away various aquatic creatures, including one of the six-eyed species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This species was designed by Boris Vallejo for the young readers novel Dangers of the Core, published in May 2000.
