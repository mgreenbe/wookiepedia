Although one model of the B2-series was only equipped with wrist blasters on their right forearm, another was outfitted with wrist blasters on both forearms. Super battle droids were much stronger than their predecessors, and like the updated B1s used by the Confederacy, they did not require a command system to operate, which gave the droids limited independence. Another improvement was their thick armor casing, which contained their fragile sensors. However, B2s were designed with simple processors, limiting their ability to formulate strategies. As a result, they relied on organic commanders or tactical droids in order to effectively operate. The B2 was much stronger than the B1s, with enough strength to lift a clone trooper off the ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having been developed before the onslaught of the Clone Wars, the first batch of B2 super battle droids was put into operation on Geonosis, during the battle that started the conflict. The droids could take more hits and could stand up better to their enemies than the B1-series battle droid could, and it saw greater production after the Battle of Geonosis. However, the super battle droid cost more than the B1, and their higher cost made it so that there were often one hundred B1 battle droids for every B2 on a battlefield."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, B2 super battle droids and other droid units were being constructed on Geonosis, which the Separatists had taken back from the Republic, in the largest droid foundry ever constructed. To reconquer the planet and shut down Poggle the Lesser's factories, the Republic launched an invasion, and, during their push to reach Point Rain, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his 501st Legion confronted the super droids and B1 battle droids stationed at the eastern barrier. Once Skywalker and his Padawan, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, made their way to the top of the wall, Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" ordered that blaster fire be focused on the droids. Ultimately, Skywalker and Tano, who were joined by Rex once he reached the top, successfully took down a pair of droidekas and the barrier. After Republic forces were reinforced by the 41st Elite Corps, they made an attack on Poggle's primary droid factory and fought its B1, B2, and Geonosian defenders. However, the entire attack was a distraction to allow Jedi Commanders Tano and Barriss Offee to enter and destroy the factory. Using a Separatist super tank, the two Padawans successfully destroyed the foundry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The B2 super battle droids continued to see action until the end of the Clone Wars, with a number of units serving aboard Grievous' flagship Invisible Hand during the Battle of Coruscant.

However, as the droids were considerably outdated, Gorr recruited the aid of the Colossus resident, Neeku Vozo to aid him in upgrading the droids to a more efficient state. Vozo upgraded the droids, but was wary of Kragen's intentions and reprogramed a single B1 battle droid to become the designated commander of the B2s and use him to take control of the B2s."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable individuals"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One super battle droid was G21, who served as part of the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars and gave a report to a superior that the planet it was stationed on was secured for the Confederacy and the population was under control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Specialized B2-series super battle droids"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "B2 super battle droids first appeared in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.
