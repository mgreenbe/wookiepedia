IG-88B had 100 of these droids produced on Mechis III. They were used to attack and destroy an Imperial shuttle carrying a computer core destined for the Death Star II, and then escorted a decoy core containing IG-88A's consciousness to the Death Star, where they were put on construction duty by an unsuspecting Moff Jerjerrod. The droids were designed to self-destruct if their true nature was discovered; when a crane accident damaged one of the droids, the resulting explosion wiped out the entire work crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
