In 3 ABY, a trio of the brown-furred individuals known as the Kagles served the fruit along with fried mahuga and tobo leaves to the Ewok Teebo while on the Forest Moon of Endor.

The episode was written by Bob Carrau and premiered on September 20, 1986. In the episode, after Teebo tells Wicket of three foods that the Kagles fed him, he holds up a small, orange sphere, indicating that that was all he had left from dinner. As the episode does not establish which of the foods the sphere is, this article refrains from linking it with jing-jang berries or any of the other foods he mentioned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
