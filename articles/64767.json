One of the planet's smaller predators, it inhabited one of the upper levels of the Kashyyyk ecosystem, right beneath the tree-top level. It was a small, lean, and streamlined creature, adapted to stealthy and swift climbing through the trees. It fed primarily by scavenging prey that had fallen from the uppermost wroshyr tree branches; these animals rarely survived such a fall, and the furtive ikov was almost always the first to find them. The inner surfaces of its finely-serrated, blade-like teeth were reflective and iridescent, a trait uncommon among predators; these sharp teeth allowed the ikov to quickly cut a piece of meat and run if chased from its finds by larger predators, which it was too small to fend off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wilek Nereus possessed three specimens of this animal in his tooth collection, two of which, likely immature specimens, he had surprised in a fur-lined tree hollow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
