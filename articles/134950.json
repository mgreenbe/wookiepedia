A colonel, Starck served in the Blizzard Force attack group under General Maximilian Veers, commanding the AT-AT walker Blizzard 4 and its group during the Battle of Hoth. In the prelude to the engagement, Starck attempted to impress the Sith Lord Darth Vader by taking Blizzard 4 and the accompanying walkers on a direct yet treacherous route through Hoth's Kerane Valley, which resulted in the loss of three walkers to shifting ice flows. Starck survived and regrouped with the rest of Blizzard Force.

Starck commanded the AT-AT designated Blizzard 4, along with its accompanying group of walkers. When in battle, Blizzard 4 was charged with conquering terrain not covered by the primary assault and deploying soldiers to secure the area. The Empire had recently discovered the presence of a Rebel Alliance base on the frozen world of Hoth, but the presence of a strong deflector shield negated the effect of any orbital bombardment. Blizzard Force was deployed to Hoth's surface, tasked with destroying the Rebels' shield generator and any resistance they met."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The dropships transporting Blizzard Force landed in the Moorsh Moraine located to the north of the Rebel base. The assault force emerged from the moraine into the Kerane Valley; while the other groups took a safe yet indirect westerly pathway through the valley, Starck opted for a direct route in an effort to impress the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader. The move proved disastrous, as Starck lost three of the group's walkers to ice flows. Blizzard 4's group reunited with the main attack force on the North Ridge. From the top of the ridge they commenced their attack on the Rebel base. In the midst of the battle, Blizzard 4 crushed Rebel Commander Luke Skywalker's disabled snowspeeder after it had crashed in front of the walker. Skywalker used a harpoon gun to ascended to the underside of the AT-AT, cut open a small hatch with his lightsaber, and threw a grenade into the compartment before falling to the snow below. Blizzard 4 proceeded forward, but its advance was cut short when the grenade detonated a short amount of time later. The walker's head exploded, killing Starck. What remained of the walker collapsed to the ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After landing on Hoth, Starck attempted to impress the Sith Lord Darth Vader by taking his AT-AT group on a treacherous route through the Kerane Valley.
