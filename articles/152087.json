When the subtram which carried her arrived, only one bounty hunter was apparently left guarding her, former Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress. Ventress then told Blank that she would give him the cargo containing Pluma only after he had paid up. Moments later, this guard approached Ventress, giving her the credits and receiving the chest from her. After this guard partially opened the chest, the bounty hunter Boba Fett kicked the lid up as far as it would go, revealing himself to have been locked in the chest, much to the surprise of the guards as well as the disgust of Otua Blank."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
