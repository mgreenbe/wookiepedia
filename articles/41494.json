The spacer was sent to Dunir by Niko Brehe in an effort to help pay off their debt to Jabba, and so Dunir tasked the spacer with delivering a package to Toggi Bok, who had a camp just outside of Mos Eisley. Once the spacer had completed this task, Dunir sent them to the nearby White Thranta Shipping Company offices just outside Mos Eisley to retrieve a package that belonged to Jabba. The spacer spoke with the receptionist, requesting the package, which the receptionist quickly found and delivered to the spacer. The spacer returned the package to Dunir, who then sent them off to Reimos Taligg to continue squaring away their debts with Jabba."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dunir Signos appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
