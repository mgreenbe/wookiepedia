As a result, it developed many unusual features and displayed features of both a Z-95 Headhunter and an ARC-170. Shortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire, Seejo and a group of Incom and Subpro used the Good Feeling at the Imperial Testing Grounds on the Outer Moon of Prakith where they were developing a new starship design. The Feeling was attacked by mynocks, leaving it stranded on the Inner Moon of Prakith. However, a group of Alderaanian Resistance agents came to the rescue and saved the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, the ship was again attacked by mynocks.
