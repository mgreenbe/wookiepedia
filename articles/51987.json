By 32 BBY they had posted a bounty on the Gamorrean Jabrogg Thung, a nerf thrower who had fatally injured several nerfs during his nerf-throwing career. The society offered a reward of 2000 credits for the capture of Thung alive and only 1000 credits if he was brought in dead. The bounty was claimed by the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, who captured Thung alive on the Outland Transit Station in the Baxel sector, whilst he was there hunting the Muttani criminal Meeko Ghintee. It was the station's Toydarian owner, Rozatta, who informed Fett of the society's bounty posting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Humane Society were first mentioned in the game, Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, released by LucasArts in 2002.
