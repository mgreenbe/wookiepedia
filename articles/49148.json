The department was represented by the Admiral of the Fleet, Admiral Gial Ackbar, but if he was unavailable a staff officer attended in his stead. The staff officer had no authority over the Fleet itself, but was well-informed about the status and disposition of the Fleet, and conversant with Ackbar's plans and objectives, allowing them to keep the other departments informed of Fleet's status. Beneath Command were four main branches; the Line Admirals, Starfighter Command, Fleet Intelligence, and Ordnance and Support."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
