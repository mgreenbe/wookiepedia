The droid was ordered to move the cruisers into attack position. The Jedi was, however, able to escape with the help of Republic reinforcements and not only that, they added insult and injury by causing the cruisers to collide. The droid then awkwardly reported \"Uhhh, they got away, sir\" to Grievous, who responded by growling at the droid and smacking his head off to vent his feelings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This B1-Series battle droid is at the left of General Grievous, but earlier in the scene that place was taken by an OOM pilot battle droid.
