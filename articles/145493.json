During the battle, Cade Skywalker struck down Darth Krayt and the Sith lost much of their military power. The Sith forces retreated, leaving the allies victorious and the Jedi free to rebuild their order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Casualties"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The third Jedi Purge first appeared in the first issue of the Star Wars: Legacy comic series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
