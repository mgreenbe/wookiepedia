Over the course of several campaigns, Stele fought against the forces of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, as well as those of the treacherous Imperial Admirals Harkov and Demetrius Zaarin.

It was only after meeting Baron Soontir Fel that Stele felt renewed allegiance to the Empire and joined Fel in the 181st Imperial Fighter Group. Stele continued to serve the Imperial Remnant as a pilot into the Yuuzhan Vong War.

He became involved with illegal swoop gangs, quickly becoming an accomplished swoop bike pilot. Under an alias, he began participating in competitions for money, undertaking dangerous stunts among the ruined high-rise buildings on his homeworld. During one of these competitions, circa 3 ABY, Stele executed a near-perfect stunt, but returned to the staging area to discover the swoop ring was being raided by the authorities.

The two arranged to meet at the Maze to investigate, but Stele first left to visit his mother in her hideout in the old city. Marina informed Maarek that he had been shown on footage of the raid and, furthermore, that he had been identified by his real name. She was concerned that this might lead the Bordali to them and that they might need to relocate to another place to hide.

After some time he was debriefed by an Imperial officer. His initial debriefing revealed Stele's experience as both a swoop pilot and mechanic along with his father's teachings on astrophysics, skills which caused him to be identified as potentially useful to the Empire. The next day he was one of almost two hundred Kuani and Bordali prisoners selected to be invited to serve the Empire. In a small amphitheater on the Vengeance, Admiral Mordon, the officer tasked with subjugating the Taroon system, explained the \"offer\" to the recruits, and displayed a standard holographic message from Emperor Palpatine. Stele was drawn in by the Emperor's image and chose to serve the Empire with all his being."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of those who attended Mordon's speech returned to their homeworlds to help in the transition of power and, in the case of Marina, to look for her husband. Maarek, however, decided to serve the Imperial Military, a decision which was influenced not only by his belief in the Empire but also by his desire to find his father who he felt was no longer in Taroon.

With the Star Destroyer unable to intercept in time, Stele was instructed to assist. When he reached it he saw the debris of the shuttle's escorts and two Y-wings shooting at the shuttle.

This process would continue as Stele received an orientation in the Imperial military and basic training under Senior Master Sergeant Jona T. Stark. Over the next two months he was instructed in military procedure, put through physical training, and tested. Eventually his basic training was complete, and he was then relocated back to the Vengeance for flight training.

The admiral gave Stele a password to use with his aides whenever he wanted to speak to him, \"There's a fog over Celadon City.\" The pair talked often in the admiral's private garden aboard the Star Destroyer, discussing history, combat techniques and the current galactic political situation. Mordon passed on some of his experiences with dogfighting, piloting and command, which Stele summarized into twenty-three rules labeled \"Some General Combat Tactics\". It was Mordon who first prompted Stele to seek out the Secret Order of the Emperor to gain advancement opportunities. He also confided in Stele his concern over disloyalty amongst some senior fleet officers and suggested that the Empire's downfall might not be due to the Rebel Alliance, but from its internecine struggles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his training Stele received his first assignment, a brief stint aboard a corvette patrolling space for smugglers. Here he got his first taste of combat duty when a freighter running weapons for the Alliance was detected. When engaged, a squadron of Alliance shuttles arrived, but was routed by the Imperial patrol, and Stele destroyed three Rebel shuttles during the skirmish with the help of his wingman. During the mission Stele witnessed the death of one of the other TIE pilots as his TIE Fighter collided with a shuttle and was destroyed\u2014the shuttle took only minimal damage. The incident highlighted to Stele that the only way to survive as a TIE pilot was to fly the better craft, an opportunity usually available only to the elite pilots; Stele resolved to be counted among this group. That same night Stele had a strange vision of the Emperor in which Palpatine said, \"You have been called upon to join us, for the good of all beings\u2026You are mine.\" He would have several more similar visions over the coming months."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the end of his training, Stele was devastated to learn that Admiral Mordon had died of \"natural causes.\" Mordon was quickly replaced by (Acting) Admiral Coross, and several crew members were interrogated by investigators, a process they were told was \"standard procedure.\" Stele was questioned about his relationship with Mordon, and offered all he knew. Unsatisfied after several hours of questioning, the investigators forced him to drink a mysterious liquid that made him forget the subsequent interrogation. Days later he received a message, supposedly from his mother, but a reference to Celadon City made him realize that something was amiss. Trying the password Mordon had given him, Stele decrypted the message to find a hidden message recorded by Mordon before his death. The admiral informed Stele that he believed he had been close to discovering the identity of the traitors within the Empire and that, fearing for Stele's safety, he had ordered the pilot to be transferred to a remote Imperial post in the event that anything happened to Mordon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battles of the Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Yavin, and his recruitment into the Galactic Empire, Maarek Stele partook in a skirmish against at least one Rebel pilot.

Stele's kills included the two massive freighters Gallon and Romold, the Alliance operative-carrying Dawn and a number of escorting Y-wings. Upon Fogger's return to D-34, it was discovered that the Alliance had seized control of the station.
