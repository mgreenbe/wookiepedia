Boost, like all clone troopers, was one of the many clones of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett and born on the Wild Space planet of Kamino. In the beginning of the war, Boost fought in the first battle of the war on the planet Geonosis. During the battle, Boost received scars after he fought battle droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the Jedi High Council dispatched General Plo Koon to search for the Separatist \"mystery weapon,\" which had destroyed several Republic fleets. Onboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer, Triumphant, Koon was accompanied by Boost and a group of clone troopers\u2014a few of which were: Commander CC-3636, nicknamed \"Wolffe\", and Sergeant Sinker. Upon discovering the Malevolence in the Abregado system, the warship fired its ion cannons on Koon's Venator-class Star Destroyer, which rendered the ship without power and defenseless. The many turbolasers of the Subjugator-class cruiser began to fire, quickly destroying the three ships. Koon told Boost, Wolffe and Sinker to evacuate the Triumphant in an escape pod, before it was destroyed by the Malevolence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the pod, Wolffe told them that they had suffered a total system blackout, and only the life support was working. Boost hoped that someone would search for them, but Sinker did not share Boost's positive thinking. Afterwards, Koon advised them to conserve energy and while doing this, Sinker commented negatively about Boost's hygiene. Sinker also said that it would not be strategical to search for them, and that he would have instead searched for the superweapon, but Koon answered that their lives were more important to him. Shortly after, Boost discovered another escape pod, but those inside were all dead and the pod was crushed. Shortly after, they picked up another signal from a pod. However, before reaching it, it was destroyed by a Droch-class boarding ship and its group of rocket battle droids, who then quickly turned their attention to Koon's pod. While Wolffe remained in the pod in order to keep their signal active, Koon, Sinker and Boost exited the pod to fight the droids. During the fight, Wolffe contacted Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who were already searching for survivors of the battle. Meanwhile, Plo Koon used the Force to throw Sinker behind the droids and he was able to destroy them. Shortly after, Plo Koon contacted Tano using the Force, showing her their location. Eventually, they were found by the Twilight, Skywalker's personal freighter, which recovered the escape pod and, once onboard, the clones were treated by a medical droid. Shortly after, the Malevolence discovered the Twilight. Despite their attempts to shut down all the ships energy, they had forgotten the medical droid. Still, the Twilight managed to escape the system before it could be disabled by the ion cannons of the Malevolence."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Khorm"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boost, Sinker and Wolffe were members of a Republic force dispatched to the Separatist-occupied planet Khorm in order to secure the Agrocite, an ore used to increase power to starfighters.

Later, while Plo Koon and Kit Fisto went ahead to scout out the main Confederate base located in an Agrocite mine, Major Ozzel led his troops to recapture the processing facility. The facility, however, had been abandoned, and Ozzel\u2014certain that the Republic had crushed the enemy\u2014ordered to initiate an assault on the Agrocite mine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In contrast to Ozzel, Boost and Sinker thought that the Confederacy had moved its troops for a reason and was preparing to make a final stand at the mine. The two expressed their opinion to Wolffe, but he replied that they had their orders and told Boost to load the Republic walkers into landing ships. Just as Boost and Sinker thought, the Republic forces faced heavy opposition from the Separatists, but eventually managed to win the battle."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Felucia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boost also served alongside the Wolfpack when they were trying to recapture Felucia from General Grievous.
