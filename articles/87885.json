However, he was once the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious, and therefore, a Dark Lord of the Sith. Having trained in the ways of the Force, Maul was a formidable warrior strong with the dark side and deadly skilled in lightsaber combat.

Sensing his potential, Sidious took Maul as an apprentice while he was still a child. Anointed by his Sith Master as Darth Maul, the Dathomirian was raised to hate the Jedi Knights that served the light side of the Force. Desiring to see the Jedi Order fall, Darth Maul trained for the day when the Sith would exact revenge on their ancient foes. The time for revealing the Sith's continued existence to the Jedi came during the Invasion of Naboo, when Darth Maul confronted Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. Though he killed Jinn, Maul was, in turn, defeated by Kenobi, who bisected the Sith assassin at the waist. Darth Maul was believed to be dead in the aftermath of the battle, but Maul ultimately survived, emerging a decade after his defeat, during the height of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite learning that his Master took a new apprentice, Darth Tyranus, Maul still believed that he was a Sith Lord. Taking his brother as an apprentice, Maul and Opress held that they were the true Sith rather than Sidious and Tyranus. He then devised a scheme to seize power on the planet Mandalore, overthrowing the New Mandalorians and installing the Death Watch as the new ruling government. In addition to the Mandalorians, Maul expanded his criminal enterprise, the Shadow Collective, to include the Pyke Syndicate, Black Sun, and the Hutt Clan. However, as his power increased, Maul became a threat to his former Master's plan, resulting in a confrontation that concluded with Opress's demise and Maul's capture by Sidious. After escaping with the help of his Mandalorian super commandos, Maul resumed his reign on Mandalore until he was overthrown by the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul survived the end of the Clone Wars, witnessing the Great Jedi Purge of Order 66 and Sidious's rise as Galactic Emperor.

Ultimately though, Maul remained driven by the desire for revenge, specifically against Sidious, the Master who disowned him, and Kenobi, the Jedi who defeated him. During his conflict with the Jedi fugitives Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger, Maul tracked Kenobi to Tatooine, determined to finally end their rivalry for good. Their last lightsaber duel ended when the Jedi Master struck down his old nemesis.

Growing up, he always felt a connection to nature and the forest outside their house, a by-product of his Force-sensitivity. While he was still a child, Mother Talzin became an ally of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith, the two beings exchanging knowledge of Dark Side arcana and Nightsister magicks. When Sidious visited Talzin, Maul always hid in his room, afraid of the man and worried about Talzin's increasing bond with him. Eventually, Sidious ordered Talzin to give up Maul, threatening to not follow through on his promise to make her his apprentice. She reluctantly agreed, and Maul ran into the forest angrily, overhearing the conversation from behind his door.

This eventually started to warp Maul's perceptions, and his love for his mother eventually turned into resentment and hatred for abandoning him. Just as Sidious wished, his hatred started manifesting through the Dark Side, and he would practice using the Dark Side of the Force every chance he got; eventually, the two brothers stopped beating him after seeing that their provocations were no longer affecting him. Eventually, rumors swirled of a man soon arriving for the Selection to acquire a warrior apprentice, and all the Nightbrother boys prepared for it. When the day arrived, Maul's keeper refused to allow him to participate, but he used the Dark Side to break his locked door down and follow anyway. At the Selection Arena, Maul found out that the visitor was Sidious. In a sudden burst of anger, he used the Dark Side of the Force to Force-choke the two brothers, and then the keeper, all in front of Sidious and Talzin. Beyond pleased at Maul's progress and potential, Sidious declared Maul the winner and his new apprentice, to Talzin's dismay. Sidious took Maul and left Dathomir, Talzin swearing to get her stolen son back and have her revenge on Sidious.

During his training, Sidious took Maul to Malachor to bear witness to a great battle that occurred there between the Jedi and the Sith. Maul mastered his anger, letting it burn in him, and under his master's supervision, began to turn his anger into hate. Sidious forced Maul to breathe in the ashes of Sith warriors, slain when an ancient weapon was activated in the Sith temple on the planet. While breathing in this ash, Maul had visions of members of the Sith order being struck down by the Jedi. He felt the slash of saber after saber as he felt the death of his Sith brethren.

It was while hunting rathtars that Maul reflected on their viciousness, ruthlessness, and freedom. The rathtars he hunted had no master, unlike himself.

He was blinded during the fight by the Quarren gangster Dirty Calgriz\u2014whom Maul quickly killed thereafter\u2014and was nearly surrounded when the fight was intercepted by Bane, Sing, and Vorhdeilo. Bane informed Maul that the bounty hunters had gotten hold of an invitation to Xrexus's auction. The bounty hunters had killed the Haddrex Gang and stolen their ship and protocol droid, FE-B3.

While Xrexus greeted her guests, Maul searched the space station and found Kaitis in a holding cell. While searching for Kaitis, Maul was caught sneaking around the station by Xrexus, and Maul provided a fake name, Seris Madreth of the Haddrex Consortium, to trick Xrexus.
