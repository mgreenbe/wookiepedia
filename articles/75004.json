Later, during the Galactic Civil War, Kelada was an important asset for the Galactic Empire due to its production of repulsorcraft and speeder bikes, as well as components for repulsorlifts and walkers. A giant assembly factory operated by Arakyd Industries was especially valued by the Empire. Around 3 ABY, Rebel Alliance operative Vewin was captured by Imperial agents on Kelada. In the months after the Battle of Endor, Imperial engineers transported components from dismantled factories on recently-abandoned worlds to Kelada, where they were used in the construction of several new factories. As a defense against orbital attack, the engineers also set up a v-150 Planet Defender near the planet's main starport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was also an Imperial skunkworks on Kelada, although the top designers at the skunkworks disappeared from the radar, alongside hundreds of schematics for experimental weapons the months prior to the Thrawn campaign.
