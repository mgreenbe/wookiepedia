After completing her mission on Coruscant, Rianna agreed to help the Rebel Alliance to investigate strange activity on Alderaan where a Black Sun vigo hijacked a research vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the help of Zeeo, Rianna infiltrated the ship and sliced the main computer. She then discovered that the vessel was used to test new drugs on scientists. Once there, she was confronted by some IG-series assassin droids, but managed to defeat them with the help of Zeeo. Rianna planted charges in the nearby warehouse and the laboratory and then watched as Slak Sagar, who was in charge of the vessel, interacted with Zarien Kheev, a Zabrak slaver, who once owned Rianna. Kheev ordered Slak to leave no witnesses and Sagar said that he will deliver the last shipment to Mustafar. However, Rianna planted the explosive on the shipment in the docking bay and escaped the vessel. She was then attacked by Sagar, but managed to defeat him. Leia Organa contacted a Twi'lek and informed her that those drugs were used to increase the slave production of mirkanite on Mustafar. Hoping to find Kheev there and finally get her revenge, Rianna asked Leia to send her there instead of Kyle Katarn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
