T-3PO was a harsh droid with feminine programming, and her many years servitude to her masters onboard the Victory-class Star Destroyer made her hate them. Her programming restricted her from expressing this hate towards them. When the Subjugator was attacked by a Alliance to Restore the Republic fleet, T-3PO was assured that she would survive the encounter, because her programming told she was superior to the other droids on the ship. As other droids deserted their posts in sheer confusion, T-3PO realized she had to follow Walex Blissex, and his Rebel Alliance agents accompanying him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
