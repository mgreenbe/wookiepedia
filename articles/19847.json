During the High Republic Era, it was considered a key member of the Galactic Republic, and received a sky-island with a representation of its environment at the Valo Republic Fair. By the time of the Clone Wars, Boz Pity was largely uninhabited, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems established a presence on it during the conflict, enabling them to frequently strike at nearby Republic targets. It was then subject to a siege by Republic forces; after the conclusion of the Siege of Saleucami during the Outer Rim Sieges, Jedi General Quinlan Vos moved his troops to support the siege."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the Ghost, a light freighter used by the Spectres, used a false transponder code that stated the freighter had free passage rights between Lothal and Boz Pity.
