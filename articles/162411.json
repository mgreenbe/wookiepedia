She was programmed to ensure that the princess was always presented in grand style for every occasion. In keeping with this duty, she was an excellent hairstylist, able to do the princess' hair in many elaborate styles. She was also programmed to remove the princess from danger, if necessary. TooVee's programming to ensure that the princess was dressed as formally as possible often clashed with Organa's preference for dressing simply. She had bluish fingers, and a roll ball for movement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, while Organa was away on a mission, TooVee made arrangements for the princess' clothing at the upcoming equinox celebrations, having one of Queen Breha's old dresses altered and decorated for the princess.
