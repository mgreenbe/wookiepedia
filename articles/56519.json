Hoping to circumvent the danger, Makeb's mining corporations constructed the gravity hooks: Orbital stations connected to the surface by tremendously long turbolift shafts and repulsorlifts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the project succeeded in creating a safe alternative for moving cargo on- and offworld, the gravity hooks' low transit speed, meager carrying capacity and high energy costs limited their use to industrial purposes. Many of the gravity hooks fell into disuse as starship modifications that reduce the danger of atmospheric flight became more widely available."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
