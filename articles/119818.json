The sandcrawler visited Tosche Station, near Anchorhead, to have business with the warehouse manager Janus. It then visited Zef Ando at the Lars homestead. After leaving the farm, Sand Crawler 345 was attacked by Tusken Raiders in the Western Dune Sea and destroyed. Some Jawas and the protocol droid FA-2PO managed to escape and took refuge nearby. As the cargo from Tansarii Point Station interested both Imperial Commander Barrezz and Rebel Captain Bastra, spacers were looking for the sandcrawler when it was attacked. The spacers received FA-2PO's emergency call and headed to the survivors of Sand Crawler 345. The spacers attacked the Tusken Raiders and rescued the Jawas. The spacers later recovered Jawa encryption keys from the Tusken Raiders and finally accessed to the sandcrawler database."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sand Crawler 345 appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
