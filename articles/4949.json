Even in the most dangerous sections of Aldera, this police force kept order and used non-lethal methods to subdue and restrain those few malcontents that did not respect the local laws. Unless the crimes were of a violent nature, any offenders were normally confined to their starships for the duration of their stay or even escorted out of the Alderaan system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
