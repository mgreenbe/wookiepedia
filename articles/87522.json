This allowed it to be used either as a long ranged rifle or as a melee weapon in close quarter combat. The ammunition consisted of a cartridge that was filled with a dark, viscous fluid which resembled ink but caused localized paralysis when it came into contact with flesh. Its effects were even more profound if the fluid struck the eyes of a target as it was capable of causing blindness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
