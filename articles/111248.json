Although the system was placed within grid square P-9 by a map in The Essential Atlas, the book's Appendix section listed it as being located in square Q-10, which was repeated in the StarWars.com Online Companion to the book. This article assumes the visual map placement is erroneous and that Q-10 is the correct square."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
