In 22 BBY, during a conflict between the Republic and a militant secessionist faction, the Oligarchy's loyalty lay with the former. In the wake of a pro-Separatist uprising in Cadinth's capital city of Saskapeg that ended with the death of the planet's Jedi Watchman, Bodis-Ker Vitan, the Oligarchy retracted its previous support of the Republic. Fopow later withdrew all statements saying instead that the planet was \"firmly undecided\" between the two groups."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cadinth Oligarchy was mentioned in an issue of the HoloNet News feed released in 2002.
