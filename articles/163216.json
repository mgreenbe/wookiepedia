Waxer led a platoon of the 212th's troopers to a site of a supposed upcoming attack by the native Umbarans, having been warned by Krell that that the enemy would be wearing captured clone trooper armor. Waxer's men indeed engaged enemy forces in clone armor, only to discover them to have been fellow troopers from the 501st, led by Clone Captain CT-7567. The two squads had been pitted against each other by Krell, who had fallen to the dark side and was seeking to thwart the Republic's progress in the battle.

Meanwhile, Separatist J-1 semi-autonomous proton cannons below began to harass the Republic Acclamator-class assault ships, forcing them to pull back. Aboard one of the transports, Jedi Master Mace Windu used a holoprojector to contact Kenobi and tasked him and Ghost Company with destroying the cannons to allow the rest of the Republic troops to land.

With the bunker neutralized, Ghost Company entered the city. Kenobi then told Cody to pick his best men and scout ahead. Following Kenobi's orders, Cody selected Waxer, Boil, and a trooper named Wooley. While scouting, the clones took notice that the city was deserted; the Twi'leks had been driven from their homes by the Confederate forces. Cody suggested that the group should split up and ordered Waxer and Boil to go south\u2014telling them to return by an appointed time\u2014while he and Wooley checked the courtyard."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Meeting Numa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Separated from Cody, Waxer and Boil stumbled upon the young female Twi'lek orphan Numa in an alley.

By hiding in the alley, the clones managed to remain undetected by the droid, but its appearance prompted Boil to hurry Waxer. The latter continued to insist on taking Numa with them and soon convinced Boil to do so. As Boil reached to Numa, however, she bit his finger, leading Waxer to believe that she must have mistaken the two for droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To ease the girl's fears, Waxer removed his helmet and tried to explain to Numa that he and Boil were living beings, just like her. Noticing that Numa looked starved, Boil and Waxer gave her a ration bar. After tasting the bar, the girl called the clones \"nerra,\" a Twi'leki word unknown to Waxer and Boil. The clones then returned to their scouting mission, and Numa followed them. Soon, however, Numa ran away in the direction of the recon droid, and Waxer, unwilling to let her be killed by the droids, decided to follow her, much to Boil's dismay. The girl led the two clones to her destroyed home, where Waxer noticed a tooka doll lying on the floor.

Before the clones could get very far, however, several gutkurrs\u2014predatory beasts released by the Separatists to fight the Republic forces\u2014attacked them, and they were forced to retreat with Numa back into the home."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Liberating the Twi'leks"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To escape the creatures, Numa led the clones into an underground passage, and they resurfaced near Kenobi, Cody, and the rest of Ghost Company, who had just fought off a number of gutkurrs themselves.

There, Numa was reunited with her uncle, Nilim Bril. Kenobi then took control of one of the proton cannons, and with the help of Waxer and Boil\u2014who loaded the cannon with shells\u2014managed to destroy the other cannons.

As the Republic forces prepared to head to the capital city of Lessu to retake it and free the planet, Waxer and Boil said goodbye to Numa and bid her well. Numa then called them \"nerra\" one last time, and Kenobi translated for them: \"nerra\" meant \"brother.\" Eventually, the Republic was able to liberate Ryloth and destroy all of the droid forces."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Geonosis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, the Geonosian population of the planet Geonosis\u2014the site of the first battle of the war\u2014rebelled against the Republic and began producing droids for the Confederacy in newly established droid foundries.

Waxer and Boil accompanied the strike team led by Kenobi and Commander Cody, and the assault force soon managed to reach the rendezvous point despite heavy fire from the Geonosians. Upon landing, Cody circled his All Terrain Tactical Enforcer tanks into a defensive formation, and the clone troopers engaged the enemy Geonosians.

The two troopers raced through the ongoing firefight to the downed vehicle and opened the gunship. Inside it, they found two survivors: the injured Kenobi and clone trooper Trapper. Under covering fire from the Republic's AT-TE walkers, Waxer and Boil escorted the wounded pair back to Cody's position. Later, Skywalker's and Mundi's troops\u2014along with some BTL-B Y-wing starfighters dispatched by Admiral Wullf Yularen\u2014arrived to assist Kenobi's men and destroyed the shield generator. At some point during the battle, the Republic forces targeted one of the Geonosian weapons factories for destruction. Waxer was then dispatched to scout ahead and gather information about the enemy.

As the Republic forces, led by Generals Skywalker, Kenobi, Saesee Tiin, and Pong Krell, closed in on the world, Waxer attended the pre-battle briefing held among the command staff aboard a Jedi transport. Waxer and the 212th Attack Battalion, under the command of Kenobi, was tasked with capturing the planet's capital city, while the rest of the troops provided support for that main assault. As the lengthy battle dragged on, the 212th received a message from General Krell, who had assumed command of the 501st Legion of clone troopers after Skywalker was recalled from Umbara. Krell warned the 212th that the Umbarans, wearing captured clone trooper armor, were planning an attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Waxer then led a platoon of the 212th's men to the coordinates provided by Krell, where they indeed encountered a group of attackers in clone armor. Heavy fighting erupted between the two groups, during which many troops on both sides were killed and Waxer himself was fatally wounded. However, Waxer's men soon discovered that they were killing their own brethren from the 501st when one of the opposing soldiers\u2014CT-7567, nicknamed \"Rex\"\u2014took off his helmet and ran out to the middle of the battlefield in a desperate attempt to stop the fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 501st, via a fake transmission from Waxer engineered by Krell\u2014who had fallen to the dark side\u2014had been guided to the same location and had been warned about the disguised enemy.

Waxer also showed a fair amount of disobedience by deliberately deciding not to answer a call from command and planning on lying to his superior about running into trouble and having his communications jammed. According to Kenobi, it was uncharacteristic for Waxer and Boil to be late."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Second Battle of Geonosis, Waxer was sarcastic regarding his and Boil's assignment to rescue Kenobi, complaining that they always got the \"fun\" missions. As a clone of Jango Fett, Waxer had the height of 1.83 meters. The trooper had light skin, and his eyes were brown in color. Waxer had his naturally black hair shaved clean for quicker grooming, and he enjoyed teasing Boil about his \"fancy\" mustache, thus arguing with Boil, who believed himself to be the tougher of the pair.
