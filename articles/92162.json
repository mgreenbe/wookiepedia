It was specifically designed to send a signal that piggybacked on other signals and planetary relay stations. This method of transmission made the range phenomenal, yet unreliable. Under optimal conditions on highly advanced worlds, rich with comlink traffic, the unit could have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers overland. At the other extreme, on worlds with no other com signals nearby, the range dropped to a mere 25 kilometers. Less-advanced worlds with intermediately powered signals typically generated a range of roughly 500 kilometers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
