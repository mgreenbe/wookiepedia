Once a manufacturing site for the InterGalactic Banking Clan's IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tanks, Golbah encountered a revolt by its drones. The aristocracy responded by demolishing the hive with a proton bomb. Geonosians did not speak of this event to outsiders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A pool of bubbling black muck had settled in the bottom of the crater, caused by the experiments with chemical weapons the hive had been carrying out. Some chemicals had seeped out into the nearby Ebon Sea, causing a breed of mutant acklay to develop there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
