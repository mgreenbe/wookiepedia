It would pledge its resources to the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Secessionist Movement, earning its magistrate Passel Argente a place on the Separatist Council during the Clone Wars. During the First Battle of Geonosis, the Corporate Alliance would have been able to supply ground reinforcements to the Separatists, but they were stopped by the Galactic Republic's orbital cordon. The Geonosians launched thousands of Nantex starfighters to break the cordon, but the Republic ultimately won the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance had representation in the Separatist Parliament by Senator Voe Atell.
