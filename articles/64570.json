It was kept on a small shrine with several other icons in the Papanoida apartment on Coruscant. When Chi Eekway Papanoida and Che Amanwe Papanoida were kidnapped, the latter managed to strike one of her attackers, the Rodian bounty hunter Greedo, in the head with the idol and injured him before she was stunned. Greedo hastily replaced the idol but not in its proper place, something which escaped the notice of the investigating police but which was immediately noticed by the Baron. Investigating the idol further, Baron Papanoida discovered Greedo's blood on it and used this to identify him with an Information Retrieval. The Baron and his son then departed for Greedo's base of operations, while the idol was put back in its proper place on the shrine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
