It contained a transmitter for offworld communications, and was defended by troopers, Tuskcat Troopers, V-19 landspeeders, and two turrets at its gated entrance. In 32 BBY, the Trade Federation targeted the New Centrif transmitter in the first stage of its invasion of the planet, sending the B1-Series battle droid OOM-9 with a small task force to carry the attack out. OOM-9 chose not to attack New Centrif first despite landing close to it, instead directing his forces towards the nearby city of Vis to destroy its transmitter. There, OOM-9 gained reinforcements from the droid EEK-176, and together they attacked New Centrif from its less defended southern entrance and razed the city and its transmitter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New Centrif was a city on the Mid Rim planet Naboo, inhabited by the Human Naboo. It was located west of the city of Vis and north of Parrlay, and was also bordered by forests on the eastern and western sides. A paved path led into the northern entrance of the city, which was was connected to Vis by a dirt path, and the southern entrance connected a paved path down to Parrlay and another path stretching north around the forest to the southern entrance of Vis. The ground in New Centrif was covered in paved paths and grass, and the buildings and walls were consistently decorated with orange patterns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two flags were placed ahead of the northern entrance, which was like a cul-de-sac aside from the gate. Two lines of light walls stretched to the north from the gate. Inside the entrance two defensive turrets were built, giving New Centrif a well-defended appearance. To the west of the entrance there was a small well and a gazebo. Trees and flowers grew throughout that decorative area, and a small light wall and several trees served as a border between it and the rest of the city. Two residential buildings were located south of the gate, and a transmitter that supported offworld communications. The transmitter was placed on a raised piece of land, was surrounded by a light wall, and also powered by a power core close to the western forest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The center of the city was occupied by a monument, and northeast of it was a troop center and two more residential buildings. In the center-east a power core was built, which supported the troop center, two residential buildings to the southwest and one in the northeast corner. A small light wall was built southeast between the buildings and the forest. At the southern area of the town there was a food processing center, where the goods from three farms that were harvested by PKN-49 worker droids. In the southeastern side there was a nova processing center, where more droids collected nova crystals from a nearby stockpile. Southwest of the farms an ore processing center was built to gather ore from a similar stockpile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation, and to prevent word of their invasion reaching the galactic capital Coruscant the transmitters in New Centrif, Vis, and Parrlay were their first targets. Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray sent the B1-Series battle droid OOM-9 with a small task force of the Trade Federation Droid Army, which included eight battle droids, four heavy beetle droids, and two Single Trooper Aerial Platforms. OOM-9's forces landed a C-9979 landing craft north of New Centrif and marched towards the city. At the time of the invasion New Centrif was defended by a total of seventeen troopers, five Tuskcat Troopers, and three V-19 landspeeders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the droids drew nearer, OOM-9 observed that New Centrif was well defended, and that reinforcements would be required before taking the city. He turned the army on the path east to Vis. At Vis, OOM-9's forces were joined with reinforcements led by the droid EEK-176, and together they destroyed the transmitter there. The combined forces took the path that connected Vis to the south of New Centrif, which was less defended than the main northern entrance due to a lack of gates and walls. At the city, the droids gunned down the soldiers and labor droids near the nova crystal deposits, at which point the vast majority of New Centrif's population descended upon the invaders. OOM-9 fought them off with the battle droids and his personal Armored Assault Tank, keeping his beetle droids in reserve. With New Centrif's inhabitants killed, OOM-9 sent the beetle droids in to raze the city, including the transmitter. EEK-176 immediately declared the result to Gunray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New Centrif was first mentioned in the Prima Games strategy guide for the the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, before appearing in the game on its release. The city appears in the first level of the Trade Federation campaign, entitled \"Beachhead.\" The strategy guide states that the player can lose the level if they attempt to attack New Centrif straight away without gaining reinforcements. The entrance to the city can trap the player's units in a small area, and while winning the battle is technically possible, the player would have a difficult time winning the level afterwards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The guide also described the objective of the level as destroying spaceports in the Naboo cities instead of transmitters, including a picture of a spaceport in the location the transmitter occupied in the finished game. The turrets at the entrance are not present if the player attempts the level in easy mode, but are present in moderate and hard difficulties. Three of the royal troopers and two V-19 landspeeders are also only present in hard difficulty. In the original version of Galactic Battlegrounds, the mounted Naboo troopers rode kaadu, which were replaced with tusk cats in the 2002 expansion Clone Campaigns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
