While flying to the Separatist fleet, Wrecker moans about being sent on another \"stealth mission.\" The clones managed to obtain permission to dock with the Separatist dreadnought after Echo transmits a signal cloaking their ship as the Separatist shuttle TC-59. Meanwhile on Anaxes, Republic forces under Masters Windu and Kenobi attack the main Separatist assembly plant with LAAT gunships and BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bombers. While ARC-170 fighters distract the Vulture Droids to buy the Republic time, the Y-wing's begin bombing the plant. Upon entering the assembly plant, Windu offers the B1-series battle droids there the chance to surrender and be reprogrammed. However, the droids reject the offer and attack Windu and his men. Meanwhile, the clones use grappling hooks to descend into the factory. On Trench's dreadnought, a super tactical droid informs the Admiral that the assembly plant has come under attack.

Unaware of the recent events on Skako Minor, Admiral Trench orders his tactical droid to contact Skako Minor for Echo's algorithm. Tech is able to mask Echo's transmission as originating from Skako Minor, fooling Trench. Posing as the algorithm, Echo advises the Admiral to mobilize all troops to the assembly plant, claiming that the Republic would send all their reinforcements there due to their faith in the Jedi. The Separatist plan was to smash all Republic forces with one strike. Admiral Trench gloats and deploys more reinforcements to the assembly plant. Tech picks up Trench's transmission and informs his comrades.

While Echo transmits the sequence to shut down the bomb, Windu uses the Force to move the dials. Their work is interrupted when Trench traces down the source of the illegal pulse and jams its signal. This has the effect of electrocuting Echo and rendering him unconscious.

In response, Skywalker severs his left set of arms and reiterates his demand. Trench complies and Anakin reveals the final number to Windu who is then able to disarm the bomb.

Rex tells Echo that he considers the Bad Batch some of the finest troopers he's fought alongside, and that he doesn't mind if he goes with them if he wants to.
