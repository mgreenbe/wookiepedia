The officer and Nala Se spoke via a holographic screen about the status of the evacuation, and from the frigate, the clone officer informed Se that the evacuation was slowly proceeding. Nala Se ordered the commander that the clones in stable condition should be moved first, while the more critically wounded would have to wait. The officer then asked about the clones in the bacta tanks, as some of those clones could not be moved. Nala Se acknowledged, and ordered the commander to guide the mobile patients to the transports, to which the officer confirmed. Eventually, the Battle of the Kaliida Nebula began when the Malevolence arrived and attacked the docked frigates that were departing first. The frigates were destroyed, and the Malevolence targeted the medical station until it was critically damaged by the newly arrived Shadow Squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, the clone officer was a human male who stood at 1.83 meters tall.
