After the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, Admiral Gratloe, tired of the deaths caused by the Galactic Civil War, defected from the Empire to create his own faction. He took control of the mining facility on Kudo, as well as the Star Destroyer Celerity. When the Empire received contact from the Celerity, reporting hyperdrive issues that prevented it from following its orders, Colonel Shakara Nuress of the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing dispatched one of the fighter wing's squadrons to accompany a maintenance crew aboard the cruiser-carrier Summit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving above Kudo, the Summit and the TIE fighter pilots came under attack from the Celerity and its TIE fighter complement. As the Summit attempted to escape to hyperspace, it was destroyed by the Celerity, leading Second Lieutenant Commander Teso Broosh to surrender on behalf of his squadron. The pilots landed on Kudo, taken prisoner by Gratloe's forces. Gratloe offered the pilots a place in his faction, but they refused to join him, instead leading Gratloe's forces to rebel against his defection. The forces aboard the Celerity fought to regain control, but Gratloe had promised to sell the Star Destroyer to the Alliance to Restore the Republic, who arrived in the system, attacking the pilots of the 204th. Overrun by rebel starfighters, the surviving pilots were forced to abandon the mining facility and retreat to the Celerity, escaping the Kudo system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Galactic Empire mining facility was located on Kudo's desert surface.
