The Chubbits ambushed an Imperial patrol speeder from an elevated position, destroying it. The speeder otherwise would have overtaken the Human allies\u2014Luke Skywalker and a man claiming to be Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2014and prevented them from entering the tower to destroy it. The structure, while necessary to overcome Aridus's ionized atmosphere and allow electronics to work on the world, interfered with the nervous system of the planet's native Chubbits, killing many. Nevertheless, the Obi-Wan Kenobi impersonator's mission was actually a careful ruse to lure Skywalker to the clutches of Darth Vader, waiting in the tower. Yet the actor had a change of heart and brought the tower down with the pull of a lever, freeing the Chubbits of its deleterious effects and allowing Skywalker to escape. Darth Vader nearly perished in the collapse, but he was saved by the Human smuggler Wrenga Jixton."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
