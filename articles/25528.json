The document contained multiple passages, including ones detailing the authority of the chancellor, later the proposed First Senator if it came to fruition, and one declaring that no person should have to answer for the crimes of a parent. Several members of the Senate, including Princess Leia Organa, believed the constitution to be flawed. It also allowed scavengers to declare ownership of a droid's wreckage (\"flotsam\") that they had discovered. Kuiil, an Ugnaught, recovered IG-11's body and claimed it as his own, in accordance with the charter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
