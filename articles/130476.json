However, Valarian's underworld rival, Jabba the Hutt, decided to crash her party. He sent a Duros bounty hunter and several other henchmen to disrupt the festivities under the pretext of protecting a prior investment. Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes were under an exclusive contract to perform only for Jabba, and the Hutt wanted to shut down their performance. As luck would have it, several Imperial stormtroopers likewise raided the Star Chamber Caf\u00e9 and engaged in a blaster fight with Jabba's cronies.
