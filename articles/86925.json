His job was to plant electronic monitoring devices on four key computer systems. However, Mark had to injure himself to avoid suspicion, rendering him unable to complete the mission himself. Fortunately for him, Galiir sent a spacer working for Colonel Braedic Ekirk to assist him. The spacer met with Mark Hieks in the A.C.L.O medical bay, and was instructed to place monitoring devices on the A.C.L.O's medical computer, personal computer, operations computer, and equipment manifest computer. The spacer carefully carried out the task successfully, and then reported back to Mark. Mark was pleased, but he still had one final task for the spacer to complete. Rebel inspectors were arriving to inspect the local office of the A.C.L.O. The Rebellion was trying to determine whether or not the A.C.L.O should work with them on a more permanent basis. In order to disrupt the inspection, and impede on the A.C.L.O's progress with the Rebellion, Mark tasked the spacer with killing at least ten Rebel inspectors. Once again, the spacer succeeded in his task. Mark was happy with the spacer's skills and dedication to the Empire, yet told the spacer he would have to lay low. Following the completion of the tasks, the spacer returned to Braedic Ekirk, and Mark remained in the A.C.L.O office for a while longer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Hieks became an agent in the employ of the Corellian Security Force.
