Having occupied the Togruta colony world of Kiros, the Confederacy of Independent Systems secretly transported the world's entire population to the planet Zygerria, where the Togruta were to be sold as slaves at an auction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Galactic Republic task force led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano, liberated Kiros and discovered links leading to Zygerria. The Jedi and Clone Captain CT-7567 soon infiltrated the auction and tried to rescue the Togruta but were captured by the Zygerrians and enslaved."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker and his Padawan, however, escaped from the Zygerrians and headed for Kadavo to rescue Kenobi, CT-7567, and the Togruta, who had been transferred to the Zygerrian slave processing facility on the planet. While en route, the two also called for reinforcements from the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano and her Master arrived on the planet first on the Aurore-class freighter Tecora and tried to break into the slave processing facility. When ordered to cease by the Zygerrian Keeper Agruss, lest the slaves be killed, Skywalker did not comply. At that moment, the reinforcements arrived, led by Admiral Barton Coburn and Jedi Master Plo Koon. The Republic's Shadow Squadron also took part in the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Koon's Wolfpack detachment attacked the facility with LAAT/i gunships and clone Z-95 starfighters, but were halted by its ray shields.

Although he feared the people of Kiros would not recover from their time in slavery, Tano was confident their will would be strengthened from their victory, and she supported his idea to join the Republic. The battle at Kadavo proved to be one of the many victories Shadow Squadron took part in, with one veteran of the battle later flying a BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber alongside squadmates on the extragalactic planet Kamino."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
