Jedi Master Toluz Cheq's Republic fleet was decimated by a new model of Confederate Vulture droids equipped with advanced engines constructed by famous starship builders from the planet Valahari. Following the battle, the Jedi attempted to convince the Valahari to stop supplying the Confederacy with the engines but failed to do so."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 22 BBY, the people of the neutral planet Valahari began trade relations with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Valahari were prolific starship builders, and the Confederate leader, Count Dooku, was an old friend of Harko Vane, the Viscount of the planet's royal House of Vane. Tired of Republic interference in their affairs and believing that trading with the Confederacy would help their economy, the Valahari began secretly selling advanced engines for Confederate Vulture droid starfighters. The engines helped the Vultures achieve great speeds, exceeding that of any Republic craft at the time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon thereafter, a number of the modified Vultures attacked a Republic fleet commanded by Jedi Master Toluz Cheq in the Rial Kroon system. The Vultures decimated the Republic Venator-class Star Destroyers and V-19 Torrent starfighters, and killed Cheq's Padawan. Cheq, who was one of the Jedi Order's best pilots, engaged the enemy in a Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor and managed to collect some data on the new Confederate starfighters. However, the Jedi was unable to inflict any damage on the Vultures and could not escape from them either. Realizing that, Cheq hastily established a holographic connection with the Jedi Temple on the galactic capital of Coruscant and transmitted his data to the Jedi Order. Soon after, Cheq was killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Analyzing Cheq's transmission, the Jedi learned of the Valahari's dealings with the Confederacy. Hoping to persuade the Valahari to stop selling the engines to the Separatists, Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi went to Valahari on a diplomatic mission. However, the Valahari refused to comply, and the Republic established a blockade of the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This battle appeared in The Clone Wars 10, a 2009 comic book written by Henry Gilroy and Steven Melching, and illustrated by Brian Koschak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
