Oruba was born with a genetic defect that left his skin devoid of pigment, giving him a dissimilar look to most other Hutts. For this reason, he was one of the select few Hutts to wear any form of clothing, sporting an elaborate cape and a beret. When Maul and Death Watch came before the Hutt Council to demand an alliance, Oruba asked them if they had anything to trade in exchange for such a thing. All of the Hutts present laughed heartily at the proposal before ordering their deaths, but the expected execution became a skirmish in which Oruba lost his life at the hands of Savage Opress, but not before giving Maul the location of Jabba's Palace, Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oruba was the last member of the Grand Hutt Council to answer Jabba's summons with his hologram appearing in Jabba's Throne Room. For the first part of the meeting, Oruba did not speak. After Jabba responded to Arok's question of what was to happen to Ziro after he was freed, Oruba stated that he believed that the council would be better off if Ziro was under their protection. With Jabba agreeing, the elder Hutt asked who would undertake the task. Oruba received his answer as Bounty Hunter Cad Bane stepped through his hologram and presented himself to the council. Oruba agreed, along with Jabba and the rest of the Hutt council, that Cad Bane break Ziro out of Republic custody and deliver him to the council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oruba was present when Ziro was brought before the Hutt Grand Council on the planet Nal Hutta after being freed by Bane.

While Arok and Marlo were able to escape, the Oruba was caught and Maul demanded the location of Jabba.
