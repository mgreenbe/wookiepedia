By 0 BBY, he had joined the Rebel Alliance as a pilot in Red Squadron, commissioned as a major and stationed at Base One on the fourth moon of Yavin. Along with Theron Nett, Surrel often flew as wingmate to Commander Garven Dreis, who served as Red Leader. At one point, Surrel and Dreis were scheduled to fly Shift Cycle 1 of an X-wing patrol mission from Yavin to the Gordian Trace Relays, where they would perform a flyby of surrounding space, verify all-clear visuals and sensors, and perform close uplink of passive relay recordings."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Scarif"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surrel, along with the rest of Red Squadron, participated in the Battle of Scarif. As the Rogue One team attempted to steal the plans for the Death Star superweapon from the Imperial Center of Military Research on the planet, Red Squadron began dogfighting the Imperial TIE fighter garrison. Flying as Red Eleven, he again flew as wing to Red Leader. Surrel survived the engagement, which saw the successful transmission of the plans to a corvette under Princess Leia Organa."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Yavin and death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plans were eventually brought to the rebel base on Yavin, where General Jan Dodonna assembled the rebel pilots. The Death Star was rapidly approaching the rebel base, but Dodonna explained that the pilots would seek to exploit a design flaw placed in the battlestation: a thermal exhaust port which would allow proton torpedoes to destroy the station's main reactor. After the briefing, Surrel entered the Red Squadron ready room with Dreis and Zal Dinnes. For the squadron's final flight plan, he was substituted as Dreis' port wingman for Puck Naeco (Red Twelve); instead Surrel was given command of second flight, comprised of wingmates John D. Branon (Red Four) and Cdt. Harb Binli (Red Seven)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they approached the Death Star, Dreis directed Red Squadron to cut across the battle station's axis and draw Imperial turbolaser fire, as Gold Squadron's Y-wings made their attack run on the meridian trench. Shortly thereafter, Imperial TIEs were scrambled, whittling away Red Squadron; Surrel's wingmate Branon was the first to succumb to the enemy fighters, and Binli soon followed. As Lt. Nozzo Naytaan (Red Nine) was shot down, Surrel was left alone amidst a swarm of TIEs. Though back in the Massassi control room, grounded pilot Col Takbright urged command to pull Surrel out, to no avail. Red Eleven died sacrificing himself, buying time for Luke Skywalker (Red Five) to complete his final run on the exhaust port."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the help of the Force, Skywalker's proton torpedoes found their mark, and the station was destroyed, allowing the rebellion to survive.
