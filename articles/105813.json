The ship was extensively modified during its lifetime with the Alliance, including additional hull plating and the mounting of triple laser cannons. While the ship appears beat-up, the Planet Jumper is a reliable and sturdy ship. Due to an undiscovered quirk in the ship's control systems, the Planet Jumper handles better in atmosphere than in space. Additionally, the ship suffers from the hyperdrive bleeding energy prior to a jump, resulting in one of the ship's other systems such as maneuverability, deflector shields, or weapons, going dead as the engines take the energy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
