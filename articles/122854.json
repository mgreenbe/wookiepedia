Senya grew troubled by Valkorion's indifference to his children, which culminated with him locking Vaylin on Nathema and subjecting her to mental conditioning. Senya attempted to rescue her daughter to no avail and later attempted to run away with the children, but they refused to leave, calling her weak. Senya abandoned her family, but not the Empire, taking assignments on the fringes of Zakuulan space. Seeing her family only in public broadcasts, she eventually learned that Thexan was killed during the raids into the Core Worlds.

She later accompanied the Outlander back to Zakuul on a mission to find and recruit the Lady of Sorrows, returning with her to Asylym shorly before Arcann's Eternal Fleet launched an attack. Senya helped defend the Gravestone against skytrooper assault and engaged her daughter in a Lightsaber duel, during which Vaylin revealed to her that it was Arcann who killed Thexan. Escaping from the Eternal Fleet on the Gravestone, Senya traveled with the rest to Odessen, where she joined Lana Beniko's Alliance to oppose the Eternal Empire. Senya participated in Alliance operations on Zakuul and Vandin, providing valuable information on the Eternal Empire.

Senya didn't hesitate to speak her mind, speaking out against replacing human soldiers in military positions with skytroopers, catching the Emperor's interest. Two years later, Valkorion and Senya become romantically involved, eventually marrying and bearing his children, giving birth to twins Arcann and Thexan. Despite Senya showering them with love, her sons gave none in return, seeking to impress their father, who seemed content to ignore them in turn. Their third child and only daughter, Vaylin, was a trouble from the very start, being so powerful that she made furniture move with the Force while still in the womb. As a toddler, Vaylin tore droids apart and one time, when a guard dropped a ball she tossed, Vaylin crippled him. Senya spent as much time as she could with her daughter and the two shared many happy moments, but Vaylin preferred to do even mundane tasks using Telekinesis instead of her hands.

He took Vaylin to Nathema, a blighted world devoid of the Force and locked her in the Sanitarium, where she underwent brutal mental and physical torture at the hands of Nathema Zealots, while Anomid scientist Jarak worked her on her mental conditioning, transforming Vaylin from a sweet but troubled child into a psychopath devoid of empathy. Sensing her daughter's suffering home on Zakuul, Senya decided to get Vaylin away from Nathema. A shuttle delivered her to Sanitarium, where she found Vaylin unconscious and carried her to the landing platform. There, her path was blocked by six of the Nathema Zealots and after Vaylin opened her eyes, Senya ordered her to stay back, while she took great care to knock out all six Zealots without killing them. Senya then asked Vaylin to come with her, but the look in her daughter's eyes was filled with hate, with Vaylin blaming her mother for her suffering. Valkorion himself then emerged from the Sanitarium and ordered several Knights of Zakuul to restrain Senya and take her away, while taking Vaylin with him back into Sanitarium. Deciding that her children were not safe around Valkorion, Senya attempted to run away with them, but the children idolized their father and refused to leave, calling their own mother weak. Even as children and with Vaylin's powers locked away, the three of them were more powerful than Senya, so she was forced to leave alone. Valkorion didn't even try to stop her, although years later he privately admitted to the Commander that he made a mistake in letting her go.

Following one such attack on Korriban, it was publicly proclaimed that prince Thexan was killed during the fighting. Senya watched her son's funeral on the public broadcast, the only way she could now see her family. Later that year, Valkorion was assassinated at the hands of an Outlander captured during one such raid, and Arcann took his father's Eternal Throne, proclaiming himself the new Eternal Emperor, with Vaylin as his High Justice. Arcann launched a full-scale invasion of the galaxy, claiming it a retaliation for the Outlander's crime. During the Occupation of Denon a crew serving under captain Koth Vortena refused to massacre civilian rioters on Denon and deserted, and Senya was assigned to hunt them down, spending months attempting to capture the deserters. During that time she met Sith Lord Lana Beniko who was looking for the whereabouts of the Outlander, exchanging what information she could with her. Senya later became sympathetic to Beniko's cause, seeing how oppressive and cruel Arcann's rule had become, but the final straw for her was the Scion massacre, when Arcann ordered the Zakuulan Knights to kill the Scions of Zakuul who served alongside them. Horrified by her son's actions, Senya felt that the Knights had lost their honor when they decided to follow that order instead of rebelling.

Senya went to Lana's coordinates in the Endless Swamp of Zakuul, where the fugitives have found and partially repaired the legendary vessel called the Gravestone. Senya arrived on her speeder bike just as Beniko and the Outlander were fighting off skytrooper forces and helped them hold their ground against Zauulan Knights. When another wave of attackers was dealt with, Koth Vortena rushed to their help and upon seeing Senya, immediately showed his distrust of her, refusing to let her aboard. However, there was no time for argument with more pursuers on their way and Senya worked together with Lana to raised the Gravestone from the swamp using the Force. As everyone got onboard and the vessel left the atmosphere, the Eternal Fleet arrived to intercept them, only for the Outlander to fire the Gravestone's omnicannon, destroying more than two dozen Eternal Fleet warships in a single shot and enabling the Gravestone to jump into Hyperspace. Hostilities soon erupted on the bridge as Koth and Senya's past history prevented them from working towards a common goal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was able to get a short distance away before the Gravestone hyperdrive failed. After informing the Outlander that they were going to Asylum, Senya responded to Koth's hostility with insistence that her pursuit of him was justified, considering his status as a deserter. With their argument going nowhere, Senya left the bridge to wander and explore the ship, going down into the deeper part of the ship and finding an enigmatic monolith in an area called \"the Dark Sanctuary\". The Outlander found her there, and the two had a brief conversation, in which Senya formally introduced herself. The Gravestone managed to limp to the shadowport and dock as the Asylum, where Vortena's crew of Zakuulan exiles joined him to work on the ship, prompting a sarcastic remark from Senya who was not told of their company beforehand. Senya then went to meet with the Scions of Zakuul who had a secret enclave on the Asylum, asking the Outlander to join her there later. She waited at the hidden entrance to the enclave until the Outlander arrived in the company of Lana's Bodyguard droid HK-55. Senya opened the secret entrance, upon entering which the HK was hit by an electromagnetic pulse that disabled him and wiped his short-term memory.

They were engaged in combat by Scions and had their intentions questioned by Heskal, who insisted that Arcann and Vaylin had to die for their slaughter of the Scions. Still unable to perceive the Outlander's fate, Heskal knocked out Senya and engaged the Outlander one-on-one. The Outlander emerged victorious and stood over a defeated Heskal, and Senya pleaded not to harm Heskal, insisting that they needed the support of the Scions. At that moment, the sanctuary was stormed by Hk-55, Lana Beniko, Koth Vortena and his crew, who demanded that the Scions stand down. Heskal ordered his men to out away their lightsabers and asked the Outlander a final question about their intentions for the galaxy after Arcann's defeat. After the Outlander gave the answer, Heskal shocked everyone by revealing that the reason why the Scions could not see the Outlander future was because Valkorion had survived within their mind. The revelation excited Koth, who believed that Valkorion's survival meant salvation for Zakuul, while Lana stated that the Emperor was a threat to all life everywhere.

Senya suggested asking Valkorion directly, though the Outlander rejected the notion of being merely Valkorion's mouthpiece. Koth and Lana soon began to argue over whether Valkorion was benevolent or a monster, each arguing that they knew more about him than the other. Senya interjected that she knew him better than anyone else, which only made the situation awkward given her unintended implication. The argument was interrupted by HK-55, who relayed a message from Lana's astromech droid T7-O1 on Zakuul, informing them that the information broker known as \"Lady of Sorrows\" wished to establish a dialogue with the Gravestone computers.

However, the Knights were not welcome in the Old World and Reg set Heralds of Zildrog led by Aitan Brewgs on Senya, who managed to hold her own against the three attackers until the Outlander arrived and helped her to finish them off. Afterwards, Senya confronted Reg, who explained that the Heralds made a deal with Arcann; in exchange for the Knights keeping out of the Old World, the Heralds would keep crime levels down. Senya demanded to know where to find the Lady of Sorrows but Reg refused, so Senya had to use the Force to demand answers of him, and Reg gave up, pointing Senya and the Outlander to one of the Lady's business partners, Mona Gale. Senya and the Outlander found Gale at the Market Station, taking bets on Arena Grand fights, which Senya found brutal and barbaric. Senya asked Gale on hos to contact the Lady just as a public broadcast from Arcann labeled Senya as the Outlander's accomplice.

The two began arguing, with Senya insisting that she could simply strongarm the Exalted into compliance, and Koth claiming that as an average Zakuulan, he could reason with them better. The Outlander made their decision and took one of them to meet with the Exalted, while the other was ambushed and brought to the Lady directly. The Exalted refused to cooperate and was about to order his Heralds to open fire on the Outlander, but was interrupted by a holocall from Lady's Nautolan aide Thea, who told them that the Lady wished to meet both the Exalted and the Outlander at the Razor.

Combining the information from the two sources allowed SCORPIO to reveal the existence of the GEMINI frequency, by the means of which Arcann controlled the Eternal Fleet. The Alliance planned an attack on the Hyperwave relay station hidden ten kilometers beneath the Spire on Zakuul and connecting the Eternal Throne to the Eternal Fleet, sending the Havoc Squad and Kaliyo Djannis on the mission, one of them providing a diversion for the other's main objective. Bearing animosity for Firebrand's anarchist attacks, Senya was against Kaliyo's involvement in the operation. Unfortunately, the Commander went missing and was unable to join on the mission, so the Alliance had no choice but to proceed regardless.

Within the depth of their mind, the Commander fought back by locating the Dramath's holocron, which held power to destroy Valkorion once and for all. The Throne room was breached by the attacking skytroopers and mother and son held them off for a while, until Senya told Arcann to use the physical Holocron to join the Outlander in the fight against his father. Inside the Commander's mind, Arcann joined Vaylin's essence, which remained bound to Valkorion after her death. Using the holocron to free her from Valkorion's control, Arcann and the Outlander convinced Vaylin to joined their side and attacked the Immortal Emperor. After toying with them for a while, Valkorion destroyed the holocron, but since his spirit was now bound to Vaylin's, the Commander used Vaylin's mental key phrase \"Kneel before the Dragon of Zakuul\" to rob him of his own strength. Overpowered and weakened, Valkorion watched as Senya joined her children in the Commander's mind and together the family watched the Immortal Emperor's final words and moments, until the Commander put a final end to his millennia-long existence. Back in the physical world, Senya congratulated the Commander on finally putting an end to Valkorion and opened a system-wide holochannel to announce the Alliance victory. The Commander then proclaimed the age of the Eternal Alliance, unifying the military of Zakuul and the Eternal Fleet with the cause of the Alliance, which Senya continued to be a part of."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senya Tirall possessed a sense of duty and honor, continuing to serve the Eternal Empire even after being abandoned by her family and holding a grudge for exiled officer Koth Vortena even after she became a defector herself. A loving mother to her children, Senya faced great difficulty raising them due their father's power and status, causing the twins boys to have nothing to do with her and her daughter Vaylin to eventually be taken from her and turned against her mother. Witnessing the atrocities committed by her children, Senya became determined to put them down, only to realize she was unable to do the deed herself. She could not bring herself to strike Vaylin on Asylum when she had her at her mercy and later choose to try to redeem Arcann rather than let the Alliance kill him. A talented warrior, she was also well-versed in Zakuul history and enjoyed singing in her spare time. Despite her usual soft nature, Senya could be swift and ruthless when on a mission, no stranger to using threats and coercion to get information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senya was an experienced duelist capable of holding the upper hand in a fight against her daughter, she was also capable of performing great feats of telekinesis as she could help Lana Beniko free the Gravestone from the Endless Swamp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senya Tirall appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire as a major companion character voiced by Abby Craden.
