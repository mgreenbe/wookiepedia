Blue milk is instead sold at the Milk Stand which also offers a Bubo Wamba Family Farms souvenir drink vessel, and the stand's in-universe owner is Bubo Wamba. The Black Spire Outpost map which is available with the Barnes & Noble Exclusive Edition of Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire does not contain the names \"Bantha Tracks\" or \"Saka Homestead,\" but still includes the illustration of banthas. It is unknown if these all represent different locations or a change in the naming of the stand and farm before the park's opening."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bantha Tracks is also the name of a well known Star Wars fan newsletter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
