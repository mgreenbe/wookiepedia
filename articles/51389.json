The second model was created by removing the co-pilot's seat and installing an astromech slot. The slimmer profile and shorter, narrower wings allowed improved visibility and access for the astromech droid. This model was also known as the Type II Dunelizard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "First produced by MandalMotors in the years following the Clone Wars, the Dunelizard was offered to the Imperial Navy, who rejected the design. However, the Empire allowed the starfighter to be sold to third parties, as it was seen as an insignificant risk to Imperial forces.
