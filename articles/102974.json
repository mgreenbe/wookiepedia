That year, Reshad was present in the audience chamber of the Hutt's palace when the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO arrived in order to bargain for their master Luke Skywalker's friend Han Solo, who was frozen in carbonite and hung on display in the palace.

Organa won Jabba's favor, but later rescued Solo and attempted to escape the palace with him, for which they were caught and imprisoned. Skywalker himself then arrived to demand their release, and Reshad witnessed Jabba subsequently drop him down into the rancor pit.

When the spacer succeeded in killing the blackmailer, Reshad was thankful, and made it clear that he would seek the spacer's help again if he ever needed it. During Reshad's time selling spice in Jabba's palace, he funded the Alliance to Restore the Republic with part of his profits. Reshad had fair skin, brown hair and gray eyes.
