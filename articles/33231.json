The Rebel Alliance tentatively identified it as the ship that engaged the CR90 corvette Old Republic shortly after the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This ship was detected after two waves of Imperial probe droids had been launched against the crippled Alliance fleet at Endor, and the Old Republic was sent to intercept it. Although the Old Republic was more heavily armed, the Daggerblade was able to prevail by consistently evading the corvette's fire while wearing away at the ship's defenses. After taking out the Old Republic's drive, Daggerblade proceeded to destroy the sensor drones that the Alliance had deployed at the edges of the Endor system. The Daggerblade retreated after destroying the majority of the sensor drones, while Alliance reinforcements arrived just in time to see the Old Republic explode."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
