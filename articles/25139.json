The membership of the Chamber of Order was comprised of former Imperial and corporate officials allied to the Alignment. The Chamber's duties included dealing with threats to the Alignment, and enacting new policies and regulations. Each member of the Chamber was able to request military assistance from the Alignment, and were responsible for appointing overseers to planets and sectors within the Alignment's sphere of influence. Grand Moff Ardus Kaine was the deciding vote in the Chamber and wielded a veto to the Chamber's decisions. While a majority overthrow vote could block Kaine's veto few questioned his decisions. The Chamber of Order never met publicly, preferring to meet at secure sites at random intervals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
