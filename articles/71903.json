During that time, he was part of one of the salvager groups that had decided to brave the dangers of the Enclave's sub-level. The group quickly came under attack by a predatory insect known as laigreks and were forced to retreat. Separated from the group and surrounded by laigreks, Jorran was forced to lock himself in a nearby room. When Meetra Surik, a former Jedi Knight, searched the sub-level looking for Jedi Master Vrook Lamar, she discovered Jorran. Surik killed the laigreks barring Jorran's escape and allowed him to leave the Enclave's sub-level. When Surik returned to the salvager camp, Jorran thanked her and offered to sell her some of the Jedi artifacts he had found.

A scavenger by trade, he worked out of a salvager camp established near the ruined Jedi Enclave on the planet. During that time, he stole a vaporator modulator from a farmer named Suulru. Later, he was part of a salvage group led by a Human named Taepalae that had decided to brave the dangers of the Enclave's sub-level in the hopes of finding some highly valuable salvage. While within the dank lower level, they came under attack from the laigreks, a predatory insect that inhabited the area. As the group fled from the laigreks, Jorran was separated from the group in the ensuing retreat and was forced to lock himself in a nearby room in order to protect himself from the vicious laigreks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Meetra Surik, a former Knight of the Jedi Order otherwise known as the Jedi Exile, visited the sub-level in her search for Jedi Master Vrook Lamar, she discovered Jorran in his hiding place. Jorran refused to unlock the door unless Surik killed all the laigreks that were around which the former Jedi proceeded to do. She returned to Jorran and assured him that the beasts were no more. Jorran opened the door, thanked his rescuer, and explained to Surik what had happened and asked if he was free to go, which Surik allowed him to do so. She later returned to the camp and spoke with Jorran, who again thanked his rescuer and mentioned that he had found some Jedi salvage in the sub-level. He offered to sell it to her for 1300. Back in the salvager camp he thanked her and offered his loot for 1000. Surik was also able to convince Jorran to return the moisture vaporator modulator to Suulru. Jorran would later be convinced by the Exile to join the Khoonda Militia to assist in the defense of Khoonda, the planetary capital at the time, during the Battle of Khoonda between the residents of Dantooine and a group of mercenaries led by Azkul, a Sith veteran of the Jedi Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a salvager and scavenger, Jorran split his time between searching the Enclave ruins for valuable items and attempting to sell these items to the Khoonda community.

It is also possible to get him to admit to finding something valuable in the sub-level before he leaves, at which point you can kill him and loot the items from his corpse.
