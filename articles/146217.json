This was done to stop the base from transmitting the all clear signal, which had been hardwired by BX-series droid commandos. Without the signal it was clear something was wrong, and this stopped a planned Separatist attack on Kamino, where the Republic clone troopers were created."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Galactic Empire suffered a major defeat at Endor, Governor Ubrik Adelhard ordered the lockdown of the Anoat sector, where Bespin was located. With the blockade, Cloud City became the only place where tibanna could be found, and the demand for that gas rose dramatically. Consequently, the Trade Spine League made money transporting tibanna to various worlds in the Anoat sector. The Galactic Empire, however, intended to take Cloud City in order to cut off the sector's population from their much-needed tibanna supplies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
