He was the highest ranking member of a group of disgruntled officers bent on killing Darth Vader due to the Sith Lord's viciousness in dealing with his subordinates. The general suggested that since Vader was focused on confronting the Rebel Luke Skywalker, the opportunity had arrived to assassinate Vader. Colonel Nord agreed and attempted to kill Vader by opening an airlock near the Dark Lord when he was pursuing Skywalker (who infiltrated the station), but Darth Vader managed to survive. When Vader had engaged the Rebels in a space battle, Nord again attempted to kill him and the Rebels with the Tarkin's superlaser, but the firing mechanism had been sabotaged by the Rebel saboteurs, causing the station to self-destruct killing all aboard, including Biel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Disgusted by Vader's brutality towards his subordinates, the general became the member of a conspiracy to eliminate Darth Vader while he visited the Tarkin battle station.
