Aside from its criminal activity, the Hutt Cartel ruled over swathes of territories known as Hutt Space and hired mercenary outfits to maintain it holdings and wage  military campaigns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the devastating civil war known as the Hutt Cataclysms, the Hutt Empire collapsed, the Hutts clans reestablished themselves the Hutt Cartel under the leadership of Budhila Hestilic Amura who adopted a new philosophy known as kajidic, a renunciation of war and conquest, instead advocating indirect control through commerce."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Old Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Great Galactic War, the Hutt Cartel was displeased with the Sith Emperor because he did not include them in his plans and intrigues. However, due to the subterfuge of Imperial Intelligence agents, the Republic was unsuccessful in gaining the Hutts' support against the Empire. The Cartel remained neutral in the war, like most others in the criminal underworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War, the Hutt Cartel owned and ran the HoloNet in the Network Access division on Nar Shaddaa, which was operated by Kabbura."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3638 BBY, the new Supreme Mogul, Toborro, led the Cartel's invasion of the planet Makeb, and Imperial and Republic forces began to arrive on the planet with their own agendas."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boorka the Hutt held considerable power in the Cartel. During the Clone Wars he co-operated with Sev'rance Tann during the early days of the War after he gathered information about the Decimator - a Republic superweapon which was still in development. He was annoyed by the Galactic Republic's trade activity near his territory, and agreed to reveal their secret plan to the Separatists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He lost most of his forces, except for a few mercenaries, for turning against Jabba. Instead, was protected by the Separatists. As a reward, he would give them information about the Decimator, provided that Tann destroyed the Republic Spaceport. After she destroyed the spaceport, Boorka gave her the information she needed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boorka was later killed by Republic forces during the Second Battle of Tatooine. The Republic was deeply encouraged to do so by Jabba the Hutt, after he offered them a 5,000 nova crystal bounty to kill him. During the battle, Jabba assisted the Republic General Echuu Shen-Jon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Empire, the Hutt Cartel had a monopoly of smuggler employment. Although the Galactic Empire did not tolerate lawlessness, they nonetheless were cautious with dealing with the Hutts due to the latter party playing an important role in the Outer Rim's economy, and as such, any direct actions to shut down the smuggler trade required clearance from Imperial High Command beforehand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime before the Rebels had emerged, the cartel took control of a few planets such as Felucia. Jabba also set up a communications relay on Saleucami to keep an eye on the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Jabba formed an alliance with Tyber Zann which was quite successful, until Zann stole his valuable Sith artifact on Felucia. Zann was caught, however, and he gave the artifact to Urai Fen, his second in command. Zann was imprisoned on the planet Kessel. Since the artifact was quite valuable, the Hutt Cartel acquired all assets of the Zann Consortium as compensation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later on, Zann broke out of Kessel and rebuilt his forces. Using his Defilers, the Zann Consortium corrupted many of the Cartel's planets and took control of Saleucami. This conflict lasted until the Ground Battle on Hypori, when Tyber Zann forced Jabba to give up his holdings on Hypori and Saleucami. This left the Cartel crippled but not destroyed, and allowed the Zann Consortium to grow unhindered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
