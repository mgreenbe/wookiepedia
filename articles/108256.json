Having gathered intel regarding a dangerous artifact on the planet, Captain Cassian Andor sent a group of agents to a secret Imperial base. There, they recovered their target and discovered that it was the proto-saber. Their pilot, Athex, began to scan the object in order to send its data to the Alliance. The sword, however, flew out of the agent's hands and into the grasp of Darth Vader, who appeared from the shadows and attacked the rebels. The other agents attempted to give Athex cover fire, but Vader pulled the pilot toward him and stabbed him with his lightsaber. Just before Vader could strike the rest of the rebel operatives down, the reprogrammed security droid K-2SO crashed a shuttle into the building, buying time for the agents to escape. Once in space, the agents transmitted the proto-saber's data to the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The proto-saber first appeared in Star Wars: Secrets of the Empire, a hyper-reality experience created by The Void and ILMxLab that opened in Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida on December 16th, 2017, Disneyland in Anaheim, California on January 5th, 2018, and a limited release in London which ran from December 16th, 2017 to March 10th, 2018."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was first identified on January 31st, 2018 on The Star Wars Show by Star Wars: Secrets of the Empire writer David S.
