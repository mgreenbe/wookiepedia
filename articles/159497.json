Cormin was assigned to work at Akkalo Station, a spaceport that was located on the moon Sulon. In 4 ABY, the spaceport was captured by a group of Rebel Alliance personnel, who wanted to be evacuated from Sulon. Cormin approached the Rebels and told them that he disliked the Empire, then offered to help them. A shuttle eventually arrived to collect the Rebels, but it was badly damaged, so Cormin topped up its coolant while repairs were carried out. However, moments later Imperial reinforcements arrived at the station, so Cormin betrayed the Rebels and assisted the Imperials."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cormin disliked the Empire, but was also a coward and was more concerned with doing the best for himself than joining the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
