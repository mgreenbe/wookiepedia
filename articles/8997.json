For long time it remained away from the central politics in the Galaxy, being a recluse planet, as the inhabitants would say, private. Around the time of the Battle of Yavin, the royalty of the planet was eager to enter a \"Community of Planets\" and saw the Rebellion as a way to fulfill its desires, so, in the first year after the battle, the crown prince of Arrochar offered asylum to the Rebel Alliance, in exchange for Princess Leia Organa's hand in marriage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arrochar was a world located on a small system close to the boundaries of Hutt Space, Mon Calamari and also to the Tion Cluster. The planet had vast volumes of water across its surface, as well as many continents spread over the planet. The planet was very mountainous and had several canyons, with much of the planets buildings and structures built along the mountain sides. The planet was rich with natural resources, with many mining sites spread across the surface, one rich with nickel and iron in which the Rebel Alliance set up a base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arrochar had long been a recluse planet, with its culture dating at least a thousand years at the time of the Galactic Civil War, but on the first year after the Battle of Yavin IV, the planet joined the Rebel Alliance when the prince offered his home planet as a base for the Rebels in exchange for his marriage with Leia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the arrangements for joining the Rebellion were being concluded, the Arrocharians also made plans on joining the Empire, thinking that their people would be given more respect than what they would be by the Alliance.

The Arrocharian soldiers then secured the palace, making a defensive perimeter around the building, and keeping the citizens and rebels away. As the coup was taking place on ground, three Imperial Star Destroyers were preparing an orbital bombardment on both the rebel base and the Arrocharian palace. Mon Mothma ordered the evacuation of all Rebel personnel on the planet, and the activation of the ion cannons that were constructed around the rebel settlement, disabling the Star Destroyers and ensuring the Alliance escape from the planet, leaving the heavily damaged palace, the unmarried prince and the planet behind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arrochar was a planet with a very proud human population, ruled by a traditional monarchy. The Arrocharian culture was rich with many formalities, specially concerning royalty; for example, for a diplomatic meeting aboard a foreign party's space ship, a shuttle would be sent and needed to be escorted by a group of the foreign party to the main ship. For royal marriages, the consort would have to present him or herself to the rulers of the planet and its people in a very pompous ceremony."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet had some distinct military divisions; the Mountain Rangers and Royal Guard.
