It then came under attack from Trandoshans, who took control of the ship before a distress signal could be made. After two weeks without any contact with the Republic, it reappeared in the Corbantis system in the Chaykin Cluster. Due to the large number of clones aboard, several survived until the Republic sent a group of clone commandos, Delta Squad, to investigate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
