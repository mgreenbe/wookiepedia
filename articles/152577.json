These mammals were covered in a thick grey fur coat with black stripes. They were known to have four legs and a large bushy tail. They also had two sets of eyes, ears, a black nose, and several black whiskers. One member of this species was seen by members of an Alanciari expedition which discovered Eshkrene in 2974 BBY. This expedition had been sent by the Lost Tribe of Sith, which had embarked on a maritime exploration program to explore and conquer the rest of Kesh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
