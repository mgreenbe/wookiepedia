Due to the presence of Jugsmuk Station, one of the only true spaceports on the world, the fair attracted both off-world attention and merchants from all over the Wugguh continent. Jugsmuk Fair hosted a large fighting tournament for boars, but it was principally a training fair. Young tuskers would issue their first challenges, while older tuskers would hone their skills and be watchful of the competition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
