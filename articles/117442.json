It was home to shipyards controlled by the Galactic Empire. In 14 BBY, ships stationed at Rothana were deployed by the Imperial Navy to other locations that were considered to be potential targets of Berch Teller and his rebel group. The Empire largely abandoned their shipyards in preparation for the Battle of Jakku near the end of the Galactic Civil War, allowing a group of pro-Imperial sympathizers to attempt to steal the craft a year later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
