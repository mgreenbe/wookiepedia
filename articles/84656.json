The MC95D Star Cruiser was equipped with a hyperdrive which gave it the capability of entering hyperspace at lightspeed, and was equipped with at least eight sublight engines. Two dual engines were located on the port and starboard aft section, while there were four larger engine units at the rear in a square formation. The MC95D Star Cruiser could be disabled when struck by powerful Force lightning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Characteristically of other Mon Calamari ship designs, the MC95D Star Cruiser had a bulbous hull with differing modules, and uniquely had a large tower at the aft mid-section of the vessel. Behind the large tower and its module, there was another smaller command tower. The ship's bridge was located on the forward section near the bow of the vessel. Additionally, the MC95D had two large wings on the port and starboard at the mid-section of the ship, with a large module near the tips of each wing. The MC95D also possessed two smaller wings at the bow of the ship. It was equipped with laser cannons and two hangars on its hull on both sides, also near the bow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a capital ship, the MC95D Star Cruiser had the ability to participate in naval warfare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "MC95D Star Cruisers were in service by the time of the war between the First Order, a military junta that was the spiritual successor of the Old Galactic Empire, and the Resistance, a paramilitary private group with foundations to the dissolved Rebel Alliance and the destroyed New Republic. In 35 ABY, the Alliance and Republic heroes General Lando Calrissian and the Chewbacca were sent on the Millennium Falcon to rally the citizens of the galaxy to aid the Resistance, which traveled to the ancient Sith world of Exegol in an attempt to finally destroy the resurgent Sith Eternal, which allied itself with the First Order, and save the galaxy from their rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Resistance neared defeat and suffered heavy losses during the battle, an enormous 14,000 ship strong citizens' fleet from across the galaxy arrived at Exegol and participated in the climactic Battle of Exegol, including many MC95D Star Cruisers. Reinforced, the combined allied force attacked the Final Order, a massive fleet of planet-killing Xyston-class Star Destroyers that numbered above 1,000 ships. As the Jedi Rey and Ben Solo fought against the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious on the surface at the Sith Citadel, Darth Sidious gained Force power from the Force dyad between Rey and Solo, and unleashed a torrent of powerful Force lightning at the galactic fleet, disabling many vessels. After Rey regained her energy and continued the fight, the lightning dissipated and the fleet regained its power, allowing them to continue fighting. Darth Sidious was then eventually disintegrated by his own power after Rey deflected his lightning, finally killing him. The remaining forces of the Sith Eternal on Exegol were destroyed, and an uprising against the First Order began throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The MC95D Star Cruiser first appeared in the final installment of the Star Wars saga and the sequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker.
