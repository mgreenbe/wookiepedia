During the Imperial Era, Mr Cooper once sent his antique N-1 starfighter to be serviced by the Freemakers, a family of scavengers and starship mechanics who owned a starship repair business called Freemaker Salvage and Repair. Cooper then gave Kordi Freemaker a list of excessive demands including double-steaming his engines, repairing his astromech droid, and washing the heat sinks with pure Kamino water. Meanwhile, in the garage, Kordi's younger brother Rowan Freemaker and their B1-series battle droid Roger tried to hide the starfighter from his mechanic older brother Zander; knowing the latter's reputation as a drag-racer and a starship aficionado."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the Freemakers' best efforts, Zander managed to take the starfighter out for a joyride. When Mr Cooper entered the garage to see his ship, Kordi claimed that it was in the back. After taking Mr Cooper back to reception room, Kordi offered to pay extra attention to his ship with Rowan offering a wax job. After Kordi and Rown returned to the garage, Mr Cooper sighed and wished he had taken the ship to Theed Hangar instead. While the other Freemakers waited for Zander to return, they tried to distract Mr Cooper by pretending to repair his ship.

After reaching the 26th chapter which dealt with the Battle of Kashyyyk, an exasperated Cooper demanded a cup of caf. Seeking to lay out the red carpet, Roger gave him his favourite drink: a cup of motor oil. Cooper found the taste horrible and went to the toilet. Meanwhile the Freemakers managed to recover the N1 starfighter with much difficulty following an encounter with Darth Vader, who took the vessel for a joyride."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Freemakers managed to bring the N-1 starfighter back to their Wheel garage but it was wrecked by Zander's adventure. By that time, Cooper was irate with Roger, who had read him 26 chapters of his autobiography. Upon seeing his wrecked starfighter, Cooper was furious with the Freemakers. Zander claimed that he had taken the ship for a test flight but that the Imperials had stolen it. As compensation, the Freemakers offered him their other ships. Seeking to spite Zander, Cooper settled for Zander's prized Blazemaker starship. He took the ship for a joyride but it exploded because Zander had forgotten to fix the fusion tubes.

Kordi then removed her pot disguise and identified herself as Kordi. Shortly later, the real cleaning droids arrived. However, this caused Cooper to recognize Leia and alert Estoc and her men.
