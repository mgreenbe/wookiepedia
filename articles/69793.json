The Jedi High Council rebuked this and cast the fallen Jedi out of the Jedi Order; however, the rogue Jedi gained followers and formed a new order that eventually became the Sith. Eventually, war broke out between the Jedi and the Sith, during which time the Sith built empires on the backs of slavery, but it would be the Jedi and the Galactic Republic that ultimately achieved victory. Even so, the Jedi and the Sith continued to do battle over the millennia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi came into conflict with the Mandalorians, but the Old Republic continued to fend off the onslaught of the Sith as the Old Republic fell and a dark age began."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith had taken over Coruscant, and later the Jedi liberated the planet.

Due to the Galactic Republic's demilitarization, the Jedi Order fully embraced their responsibilities as peacekeepers and rejected their roles as soldiers. Assisted by the Republic Judicials, the Jedi Knights were responsible for maintaining law and order, namely by mediating conflicts to bring about peaceful solutions between various rival factions and planets, as well as serving as interplanetary law enforcement by pursuing wanted and dangerous criminals, pirates, and smugglers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the war, the galaxy entered into a period of time known as the Great Peace.

Realizing that his fellow Sith Lords destroyed themselves with their greed for power, Bane reformed the order by establishing the Rule of Two, mandating that only two Sith Lords\u2014a master and an apprentice\u2014could exist at any given time, lest they fall prey to infighting. Another reason he created the Rule of Two was so that the Sith could operate in secret, working from the shadows and favoring guile and conspiracy rather than brute force until it would be their time to take revenge, rise again, and subjugate the galaxy. The Sith abandoned their traditional homeworld of Moraband after it was scarred by many wars. Eventually, Darth Bane was killed and was buried in the Valley of the Dark Lords on its surface, but the Rule of Two continued on through his apprentice, Darth Zannah. The Sith stayed in hiding for a thousand years, their survival unknown to the Jedi, as they plotted their revenge against the Jedi Order.
