The city had been laid out in a circular pattern around a central point when Demar was originally settled. After the LMC took control of the world most of the buildings were replaced with more modern structures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The center of the city was dominated by LMC's administrative headquarters buildings, four glittering, metallic towers that had been constructed from the best of the company's products. The towers housed the company's top leadership and Demar's governmental offices. Among the towers in the center of the city were also LMC's Research and Design departments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next layer out from the center was the business and commerce area.

Sandwiched between the industrial areas, in the other two quarters of the outer circle, were large residential areas with apartment complexes of decent quality.
