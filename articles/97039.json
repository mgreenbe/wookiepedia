However, due to the Ka'hren tendency of not recording historical facts, Ni'Shaw was forgotten after the fall of the Unfyr. At that time, Ni'Shaw had only had two prophets, instead of the three traditional prophets to write his teachings in the sacred Jydan Writings and his laws and ethos in the holy Volumes of Truth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Rebellion era, the Unfyr warriors and their culture were rediscovered by Kaltor Naklian, a teacher of Ka'hren history at the University of Timb.
