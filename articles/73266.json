Anybody who slept near Kaernor's Smile would have the same dream of battles and violence, led by two mysterious dark figures who suddenly identify the watching dreamer and redirect their armies against him. The dreamer then had a traumatic awakening. However, as the dreams had been documented for generations as of 32 BBY, some believed that they were caused by a cultural effect of the tale."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Smile was perhaps strong in the dark side.
