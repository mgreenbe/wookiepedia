This recurrent in-joke in George Lucas films and LucasArts computer games originates in Lucas's short student film Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was later reworked into his first theatrical release, THX 1138.

Many elements in Star Wars include 1138 in their names, and it is a frequent easter egg in Star Wars products."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}]}
