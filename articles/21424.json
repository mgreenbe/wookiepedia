One end of the route began with the Ponemah Terminal in the Outer Rim Territories, which the route then passed through the Expansion Region and Mid Rim to connect with the planet Jakku in the Inner Rim. It then passed back out to Adrathorpe in the Expansion Region, then on to the moon Jedha in the Mid Rim before terminating at Ord Mantell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Burke's Trailing was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide, which was written by Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
