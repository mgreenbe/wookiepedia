It became part of the Resistance fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Jotis during their war with the First Order. It was one of four vessels that Resistance forces used on the planet D'Qar evacuated on after they were attacked by the First Order following the destruction of Starkiller Base.It was used also to house supplies and munitions and many other types of equipment during the evacuation. After the Resistance successfully destroyed the First Order Dreadnought Fulminatrix above D'Qar, the Vigil jumped to lightspeed along with the Raddus, the Anodyne and the Ninka.
