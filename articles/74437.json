It was stolen by the Jedi Padawan Caleb Dume while he fled clone troopers who were trying to kill him during the execution of Clone Protocol 66."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the last year of the galaxy-wide conflict known as the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Kasmiri was owned by the Kalleran criminal Janus Kasmir. During that time, a battle broke out on Kaller, Kasmir's homeworld in the Outer Rim Territories. The Confederates were soon defeated, and the two Jedi who had led the Republic's forces, Jedi Master Depa Billaba and her Padawan, Caleb Dume, were introduced to Kasmir before they left to sleep under the stars with their loyal Clone troopers. Kasmir, meanwhile, traveled to Plateau City, where the Kasmiri docked in the city's spaceport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several planetary rotations later, Kasmir found Dume in an alleyway having survived being betrayed by his troopers\u2014though his master had not. Because Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine was secretly a Sith Lord and had transformed the Republic into the First Galactic Empire\u2014with himself as Emperor\u2014and ordered the extermination of the Jedi Order. Kasmir brought Dume to the Kasmiri where he washed and slept for a full day, before receiving a message from the Jedi Temple on the Imperial capital of Coruscant, calling him back to the temple. Kasmir refused to take Dume to the city-planet and told Dume that if he wanted to survive the Imperial troops and bounty hunters hunting him, he needed to learn how to steal and cheat to survive. Just then, two clone troopers arrived to search the Kasmiri for Padawan Dume. Kasmir exited the ship to try and reason with the armored troops, while Dume took Kasmir's advice to heart: He entered the Coruscant subsector into the Kasmiri's navigation computer, blasted away from the spaceport and entered hyperspace. Soon thereafter, as Dume neared Coruscant, he received a message from Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi telling all Jedi who received the message to stay away from Coruscant at all costs; the summons to the temple was a trap. Dume realized he had made a mistake as he exited hyperspace in orbit over Coruscant: He was instantly surrounded by Imperial ARC-170 starfighters that demanded his surrender."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dume didn't respond in the time allotted to him by the clone pilots to surrender, so they opened fire on the Kasmiri. The Kasmiri's shield held under the onslaught, while Dume performed evasive maneuvers and destroyed two of the Imperial fighters. Dume steered the ship clear of the debris and fled into hyperspace\u2014ending up back in Plateau City, because he knew nowhere else to go. After landing, Kasmir found and ran Dume off for stealing his ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months passed and Kasmir continued to utilize the Kasmiri in his criminal work all over Kaller, before he again ran across Dume. Kasmir brought the former Padawan aboard his ship and subsequently hired Dume as his partner in his next job. Kasmir transformed Dume from an obvious Jedi to into more of a bounty hunter before traveling to a Kalleran complex at the dead of night to steal a shipment of valuable IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droids. The duo smuggled several of the droids to the Kasmiri before they were caught by a Kalleran official, Gamut Key. Kasmir turned Dume over to Key in order for Key to claim the bounty placed on all surviving Jedi, and for Kasmir to be able to escape with the IG-RM droids. However, Kasmir had lied: he hadn't betrayed Dume, his friend. Kasmir broke Dume out of prison with one of the thug droids, and the trio ran back to the Kasmiri and quickly took off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, they traveled to another planet where they sold the droids to finance Kasmir's next scheme. As time went by, the criminal duo traveled to many different worlds aboard the Kasmiri, while Grey and Styles, Dume's former clone soldiers, pursued them across the galaxy in order to bring Dume to \"justice.\" Kasmir piloted the Kasmiri to the ocean planet Lahn where Kasmir had arranged a trade: stolen goods for stolen goods. However, Dume and Kasmir had yet to steal their goods, so Dume went to talk with their business partner while Kasmir went to acquire the goods for the exchange. However, as Kasmir loaded the goods onto the Kasmiri, Grey found Kasmir and put him under arrest for harboring Dume, a fugitive of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
