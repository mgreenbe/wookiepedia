Upon ordering, the book could be customized by selecting facial features along with hair style and color, face shape, eye color, and skin tone to create a likeness.

The peace-keeping Jedi Order fought on the Republic's side, while the Confederacy was headed by a member of the Sith, the Jedi's longtime enemies. At some point during the war, Yoda, the Grand Master of the Jedi Order, sensed a disturbance in the Force warning him that the Way of the Warrior, an ancient Palawa prophecy, was about to come to pass. According to that prophecy, a champion representing each faction of a great war would emerge to follow the Way of the Warrior, and one of them would earn a reward that could tilt the war in his or her favor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoda decided to send the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to Bunduki so he could claim the reward in the name of the Order. However, news of the prophecy also reached the ears of the Sith. Count Dooku, Sith Lord and leader of the Confederacy, dispatched his acolyte Asajj Ventress as his own champion. Upon landing on Bunduki in a Y-wing starfighter, Skywalker started to look for Jeter Snahl, a Palawa hermit who guarded the secrets of the prophecy. Shortly thereafter, Dooku's acolyte in turn reached Bunduki and set off in search of Skywalker. The Jedi ended up locating Snahl, but did not have the occasion to ask him about the Way of the Warrior, as Ventress turned up and attacked him. The two champions started dueling keeping their attention away from Snahl. Unbeknownst to the two duelists, there was a third visitor in the hermit's lair. The bounty hunter Cad Bane, who had been hiding in the shadows, managed to sneak in and abduct Snahl, taking him about his starship, the Sleight of Hand. Bane hoped that he could force the hermit to reveal the location of the reward so the bounty hunter could sell it on the black market."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Main characters"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Dooku"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku, Count of Serenno, is a defrocked Jedi Master, a Sith Lord and the head of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, one of the two warring parties in the Clone Wars.

After leaving the Order, the disillusioned Dooku rallied thousands of rogue planets behind him, building the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
