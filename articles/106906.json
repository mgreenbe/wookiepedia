None of them had the technical understanding to back up their practical ability but the Goo brothers were not embarrassed by this. The Goo brothers charged the standard rate for their work, but if properly motivated (not with credits, but dares or bets), could complete their work in a third of the usual time needed. The Goo brothers were also perfectly willing to install illegal ship modifications so long as they viewed the modification as being 'cool'."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Porgo was a playful being and enjoyed social gatherings, especially in dangerous cantinas.
