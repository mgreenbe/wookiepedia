Leaving without his master, Obi-Wan Kenobi's, permission, Anakin arrives at a seemingly abandoned space station. While investigating inside, Anakin finds that all of the clone troopers that were on the station are dead. Eventually, Anakin meets another Jedi Knight, Serra Keto. She tells him that they need to leave, but Anakin insists that they press on. They are attacked by pink blobs with metal on their backs. Anakin strikes at them with his lightsaber, yet they come back to life and start scurrying to another room. The two Jedi follow the pink blobs and find two huge OG-9 homing spider droids, made completely from the blobs. Thinking fast, Anakin uses the Force to break open a hole in the wall, sucking out the spider droids, but also breaking apart the station. As the vacuum of space tears the station to pieces, Anakin attempts to activate the station's emergency ray shields. Keto quickly convinces Anakin not to, as the only hope for destroying the pink blobs is for the station to destroy itself, and them with it. Anakin refuses to give up so easily, however, and the two manage to escape just in time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
