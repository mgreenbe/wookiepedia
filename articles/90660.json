It controlled the Alliance's industrial output, from the few heavy factories on safe worlds and Alliance planets such as Mon Calamari, to the small cottage industry factories hidden throughout the galaxy. The larger factories produced the war materiel that could not be easily acquired, such as starships and artillery, while the smaller ones churned out medpacs, small arms, and clothing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
