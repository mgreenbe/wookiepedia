For good reason: she was classified as a super-predator, with no known carnivore that could take her down. Nevertheless, despite its power, size and the dangers that surrounded its territory, Gorgara was killed in a battle with the Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis after crashing into a wall of rock whilst attempting to throw Kestis from her hair."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Indeed, even with the clawed wingtips, the shockwave-inducing howl and its ability to spit a deadly dark substance, the Jedi severely wounded it in its lair, forcing it to flee. Gorgara counterattacked when Cal Kestis attempted to climb a cliffside to the upper reaches of the ruins of Dathomir. But injured and disoriented by the Jedi who clung to her neck, the chirodactyl hit many rocks in mid-air until she fell to her death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
