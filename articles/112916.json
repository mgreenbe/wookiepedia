Tandankin had been seized by Grand Moff Nivers of the Galactic Empire when the Rogues, flying with \"Red\" callsigns, struck. A stormtrooper with a big gun took out Red Seven's thrusters, forcing an emergency crash landing, where the pilot discovered a landing strip of TIE fighters. He informed Red Leader Wedge Antilles, who shot down a tower to crush the TIEs. Nivers was captured, and the New Republic won the day."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
