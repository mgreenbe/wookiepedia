He was nicknamed \"Bantha\" Burloo. For as far as any neighbor could remember, Burloo had been seen in the company of Miss Mylla, a Falleen who had arrived to Lamaredd at some point before 69 BBY along with several Falleen escorts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Miss Mylla eventually bought an inn and transformed it into Miss Mylla's Saloon, an entertainment locale where customers could enjoy drinks served by scantily-clad waitresses or these women's company in private rooms. Burloo became the bouncer of the Saloon, standing always at a maximum of ten meters from the door, except when he was dealing with any problematic guest. The Saloon was always open, and Burloo appeared to be always on duty. Burloo was also partly responsible for the security of the courtesans \u2014 although most of them could take care of themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At 225 centimeters of height and powerfully built, Burloo was an imposing presence in Lamaredd. He commonly carried with him a club, a combat knife and a slugthrower pistol \u2013 as blasters were uncommon in Lamaredd. He had several skills appropriate to his job, including the ability to intimidate, and was fluent in both Chagri and Basic \u2014 although he could only write Chagri."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Burloo was a mysterious, silent person, rarely speaking unless absolutely necessary. Acting like a statue, he ignored everyone around him except patrons looking for trouble.
