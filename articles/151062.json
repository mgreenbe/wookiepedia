It was situated just outside the borders of Galactic Republic space during the Pius Dea Era, a period of time that lasted between 12,000 BBY and 11,000 BBY, but was considered around 5000 BBY to be a part of the \"civilized galaxy\" that had been widely explored by the Republic. By that time, Ubrikkia had become a part of nearby Hutt Space, which had enveloped the world while expanding Coreward. During the subsequent millennium, however, the borders of the Hutts' territory receded Rimward, and Ubrikkia found itself outside that dominion. The world fell under the control of Darth Revan's Sith Empire between 3959 BBY and 3956 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the first campaigns of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, Ubrikkia lay within the sphere of influence of the Hutt species, a state which had persisted for thousands of years. At the time, the Republic's Thirteenth Sector Army was charged with engaging the military forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in Ubrikkia's vicinity. By 17 BBY, Ubrikkia was situated in the territory controlled by the Galactic Empire. The smuggler Han Solo visited Ubrikkia at some point between 14 BBY and 0 BBY on a mission for a Hutt employer. As part of their invasion of the galaxy, at some point between 26 ABY and 27 ABY, the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong attacked and conquered the Ubrikkia system, and it remained under the control of the invaders by 27 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The population of Ubrikkia around 25 ABY numbered between 500 million and 1 billion.

In a 2009 Suvudu article describing the creation of the map of Hutt Space for The Essential Atlas, Fry related that in 2006, after sketching an outline for the borders of that region with a ballpoint pen and noting the few star systems that previously published sources had placed on maps, he composed a list of worlds that were implied to be in Hutt Space but had not been explicitly depicted as part of the region. During that process, Fry envisioned \"Ubrikkia\" as the name of a world and subsequently added it to the map-in-progress in pencil."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several of the galactic maps included in The Essential Atlas and other sources placed Ubrikkia in grid square Q-10, although both the Appendix section and the later StarWars.com Online Companion to the book erroneously listed its location as square R-11 instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
