Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, two droolers, a man and a woman, operated a kissing booth within the confines of the Meatlump sewer hideout. In exchange for one Meatlump Lump, the droolers would kiss their customers. It was not uncommon for the Meatlump droolers, after kissing a customer, to transmit a viral infection called Meatlump Mono. People who got this infection could go to the Meatlump complaint department, staffed by Gitchur Lumpback, to demand a refund of their Meatlump Lump. However, Lumpback would put customers through an endless bureaucratic process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meatlump droolers were non-player characters in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
