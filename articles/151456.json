The planet was also an exporter of doonium, a metal utilized in the construction of starships. During the Clone Wars, the planet was initially part of the Galactic Republic before seceding to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems. It proceeded to host one of the larger battles of the Clone Wars. After the fall of the Republic, the planet fell under the power of the Galactic Empire. During the Imperial Era, Captain Thrawn suppressed an uprising on Umbara that had been engineered by the shadowy insurgent leader Nevil Cygni."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Umbara was a planet in the Expansion Region that experienced no sunlight on its surface, earning the name \"Shadow World.\" Situated within the occluding Ghost Nebula sector, Umbara was cut off from the rest of the galaxy. This resulted in the development of advanced technologies that far exceeded the galactic standard by the native Umbarans, though it was difficult for non-Umbarans to use the technology. Among these breakthroughs was a gas that stimulated soldiers to fight longer and harder.  Umbaran glass was a type of glass, with Greez Dritus using it to cover a terrarium aboard the Stinger Mantis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Umbara sported a variety of predatory animal and plant life. Umbara also had large doonium reserves, which led to the emergence of a substantial mining and refining sector in its economy. The planet was also known to have several moons including an outermost one. The plant life on Umbara was particularly aggressive, and bioluminescence was a common trait, found in both Zabrak Spines and death's embrace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Umbarans had been members of the Galactic Republic since the government's founding, but, despite their long history of taking part in the galaxy's politics, they always prioritized their homeworld over the galactic government. Despite this and the Umbaran's reputation of being deceitful and employing self-serving schemes, Umbara displayed faultless loyalty to the Republic during the Separatist Crisis, a time of political crisis where thousands of star systems seceded from the Republic and joined Count Dooku's Confederacy of Independent Systems. When the Clone Wars broke out between the Republic and Separatists, Umbara remained a staunchly loyalist world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Umbara was represented by Senator Mee Deechi in the Galactic Senate of the Republic, who aggressively supported for increased military spending. However, following Senator Deechi's assassination, Umbara defected to the Confederacy. In response, the Grand Army of the Republic would launch an invasion of the Shadow People's homeworld. Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi, Saesee Tiin, Anakin Skywalker, and Pong Krell led the assault with the 501st Legion and the 212th Attack Battalion. During the fighting, the clones battled Umbaran mobile heavy cannons, Impeding Assault Tanks, Umbaran hover tanks, and Zenuas 33 Umbaran starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after landing, Anakin Skywalker was called back to Coruscant at Chancellor Palpatine's request. Krell took over the 501st in Anakin's absence. The Umbaran's unique and powerful weaponry and militia made the fighting long and costly for the clones on the planet's surface while battles continued in the skies between the Republic and Separatist fleets. As the fighting progressed, men of the 501st noted and began to grow sour with Krell's casualty-heavy tactics despite their successful results. Shortly after Krell ordered the execution of clone troopers CT-5555 and CT-5597, who had hatched their own plan to take out a Separatist supply ship, Krell betrayed the 501st Legion by telling them that the soldiers of the 212th Attack Battalion were actually Umbarans disguised as clone troopers, Clone Captain CT-7567 realized Krell was working for the Separatists. Led by Rex, the 501st and 212th united to take down Krell, who was stunned by clone trooper CT-5385 and taken into custody. CT-6922, feeling betrayed, killed Krell when Rex began to interrogate Krell, and was himself taken into custody. Republic forces soon reclaimed Umbara."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early months of the Imperial Era, the Galactic Empire dealt with surviving pockets of resistance, including on Umbara. Eventually faced with a debt it had no way to pay to the Empire, Umbara was one of many worlds that surrendered its remaining independence, fully placing the planet under the power of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pirate and insurgent leader Nightswan instigated an uprising on Umbara in order to facilitate the Imperial takeover of Umbara's mining and refining sector. Nightswan thought it would be easier to bribe the Imperial inspectors rather than their Umbaran counterparts. Despite resistance from former Separatist Vulture droids, Captain Thrawn helped secure an Imperial victory by convincing Commander Alfren Cheno, who was part of the task force, to bombard a ground-based transmitter on Umbara's outermost moon despite Admiral Carlou Gendling's orders not to. Gendling was furious with Thrawn, and Cheno eventually retired due to the incident."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point during the Imperial Era, a new pocket of doonium was discovered on Umbara. With the Empire in constant need of new raw materials for its construction projects, the Mining Guild was ruthless in its exploitation of the doonium deposit, and Umbara was one of several planets to suffer such a fate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
