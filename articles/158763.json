The tumor was implanted into the brain of the aspiring Master, who had to endure a period of personal sacrifice as part of the process. The tumor was structured to alter the Shaper's brain structures, and enhance the mnemonic ability of the host. After developing the needed capacity, the tumor enabled the shaper to rapidly integrate the data of a qahsa into memory. Thus educated, the Shaper would later have the vaa-tumor ritually excised."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
