The quakes devastated the surface, and greatly affected the Aleena species that lived there, causing the Galactic Republic to send aid to the world. Among the aid workers were the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, who, after learning about the cause of the quakes, managed to reseal the breach and so end the quakes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Groundquakes occurred regularly on the planet Gorse when its moon Cynda approached during its elliptical orbit. During a quake, parts of the planet's surface violently shook and rocked, often causing damage to buildings. The quakes occurred to release the energy that built up through the gravitational pull of Cynda and the Gorse system's star on Gorse. Droid workers would occasionally fall into the acid baths used by Moonglow Polychemical on Gorse during groundquakes. When Lal Grallik\u2014the manager of Moonglow\u2014was murdered in one of the baths by Count Denetrius Vidian, it was claimed she had accidentally fallen in during a quake. When Vidian later planned to destroy Cynda, the science officers on board the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Ultimatum predicted that the loss of the moon would increase groundquakes on Gorse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a vision on Coruscant, Palpatine thought he felt the ground shake but remembered that it was not real, as it was physically impossible for a quake of that magnitude to occur as Coruscant was an artificially regulated planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Groundquakes first appeared in the Star Wars Legends novel Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu, which was written by L.
