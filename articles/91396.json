The Sith Master Darth Sidious planned on using these children to create an army of Force-sensitive spies. After finding traces of volcanic ash on Bane's starfighter, the Xanadu Blood, and evidence of the bounty hunter's travels to the planet in his fueling records, Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano investigated a facility on Mustafar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious began to rely on the bounty hunter Cad Bane, who was considered to be the most efficient gun-for-hire in the galaxy following the death of renowned Mandalorian Jango Fett. Bane was tasked with stealing a holocron and the Kyber memory crystal, which contained a list of every single Force sensitive infant in the galaxy. Bane was then tasked with taking four children on the list to Sidious's lab on Mustafar, a volcanic mining planet in the Outer Rim. Bane succeeded in taking Zinn Toa, a Nautolan, and Wee Dunn, a Rodian, but was arrested during his attempted kidnapping of the Gungan Roo-Roo Page. Following a harsh interrogation session, the bounty hunter led Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi to his base of operations, though this was a trap set up to ensure his own escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Windu and Kenobi were away on their mission, the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano inspected Bane's starfighter, the Xanadu Blood, which had traces of volcanic ash on its hull. While Bane had wiped his navigation records, he had failed to wipe his fueling records, which revealed the four planets Bane had been to in his recent travels: Glee Anselm, Rodia, Mustafar, and Naboo. Mustafar was the only planet on the list that was volcanic, and the Jedi were previously unaware of his travels there. Skywalker and Tano traveled to Mustafar in the Twilight to investigate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As soon as the Twilight landed on Mustafar, one of the nanny droids watching over the missing children, RO-Z67, reported to Darth Sidious that a ship had landed, and it wasn't Bane. Sidious quickly ordered for the gravity supports to be deactivated and for the children to be evacuated to his secondary facility. Hearing the wails of Wee Dunn, Tano guided Skywalker to the children's chamber using the Force. RO-Z67 deactivated the gravity supports as Darth Sidious commanded, and retrieved the children from their cradles. The droids deactivated the lights as the Jedi cut their way into the room using their lightsabers. While Tano thought the worst when they found two empty cradles, Skywalker still sensed their presence, and the two nanny droids emerged from the shadows, using the children as human shields. The facility was beginning to collapse, and Tano managed to secure Toa, slicing the droid's arms off, while Skywalker retrieved Dunn from RO-Z67 after the droid was forced to let go of the child to cling for its life. With the children safely rescued, the Jedi retreated to the Twilight just as the facility was completely destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker and Tano brought the children back to the Jedi Temple. Since the Jedi Council wasn't sure of the extent of what the children were subjected to on Mustafar, the Council decided to not return the children to their parents and instead raise them in the Temple, at least for the time being."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since the entire base sank into the lava, the Jedi were unaware of Darth Sidious's involvement since any evidence of his involvement was destroyed. As Cad Bane escaped from Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu at Black Stall Station, a follow up interrogation was impossible. Despite this, the children were safe, and the holocron was recovered, with no sign of its information being duplicated. However, Yoda remained concerned about the future of the Jedi Order following the incident."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New technology introduced during production of season two of Star Wars: The Clone Wars made it possible to fit Mustafar and several other planets depicted in \"Children of the Force\" into the timespan of a single episode."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Director Dave Filoni was initially opposed to including Mustafar in the show, since that would mean Skywalker and the other characters would be aware of the planet's existence during Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. George Lucas later persuaded him, clarifying that since Mustafar was a mining planet, it had to have had exports and been an active member of the galactic community."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
