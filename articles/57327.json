She used a Czerka outland rifle in the war, which was passed down to her descendants. Her great-grandson was a male Kaleesh named Qymaen jai Sheelal, who was born during the Huk War between the Kaleesh and the Yam'rii, who invaded Kalee. The young Sheelal grew to hate the Yam'rii, a feeling his father applied by training him to fire a slugthrower with keen precision. Sheelal became such a powerful warrior in the war that his own people revered him as a demigod. He was also frequently partnered in the war with Ronderu lij Kummar, a Kaleesh woman rumoured to be his lover or half-sister."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Kummar was killed in battle against the Yam'rii, Sheelal fell into a state of grief. He took ten wives and fathered thirty sons and daughters with them, taking the name Grievous. He renewed the conflict with the Yam'rii, driving them off Kalee and taking the war to their colony worlds. Multiple times he returned home wounded, and relied on the support of his wives and children to restore him to life. Grievous's actions caused the intervention of the Galactic Republic, who enforced harsh sanctions on Kalee. Grievous returned to his family, but due to the sanctions was forced to watch his wives die of starvation and see his children kidnapped and subjected to immense depravity. A job offer from InterGalactic Banking Clan Chairman San Hill brought him into further provided some relief, but Grievous swore to fight the Yam'rii after discovering they had desecrated a Kaleesh holy sight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hill was furious, and in league with Count Dooku he arranged for Grievous's troop carrier, the Martyr, to crash. Grievous dreamt that he had joined his ancestors amongst the gods, but in actuality had been pulled apart by Hill's medical droids and was recovering in a bacta tank. The Chairman offered Grievous the opportunity to lead the Droid Army of the growing Confederacy of Independent Systems, on the condition that he become a cyborg to preserve his dying body. Grievous only wished for death but took pause when Hill brought his barely surviving wives and children before him, who offered prayers for his health while Grievous ultimately relented. In his new body he adopted an armorplast mask that resembled his father's death mask and became a fearsome general for the Separatists during the Clone Wars, until his demise on the planet Utapau at the hands of the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grievous's family was first mentioned in Labyrinth of Evil,  a 2005 novel by James Luceno, which only mentioned his wives and children."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
