In 1 ABY, an Amorphiian company was selling mini-transmitters outside the Amorphiia system; the purpose of these items was to translate speech into one of 1,000 other languages. Because the mini-transmitter needed assembly, it came with an information cassette to explain the assembly process. This cassette was hosted by an Amorphiian male named Dromboid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
