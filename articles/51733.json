They were 10 meters long by 2 meters wide and could attain speeds of up to 50km/h. Certain variants could also manage an altitude range of up to 500m. In their civilian role of transport, they could hold up to 15 passengers or 50 tons of cargo. They were often militarized for police roles, though, and then fielded a single forward blaster cannon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Floatboats were a popular form of transportation on Abregado-rae and could be seen in a vibrant array of colors on the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
