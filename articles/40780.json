The Opressor was a heavy artillery droid and, during the Galactic Civil War, a number of smugglers re-purposed them to protect their contraband. Similar to its its predecessor, the Oppressor was fitted with two twin blaster cannons, but its artillery ordinance could level anything that was not protected by a deflector shield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
