In 32 BBY, when Amee was six, the trio visited Skywalker in Slave Quarters Row with the children Seek and Melee.

Seek then suggested they all go play a ball game, and Amee left the courtyard with him, Wald and Melee, giggling as they went. Skywalker went on to win the podrace and leave Tatooine. Amee was the only member of her friend group to wear braces, and also wore a brown dress. She had blonde hair, and fair skin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amee was played by Katie Lucas, daughter of director George Lucas, in the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
