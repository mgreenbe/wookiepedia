Accompanied by the Knight's Padawan Kira Carsen and the astromech droid T7-O1, the Jedi discovered that the weapon had been stolen by the Sith Lord Praven, and that Carsen's former master Bela Kiwiiks had been left for dead with the activated Shock Drum at the orders of Praven's master Darth Angral. After defeating Praven in a duel and turning the honorable Sith Pureblood to the light side of the Force, the Knight killed the monstrous Sand demon that had been drawn to the Shock Drum's vibrations and destroyed the weapon before it could destabilize Tatooine's core, saving Master Kiwiiks in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
