While Hera Syndulla and Rex traveled offworld to recruit allies for the liberation of Ezra Bridger's homeworld, Ezra, the other Spectres, and Ryder Azadi's resistance group lured Governor Arihnda Pryce into a trap at the Lothal cliff dwelling. With the help of Hera's reinforcements and a pack of loth-wolves, the rebels succeeded in defeating the Imperial forces and capturing Governor Pryce."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of the next stage of their plan, the Spectres and Lothal rebels used their captive Governor Pryce to gain entry to the \"Dome,\" the center of Imperial power on Lothal.

Following Ezra's departure, the rebels fired up the \"Dome\"'s thrusters and brought the mobile occupation facility into Lothal's upper atmosphere.

The presence of the Empire was not favored by all Lothalites, however, which included Ephraim and Mira Bridger, who had begun conducting underground transmissions with the support of the Governor of the Lothal sector, Ryder Azadi. Within a month, Azadi had been ordered by the Empire to end the transmissions. When Azadi disobeyed and defended the Bridgers, the three were arrested by the Empire. As a result, the Bridgers' son Ezra Bridger was left orphaned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Azadi would be supplanted by one of his rivals, the Lothalian Arihnda Pryce, who after exposing a rebel spy operation on Coruscant, had attained the temporary position of acting governor while she trained for the governorship of Lothal, bringing with her starship manufacturing contracts for Lothal, including the expansion of naval facilities and factories. The Imperialization of Lothal saw a further expansion of mining operations, as beneath the vast grasslands of the planet laid large veins of doonium, a metal that was primarily used for the construction of starships and a secret project. This expansion resulted in the eviction of farmers and expansion of mines and factories, resulting in anti-Imperial sentiments. By 6 BBY,[source?] a bombing attempt of Imperial seismic surveyor droids led to a massacre of peaceful protesters, and culminated in a small-scale skirmish between Imperial forces and a handful of insurgents, eventually resulting in the capture of the group."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Growing dissidence"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 5 BBY,[source?] another rebel group, the Spectres, led by the former Jedi padawan Kanan Jarrus and the Twi'lek Hera Syndulla, and consisting of the droid C1-10P, the Mandalorian Sabine Wren, and the Lasat Garazeb Orrelios, had begun operations on Lothal after successful small-scaled operations against the Empire on other worlds such as Toydaria and Christophsis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their early attacks, including a raid on an Imperial supply convoy, an attack on a Lothal airfield, and a heist in Capital City, which saw them collaborating with the Force-sensitive city orphan Ezra Bridger, resulted in the attention of Imperial Security Bureau agent Alexsandr Kallus. After further operations resulted in the attraction of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and The Grand Inquisitor, and culminated in the capture of Kanan Jarrus and the Spectres broadcasting a call to action to Lothal and nearby planets, the Spectres were able to defeat Imperial forces above Mustafar and rescue their friend with the help of the rebel cell Phoenix Cell and the former Jedi Ahsoka Tano."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Siege of Lothal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The events above Mustafar saw the destruction of the Sovereign, Grand Moff Tarkin's flagship, the death of the Grand Inquisitor, the attention of Darth Vader and the induction of the Spectres into Phoenix Squadron. Whispers of what had occurred above Mustafar eventually reached the citizens of Lothal, which according to Agent Kallus, made some believe that the Empire was weak and vulnerable. Consequently, the Empire's grip on Lothal tightened, imposing a siege in an effort to route out the insurgents. By this time, Emperor Sheev Palpatine, secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, had become interested in Lothal, a secret known by a few, including Lothal's Minister of industry Maketh Tua who sought to exchange that information with Phoenix Group in exchange for safe passage off of Lothal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Phoenix Group's flagship, the Phoenix Home, was destroyed during the siege by Darth Vader and their hideout on Garel City was discovered by the Inquisitorius, Ezra's broadcast would eventually reach his parents, Ephraim and Mira, who were imprisoned with former governor Azadi.

However, Thrawn learned that Kallus was a double agent and tricked him into revealing the location of the Phoenix Squadron's Chopper Base on the planet Atollon. Thrawn's Seventh Fleet then ambushed them, destroying all but a handful of ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 1 BBY,[source?] Imperial mining and industrial production on Lothal had intensified, leaving large areas of the planet polluted and shrouded in smoke.

While Hera and Chopper traveled offworld with the Elite's stolen hyperdrive, the other rebels liberated several indentured Mining Guild workers including Vizago.

Shortly later, Rebel Command authorized Hera to lead a second strike against the TIE Defender factory on Lothal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The second attempt involved an Alliance X-wing squadron but Thrawn destroyed them with ease.

While the mission was not sanctioned by the Rebellion, they all agreed to help Ezra with his endeavor.

Ezra's plan was to capture Pryce and use her to get into Lothal's Imperial Complex or \"Dome,\" the center of Imperial power on Lothal. Knowing that Pryce was seeking to curry favor with Thrawn, Ryder pretended to betray his rebel comrades in return for receiving immunity from imprisonment. Taking the bait, Pryce assembled an assault force of six patrol transports, stormtroopers, jumptroopers and Thrawn's Noghri assassin Rukh to attack the Lothal cliff dwelling."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After strafing the camp, Governor Pryce deployed several of the jumptroopers to apprehend Ezra and the rest of the rebels.

Having trapped the rebels, Governor Pryce ordered her gunships to bombard the ore crawler, wrecking the vehicle and killing at least three of the rebels in the process.

At that moment, Hera returned aboard the Ghost with reinforcements including Rex, Wolffe, Gregor and Kallus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After destroying a gunship, Hera, Hondo, and Melch strafed the Imperial forces from above. While the Ghost tangled with the two remaining gunships, Ezra led Rukh and the stormtroopers down a cave where a pack of loth-wolves lay in wait. The wolves rampaged through the stormtroopers, killing many of the Imperials. Rukh fought with the alpha White Loth-wolf, which threw him down the cliff. With the tables turned on them, the remaining stormtroopers lowered their weapons and surrendered. Pryce was captured by the white loth-wolf, who brought her before the rebels. Conceding defeat, Pryce surrendered and was taken into custody."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, Hera praised Ezra for his victory. In return, Ezra thanked Hera and the rest of the Lothal resistance for their help. Having captured Governor Pryce, the rebels then turned their attention to the second stage of their plan: liberating Lothal from Imperial rule.

With their plan underway, Hera contacted Wolffe, Cikatro Vizago, and Mart Mattin to arrange a pick-up. Before the rebels could depart for the Dome, Rukh resurfaced and stole their patrol transport.

Horrified, Ezra ordered that the deflector shields be raised but Rex reported they were offline.

While the other rebels debated their next action, Ezra with the connivance of Sabine and Chopper managed to escape through a ceiling hatchway and depart in a patrol transport for Thrawn's flagship.

While navigating their way through the Dome's corridors, the rebels came under attack from stormtroopers, death troopers, and Rukh. Following fierce fighting, the rebels managed to obtain their objectives. However, Gregor was shot by an Imperial weapons technician.

An officer than reported to Thrawn that all of the ships in the blockade were \"just gone.\" Thrawn and Ezra then saw the Ghost leading a pod of purrgil towards the Chimaera. The purrgil then latched onto the Chimaera and grabbed Thrawn and several stormtroopers with their tentacles.
