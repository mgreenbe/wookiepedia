Lorrir was a strong supporter of Admiral Lon Isoto, and firmly believed that Baron Colonel Soontir Fel had betrayed the Empire at Brentaal instead of Isoto. Lorrir himself was a mediocre pilot, as demonstrated when Antar Roat's Requiem Squadron trained with Lorrir's forces prior to Krennel's planned assault on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lorrir was placed in command of the Requiem ships, which were ordered to fly on his orders. When Krennel sounded a battle alarm, Roat, who was actually Wedge Antilles, was on Ciutric to bring down the planet's shields to allow the New Republic to defeat the Prince-Admiral knocked Lorrir out cold and took his uniform. This allowed him to delay the launch of Requiem's fighters, giving them an opportunity to avoid the primary battle while trying to knock out the planet's defenses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lorrir was ordered by the clone of Ysanne Isard to pilot her shuttle away from Ciutric, in an effort to deceive Rogue Squadron into believing she was in it. Mimicking the scheme the real Isard used to escape Thyferra, the clone sent relayed communications through the shuttle's comm systems while Lorrir fled the planet. However, Wedge recognized Lorrir's tendency to side-slip his ship to avoid being hit by enemy fire and destroyed the shuttle. Though most of the shuttle was destroyed, the cockpit was intact until the violence of the crash wrecked what was left and was washed away in the Daplona River."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lorrir was described as a tall, slender, angular and very proper man who seemed to have been put together using a model kit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
