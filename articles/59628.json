Haresh was loyal to the Dark Councillor Darth Vowrawn at the time of Darth Baras's plot to assume the position of the Voice of the Emperor and was in charge of the security of Vowrawn's secret Corellian stronghold. During the Battle of Corellia the Sith boldly made their base of operations inside a Republic-aligned corporate building, by having their soldiers put on Republic uniforms and make a show in front of the holocameras, so that Republic enemies had no reason so suspect something had gone awry. When the Emperor's Wrath, a former apprentice of Darth Baras, arrived to protect Darth Vowrawn from Baras' assassins on the orders of Servant Eleven, Haresh didn't believe him and engaged the Wrath in combat, forcing the latter to kill Haresh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
