Aiden was once hired to stun a prominent Black Sun operative on Corellia. Aiden used a dart shooter to fire a dart tipped with poison to knock out the target. Aiden was cannily aware that the client would turn on them, and got off-planet before the clients could kill them. Aiden kept the dart shooter as a constant reminder that some deals were too good to be true. Aiden commented on several entries in the Datalog, such as the LaserHone Talon vibrodagger, dart shooter, Renegade heavy blaster pistol, and the X-45 sniper rifle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
