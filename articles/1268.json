Also known as the year 32,503 After the Tho Yor Arrival (TYA), the year 307 before the Treaty of Coruscant (BTC), the year 2,960 before the Ruusan Reformation, and the year 3,925 before the Great ReSynchronization (BrS), the year included the Battle of Malachor V, where Revan defeated Mandalore the Ultimate in single combat and the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator destroyed most of the Mandalorian forces. From the dying Mandalore, Revan discovered the Mandalorians had been influenced by the Sith, and his search for answers led to his and Malak's corruption at the hands of the Sith Emperor. The year's events had powerful ramifications, as they led to the Jedi Civil War of 3959-3956 BBY and the later Dark Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Events"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Battles"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
