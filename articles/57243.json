In 5 ABY, 8t88 was hired by Jerec to find the location of the Force nexus called the Valley of the Jedi and soon discovered a Holodisc belonging to the late farmer Morgan Katarn. Unable to decipher it himself, the droid arranged a meeting on the planet Nal Hutta's moon of Nar Shaddaa with Morgan's son, the Rebel agent Kyle Katarn, hoping that he would agree to access it. During the meeting at the Rimmer's Rest cantina, Katarn refused and 8t88 ordered several hired thugs to kill him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grentho was a very muscular man and was considered one of the brightest 8t88's thugs.
