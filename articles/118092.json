There were countless scars on his bare skin. He was a famous military engineer in Torukiko, who turned a fleet of catamarans into assault ships and designed and directed a three-year covert operation aimed at driving the Galactic Empire out from the planet Kashyyyk. After Bossk caught and delivered him to the Imperials, Rutallaroo allegedly apologized for his sins and \"voluntarily\" undertook to design equipment for the ever-increasing military contingent who was sent by the Empire to the Kashyyyk. Later he escaped and joined  to a Trandoshan captain, called Doshanalawook, who helped fight against Imperial rule and freed enslaved Wookiees with her spaceship Liswarr. In 3 ABY, Bossk, tracked Liswarr to the Rycep Belt. He entered the ship through its airlock and made his way to the bridge. Rutallaroo and other Wookiees onboard tried to stop Bossk but were all defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
