Its alternately charged barrels delivered devastating amounts of energy, with reasonable accuracy, and high rate of fire, although the weapon was relatively unreliable. To keep this blaster firing, power packs were consumed at a tremendous rate. Theoretically, one could hook it to a larger belt or backpack mounted power-pack to permit longer periods sustained fire, but the cooling system was not up to the task of dissipating the heat produced by prolonged, rapid fire. The hot exhaust plume produced in such instances was a dead giveaway of one's position when fighting enemies with thermal optics, and was sometimes sufficient to burn the firer. Frequent maintenance was required to keep a bi-polar in working condition in the field."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
