Though Rinzler apologized, Novachez was disturbed by the cheating, but decided that people would consider him a \"jerk\" for this."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rinzler remained student council president in the next year and was profiled in the Coruscant Senate Bulletin. Throughout the term, Rinzler continued trying to cheat off Novachez, at one point even attempting a mind trick to influence Novachez to let him look at his homework, but Novachez instead successfully employed a mind trick of his own to convince him that he didn't need to. Novachez later learned that Rinzler was one of the two individuals that had been pulling pranks on him throughout the term, double-teaming against him with known school bully Cronah. At the end of the term, Rinzler was revealed as a cheater and failed the academy middle school's final test, the Labyrinth Trial, when it was revealed that he had finished first only by cheating. For this, he was suspended from the academy indefinitely, but chose to accept a post at Senate Academy, a school specializing in those looking to enter the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the The Padawan Observer end-of-year awards, his fellow students voted him a \"Future Sith Lord.\" As he left for Senate Academy, he told his classmates that this academy was really impressed with his work and that he would think of them when he was ruling the galaxy.
