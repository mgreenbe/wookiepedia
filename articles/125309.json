The Imperial Navy was opposed by the locals, the Svivreni species, who disliked very much the idea of being sieged. This caught the Imperials flat-footed. After several failed attempts against the Svivreni resistance, the Imperial Navy retreated, only to return later and try to occupy Svivren. For a long time, the Imperials were unsuccessful at fighting the local resistance, and their plight was well-known enough to have reached the ears of Samuel Tomas Gillespee, by then living at Ukio."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, after Thrawn's death in the Battle of Bilbringi, the Imperials retreated from Svivren. As a consequence of their fight, the Svivreni decided that their resolution was as good as a military-grade weapon, and decided to be even more determined about rejecting invaders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
