During the Clone Wars, Neeyutnee was elected as the Queen of Naboo, succeeding Queen Jamillia. She relied on insight and experience offered by Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. In 21 BBY, several Separatist droids infiltrated Naboo. After this discovery, Naboo was placed on high alert as it could lead to another invasion. Because of this, Amidala and Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks came to Naboo to aid in the investigation. When they arrived, Neeyutnee and Captain Typho greeted them. Neeyutnee stated that besides the droids that have already been spotted, there weren't any more and pleaded that Amidala convince the Galactic Senate or the Jedi High Council that Naboo was threatened."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, they came to inspect the Tactical droid TR-350 with Amidala asking Neeyutnee if they received any information. Binks spotted an insect coming out of another battle droid and tried to get it as it was only found in the Eastern swamps. Neeyutnee listened as Amidala's protocol droid, C-3PO, interrogated the tactical droid before Binks inadvertently destroyed it during his chase of the insect. They were able to deduce that the droids came out of the Eastern swamps due to the location. They informed the Jedi Council what they discovered and Amidala convinced them to send Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Eventually, it was discovered that the scientist Dr. Nuvo Vindi was trying to revive the Blue Shadow Virus. Vindi was defeated by the Republic and the virus was stopped."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Skirmish on Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, Naboo was again a target for the Separatists with rumors circulating that the Gungans were aiding General Grievous invade the planet.
