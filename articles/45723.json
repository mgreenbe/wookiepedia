One of the overseers of the evacution was Jedi Padawan Thame Cerulian, who helped the Princess escape by lowering her down the wall of a palace with a grappling hook. Despite having the tested breaking point of 550 kilograms, however, the device broke during the attempt. Cerulian later recorded the event in his copy of the Jedi trainee guidebook The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
