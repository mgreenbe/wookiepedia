However, Pikka is distracted, despite having been insistent about being ready on time earlier, paying close attention to her datapad. She reveals to Joss that she's found an error in the station's power systems, one that she feels they should take a look at, despite the fact that their work on the station is over."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Heading to investigate, Joss and Pikka run into station administrator Shai Tennem giving Admiral Pevel Kronara and a party of Jedi a tour of the station. The Adrens are concerned that they'll be roped into joining the tour, despite the power issue being time-sensitive, when Master Nib Assek, on the word of her Padawan Burryaga Agaburry, suggests that the couple be left to their work, allowing them to hurry on. They find the problem inside Conduit 398-GX14, near the entrance to the station's Jedi temple: a miswired resistor hub that could wipe out power to the whole station if not fixed. Joss, the mechanic, moves to implement a fix for the problem with a spanner, but his hand is too large to fit inside it, meaning Pikka has to fix it, despite not being experienced in that kind of work. Her husband reassures her otherwise, and they manage to fix the problem together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After having departed the station, passengers aboard the Galactic Republic cruiser Third Horizon, Pikka writes up an incident report on the wiring issue for Administrator Tennem, sending it off, while Joss befriends a Twi'lek working on the vessel's complement of Longbeams. Suddenly, Admiral Kronara makes an announcement over the intercom: the Third Horizon is diverting because of a distress signal picked up from the Hetzal system, and any passengers with piloting or rescue experience should make themselves known to the crew immediately. The Adrens have no idea what could have happened, since the Republic has been at peace for a long time, but move to volunteer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
