At some point in history, a traveling explorer visited the skies of Endor in a hot air balloon, but crashed on top of the Explorer's Crag. That individual was unable to get down from the peak, and subsequently died in the balloon's basket. Around 3.5 ABY, the native Ewoks found the ballon and the remains of the explorer when the young Wicket W. Warrick flew over the Explorer's Crag with his skin glider."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
