The design was stolen and modified to be a smaller, rifle-sized weapon. It could be mounted on personal battle armor, firing shrapnel flechettes out a stubby double barrel and was particularly effective at close range. While effective, it was very inaccurate and eventually removed from service."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
