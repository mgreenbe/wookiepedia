The Jedi Master Jora Malli acquired the kyber crystal of her lightsaber from an ancient Sith lightspear by the time of the High Republic Era. While the lightspear's original owner instilled rage and pain into the crystal, which made it glow bright blood-red, Malli healed the crystal as an intellectual exercise to see how the process was done. Once the healing process was complete, the kyber crystal was purged of the emotions of the lightspear's original owner and became tightly bound to Malli. By 232 BBY, Jora Malli used the lightspear's crystal as the core of her lightsaber, which featured a bright white blade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
