Originally a tribal leader on Dathomir, Opress was handpicked by the Nightsister Asajj Ventress to become her 'mate' and servant following her grueling tests of Selection, as part of her bid for revenge on her former Master, the Sith Lord Count Dooku. In accordance with their plot against Dooku, Mother Talzin and her Nightsister witches employed their dark magic to grant Opress fearsome abilities, placing him under their control. After murdering his beloved brother Feral in a display of loyalty to Ventress, Opress entered the Clone Wars as a Dark Acolyte, serving as an enforcer in Dooku's Confederacy of Independent Systems. He executed missions against the Galactic Republic at Devaron's Temple of Eedit and on Affa, slaying his first Jedi, Halsey and Knox, in the former campaign.

In what became a three-way lightsaber duel, Opress overcame Ventress's spell of control and also terminated his service to Dooku, further battling his way through Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi before escaping to Dathomir. After learning from Talzin of his kinship to Darth Maul, Opress rescued his weakened brother from the depths of Lotho Minor and brought him home to Dathomir, where Talzin restored his mind and body. Opress then became involved with Maul's pursuit of vengeance on Kenobi, who had cut him in half over a decade ago on Naboo. Although Kenobi escaped from them with the aid of Asajj Ventress during a confrontation at Raydonia, Opress and Maul continued their plans for revenge and galactic domination, turning to the criminal underworld to achieve their needs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 20 BBY, Opress and Maul cut a swath through the Outer Rim Territories, battling through all civilians, bounty hunters, and Jedi Knights who stood in their way.

As part of Maul's plans, Opress became a Sith Lord, but he was forced to become the apprentice\u2014submitting to his brother, the Master\u2014in accordance with the Rule of Two. While attempting to recruit Weequay pirates into their service on Florrum, Opress killed Jedi Master Adi Gallia, though he soon thereafter lost his left arm to Kenobi's blade. Kenobi then chased Opress and Maul off Florrum, destroying their ship and leaving them stranded until they were discovered by members of the Death Watch, a group of Mandalorian warriors led by Pre Vizsla. Opress, Maul, the Mandalorians, and various criminal groups in the galaxy formed an alliance to overthrow the pacifist rulers of the planet Mandalore, though after the operation ended successfully, Vizsla and his men arrested Opress and Maul. After breaking free from prison with Mandalore's incarcerated Prime Minister, Almec, Opress and his brother seized control of Mandalore from Vizsla and his allies. Their rule of Mandalore, however, attracted unwanted attention from Maul's former Master, Darth Sidious, who saw the power of the two Sith brothers as a threat to the dominance of his Sith Order. Sidious traveled to Mandalore and confronted the two brothers, fatally impaling Opress, who in his dying breath expressed regret for never having been Maul's equal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Nightbrother of Dathomir"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Force-sensitive Dathomirian Zabrak male, Savage Opress was born to Kycina, a Nightsister of the planet Dathomir, prior to the year 54 BBY. Opress eventually became the elder to two brothers, Maul and Feral. During infancy, Opress and Maul underwent rituals to be consecrated as initiates in Dathomir's Nightbrothers, a clan of warriors subservient only to the matriarchal Nightsisters, who kept them for breeding and warfare. For their initiation as Nightbrothers, Kycina submerged them both in an oily bath energized with ichor from her Nightsister magic, ceremoniously giving them the Nightbrother tattoos that they would wear for the rest of their lives. However, Opress never learned of his relationship to Maul or even of his existence until years later due to the actions of his mother, who hoped that Maul would grow up free from servitude to Mother Talzin, the leader of the Nightsisters. Kycina concealed Maul's existence from Talzin and secretly gave him away at Dathomir's Blue Desert City before he was a standard year of age, while Opress and Feral were taken from their mother by Talzin. Opress thus grew up only knowing Feral, whom he vowed to watch over in the Nightbrothers' dangerous way of life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Opress and Feral lived on Dathomir, Maul was raised and trained by the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, under whose tutelage he became known as the feared Sith Lord Darth Maul.

Initially part of the same clan, Feral and Opress grew up in the Nightbrothers' village in an isolated region of Dathomir, which was headed by Brother Viscus. Nightsisters often came to the village for the Selection, a ritual series of tests in which the witches claimed servants and mates from the Nightbrothers' nine formidable tribal heads, with death awaiting those who failed the challenges. Because the Nightsisters made periodic, unpredictable visits to their village, Opress and his brethren were forced to stay in fierce fighting shape. Opress often sparred with Feral in his free time, and he learned much about cruelty in his early life. All too aware of the threat of the Nightsisters, he did his best to protect his younger brother from the fearsome witches. By the time of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, both Opress and Feral became tribal heads within the Nightbrother village.

Around 21 BBY, the second year of the war, the Nightbrothers became host to Asajj Ventress, a powerful Nightsister in search of a servant from the Zabrak warriors. Formerly a Confederate-allied Dark Acolyte for the Order of the Sith Lords, Ventress had recently been betrayed by her Master, Count Dooku, and sought to acquire an adept servant for a plot to gain revenge on her ex-Master. Ventress arrived at the Nightbrother village square aboard an Ubrikkian speeder just as Opress was sparring there with Feral. When brought forward by Viscus for Ventress's inspection alongside the other tribal heads, Opress warned Feral against drawing attention to himself, hoping that neither of them would be subjected to the Nightsister's tests. Nevertheless, both brothers were among the six clan leaders who were deemed fit as candidates for the Selection, to Opress's dismay.

Fighting with a curved dagger, Opress was initially Force-pushed against the combat field's railing by Ventress, who also countered the other warriors' moves with considerable ease. Recovering and rejoining the fight, Opress approached the Nightsister, avoiding several spears that she threw at him. When she targeted Feral, Opress abandoned his dagger and quickly went to his younger brother's aid, though their brief distraction was enough for the unimpressed Nightsister to knock them to the ground. As night fell, Opress, Feral, and the only two other remaining Nightbrothers graduated to the next round, in which the four of them were to confront Ventress without the light of the Crucible's torches as part of the Test of Night. The two other warriors fell to Ventress's deadly chain-sickle in quick succession, but Opress managed to pinpoint Ventress's third strike in time to pull himself and Feral out of harm's way. Quickly bringing his dagger up in the direction of the Nightsister, Opress ordered her to show herself, earning a portion of Ventress's respect.

Intervening on his brother's behalf, Opress bodily threw Ventress against an adjacent pillar. Placing himself between the Nightsister and the weakened Feral, Opress fended off her attacks, refusing to let harm come to his brother. He ultimately requested that she spare his brother and instead take him as her servant. After Feral reluctantly obeyed her order to leave them, Ventress continued her fight with Opress in hand-to-hand combat. During his subsequent fight with Ventress, Opress drew upon his rage on several occasions and attempted to use his brute strength to fatally wound her in the head. However, it was Opress who took a beating, and he finally surrendered his life and pledged himself to the Nightsister when triumphed over. In spite of his defeat, Ventress was nevertheless impressed by Opress's combat style and fighting prowess, and she took him as her servant and mate. The next morning, Ventress took Opress away from the village aboard her Ubrikkian speeder.

In an ancient ceremony heavily rooted in the dark side, Talzin and a full coven of her spellcasters bound together, channeling spirit ichor and the rawest hatred to make Opress an avatar of primal anger for Ventress's plot for vengeance. Subjected to the dark magicks of the Fanged God, Opress was granted greater height and size, a full crown of vestigial horns, and fearsome power: he gained even more brutality, an unmatched ferocity, and heightened physical potential and Force abilities.

For all the care and protection that he had afforded Feral up to that point, he derided his brother's pleas for mercy and strangled him in a single stroke in a monstrous display of cruelty. Thus assured of her agent's allegiance, Ventress gave Opress a short first lesson in the practice of the dark side\u2014to draw power from hate and never sympathize with the enemy, beginning what was to be an abusive method of teaching for the Nightbrother. For weaponry, Talzin conjured an enchanted pike from raw spirit ichor for Opress, who also employed his newly granted bulk to heft an entire suit of full-body plate armor, including the cuffs and shoulder armor reserved for those who had survived the Crucible."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Apprentice to the Sith"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His life committed to the dark side, Opress was to be gifted to Count Dooku, becoming a Dark Acolyte for Dooku's Confederacy and replacing Ventress as the Sith Lord's personal assassin.

Talzin and fellow Nightsisters Karis and Talia escorted Opress aboard a Sheathipede-class transport shuttle to Dooku's homeworld of Serenno, where the Count maintained a palace residence. Upon being introduced to Dooku, Opress bowed to his new Master as a gesture of loyalty, though the Nightsisters' sorcery would ensure that this allegiance would not be permanent. As Dooku required proof of his new agent's abilities before any training could commence, Opress was sent on his first assignment: to seize control of the Temple of Eedit on the jungle planet Devaron. Because the temple served as a military outpost for the Republic and the Jedi Order, the base's capture would enable the Confederacy to conquer that area of the galaxy. Dispatched alone to the Devaron system aboard Dooku's personal Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop complete with an FA-4 pilot droid, Opress proceeded to the Temple of Eedit, where a battle for control of the outpost was already raging between Republic and Confederate forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon landing on the path leading to the temple, Opress pushed through the B1 and B2 infantry droids of the Separatist Droid Army, focusing only on the temple's defenders: a clone trooper detachment from the Grand Army of the Republic led by Jedi Master Halsey and his Padawan, Knox.

There, he was to confront the Hutt merchant Noggox, an industrialist independent of the Hutt Grand Council who sponsored Republic business, but was content to watch the war between the Republic and the Confederacy from a distance. As two of his Republic-allied freighters had recently been raided by the pirate Dool Pundar en route to the Fondor Shipyards, Noggox enlisted the help of a Jedi Padawan named Nuru Kungurama, who claimed that the pirates were being backed by the Confederacy and had been dispatched by the Jedi High Council to escort Noggox's other freighters to Fondor. Opress was sent to remove Noggox from action before Kungurama could reach Affa. Once he landed at the main hangar of Noggox's fortress, Opress allowed himself to be captured and deprived of his pike by the Hutt's bodyguards. Brought directly to Noggox in chains for questioning, Opress warned the merchant that a Jedi was approaching, though the Hutt mistook his words to mean that the Jedi posed a danger.

The victims of his massacre were left behind for discovery by Kungurama and his clone trooper unit, Breakout Squad. Having become brutally adept in the use of his enchanted halberd, Opress upgraded his preferred choice of combat weaponry to a double-bladed lightsaber, for which he received training from Dooku. In the throne room of the Count's palace, Opress engaged in his first practice session of lightsaber combat with Dooku, a highly accomplished swordsman who owed his reputation to his previous career as a Jedi Master. Opress was the first to attack, swinging his lightsaber at Dooku with powerful strikes, but his Master easily avoided his attacks. Opress was disarmed of his lightsaber and briefly Force-choked, and Dooku then brought both his and Opress's lightsabers around his apprentice's throat, ending the duel.

Drawing upon his apprentice's hate, Dooku blasted him with Force lightning until Opress gained a crude proficiency of the Force and was able to lift the blocks a greater distance.

Departing from Serenno, Opress traveled to Katuunko's palace on Toydaria aboard Dooku's solar sailer. Upon touching down at the palace's landing platform, Opress swiftly defeated the Toydarian royal guards who came to confront him, slaying two of them with his lightsaber and Force-choking a third guard. He continued into the palace, cutting through the main entrance door and effortlessly killing the six remaining guards between him and Katuunko, who refused to be intimidated by an assassin.

Opress crushed Skywalker's handhold beneath his boot and quickly used his lightsaber to disable the repulsorpod, which fell directly onto the two winded Jedi. Skywalker and Kenobi used the Force to prevent the pod from flattening them, but this left them momentarily distracted. Not wasting any time, Opress grabbed Katuunko's body and dragged it onto the solar sailer. Before lifting off from the palace, he reached out with a massive Force-push to send the Jedi's T-6 shuttle off the landing platform.

A lightsaber duel ensued, with Opress assisting Ventress in challenging Dooku. When Ventress was knocked aside by the Sith Lord, Opress took over, relentlessly battering away at Dooku's defenses. He won a brief advantage over Dooku by disarming him and knocking him against a wall. Yet his victory was short-lived, as Dooku recovered in time to evade his advances and repelled him with Force lightning, for which the Nightbrother had no defense.
