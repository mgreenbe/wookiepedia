This field acted to scramble the bio-signature and energy emissions of the wearer, obscuring thermal, infrared, and sonic signatures from detection. This essentially rendered the wearer invisible on active and passive sensors and scanners, as well as inaudible to both organics and machines. The No-Show was not without its drawbacks, however, and suffered from double-blindness; the field projected by the No-show interfered with any scanners, sensors, or communication devices held by the wearer - something potentially fatal if the wearer wasn't careful."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Developed by the Alliance and manufactured by Audio Performance Incorporated, the No-Show was highly sought after by Infiltrators and thieves, so much so that several criminal elements of the galaxy learned to build their own versions of the device during the years of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
