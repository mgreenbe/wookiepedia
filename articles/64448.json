It was led by the Lightning Battalion under the command of General Nim and Colonel Abal Karda. After months of vicious fighting, during which they witnessed the Icarii's unusual ability to remain alive after dismemberment, Lightning Battalion employed a horrific biological agent to eradicate the Icarii.
