If a ship traveled through the area the generator was affecting, the hyperenergy spheres would quickly overwhelm its deflector shield and destroy the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While effective, the flaw in the technology was that the hyperenergy spheres had a life span of only minutes and would dissipate quickly.
