On the other hand, the 2009 guide The New Jedi Order Sourcebook stated that Vortex was invaded by the Yuuzhan Vong by the time of Balance Point. The 2009 guide The Essential Atlas eventually combined those facts in its second map of the Yuuzhan Vong War, revealing that New Republic forces from Adumar attacked the Yuuzhan Vong at Vortex, located in the neighbourhood of Bilbringi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
