It was constructed north of a wide forest that grew up to cover the eastern side, and south of a river that flowed from the northwest down to the western edge of the base. The command center of the base was surrounded by four farms, a food processing center, and a clump of trees. A ring of buildings was built around the command center, in clockwise order there was a prefab shelter, a carbon processing center, a troop center, a spaceport, another prefab shelter, a power core, a mech factory, four more prefab shelters, and an animal nursery. Two sentry posts were built inside the base, one southwest of the base's center and another in the northeast."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The portions of the base that were not protected by the treeline were covered by walls partially built by the Wookiee Shoran. To the north of the base five sentry posts were built to alert the Wookiees of any incoming attacks from the Trade Federation, who had a base north of the river. The Wookiee base was significantly expanded on the recommendations of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, an advisor to the Wookiees. The workers completed the walls and built a fortress, along with an airbase and a heavy weapons factory. Jinn also recommended that the Wookiees construct a War Center to research upgrades to their military arsenal. The base was abundant in natural resources, with various muja fruit bushes growing in the center, and deposits of nova crystals and ore. Several nerfs also lived in the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base was constructed between 39 BBY and 36 BBY, during the war for Alaris Prime fought between the Wookiee colonists and the Trade Federation. The Wookiees positioned themselves near the Trade Federation's main base in preparation to permanently remove them from the moon in the Battle for Alaris Prime. The Wookiee leader Chewbacca was advised by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn to destroy the Trade Federation's fortress. The initial Wookiees at the base included Chewbacca, Shoran, eight workers, seven bowcaster troopers, two HummBike speeders, and two dragon troopers. Jinn informed the Wookiees that the Jedi Council had given permission for him to participate in the battle personally if the Wookiees built a fortress. Chewbacca set the workers to gather resources in order to upgrade their level of technology, allowing them to build a fortress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chewbacca's father, Attichitcuk, also arrived at the base to participate in the battle. A group of battle droids, including a droideka and five beetle droids, were sent by the Trade Federation commander SRAM-13 to attack the outer sentry posts. Jinn instructed the workers to complete the gaps in the walls built by Shoran, reminding them to build gates to avoid trapping themselves in their own base. The Wookiees gathered enough resources to improve their technological level and construct a fortress, after which Jinn arrived at the base. At that point SRAM-13 sent a trio of light droid starfighters to scout out the base. Jinn warned the Wookiees to prepare for an attack, but as the droids turned out to be mere scouts the base was kept safe. The Jedi told the Wookiees to prepare anti-air defenses, including turrets and an airbase, with which they could build starfighters. The Wookiees also built a heavy weapons factory and gathered an army of ten Agr starfighters, three Heavy Blade bombers, three energy pummels, five sentinel mechs, and five heavy bowcaster troopers. Along with the Wookiee leadership and Jinn the Wookiees stormed the Trade Federation base and destroyed the fortress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base was first mentioned in Prima Games' strategy guide for the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, before appearing in the game on its release. The base appears in the seventh and final level of the tutorial campaign, entitled \"The Battle for Alaris Prime.\" In the level the player has control of the layout of their base and which buildings to construct. The Prima guide gives a suggestion for the player to expand the boundaries of the base by destroying the existing walls and building new ones further out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
