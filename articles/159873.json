At fifteen she stowed away aboard a smuggling vessel and secured her place in the crew by defeating the Nikto first mate in a knife fight. Over the next few years, Sepen had moved from one fringe crew to another, and by 25 ABY she was a junior tactician aboard Urias Xhaxin's pirate frigate, the Free Lance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Free Lance was attacked by the Yuuzhan Vong, Sepen decided that the invaders had to be stopped, reasoning that the situation offered a stark choice between slavery or death and fighting back.
