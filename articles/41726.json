The two commanded the Blockade of Kashyyyk and patrolled the Emperor Palpatine Museum on Naboo. Following the destruction of the Emperor Palpatine Museum, Durpin and Plumestriker were reassigned to Echo Base on the planet Hoth as a punishment posting. These postings brought Durpin and Plumestriker into conflict with the Freemakers, a group of scavengers who were gathering the pieces of the Kyber Saber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Freemakers joined the Rebel Alliance, Durpin and Plumestriker were given command of a Gozanti-class cruiser. The Freemakers managed to escape them by claiming they had Gamorrean flu, causing Durpin and Plumestriker much embarrassment. Later, the two led an operation on Qalydon to acquire kyber crystals for the Empire but were outsmarted by the Freemakers. As punishment, they were reassigned to the desert world of Jakku.

He had an aide named Plumestriker, who was determined to serve the Galactic Empire. Lieutenant Commander Durpin commanded the Imperial blockade above Kashyyyk. The Empire's Trandoshan proxies maintained order on the planet and subjugated the Wookiees. To ensure compliance with the Wookiee Chief Attabura, the Trandoshans took his son Tantarra hostage and imprisoned him in an island fortress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the scavenging family known as the Freemakers sneaked past the Imperial blockade in the freighter StarScavenger, Durpin and Plumestriker ordered their men to pretend the incursion never happened while they traveled to Kashyyyk to deal with the intruders. Upon landing at the iron fortress, Durpin and Plumestriker asked the Trandoshans if they had seen anything suspicious. When the Trandoshans reported that a group of humans had delivered a wroshyr wood panel, Durpin sounded the alarm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Freemakers managed to free Tantarra and steal the third Kyber Saber crystal. The Wookiees then attacked and overwhelmed the Trandoshan forces. Later, Durpin and Plumestriker managed to corner Zander and Rowan Freemaker at the StarScavenger. When Plumestriker complimented Durpin for saying that finding the ship would lead to the rebels, Durpin denied saying that. Durpin was about to make a speech about what the Imperials would do with their prisoners when Kordi Freemaker sneaked up behind them and knocked out the two officers with her newly acquired wroshyr wood panel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Durpin and Plumestriker reported the rebel incursion to Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. Durpin was reprimanded by the two Sith Lords for his incompetence. When he tried to deflect some of the blame onto his aide, Plumestriker, the Emperor instead blamed the Trandoshans. He then promoted Durpin to General and gave him more men and resources. While Durpin was despondent, Plumestriker was jubilant."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Stunt on Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his promotion, General Durpin and the-now Commander Plumestriker were posted to a plush posting at the Emperor Palpatine Museum in Theed, Naboo's capital. The Museum had once been the Theed Royal Palace but had now been repurposed as a museum dedicated to glorifying Palpatine. The two officers were assigned with guarding the Museum's exhibits. While chatting about the Museum's impregnability, the two passed a disguised Zander who was wheeling the B1-series battle droid Roger, who was disguised as an exhibit. The two failed to recognize Zander due to his mustache."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that night, the two Generals settled down to play a game of holochess. Unknown to them, Roger took the opportunity to break out of his exhibit and let the Freemakers inside. While Plumestriker was alarmed by the sound of broken glass, Durpin was too engrossed with the game to bother. However, the two were stirred out of their complacency when Rowan accidentally triggered a chain reaction that caused an N-1 starfighter exhibit to collapse. While Durpin was dismissive of the problem, Plumestriker alerted the stormtroopers and ordered them to search for intruders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Generals and their stormtroopers soon cornered Zander, Roger, and Kordi at the Theed Hangar. While Durpin wanted to let off the intruders as mischievous kids, Plumestriker recognized them from their earlier encounter on Kashyyyk. In deference to Durpin, they decided to skip through the paperwork and execute the intruders on the spot. However, they were stopped by Rowan, who had disguised himself as Emperor Palpatine. Rowan chastised the Generals for harming his \"generous\" donors. Durpin begged for forgiveness and offered to be demoted to Ensign, an offer which the fake Emperor accepted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Durpin, Plumestriker, and their men had left, the Freemakers discovered the sixth Kyber Saber crystal but were attacked by the Sith agent Naare and the bounty hunter Dengar. During the ensuing duel, Naare stole the sixth crystal but the Freemakers escaped by toppling the N-1 starfighter, which triggered an explosion that demolish the Museum.

The two were reassigned to the former rebel base Echo Base on the frozen planet Hoth. While Plumestriker regarded this as a hardship posting and sought to regain the Empire's favor, Durpin regarded the reassignment as a refuge from the galaxy's problems. When the Freemakers arrived on an improvised snowspeeder sledge seeking refuge, Durpin tried to drive them away but the Freemakers rode their sledge inside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Plumestriker wanted to alert Imperial High Command to the presence of the intruders, Durpin was determined to let nothing disturb their quiet exile. He attempted to drive out the Freemakers with his blaster but was bitten by a baby wampa they had befriended. After sending a distress transmission, Plumestriker tried to help Durpin by shooting at the wampa. However, this angered the mother wampa, who attacked and chased the two Imperial officers out. Later, a fleeing Durpin and Plumestriker ran over Naare while fleeing from the wampas."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Manning the blockade"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the incident on Hoth the two were promoted to Commander and Lieutenant respectively, and stationed aboard a Gozanti-class cruiser blockading a planet where the rebel agents Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca were stranded. Since their ship, the Millennium Falcon, lacked a fuel intermixer, they were unable to travel. The Imperial cruiser soon intercepted the Freemakers' starship StarScavenger. After the Imperials boarded the ship, the Freemakers pretended to be dying from the Gamorrean flu. Durpin fell for their ruse, but Plumestriker realized that humans could not contract the Gamorrean flu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plumestriker had the Freemakers thrown into a brig. However, Durpin began to feel sick and asked Plumestriker to check if he had a fever. While Durpin was preoccupied, the Freemakers escaped with the help of Roger, stole the cruiser's fuel intermixer, and escaped aboard the StarScavenger. Instead of giving chase, Durpin fretted about accidentally contracting the Gamorrean flu and insisted that Plumestriker check his glands. With the Imperials preoccupied, the Freemakers managed to rendezvous with Lando and Chewbacca and repair the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Raid on Qalydon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hoping to regain Darth Vader's favor following the Gamorrean flu incident, Durpin and Plumestriker led a detachment of stormtroopers aboard a Gozanti-class cruiser to the planet Qalydon to collect kyber crystals for the second Death Star. Durpin's forces landed at a Lurmen village and rounded up the villagers as well as Zander, Kordi, and Roger. Durpin ordered his men to seize the Lurmen villagers' kyber crystal necklaces. For this, he was insulted by the villager Elan, who called him a \"scum weasel.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rowan and the Lurmen girl Maynar then counter-attacked with the StarScavenger. The Imperials retreated aboard their Gozanti cruiser with the stolen crystals. However, Rowan managed to damage their rear stabilizer and hyperdrive, causing them to crash-land in the nearby mountains.

Kordi exploited Durpin's fear of Lord Vader but Plumestriker was suspicious. Zander managed to repair the Gozanti cruiser's damaged hyperdrive and rear stabilizer. When the Imperial hunter droid M-OC attacked Rowan, Maynar fled the site with the kyber crystals. Despite Kordi's efforts to distract them, Plumestriker spotted Maynar and the crystals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Durpin and Plumestriker chased Maynar and cornered her near some boulders. Durpin ordered Maynar to hand over the crystals. However, Kordi and Zander tackled the two Imperials to the ground. Though Rowan managed to defeat M-OC and entomb him in machinery, Durpin and Plumestriker ambushed Rowan and Maynar and recovered the kyber crystals. The Freemakers gave chase but the Imperials escaped into hyperspace aboard their Gozanti cruiser, which Zander had accidentally repaired."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Durpin and Plumestriker exited hyperspace in the Marriten system, hoping to deliver the crystals to Vader in return for a plush posting on Coruscant. Despite this, Rowan managed to track the crystals to the Marriten system using the Force. After the StarScavenger disabled their cruiser's rear engines, the Freemakers recovered the kyber crystals.

Durpin was also demoted to Sub-Ensign while Plumestriker was made Ensign. Both men hated their Jakku posting but Durpin had no ambitions of getting promoted since he did not want the responsibility that entailed. By contrast, Plumestriker wanted to regain favor with the Empire. During a routine patrol, Plumestriker was hit by an energy matrix activator from the crashed Arrowhead, which had exploded after sinking into quick sand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Zander and Roger foolishly tried to reclaim the activator, the two successfully captured Zander and the battle droid. Though Plumestriker was hopeful of using the captured fugitives to lead them to Rowan, Durpin did not want to get promoted since he did not want to be Force choked by Lord Vader. The two argued into the night. That night, Kordi disguised herself as Darth Vader and approached the Imperial camp. Plumestriker saw through her disguise and held her at gunpoint. However, this distraction allowed the Freemakers' rebel friend Lieutenant Valeria to knock the Imperials out from behind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After finding their happabore too slow, the Freemakers fled through the desert on the shuttle Mini Scavenger. Plumestriker and a reluctant Durpin gave chase in an AT-ST walker. Durpin's unwillingness to get promoted led him to fight with Plumestriker for the controls. Valeria took on the AT-ST while Zander also attacked the Imperials' walker with the Mini Scavenger. This bought Rowan enough time to fit the energy matrix activator onto the Arrowhead, completing the powerful vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Arrowhead then used its Embersteel Blade to slice the AT-ST in half. Durpin and Plumestriker survived but were unable to stop the Freemakers from escaping offworld.

Durpin then responded that Plumestriker would one day see his point."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Durpin was a complacent and disillusioned Imperial officer who was tired of pomp and ceremony. Durpin often tried to hide his incompetence by lying or trying to shift responsibility. He had little interest in his duties as an Imperial officer and was more interested in recreational activities like playing holochess. On one occasion, he was prepared to execute the Freemakers without carrying out paperwork. Durpin was fooled by Rowan Freemaker's disguise as Emperor Palpatine. Despite the cold and barrenness of Hoth, he regarded it as a refuge from the galaxy's problems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Durpin was also gullible and fell for the Freemakers' ruse that they had contracted the Gamorrean flu. He panicked and believed that he had also contracted the disease. This prevented him from responding to the Freemakers' escape. Durpin was also thin-skinned and was upset when the Lurmen villager Elan called him a \"scum weasel\", overlooking the fact that his forces had raided their village. Durpin was also tricked by Kordi and Zander's disguises during a mission to recover the stolen kyber crystals. In addition, Durpin was also willing to lie in order to cover up his failings. During the Qalydon mission, Durpin claimed they had been attacked by a thousand rebels when in fact they had only been attacked by the StarScavenger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Durpin hated being reassigned to Jakku, which was a punishment posting for him and Plumestriker's repeated failures.
