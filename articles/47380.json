It was the location of the Senate Building, the Avenue of the Core Founders, the Imperial Executive Building, and the Jedi Temple which, after the creation of the Galactic Empire, was rechristened as the Imperial Palace. Other notable locations included 500 Republica, the headquarters of the Naval Intelligence Agency, and the COMPNOR arcology, which contained the central offices of the Imperial Security Bureau."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the Galactic Republic, the central government district was generally referred to as the Senate District or the Legislative District, the focal point of which was the Senate Building that served as the meeting place of the Galactic Senate. In front of the Senate was Senate Plaza, whose Avenue of the Core Founders bore statues dedicated to the founding members of the Republic. Located nearby was the Senate Office Building, where the Supreme Chancellor maintained a suite of offices, 500 Republica, a prestigious and exclusive residential tower where Sheev Palpatine maintained an apartment during his service as senator of Naboo, and the Jedi Temple, which served as the home of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the fall of the Republic and the establishment of the Galactic Empire, the Jedi Temple was converted into the Imperial Palace and the term \"Federal District\" became the primary appellation of the central government district. Informally, however, the Federal District was referred to by Coruscanti as the \"Core of Coruscant\" or \"Core Square.\" The area surrounding the former Jedi Temple became a focal point of the so-called \"supreme triangle\" of the newly-christened Imperial Palace, together with the Naval Intelligence headquarters and the COMPNOR arcology that housed the Central Offices of the Imperial Security Bureau. It was also within the Federal District that the Imperial Military constructed a combined headquarters for the Imperial Army and the Imperial Navy. The district was covered with towering skyscrapers and its skies were kept clear via weather control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the days of the Republic, the term \"Senate District\" was synonymous with the business and power of the galactic government. The Clone Wars brought about great changes to the district, as it saw a massive build-up of new structures to house the increase in government agencies that were created in support of the Republic's war effort. Near the beginning of the war, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala traveled to Ziro's Palace in the district to arrest the Hutt for his role in the kidnapping of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's son Rotta. In 21 BBY, the Senate District was the site of a terrorist bombing and a rampage by a freed Zillo Beast from the planet Malastare."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the execution of Order 66, Imperial forces secured the Jedi Temple under the command of the newly-christened Sith Lord Darth Vader. The Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, publicly known as Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine, subsequently confiscated the Temple and refurbished the structure as the Imperial Palace, the seat of the Galactic Empire. Along with other government structures that were constructed around it, the palace became the focal point of the Federal District as part of the \"supreme triangle.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the turning point of the Galactic Civil War between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, under the direction of Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, the Imperial Security Bureau seized control of Coruscant in an effort to put down the revolution that had erupted on the planet. As the Empire was driven back across the galaxy by the New Republic, Amedda was placed under house arrest by order of Gallius Rax, the self-styled Counselor to the Empire, while Imperial forces continued to lose ground and struggled to hold onto the upper levels of the Federal District. With the defeat of the Imperial remnants at the Battle of Jakku, Amedda signed the Galactic Concordance, formally marking the surrender of the Galactic Empire and replacing it on Coruscant with a provisional government that was overseen by the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
