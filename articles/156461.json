Although the battle droids left the fisherman alone, the explosions during the invasion scared the fish away, leaving the man with nothing to do. During the battle, the Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, while escorting the Queen of Naboo during her escape from the planet, attempted to cross the river in order the reach a set of bridge controls. He jumped into the fisherman's boat to cross the river and held a short conversation with him before continuing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time Queen Amidala returned to Naboo and fought to recapture Theed, the fisherman's boat had been sunk, and his body was seen in a nearby house."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This fisherman appears in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game, the 1999 video game adaptation of the Episode I movie.
