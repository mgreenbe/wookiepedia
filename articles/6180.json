The system launched hyperdrive pods with no internal controls between the relay stations. The network's hub was located on the space station. The system was abandoned by the Amaxines after contact with the Drengir, sentient carnivorous plants who infiltrated the station. Much later, during the High Republic Era, the system was discovered in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster. Jedi Padawan Reath Silas destroyed the system by launching the remaining pods into deep space to prevent the Drengir and Nihil from making use of it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
