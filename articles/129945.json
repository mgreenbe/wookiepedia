Spukami were unusually intelligent, though non-sentient, and were popular as pets. They could be taught simple commands, but, either out of boredom or stubbornness, only obeyed them about two-thirds of the time. They were adept at catching and killing small vermin with their sharp teeth and claws, but when bored, often chewed at whatever bits of plasteel or cloth were at hand. The spukamas was a solitary creature and would lash out violently at any other spukamas it encountered in its territory; pet owners could only keep one at a time.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
