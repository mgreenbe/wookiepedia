He triggered the emergency lock-down in the Republic Executive Building, which allowed Bane to execute the rest of his plan. Robonino was also able to single-handedly defeat Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker by grabbing him from behind and electrocuting him while the Jedi fought Shahan Alama and Aurra Sing.

In the ensuing skirmish, Robonino briefly battled and defeated Fisto, but was apparently swallowed by a Kwazel Maw.

They targeted many senators whose vote was to oppose the bill, which brought the bill a greater chance of being approved. In a bar at Coruscant, Count Dooku would again send the two bounty hunters to seize Padm\u00e9 Amidala to prevent her from influencing other senators' thoughts. However, they missed the primary target, and attacked Senator Bail Organa instead. Nonetheless, the scheme failed, and they were subsequently arrested, with the senator from Naboo still possessing the chance to turn the tide against the bill."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Robonino was an expert saboteur, and skilled at handling explosives, allowing him to battle Jedi such as Anakin Skywalker and Kit Fisto and come out victorious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Robonino's look was based on an unused prequel Jedi design by Iain McCaig.
