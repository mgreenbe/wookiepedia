From there, he supplied Okeefe and other smugglers for a tidy profit.

Tastefully decorated, it had polarized windows to provide privacy for its clients. Nasrabi decorated the casino with a number of globes hanging from the ceiling filled with live fish, a nod to his own culture. Nasbari was known to run the casino well, gaining a reputation for a clean, honest establishment. The casino provided games of all sorts, including sabacc and Trin sticks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY Okeefe made a run out to Bespin to pick up some tibanna from Nasrabi. He was pleased to help her out; especially since a run a year before to Bonadan had gone wrong. However, Major Birket of the Imperial Security Bureau was aware of the deal and set bounty hunters on Okeefe's trail. Okeefe eventually managed to beat them, and made the transfer with Nasrabi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is likely Mussat was related to Amira Nasrabi, the Mon Calamari proprietor of the Illuminated Aquean casino in the Vaynai Archipelago."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
