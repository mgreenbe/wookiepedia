Its date of first deployment relative to the AT-RCT is unknown. On either side of the cockpit were power cells and a missile launcher. In the front of the cockpit was a heavy blaster cannon. Although it was usually driven by a pilot and a gunner, it could be controlled by either one on their own; both pilot and gunner positions had good lines of sight, but were very exposed. The vehicle was often called the chicken walker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In mid-December, 2008, LEGO.com released a new wave of Clone Wars sets with the Clone Walker being one of the previews.
