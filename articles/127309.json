The ship in its original form was produced by a subsidiary company of Kuat Drive Yards, based on the planet Kuat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Design and modifications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Slave I was a Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft that was modified as far back as its time under Jango Fett. During this time, the only overt weapon systems leftover from its standard layout were the tail blaster cannons, but he still made sure to upgrade them, allowing these cannons to be fired with greater precision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Already during its time under Jango, Slave I was a very effective and customized ship, armed with superior shielding technology, high levels of endurance, and an arsenal of hidden and overt weapons. When his son, Boba Fett, took on the ship, he made his own modifications, so Slave I was filled with heavy-duty shield generators, several new weapons systems, and various types of auxiliary sensor systems. Additionally, a secret military sensor, which could be used for jamming and masking, allowed Slave I to disappear from the majority of scanning systems. The craft was equipped with overwhelming weaponry that could take out other heavily armed ships. However, with the exception of the twin blaster cannons, the weapons systems remained hidden to make the ship appear as if it was lightly armed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Interior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jango put Slave I through extensive modifications after several harsh battles in space. Because the original fit of Firespray patrol craft was only furnished for short-term patrol runs, he added spartan crew quarters due to the long hunts he partook in. He also altered the previously police-regulation cages into coffin-like cabinets that were less-humane but better controlled his prisoners. By the ship's use under Boba, Slave I had what were described as \"prisoner cages,\" which had six immobilizing bunks. In the cockpit, sensor scopes displayed readouts for the starship's navigation, atmospheric data, and weapons systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The interior of Slave I included a deck situated on a gyro system, allowing the occupants to stay upright no matter what position the ship was in. The ship also had a holoprojector in the main cabin as well as six chairs for passengers. The artificial gravity on each deck re-oriented, depending on the flight mode the ship was in."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In the service of Jango Fett"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jango Fett originally stole Slave I from Oovo IV, a prison moon that Firespray attack craft were used to guard, outfitting the craft with a number of weapons, including laser cannons, projectile launchers, and seismic charges. While under Jango's ownership, the ship was used to travel to Ord Mantell and in a dogfight over Geonosis against a Jedi starfighter piloted by Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Jango's death during the First Battle of Geonosis, the craft came into the possession of his son, Boba, who used it throughout his failed quest to kill the Jedi Master who had beheaded his father, Mace Windu. Boba, his ally turned mentor Aurra Sing, Castas, and Bossk traveled to the planet Florrum to meet with Sing's friend, spice pirate Hondo Ohnaka in the ship. After the arrival of the Jedi Master Plo Koon and Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Fett and Bossk were captured. When Sing tried to escape on Slave I, Tano leaped onto the ship's hull and sliced off a wing with her lightsaber. After this, Sing lost control of the ship and it crashed, with the Jedi believing Sing to be dead. Ohnaka pulled her out of the crash site and took ownership of Slave I for a short period of time, before it returned to Fett's ownership near the end of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Boba Fett's deadly craft"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship became well-known to the galaxy's fugitives, who recognized it as the ship owned by one of the galaxy's deadliest bounty hunters. During the Galactic Civil War, the adult Boba flew Slave I to rendezvous with the Imperial fleet, where Darth Vader tasked Boba and a group of bounty hunters to capture Han Solo. Boba tracked Solo and his ship, the Millennium Falcon, to Cloud City. After Solo's capture, Boba transported the carbon-frozen rebel to bring him to Jabba the Hutt's custody at his palace on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Fett's journey, however, he became sidetracked upon learning about the return of Nakano Lash, using the Slave I during his search for his former ally. After returning to his mission to bring Solo to Jabba, certain that Lash would die, Fett eventually took the Slave I to the \"smuggler's moon\" of Nar Shaddaa, taking Solo to Doc Ragon to ensure he would survive his carbonite imprisonment. Low on credits, Fett agreed to kill pit warrior Wyrmen Lictor in exchange for the work, but, while Fett was away, Ragon was killed and Solo was taken by agents of Crimson Dawn. After the new head of the organization, Qi'ra, sent a message showing Solo to Jabba, the Hutt believed Fett had double crossed him and put a bounty on Fett. On Nar Shaddaa, the Slave I was the site of trap launched by bounty hunters Zuckuss and 4-LOM, yet Fett defeated them both. Hacking into 4-LOM's head, Fett used the Slave I to return to Tatooine, where he learned Jabba was offworld and that Crimson Dawn had returned. In time, he would regain Solo and bring him to Jabba."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the war, Fett and his new partner Fennec Shand flew Slave I to the planet Tython, where they had tracked the Mandalorian Din Djarin and his Force-sensitive foundling, Grogu. After Grogu was kidnapped by dark troopers belonging to Moff Gideon, Fett flew his ship into Tython's upper atmosphere to identify Gideon's light cruiser. With Djarin's own ship destroyed and Fett now in Djarin's debt to help protect Grogu, Fett agreed to fly Djarin to Nevarro aboard Slave I as part of his plan to retrieve the child."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Departing from Nevarro, Fett took Djarin and Cara Dune to the Karthon Chop Fields to retrieve Migs Mayfeld. He then flew the party to Morak, where Djarin and Mayfeld infiltrated an Imperial rhydonium refinery and Djarin accessed a computer terminal giving him the coordinates to Gideon's vessel. After the two men finished the mission, Fett rescued them from the roof of the refinery. As Slave I was flying away from the scene, it was targeted by two TIE fighters. Fett used a seismic charge to destroy the fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Morak mission, Slave I was used to attack Imperial shuttle 2743 carrying Dr. Pershing, a scientist working for Gideon. Slave I then transported Djarin to an unknown planet to recruit Bo-Katan Kryze and Koska Reeves in the rescue of Grogu. After tracking down Gideon's cruiser and attacking the ship, Fett jumped into hyperspace per the group's plan. Sometime after the mission's success, Fett collected Shand and landed Slave I on Tatooine. There, the two invaded Jabba the Hutt's former palace, killed Bib Fortuna, and took over the remnants of Jabba's criminal empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the 2015 reference book Ultimate Star Wars, Slave I was mistakenly referred to as Clone 1 on two occasions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
