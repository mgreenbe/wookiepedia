It notably contained the gas giant Endor and its nine moons. Following the Battle of Endor, the New Republic restricted travel to the system in the fear that amateur historians and sightseers might wander into the sector's notorious hyperspace anomalies, unwittingly set off unexploded ordnance, or capture unclaimed war material. In 35 ABY, the system was guarded by a First Order Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
