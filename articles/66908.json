They monitored the loyalty of the Imperial forces around them, reporting on and reprimanding those personnel who fell short of expectations. They are charged with looking after the \"best interests of the Empire.\" and have broad discretionary powers to ensure Imperial vessels and bases did not fall into the hands of the enemy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many Imperial security officers were stationed undercover, blending in with the rank and file to observe and report. Their existence was common knowledge, and the idea that a fellow officer might be an undercover Imperial Intelligence agent was often enough to quell thoughts of sedition. Aboard starships, security officers had standing orders to prevent the capture of the vessel, even if that meant destroying the craft with all hands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
