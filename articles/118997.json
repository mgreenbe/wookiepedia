Part of the 181st Imperial Fighter Wing's Saber Squadron by 4 ABY, Saber 3 was piloted by DS-181-3, who flew as the wingman of Saber Squadron's Baron Soontir Fel, watching Fel's back. In Saber 3's capacity of flying as Fel's wing, the interceptor was often ordered to remain at a distance from the baron in order to give him maneuvering room during starfighter combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, DS-181-3 fought in the Battle of Endor, where Rebel Alliance starfighters attempted to destroy the Galactic Empire's Death Star II battlestation while TIE pilots attempted to defend the Death Star from the Alliance starfighters. The battle ended in an Imperial defeat and the Death Star's destruction. Saber 3 bore a bloodstripe which was the standard Saber Squadron insignia, representing a minimum of 10 kills."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saber 3 was created for a card in 2000's Death Star II Limited expansion set of the Decipher, Inc. Star Wars Customizable Card Game, and was simultaneously mentioned on DS-181-3's card for the same set. Of note, Fantasy Flight Games released a card depicting DS-181-3 flying a TIE/IN interceptor for the TIE Interceptor Expansion Pack of the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game in 2013. However, because Saber 3 is not definitely identified as the TIE/IN interceptor depicted on the card, this article avoids listing that card as a confirmed source for Saber 3."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
