Various planets had their own forces; however, and some of those, such as Naboo, had starfighter corps. Royal Naboo Security Forces pilots had brown, leather-like helmets with visors. Early in the Clone Wars, clone pilots wore white helmets similar to phase I clone trooper helmets, but with air tubes. By the time of ARC trooper CT-5555's escape from Tipoca City a new model of helmet for clone pilots had been introduced, and this helmet left some of their face exposed. This type of helmet was used by starfighter pilots like Clone Commander CC-2237 \"Odd Ball\" during the Battle of Coruscant and \"Jag\" during Order 66."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Rebellion and Resistance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pilots of the Rebel Alliance often wore the starbird symbol on their helmets. There were several different designs of Rebel flight helmet. X-wing and Y-wing pilots, during the early rebellion and Galactic Civil War, usually wore a rounded helmet with a chinstrap. A-wing and B-wing pilots, however, usually wore a different design with cheek pieces and no chinstrap. By the time of the Cold War thirty years later, the Resistance's X-wing pilots wore a helmet design that was an updated version of the type from the Galactic Civil War. In all cases, modified helmets were available for those whose species prevented them from fitting into human-standard helmets. Rylothian pilot Yendor had a custom helmet with holes for his lekku, and fellow Twi'lek Hera Syndulla wore a pilot's cap and custom visor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Empire and First Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial TIE pilots wore black helmets similar in design to those of stormtroopers. They had breathing tubes that connected to a control box worn on the chestplate of an atmospheric suit, as TIE fighters typically did not have fully pressurized cockpits. Some helmets had gray stripes. Thirty years later, the TIE pilots of the First Order's starfighter corps, in keeping with the mimicking of Imperial aesthetics, wore similar-looking black flight helmets, some with red stripes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
