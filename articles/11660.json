When Zorii Bliss and Poe Dameron and members of the gang went to Quintil to rescue Tomasso, Bliss asked after Frik. Later, after Bliss and Dameron were inducted as Spice Runners, Bliss brought Dameron and their damaged droid companion EV-6B6 to Babu, who fixed the droid for them. When Dameron abandoned the group to join the New Republic, Babu allowed him to take a holographic disguise matrix so he could sneak offworld. Sometime after the Battle of Crait, Kijimi fell under First Order occupation, which made life more difficult for Babu and the band of spice runners."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First Order\u2013Resistance war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war between the First Order and the Resistance, a group of Resistance members consisting of Rey, Finn, Chewbacca, BB-8, C-3PO, and the now Resistance Commander Poe Dameron recovered a Sith dagger. While C-3PO was able to translate the Sith inscriptions on the dagger, his programming prevented him from revealing the translation to anyone. When Chewbacca was captured along with the dagger, the group went to Kijimi to find Babu Frik in order to retrieve the information in C-3PO's memory banks following the recommendations of Poe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Babu was able to bypass C-3PO's programming restrictions to allow C-3PO to speak the translation. Aware that the procedure would erase his memory, C-3PO decided to undergo it as he knew there was no other way to have a chance at defeating Darth Sidious. The protocol droid later regained his memory from a backup carried by R2-D2. Babu tinkered with C-3PO's main processing unit in order to locate the text of the inscription and override the programming preventing C-3PO from speaking the translation. During the procedure, C-3PO's photoreceptors became red as he spoke the words. After completing the translation C-3PO was rebooted with no memory, leaving him only with his base factory programming."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the departure of the Resistance fighters, Babu Frik contacted Jannah and the rest of Company 77 on Kef Bir in the hope that they would be able to aid the fighters on their quest to find the Emperor's wayfinder which would lead them to the Sith world of Exegol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dark Lord subsequently gave the order to use one of his Xyston-class Star Destroyers to destroy Kijimi.

Abrams screened The Rise of Skywalker to Steven Spielberg, Spielberg asked Abrams what happened to Babu Frik, as the character was supposedly originally going to die when Kijimi was destroyed as recalled to Ivan Manzella.
