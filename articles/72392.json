At the recommendation of Senator Organa, Sato welcomed the Spectres into his fleet, and the two cells fought side by side in a number of engagements.

When most natives were hostile and even violent to him, Sato found comfort and support with Princess Althea, daughter of the planetary leader Lord Hallux, who would even tend to his wounds. Eventually, Sato was caught red-handed smuggling stolen crystals. Although he defended himself that night in front of Lord Hallux, his son Thelan and a very dismayed Althea, Sato was found guilty of the charge and banished from Isobe for the rest of his life, on pain of death.

After one such attack, in which the Spectres led the Phoenix cell's group of A-wing fighters, known as Phoenix Squadron, in an attempt to steal Imperial shield generators, Sato commended the Ghost crew for their work. Captain Hera Syndulla of the Ghost regretted being unable to secure the shield generators for the fleet, but they had secured additional fuel to maintain Phoenix operations. It was then that the crew's astromech droid C1-10P, nicknamed \"Chopper,\" arrived in the Phoenix Home command center carrying a message from Lothal. The transmission was from Maketh Tua, a minister in Lothal's Imperial government, who requested that the rebels help her defect from the Empire in exchange for valuable intelligence; the secrets she was willing to share included the names of rebel sympathizers on Lothal and nearby worlds, as well as the true reason for the Empire's presence on Lothal.

The rebels escaped Lothal aboard a stolen shuttle after the Empire assassinated Tua, implicating the rebels in the crime, and they returned to Phoenix Home. Once there, they realized that the Empire had placed a tracking device on the shuttle. Their warning to Commander Sato came too late, however, as Darth Vader arrived alone in his TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. Sato ordered Phoenix Squadron to engage the Dark Lord, but Vader was the superior pilot and destroyed most of the squadron. Vader's attack led to Phoenix Home suffering critical damage and, despite the suggestions of Captain Syndulla\u2014who, along with her crew had boarded the Ghost to engage Vader\u2014Sato at first refused to abandon the command ship.

The survivors of the mission, including the crew of the Ghost, rendezvoused with the rest of the rebel fleet and met with Sato to discuss their options in regards to Ibaar. Rex suggested that they seek out an engineer named Quarrie, who had an experimental starfighter on hand that could change the course of the growing conflict. However, Quarrie happened to be located on the planet Shantipole. Two Phoenix Squadron pilots voiced their concerns for the plan, as Shantipole was known to be a \"one way trip\" for unskilled pilots. In response, Ghost crewmember and ex-Jedi Kanan Jarrus volunteered Captain Syndulla to go on the mission, as she was the rebels' best pilot. Sato agreed to the plan, and Syndulla, along with two of her other crew members, departed for Shantipole.

After Jarrus and Rex escaped the Interdictor in an escape pod, Commander Sato prepared to make a jump into hyperspace.

During the escape, Sato was with the former Clone Captain Rex when the Liberator was caught in the tractor beam of the Imperial Star Destroyer Relentless, Konstantine's ship.
