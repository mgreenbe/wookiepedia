Master Trit was influential in the reforms that followed the Ruusan Reformation in the Galactic Senate, introducing the notion that a Jedi served the Force first and could not have external loyalties that trumped loyalty to the Order. Trit's writings would influence the codification of the Order's policies regarding the age of Initiates and the forbidding of marriages amongst Jedi. Additionally, Master Trit's words aided the Jedi High Council to make it officially inappropriate for Jedi to accept political positions or gifts unless they could aid a mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
