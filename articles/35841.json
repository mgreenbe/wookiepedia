The letter says that Anakin has been gone a long time, but that Kitster cannot help but feel that Anakin is still right beside him. He always expects to see him at Watto's Shop, but he is never there. Kitster explains that Anakin was a hero to a lot of the people on Tatooine, and that to Kitster, someone who is not good with machines, Anakin was like a god. Even though Anakin is gone, Kitster writes that Anakin is still his hero. Kitster reminds Anakin about the Boonta Eve podrace, and he claims that he even shed a tear when Anakin won the race because he knew that his friend would be going away. To finish his letter, Kitster tells Anakin that he has heard stories about him traveling across the galaxy. When he hears these stories, Kitster cannot help but look up in the sky and think about his friend moving through the stars. Kitster tells Anakin that if he ever gets tired of moving around that he should come back to Tatooine for a visit. With the letter finished, Kitster writes, \"May the Force be with you. Your friend, Kitster.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally published in Japan, the stories from Tokyopop's Star Wars Manga were considered to be of \"fuzzy\" continuity by Lucasfilm.
