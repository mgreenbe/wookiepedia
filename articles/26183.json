Each clan with the families was headed by leaders known as Aristocra who wore particular colors to indicate their clan and family loyalties. Standard and day-to-day decisions were made by a democratically elected parliamentary body from each of the 28 colonies. Issues were siphoned up through the parliament to a cabinet of appointed governors, and then to the ruling families, where a decision made by the parliament and/or cabinet could be approved for action. Each of the extended ruling families was responsible for a set of government affairs to manage: House Sabosen was responsible for social issues such as justice, health, and education; House Inrokini was responsible for industry and science; House Csapla was responsible for colonial affairs, agriculture, and redistribution of resources; and House Nuruodo was responsible for military and foreign affairs. The Csapla's redistribution of resources amongst the Chiss colonies and Csilla was particularly important, given the collectivist-socialist economic system of the Chiss, and led to their relative position at the head of the families, with the others acting in an advisory role. House Nuruodo would be ranked as second, considering the importance of warfare on Chiss society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each family was equally represented in the Chiss government, although they went to great lengths to ensure that family identity was eliminated wherever possible. The leaders of the Chiss did not use names, but instead wore colorful robes to distinguish themselves. This helped ensure that decisions were reached in a fair and equitable method. Although the four extended ruling families were not known to face power struggles, five lesser clans often vied for greater authority and power, such as House Chaf, which was considered the fifth ruling family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vast financial holdings of the Chiss kept their supply lines running and also provided them access to a number of independent shipyards which they used to keep their vessels on constant patrol. It was through such methods that the Chiss maintained a poacher base at the Etyyy hunting grounds on Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Military"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The military of the Chiss Ascendancy consisted of a well trained and well armed force which protected a number of advanced and orderly worlds within its sphere of influence. Chiss belief in rigid discipline was further seen within their armed forces and they made use of superior technology when required in order to hold enemy forces at bay. Ultimately, the Chiss saw themselves as a bastion of order in a sea of chaos in their home space in the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While their history was marked by nearly continual warfare and conquest of other worlds, the Chiss were generally not violent. They preferred to extend themselves only from a defensive posture, although they were exposed to threats in the Unknown Regions and Outer Rim, such as the Ssi-ruuk and the threat of the Vagaari (who fought three wars with the Chiss), the Yuuzhan Vong War in which is the reason Thrawn went to Palpatine in the first place, to help defeat the threat of the Yuuzhan Vong in the Unknown regions, and the later Killik incursion. There were two military organizations: the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force and the Colonial Phalanxes, which were both led by the Nuruodo family. The Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet patrolled the Chiss borders and space, although segments were known to combat forces beyond the realm of the Chiss in times of dire need. This fleet was considered to be a tool of foreign affairs rather than a military asset. Each of the 28 colonies was protected by a phalanx, which was commanded by a Syndic, or House leader, and responsible for handling any threats that slipped past the fleet. In times of crisis, Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet segments drew upon the nearby phalanxes to strengthen themselves and tighten border patrols. The formation of the Chiss Army and Navy was tributary, with each Chiss colony world sending a complete phalanx to Csilla for command by the Nuruodo family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 965 BBY, the Ascendancy passed the Non-Aggression Law, prohibiting preemptive warfare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Foreign affairs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chiss were very xenophobic, believing themselves to be superior to all others. Because of this, the Chiss were as isolationist as possible. They rarely engaged in trade with those outside their borders. Despite their isolationism, Chiss goods, like charrics, could be found in Republic markets by 3951 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Sith Empire returned in 3681 BBY to fight the Republic once more during the Great Galactic War and the Cold War, the Chiss Ascendancy was the only actual ally of the Empire, unlike all the species that the Empire subjugated, and some Chiss were known to serve as Imperial Agents. When the Eternal Empire conquered the galaxy in 3636 BBY, the Ascendancy ceded its two richest industrial worlds to Emperor Arcann as tribute in exchange for the Ascendancy's continued autonomy. When the Eternal Empire fell to the Alliance six years later, the Ascendancy quickly reclaimed the worlds with the aid of the Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point prior to 1000 BBY, the Brotherhood of Darkness raided the Unknown Regions to bolster their own forces. As part of this operation, a regiment of Chiss were relocated to Thule. Nearly a thousand years later, before the Clone Wars, Count Dooku recruited the Force-sensitive Chiss General Sev'rance Tann and her lover, Vandalor, to the armed forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the Clone Wars, the Ascendancy held diplomatic meetings with the Republic, with Aristocra Sev'eere'nuruodo meeting with the Republic's representative, the Chiss Jedi Padawan Kung'urama'nuruodo. The Chiss' position was to stay neutral in the conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the later stages of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Chiss joined the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances in the fight against the invaders, and apparently maintained closer relations with the Galactic Alliance following the peace treaty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the Ascendancy's major conflicts was the Swarm War. The insect creatures, the Killiks were disrupting Chiss space. This would eventually lead to all out war against the species when Jacen Solo and his friends executed a sneak attack on Supply Depot Thrago to prevent Jacen's catastrophic vision from coming true. The Galactic Alliance would eventually be caught up in the mix once they realized it was the Dark Nest's influence on the colony that was provoking the war. The war was ended after the capture of the Colony's leader, Raynar Thul, and the destruction of the Dark Nest with the death of Lomi Plo after the death of Welk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Sith\u2013Imperial War, the Chiss were dragged into the conflict on the Fel Empire's side when Fehlaaur'aitel'loro, the Chiss diplomat to the Empire, was made a Moff, the head of the Imperial Diplomatic Corps and placed on the Moff Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire allowed the Ascendancy to retain much of its autonomy. However, it maintained some control over Ascendancy by making heads of Chiss houses high-ranking officials within the new Empire. It also gave the Ascendancy control over large tracts of the Unknown Regions. In 138 ABY, as the Second Imperial Civil War escalated following the poisoning of Dac and the return of Darth Krayt, the Ascendancy remained neutral, though, like the Hapes Consortium, it did not even reply to Imperial requests for open liaisons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Astrography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chiss Space\n\n\nAstrographical information\n\nRegion(s)\nUnknown Regions\n\n\nSystems\nCore territory:Avidich systemCioral systemColonial Station Cam'co systemColonial Station Chaf systemCopero systemCormit systemCsaus systemCsilla systemJamiron systemKinoss systemNaporar systemNoris systemOol systemOrnfra systemOyokal systemRentor systemRhigar systemS-K systemSarvchi systemSchesa systemSharb systemShihon systemSposia systemOther systems:Bogo Rai systemCatlia systemCelwis systemCrustai systemForbelea systemKlasse Ephemora systemMassoss systemPesfavri systemTenupe system (after 36 ABY)Thrago systemYashuvhu system\n\n\nStations\nBrask Oto Command Station\n\n\nNebulae\nRata Nebula\n\n\nOther objects\nThe Redoubt\n\n\nTrade routes\nChasdemonus RouteCressus RoutePath of the HousesPhalanx RouteSparkle RunVagaari CorridorWay of Schesa\n\n\n\nSocietal information\n\nNative species\nChiss\n\n\nSector capital\nCsilla\n\n\nAffiliation\nChiss Ascendancy\n\n\n\nSector battles\n\nOrder of Zildrog campaign\nCopero\n\n\nLocal conflict\nCrustai system\n\n\nLocal conflict\nRhigar\n\n\nThird Vagaari War\nThe Redoubt\n\n\nYuuzhan Vong War\nCsilla - Zonama Sekot - Zonama Sekot\n\n\nLocal conflict\nChiss Ascendancy\n\n\nLocal conflict\nBogo Rai\n\n\nSwarm War\nThrago\n\n\n[Source]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In total, the Ascendancy consisted of Csilla and twenty-eight inhabited colonies, although the Ascendancy contained several hundred thousand star systems within or near its borders.
