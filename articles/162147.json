He was tall and slender with visible tattoos on the sides of his scalp. He hailed from a backwater world on the fringes of the Galactic Empire. Though his planet was rich in culture and tradition, Vreel was essentially a non-conformist who longed for traveling and adventuring. He joined the Empire, only to learn how tyrannical it was, and he secretly wanted to join the Rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day, exhausted from the hard training, Vreel nearly blew himself and his entire platoon up, because he made a mistake in setting the timer on a thermal detonator. He was saved when a fellow recruit, who was actually a Rebel agent, threw the detonator clear before it detonated. Vreel was eternally grateful and, being an honorbound man, he swore to serve his savior until his debt was repaid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
