During the Clone Wars, Bossk worked alongside fellow hunters Aurra Sing and Castas to mentor the orphaned Boba Fett. Their scheme to kill Fett's hated enemy Mace Windu resulted in Fett and Bossk's arrest. After a stint in prison, Bossk worked in Krayt's Claw, Fett's syndicate of bounty hunters, taking jobs for clients including Otua Blank on Quarzite and, later into the war, worked for their former companion from the Quarzite mission Asajj Ventress to help free Quinlan Vos from Serenno."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the rise of the Empire, Bossk continued to be one of the biggest names in the bounty hunting business despite eventually drifting apart from Boba and working mostly solo. At one point, he traveled to the Outer Rim planet of Lothal to collect a bounty on the Dug criminal Gronson Takkaro, who had jumped bail in the Ahakista system. During his trip Bossk also joined forces with the Force-sensitive street urchin Ezra Bridger to stop the corrupt Imperial Security Bureau Lieutenant Jenkes. Bossk also took part in hunting Wookiees that were natural enemies of his species, particularly growing a distaste for the Wookiee Chewbacca and his partner Han Solo.

Immediately after his hatching, Bossk devoured the nest eggs of his siblings and went on to claim that he was the sole survivor of his clutch. In reality, his sister Doshanalawook survived. From his father, Bossk learned how to boost and steal a landspeeder, as well as inherited both his father's and the Trandoshan species' longstanding hatred for the Wookiees of Kashyyyk. When Bossk reached maturity, he followed in the footsteps of his father to become a bounty hunter. Looking back on his childhood, Bossk regarded fathers as overrated and was uncomfortable with people asking questions about his early life. Bossk quickly established himself in the bounty hunting trade, and became known far and wide for his skills at tracking, capturing, and blackmailing enemies of crime lords and tyrants across the galaxy. He also gained notoriety as an exceptionally skilled hunter of Wookiees. He was also a member of the Bounty Hunter's Guild, an institution that regulated the bounty hunting trade. At some point during his career as a bounty hunter, Bossk obtained a modified YV-666 light freighter that was named the Hound's Tooth. This versatile ship became his main transport during his career as a bounty hunter. Bossk was a fervent believer in the Trandoshan goddess known as the Scorekeeper, and believed that he was favored by the deity above other hunters."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Aiding a vendetta"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the Galactic Republic entered the Clone Wars with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the opening conflict between the two, the First Battle of Geonosis, renowned bounty hunter Jango Fett was killed by Jedi Master Mace Windu, leaving Jango's young son Boba orphaned. Early in the war, Boba was taken in by Jango's former associate Aurra Sing, who, along with Bossk, mentored and trained the young Fett. Bossk and a Klatoonian bounty hunter hired by Sing named Castas also schemed with Aurra to help Boba exact revenge on Windu. Some time later, the group initiated their plan and had Boba infiltrate the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance, which at the time was host to Windu. Boba, whose father was the genetic donor to what would eventually become the Republic's clone army, was able to easily disguise himself as a clone cadet. While Boba was on the Endurance, Bossk and Aurra followed the cruiser in Jango's ship, the Slave I. Aurra kept in contact with Boba, instructing him on what to do. Their first plan to kill Windu, by placing an explosive in his quarters, failed and Aurra decided to have Boba take down the entire ship. She told him to destroy the Endurance's reactor core, which caused a chain reaction that damaged much of the ship's hull. Boba and the cadets he was with were sent to escape pods. The young Fett sabotaged his pod, sending it careening away from where the clones had planned to rendezvous. Bossk and Sing located the pod and had it docked to the Slave I. The two hunters opened the hatch to the pod, and they were greeted by Boba. While Aurra and Boba debated what to do with the three cadets in the pod, Bossk went back to the front of the ship and prepared to take off. After detaching the pod, Bossk piloted the ship to the planet Vanqor, where the Endurance had crashed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once on Vanqor, the bounty hunters searched the wreckage of the Endurance for survivors. They executed several clone troopers who had survived and took three hostages: Admiral Shoan Kilian, Commander CT-411 \"Ponds,\" and another naval officer. Once they had cleared the wreck, they set up a trap for Windu, knowing he would also search the wreck for survivors. Inside the command bridge, Jango Fett's helmet was wired with an explosive that would be set off once it was moved or touched. After completing their task,  Bossk and the others returned to the Slave I with their hostages. Bossk, Boba, Aurra, and Castas watched from afar as Mace Windu and his fellow Jedi Anakin Skywalker entered the wreckage, and later watched as the bridge exploded. Boba wanted to make sure that Windu was dead, but Aurra told him that there would be nothing to find if they searched for a body. Castas complained to Bossk about the idea of having to stay on Vanqor any longer, given not only the large population of gundarks but also the fact they were carrying hostages. Aurra reminded him that they could sell them to the Separatists, and, at the insistence of Boba, was convinced that giving the Separatists proof of Windu and Skywalker's deaths could also fetch a price. Aurra, Boba, and Castas boarded speeder bikes to head to the crash site, while Bossk was ordered to watch the hostages. While trying to navigate the wreckage of the Endurance, Sing, Castas, and Boba were nearly killed by falling debris and explosions. Despite Boba's willingness to continue to the bridge, Sing and Castas decided that it would be better to blow up the rest of the wreck and turn back. Bossk, meanwhile, had tied the three hostages together and was dragging them on board the Slave I. Aurra contacted him as he was doing so and told him to fire up the ship and that they were going to destroy the rest of the Endurance. Bossk replied that he would have the ship ready for when they arrived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Sing and the others rode back to the Slave I, they noticed an explosion nearby. Aurra commed Bossk and demanded to know what it was. Bossk looked at the ship's scanners and saw that they had picked up something near where the Jedi had landed their starfighters. Sing told Bossk to jam any communications heading off the planet before the hunters continued on their way back to Slave I. Once they loaded their speeder bikes, Bossk took off and flew the ship towards the wreckage. While flying low, they noticed a Jedi starfighter not far to their right. Castas and Boba recognized the ship as Windu's, and Aurra told Bossk to follow and destroy it. Boba fired at the ship as it flew along the length of the star destroyer, and continued firing on it as Bossk followed it into the atmosphere. As the starfighter neared two hyperspace rings, Bossk told Boba that he was not in close enough range and would have one shot at destroying them. Boba destroyed one ring, but the starfighter entered the second one and entered lightspeed. With the ship gone, Bossk asked Aurra what their next step was. She opened the hatch to the hostages and decided that they would be the perfect bait for Windu. Aurra turned back to Bossk and said that what they needed to do next was regroup. Unbeknownst to the hunters, Windu had never left Vanqor; both Windu and Skywalker had survived the explosion of the bridge, but were trapped under debris. Skywalker's astromech droid R2-D2 had taken Windu's starfighter and was looking to contact the Republic and ask for aid which arrived soon after and saved the two Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Bossk piloted Slave I through space, Aurra and Boba recorded a message for the Jedi. Showing the hostages to the Jedi, Aurra demanded Boba kill Ponds, which he could not bring himself to do. Aurra angrily did so herself, and she taunted Windu to find them before the other hostages were killed. Returning to the cockpit, Aurra told Bossk and Castas that it would only be a matter of time until the Jedi tracked them down. Castas told Aurra that she was in over her head, citing the haphazard planning and increasing stakes. Annoyed by Castas' cowardice, Aurra turned to Bossk and asked him if he was having any doubts as well. Bossk denied doubting her plan and told her that he wouldn't back out, saying he had a lot riding on killing Windu and that he needed the cash. Castas, however, told Aurra that he was dropping out of the mission. Sing told Bossk to set a course for Florrum, where they would visit an old friend of hers and Castas could find a place to go. On Florrum, the hunters landed at the fortress of the Ohnaka Gang, a pirate group led by Aurra's former partner Hondo Ohnaka. While Sing, Boba, and Castas left the ship to meet with Ohnaka, Bossk stayed behind and watched from the entrance to Slave I, and later re-entered the ship when Ohnaka brought his visitors inside for drinks. While at a bar in the fortress, Aurra noticed Castas attempting to sell information on her location to a contact of his and shot him in the head. Bossk, meanwhile, watched Slave I's scanners for any ships entering the atmosphere. The scanners picked up a Jedi craft, and he alerted Aurra. Sing ordered him to take Slave I to the outskirts of Florrum and prepare the hostages."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi who arrived at Florrum wasn't Windu, but Jedi Master Plo Koon and Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Sing set up a trap for Windu inside Ohnaka's bar, but when she realized that Windu had not come she contacted Bossk and told him to execute the hostages when she gave the order. Shortly after, however, Tano cut Aurra's comlink antenna, and Bossk was unable to reach her. Bossk decided that, if he didn't hear from her, he would kill the hostages and leave aboard the Slave I. Meanwhile in Ohnaka's fortress, Koon and Tano managed to gain the upper hand from Sing and Boba, taking the latter captive. Sing abandoned Boba to the Jedi and escaped on a speeder bike, followed closely by Tano. Boba gave Koon the location of Slave I, and Tano went to rescue the hostages. As Bossk aimed the hostages, Tano arrived and fired at him from her speeder. Bossk jumped to the ground to avoid the blasterfire, dropping his rifle in the process. Tano freed the two hostages, and the freed Kilian picked up Bossk's rifle and aimed it at him. Just then, Sing arrived and crashed her speeder into Tano's, destroying both in an explosion. Sing ran aboard Slave I and prepared to leave, but Tano used her lightsaber to destroy the wing. The ship came spiraling down to the ground, exploding with Sing still inside."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Incarcerated"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both Bossk and Boba were taken prisoner by Republic forces that arrived on Florrum soon after, and they were brought to the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center on Coruscant. Upon arriving at the facility, they were met by Windu. Boba angrily confronted him and told him that he would never forgive him, but Windu told him that he would have to. Over the course of their stint in prison, Bossk grew protective of Boba, acting as a bodyguard and protecting him from their fellow inmates. Some time into his own prison sentence, the notorious and famed bounty hunter Cad Bane paid Boba to pick a fight with one of the newest inmates, Rako Hardeen, in order to start a prison riot. Bossk watched as Boba started an argument with Hardeen in the cafeteria, and cheered on his young charge as the two entered a fistfight. Hardeen managed to subdue Boba as two prison guards entered the fray, and Bossk stood up from his table. Bossk walked over to the guards and picked them up by their heads, slamming them together and knocking them out. Bossk growled at Hardeen and told him that if he had a problem with Boba, then he had a problem with him too. The Trandoshan picked up Hardeen by his back and hip and threw him across a cafeteria table. Four guards surrounded Bossk, prodding him with electrostaffs. Bossk hissed and began attacking them, which encouraged the other inmates in the cafeteria to attack the guards across the room. Amid the riot, Bossk took out several more guards before fleeing the prison with Boba as the chaos spread."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Quarzite job"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following their escape from prison, Bossk and Fett made their way to the Outer Rim world of Tatooine, where they formed a new bounty hunting posse called Krayt's Claw. Their crew grew to include bounty hunters Dengar, Latts Razzi, C-21 Highsinger, and Oked. The group based themselves in the spaceport of Mos Eisley, where they took a job from the Belugan Major Rigosso to escort cargo on the planet Quarzite. On the day the team planned to depart for Quarzite, Bossk, Razzi, and Oked went to a local cantina to have a few drinks. While Bossk and Razzi sat at a booth, Oked went to the bar, where he began flirting with a Dathomirian woman named Asajj Ventress. When Oked grabbed her arm, she ignited a lightsaber through his stomach, killing him. Once the commotion died down, Bossk ordered her a drink on his tab, then motioned for her to sit down with him and Razzi. Ventress asked Bossk what he wanted, and he introduced himself and Razzi. Razzi went on to tell her that they had a problem. Ventress reached for her lightsabers, and Bossk pointed to the dead Oked and told her that she had killed one of their team. The Dathomirian sarcastically apologized for the incident. Bossk asked her where she got her lightsabers, and she replied that she had stolen them. Bossk asked if she was a bounty hunter, but she said that she was not, to which the Trandoshan asked if she had ever considered it, given her disposition. Sitting down at the table, Ventress asked if it paid well. Razzi told her that it did, but Bossk got to the point and informed Ventress that they had a job to do and that she could either join their team in Oked's place or be turned over to the authorities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With little choice, Ventress agreed to Bossk's deal and joined him and Razzi. The trio left the cantina and headed for Krayt Claw's base. As they entered their small base, Dengar teased Bossk and asked who his girlfriend was, referring to Ventress. Bossk told him to shut up and continued inside. Bossk greeted Boba as his boss, which prompted Ventress to mock the idea that Boba was their boss. When asked what her name was, Ventress said that she had none. She confronted Boba, mocking his height and age. Bossk hissed at her, then told Fett that they brought her there because she had killed Oked. Putting his arm around her, Bossk coldly told her that if she backed out, they had \"another way\" of settling her debt. Ventress got the message and told Bossk and Fett that she would join them. With the matter cleared, Fett told the team that they were ready to go, but Ventress questioned why they hadn't settled the payment first. Boba angrily told her that she would get her cut once the job was finished, same as the other hunters. The group left Tatooine aboard the Hound's Tooth and traveled to Quarzite's space station, where Bossk landed his ship. As they departed their ship, the team was met by Major Rigosso. Rigosso ushered them to a holotable, where he explained the mission. The team would be escorting a subtram in the planet's crystalline caverns. The tram was host to cargo valuable to Quarzite's dictator, Lord Otua Blank. Dengar asked what the cargo was, but Rigosso told him that it was none of the hunter's concern. Rigosso and the bounty hunters headed to a series of turbolifts nearby, where they would descend past the planet's hostile surface and to the crystal underworld below. Bossk entered one of the lifts alone, and altogether he and the others were brought to the tram station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once they got off the lifts, the bounty hunters helped Rigosso's soldiers bring the cargo to the tram. As they walked towards the train, Bossk noticed the small box and sardonically asked Razzi if it was all the cargo was. Latts responded that she didn't care what it was, as long as they got paid. Once the cargo was fully loaded, the team split into three groups. Razzi and Highsinger stayed with Rigosso and the cargo, while Fett and Bossk guarded the engine room. Securing the back platform were Dengar and Ventress. Not long into the journey, Dengar contacted the other teams and told them that they had company: a group of Kage Warriors, seeking to hijack the cargo from Rigosso and Otua Blank. Immediately after getting Dengar's transmission, Bossk and Boba noticed footsteps coming from above the tram. A group of three warriors entered the engine room in the front of the car, and three more entered from the back. While Boba fought off the three in front, Bossk shot down one in the back and engaged the others. Bossk and Boba managed to hold them off, and Boba left Bossk to check on the cargo. On the back platform, Dengar was pushed over the side of the tram, and Ventress was alone to fend off the increasing number of attackers. She commed the team and told them that she needed a hand, and Boba ordered Bossk to go help her. While taking out the last of the warriors in the engine room, Bossk threw one against a wall accidentally shorting the lights on the tram. Bossk told Boba that he was on his way and began heading towards the back platform. While in the car between the engine room and the back, he was attacked by a group of warriors. One blew blinding dust into Bossk's eyes, effectively leaving Bossk unable to see. One of the warriors grabbed hold of Bossk's side, while the others pummeled him and brought him closer to the edge of the tram. Although Bossk fought back, he was no match incapacitated and was pushed overboard.

After a brief standoff, Ventress tied and gagged Boba and placed him in the cargo box, which was discovered to be containing a Kage girl, Pluma Sodi, who the warriors were eager to have returned safely. Ventress presented the cargo to Otua Blank and took the payment, and ensured he wouldn't discover Boba inside until she left aboard the tram. Ventress then handed Sodi over to the Kage Warriors for an additional fee. With the promised unmarked credits from Blank and her separate payment from the Kage, Ventress returned to the Hound's Tooth, where she found Bossk and the other hunters waiting for her and Boba's return. Ventress handed Blank's payment, minus her share, to Bossk, who presented the case to the others. Ventress asked Bossk to make sure Boba got his share.

When Vos casually referenced Ventress, however, Bossk's attention was piqued and he laughed before buying Vos a drink. Bossk inquired if she had stolen a job from Vos, and he instead asked if he knew where she was, to which Bossk answered he had no idea, but after further prodding from Vos, took him to a back alcove where Boba and the other hunters under his employ were seated.

Bossk was part of a group of hunters hired, including Beilert Valance, Nakano Lash, and T'ongor. While the crew made preparations for the job, T'ongor contacted his sister T'onga on the ship's long-range communicator, while Bossk and Valance stood nearby and waited for the briefing. Bossk teased Valance, who was waiting for T'ongor to finish his conversation so he could talk to his close friend, Yuralla Vega. Bossk was impatient with having to wait for Valance to talk to Vega before they could start the briefing, and told the cyborg to be quick with his lover. The annoyed Valance threatened to rip off Bossk's arm after the Trandoshan smacked him in the back of the head, and the two engaged in a brief standoff. Bossk taunted Valance and told him that his new synthetic skin wouldn't make Vega love him, mockingly calling him more of a droid than a man.
