Godera was a scientific genius, specializing in the creation of superweapons, and he hated the Empire with a passion. But when the Republic was forced to sign the Treaty of Coruscant, Godera left the Republic in a fury. He fled in secret to Taris, where he set up several laboratories and facilities throughout the ruins of the once-mighty ecumenopolis. It was during this time that Godera created RE-M0, using the droid as one of his assistants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, the Sith Lord Darth Angral seized control of many of the Republic's superweapon projects in an attempt to get revenge on an unknown Jedi Knight for killing his son. Angral sent the Imperial Agent Watcher One to Taris to capture Godera. When Godera learned of the Empire's interest in him, he assigned RE-M0 to watch one of his facilities and spy on any Imperial presence. Watcher One's troops stormed the facility not long after, taking control of the lab and searching for the doctor. RE-M0 did not reveal himself until the same Jedi Knight who had earned Angral's wrath arrived at the facility also in search of Godera. After defeating the Imperial forces, the Knight spoke with Watcher One via hologram.

The Knight raced to the ruins of an old chemical plant on the shores of Lake Brell, where they found \"Doctor Godera\" lying dead at the feet of Watcher One. But RE-M0 had followed the Knight and intervened, telling the Jedi that the body wasn't Godera\u2014a second bioscan had revealed he was still alive.
