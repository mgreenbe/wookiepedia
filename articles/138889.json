He was in charge of General Grievous's droid outpost on Felucia. However, Republic AT-TEs began firing on the outpost, whereupon TZ-33 ordered the gates of the outpost be lowered so that droids could be sent out to investigate. But it turned out to be a trap, and soon, the Jedi and clones stormed the compound and destroyed all the droids present. TZ-33 was also destroyed when Jedi General Anakin Skywalker bisected him diagonally through his torso."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This tactical droid was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.
