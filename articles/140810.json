When Jedi Master Lene Kostana's Padawan Sifo-Dyas received a Force vision of a deadly solar storm hitting Protobranch, she informed Tavetti against the wishes of the Jedi High Council. Tavetti believed Sifo-Dyas' vision could possibly come true due to the Tabor Plains being described in it. During the conversation, Tavetti only expressed concern for the large amount of bacta Protobranch produced rather than the population, which slightly unnerved Dooku. Tavetti also requested Kostana investigate, but in secret so as to avoid civil unrest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, Sifo-Dyas' vision came to pass; a powerful solar storm hit Protobranch, destroying much of the planet's population and resources.
