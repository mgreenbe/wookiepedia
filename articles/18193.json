As water was extremely scarce, different Abyssin tribes would fight to the death over an oasis, which the victors were awarded territorial rights to. Bloodings could also be more personal, and Abyssin would use them to settle differences. Eventually, they were phased out when the less-belligerent Arcona arrived on Byss and taught the tribes to collaborate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
