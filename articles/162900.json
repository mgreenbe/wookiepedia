When the message of Jabba's death reached the palace, Yarna d'al' Gargan ran across the two drunks, who attempted to rape her in their befuddlement. Fortunately, Sergeant Doallyn arrived just in time to protect her before they could commit their heinous act. He shot the Gamorrean in the back and escaped with Yarna into the desert. Warlug was lucky to survive the incident and backed off with Tornik."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
