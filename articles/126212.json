Sadow then led the Sith invasion fleet in what was known as the Great Hyperspace War. After facing defeat at the hands of the Republic, Naga Sadow returned the fleet to Korriban in hopes of rebuilding, but was met by the newly anointed Dark Lord Ludo Kressh, who exiled him and his forces from the Sith Empire when Sadow refused to surrender. Not accepting his exile, Sadow sacrificed several of his remaining ships to defeat Kressh's forces. With much of the fleet gone, it was a pyrrhic victory, such that by the time the Republic and Jedi Order caught up to Sadow and his fleet the sole remaining ship was forced to rout."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
