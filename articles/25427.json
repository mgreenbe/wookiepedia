A small but effective unit, the Irregulars specialized in brushfire wars and hot spot conflicts. In combat, Charger was a tightly wound commander, shouting orders and commands. Out of combat, Charger was soft-spoken and polite. While the Irregulars were exclusively Human, Charger had no qualms about working with aliens although he found it easier to command beings of his own species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
