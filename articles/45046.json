It provided good protection and allowed a lot of movement to the wearer. However, Eriadu did not pursue general production of the armor pending further tests, and by the time of the Rise of the Empire era, it was not a common sight to the general public. The armor was more easily upgradeable than most armor and the redeemed Revan and his companions may have obtained a set of Eriadu prototype armor during their quest for the Star Maps and the Star Forge. It was similar in design to the Jedi Civil War era heavy combat suits, Republic mod armors, and Zabrak battle armors except that the plating was blue rather than silver."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
