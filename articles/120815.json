During the reign of Shimrra Jamaane, the Scepter was very similar to its wielder: it was three meters long, making it larger than the standard amphistaff and was tattooed with the symbols of the Gods of the Yuuzhan Vong. It was the 'king' of the other amphistaffs and therefore other amphistaffs refused to fight the user of the scepter of power. It was also just as effective a weapon as its smaller cousins, as during the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, the Scepter managed to coil around Luke Skywalker. Luke suffered a bite from the scepter, but managed to slash it with his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Scepter was also identified as \"scepter of rank\" when Shimrra had his first meeting with the Elites in The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
