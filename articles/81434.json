It had a game room, lounges, seating areas, an interactive hologram suite, and eating areas. It was often filled with passengers from many different worlds, who often talked, ate, and played games of chance to pass the time, filling the starship with noise. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi used this spaceliner to get to Telos in an unofficial mission to capture Xanatos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
