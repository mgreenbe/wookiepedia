One of only a few semi-permanent structures within the village, it was from here that the junk boss Unkar Plutt ran his operation, in which, he offered up small amounts of food in exchange for valuable scrap. The stand was heavily armored, made from a converted cargo crawler. It also featured a security system to stop desperate scavengers from stealing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
