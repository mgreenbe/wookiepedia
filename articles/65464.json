The Instruments marked an initial armistice between both factions, setting the stage to a formal end to hostilities and reduction of the Empire's power. It forced the defeated Empire to abide by the terms of the Galactic Concordance. Mon Mothma issued another declaration designating all surviving Imperial officers as war criminals but granting conditional pardons to civilian functionaries including Mas Amedda, provided they complied with the articles of the Galactic Concordance. Despite this formality, the Imperial Navy was in fact allowed to stay united, so long as it remained within the borders of the Imperial remnant. The officers who did not accept surrender retreated to the outer portions of the galaxy and established another faction. These war criminals would then keep their forces at the ready in case conflict were to break out, leading to a Cold War between the Imperial hardliners and the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The signing of the Imperial Instruments of Surrender took place north of Hanna City, capital city of the planet Chandrila."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
