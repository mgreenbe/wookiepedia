Made up of members of the Special Forces Tracker Group, these courageous rebel soldiers ignored orders from the Alliance High Command, to follow the steadfast leadership of Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor. Sadly, everyone who took part in the secret attack mission lost their lives in the Battle of Scarif. However, despite the tragic outcome, they achieved their main objective: to steal the Death Star blueprints and hand them over to the Alliance commanders, who then used them to detect the rift in the monstrous space station and prepare a daring offensive to destroy it. Rogue One's sacrifice will not have been in vain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
