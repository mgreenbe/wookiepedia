With Bobbajo trapped by stormtroopers, Bobbajo's creatures, including Smeep, Qyp and Mideyean, work together to both effect Bobbajo's escape and the destruction of the Death Star itself, rigging its superlaser weapon so that when the Empire attempts to fire it, it instead turns upon itself, destroying the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The villagers are amused by the story, but insist that they know the truth, that the Death Star was destroyed by the heroes of Rebel Alliance.

Bobbajo tells the villagers that while what he told them may have been just a story, they should never discount the power and strength of stories. He then leaves in search of another story to tell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
