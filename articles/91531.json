Also present were Rath Kelkko, Bok and a hologram of General Grievous. After listening to this conversation, Tholme made contact with Jedi Knight Aayla Secura and ordered Republic troops to come to Saleucami immediately. Two Morgukai clones attacked Tholme, but were quickly defeated. Sora Bulq then appeared and attacked his old friend. While fighting, Tholme realized that there was no need to defeat the Dark Jedi: he needed only to escape and destroy the cloning installation.
