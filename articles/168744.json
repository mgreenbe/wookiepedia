After the Imperial military banned the use of relay droids, she upgraded it and gave it to Calliope Drouth upon her dismissal. On a pre-recorded message, Catabe told her former subordinate that she was going to join the rebels, and suggested that Drouth secretly work for her using Zox. During the Imperial Ball, to which Drouth went with Zox, the droid suddenly flew and fell into the hands of Director Orson Krennic, who attended the event. Through information received by Drouth at the ball and recorded by Zox, various anti-Imperial factions have learned of the importance of Jedha to the Empire, including the Partisans of Saw Gerrera, who had deployed insurgency there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
