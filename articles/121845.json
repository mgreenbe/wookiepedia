Xiono chased after him and they arrived at Sector 7-E which was off limits to members of the Colossus. They looked out and spotted thieves moving crates. Knowing that they had to stop the thieves, BB-8 rolled off and opened up a vent, rolling through it to reach the thieves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The thieves found the weapons in the crates they needed but were left with the problem of getting them out of the Colossus. But then BB-8 fell through the vent and landed right in front of the thieves. The thieves didn't want any witnesses and prepared to blast BB-8 to pieces. Realizing what was about to happen, Xiono who was still outside Sector 7-E, ran over to a control panel. Turning a wheel, Xiono opened up a pump intake valve located above BB-8. This caused BB-8 to be shot up the valve and travel through the pipes of the Colossus. But another problem quickly emerged. BB-8 was heading straight for the furnace of the ship. Xiono quickly ran over to a lever. He pulled the lever which caused BB-8 to change directions and head down another pipe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pirates then launched thermal detonators into the valve and they barrelled towards BB-8. Pulling another lever, Xiono was able to quickly divert BB-8 away from the detonators.
