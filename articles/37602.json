Dethro Glok designed the course without many sharp turns (which proved troublesome for acrophobes) and enjoyed hearing pilots scream whenever they fell into the gassy void. Racers with great top speed and decent brakes fared well with this course. This course was the fifth race in the Galactic Podracing Circuit tournament.
