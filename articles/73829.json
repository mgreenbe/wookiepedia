It was discovered by the Jedi Kit Fisto and Aayla Secura a few months after the Battle of Geonosis, who were staying at Kamino when they passed a squad of dead troops. After confirming a deadly virus, Prime Minister Lama Su issued Clone Master Sayn Ta to create a vaccine to protect all clones. Fisto and Secura tracked the defector and killed her, but could not save Sayn Ta from being killed. After Ta's death, the other cloners injected vaccines into all clones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
