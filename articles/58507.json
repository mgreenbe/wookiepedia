While not heavily armed, they were equipped with a strong deflector shield. Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala used several H-types during the Fall of the Republic, which bore silver coating to denote her status as former Queen of Naboo. One was flown from Naboo to Tatooine to help Anakin Skywalker find his mother, and then to Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi; others were used during the Battle of the Kaliida Nebula and her mission to Rodia, though in both cases the yachts were destroyed owing to unfortunate circumstances.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
