Armanda Durkin and her husband owned a building with a Maltsett insurance policy. After a fire burned the building down, injuring Armanda's husband, Maltsett used an obscure legal reference to avoid paying. As a result, Armanda could not afford the care that might have saved her husband's life. She later became CEO of the Notsub Shipping Company, and led a double life as a pirate preying on Maltsett-insured vessels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
