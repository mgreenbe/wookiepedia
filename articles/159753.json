Slick's major side effect was that it induced a temporary state of euphoric delirium, which led to recreational abuse of the substance among some customers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corrupt aristocrats dominated Vaynai, profiting from its aquaculture industry and constructing lush towers atop islands of the Vaynai Archipelago, such as Streysel Island.
