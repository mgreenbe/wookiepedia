But when Dross Squadron was challenged by First Order stormtroopers, Puwanini and her Scrapper Guild team came to the rescue and a firefight ensued. Puwanini led Shriv's team to Platform thirty-three G, where a number of ships that were ready to be scrapped were located. These included a T-65B X-wing, two T-70 X-wings, and a T-85 X-wing.
