The offensive took place between 25 ABY and 26 ABY, and was the follow up to an attack on the Vandyne system after which the Yuuzhan Vong traveled along a hyperlane to reach the Edusa system. Following the strike on the Edusa system, the Yuuzhan Vong moved on along the hyperlane to attack the Tangrene system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on the Edusa system was first shown in The Essential Atlas, a sourcebook released in 2009 and written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry. The Atlas included the attack in a map titled \"Vector Prime and the Yuuzhan Vong advance\" which showed the movements and conflicts of the various factions involved in the Yuuzhan Vong War, between 25 ABY and 26 ABY. The book gives no information on the outcome of the attack, but a separate map shows the Edusa system was under Yuuzhan Vong control by 26 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
