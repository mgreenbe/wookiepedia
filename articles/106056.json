In about 17 BBY, a group of Alderaanian Resistance agents infiltrated the Cloud City Sabacc Tournament and the Human Silas Draver, a competitor in the competition, suspected that they agents were somehow cheating, so he tipped off the Bespin Wing Guard that a spice deal was going to take place on Platform 13-009 at 02:00, then had one of his thugs send a message to the agents telling them to meet him at the platform at that time. Both the Wing Guard and the Alderaanian agents traveled to the rendezvous point and the Wing Guard attempted to arrest the agents, believing them to be criminals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
