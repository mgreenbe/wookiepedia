A mollusk by nature, its shell was about two meters long with three meter long tentacles. Like many mollusks, its shell was chambered and coiled with its fleshy body protruding out. Unlike most mollusks, its segmented body and knife-like legs were covered by an insectoid exoskeleton. It was believed by the native Mizx to be an avatar of Hershoon the Destroyer, created by its demented soul so that its legacy would be perpetuated. However, Ibliton fossils dated back to 600,000 BBY, predating the Mizx."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
