Alongside its decent blaster fire output, the CJ-9 was capable of delivering lethal melee strikes when its shaft was extended to form an electrified staff. As the traditional weapon of the Lasan High Honor Guard, the bo-rifle was renowned as a weapon owned solely by the one who bested its wielder in combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CJ-9 electrified bo-rifle, or simply the CJ-9 bo-rifle, was a model of bo-rifle, a unique two-handed weapon design that combined an electrostaff with a blaster rifle. The weapon was capable of discharging red-colored blaster bolts with a reliable fire output. Its signature feature, however, was its forward facing staff that could emit yellow electromagnetic pulses in order to deliver lethal melee strikes to opponents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Similar in design to the J-19 bo-rifle, which was one of the later and less artfully designed versions of the bo-rifle, the black-colored CJ-9 consisted of a long, rotund shaft with a smaller rifle barrel attached below it that was responsible for discharging blaster bolts. The weapon's shaft contained cooling vents, and it could be extended forward to be transformed into an electrified staff. The rifle also lacked a trigger guard. Unlike the J-19, however, the CJ-9 was fitted with a scope above the shaft instead of a bayonet situated along the top edge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CJ-9 was a model of bo-rifle, a type of weapon manufactured by the Lasan-Malamut Firearms Corporation and traditionally used by the Lasan High Honor Guard, the defense forces who protected the Lasat homeworld of Lasan until the planet's pacification by the Galactic Empire. The bo-rifle was renowned as a weapon that could only be obtained by defeating its wielder, a custom that was known as the Boosahn Keeraw in Lasat culture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime between 19 BBY and 10 BBY, Masse Goskey, the proprietor of Masse Goskey's Arms Emporium and Explosives Mart in Mos Eisley spaceport on the planet Tatooine, and his associate Ephant Mon bought some weaponry on the moon of Nar Shaddaa, including a CJ-9 electrified bo-rifle that came at a price of 1,100 credits. A complete inventory of the merchandise was recorded in a book that would eventually be known as the Smuggler's Guide. According to Goskey's note in the book, all the weapons they picked up on Nar Shaddaa were illegal in sixty-six sectors, compelling them to sell the arms to crime syndicates such as the Crymorah syndicate and the Black Sun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, a Lasat male wielded a CJ-9 bo-rifle while facing an aggressive creature.

Originally introduced into the game by game developers who joined multiplayer matches while equipping the CJ-9, the bo-rifle has become a virally propagating weapon since then. Once obtained, the CJ-9 can be used by troopers from all factions, including the Galactic Empire, the Rebel Alliance, and the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
