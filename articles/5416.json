He hired Tusken Raiders to murder members of the local police. This began a long blood feud between colonists and sand people. During his 34-year-long occupation of the monastery, Alkhara cut a road from the citadel to the Western Dune Sea and Great Pit of Carkoon, and also added battlements, dungeons, and a nine-story tower to the building. Eventually, the bandit was driven off Tatooine by the Hutt Jabba Desilijic Tiure, who turned the monastery-cum-hideout into his personal palace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
