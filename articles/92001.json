Moap worked from some of the world's various shady bars, and he also maintained a small office in the mid-levels of the moon's cityscape. During the Galactic Civil War, the Hutt crime lord Jolla schemed to interfere in the business operstions of his nephew Torga and his old friend Moska, so as to make pair engage in a dispute against each other, so that they would be less likely to cause trouble for Jolla. At Jolla's behest, Moap hired the Clawdite assassin Nomo Sliken to murder Torga's lieutenant Nak Simm and sabotage a business deal that Torga had been trying to make, and the Kitonak then made it appear to Torga that Moska had hired Simm, thus causing Torga and Moska to become hostile to each other."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
