Prior to the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Warrchallra provided the concept for the propaganda poster \"Liberty for All\" to the Clawdite illustrator Tavris Bahzel while the shapeshifter was disguised as a Twi'lek, who toned down the graphic violence it depicted. By the year 34 ABY, Warrchallra was focused on creating art that celebrated the Wookiee people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Warrchallra was first mentioned in the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
