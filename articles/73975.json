Following the formation of the Galactic Empire, the station was taken over by the new regime and put into use as jail for various high-level prisoners. The station continued to house a civilian population, and control of the facility was nominally in the hands of the civilian stationmaster Cleben. The station was occasionally visited by traders affiliated with the Black Sun organization, who provided illicit wares for the facility's inhabitants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In about 18 BBY, the Sith Lord Darth Vader captured the Cerean Thi Xon Yimmon\u2014the leader of the Coruscant-based resistance group the Whiplash\u2014and held him aboard Kantaros Station. Vader's initial attempts to extract information from Yimmon were unsuccessful and he placed the Cerean under watch, to monitor him so that a new approach to forcing the resistance leader to reveal details of the Whiplash's activities could be formulated. In addition, a large contingent of Inquisitors, including the noted Inquisitor Probus Tesla, accompanied Vader to Kantaros Station and took up residence aboard the facility. Soon afterward, Yimmon's allies Jax Pavan, Den Dhur, I-5YQ and Sacha Swiftbird staged a rescue attempt and freed Yimmon from the clutches of his Imperial captors. Pavan briefly engaged in a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader, but the Jedi was eventually able to escape, blowing up one of the station's hangar bays as he fled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
