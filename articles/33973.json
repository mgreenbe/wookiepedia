Four Jedi younglings (Ahsoka Tano, Kalifa, O-Mer, and Jinx) fled across Island Four on the moon of Wasskah from Dar and the group of hunters led by his father, Garnac; the Trandoshans managed to wound Kalifa, and Garnac ordered his son to kill her himself. Dar eagerly tried to accomplish this hunting task, but he was not striding carefully enough, leading him in having a surprise ambush from Ahsoka. Kalifa escaped from Dar while Ahsoka subdued him; the Trandoshan tried to shoot the young Jedi and failed. He then charged at her, swinging his rifle. Ahsoka was too quick for Dar in the end, and she managed to throw him off the platform on which they fought. Dar fell to his death; he was impaled by one of the sharp stalagmites on the forest floor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Garnac cherished Dar greatly regarding their family.
