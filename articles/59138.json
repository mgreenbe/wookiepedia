He told a group of Rebel agents, interested in obtain a shipment of bacta, that he would assist them in obtaining a bacta transport. He pretended to be a Rebel sympathizer but in reality he did not favor either the rebellion or the Empire. In truth the bacta transport that they targeted called Theta-2Y was owned by Hamar himself. He planned to hide a group of his mercenaries on the bacta transport and subdue the rebels once they had captured the vessel. He then planned on faking the ships destruction and claiming from the huge insurance policy he had on the bacta and the ship (200,000 credits). Furthermore he planned to sell the bacta transport to a pirate for 75,000 credits and the bacta to the rebel alliance for another 25,000."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hamar-Chaktak also owned a corvette called the Crusader and a Eliall-class container ship.
