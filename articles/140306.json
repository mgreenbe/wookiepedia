One was used in the attempted capture of Zayne Carrick for his alleged involvement in the Padawan Massacre of Taris. It could carry at least 10 people aboard and was equipped with a public-address system. The gunship was not spaceworthy so, in the event of fugitives escaping to orbit, the Taris Civil Authority's police cruisers would be used instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Taris Civil Authority gunship appeared in Knights of the Old Republic 3 and was penciled by Brian Ching."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
