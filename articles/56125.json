Similar in cut to the standard Imperial uniform, it was distinguished by being stark white in color as opposed to the usual olive-gray. Other distinctions included a unique rank insignia plaque, and gold epaulets. Owing to its distinctive appearance, a number of Grand Admirals relied on only the plain white uniform without other insignia to identify themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many other Imperial individuals began wearing the uniform as a sign of its power, despite not officially being promoted to the rank of Grand Admiral. Most notable were Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard, who wore a customized blood red uniform with a Grand Admiral's rank plaque when she ruled Coruscant after Grand Vizier Sate Pestage's death; Warlord Zsinj during his war with the New Republic; and even Thrawn himself, who was seen wearing a similar uniform prior to his official promotion (at the very least since he held the rank of Vice Admiral)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
