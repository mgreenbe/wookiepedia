A EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate that was protecting the convoy launched twenty-four TIE/LN starfighters at the Rebels. Five of them were destroyed by the Rebel pilot Biggs Darklighter, who was flying his first mission for the rebellion. Amil Karsk, another rebel pilot, claimed Darklighter's third kill, however, which secured his status as an ace and denied the honor to Darklighter. Wedge Antilles was also flying for the Rebels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
