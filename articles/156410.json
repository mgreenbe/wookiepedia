In 43.5 ABY, she served as a member of Sith Lord Viun Gaalan's strike team sent to retrieve the Sith apprentice Vestara Khai from Dathomir. After capturing several Nightsisters, the Saber stayed behind, along with Gaalan, Gaalan's aide, and a male Sith Saber to wait for Khai to retrieve one last Nightsister. However, before Khai returned, the Sith were attacked by Luke Skywalker, his son, Ben Skywalker, and the Force-sensitive Dyon Stadd. The male Saber was quickly killed as Gaalan engaged the elder Skywalker in a duel. Meanwhile, the female Sith Saber attacked Stadd, who proved very difficult to kill, using acrobatic maneuvers to stay out of her reach. After helping Ben Skywalker kill Gaalan's aide, the two then attacked the Sith Saber. Stadd fired on her with his blaster pistol, and she deflected the shot at Ben Skywalker, who deflected it back at her. The bolt hit her weapon hand, and as she staggered back, Stadd shot her in the gut and Skywalker beheaded her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
