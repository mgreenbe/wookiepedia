Ventress manages to destroy the defoliators and fights her way right up to Grievous, challenging him to single combat, which Grievous readily agrees to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, Mother Talzin calls upon her order's venerable elder, Old Daka, to allow the reviving of the past Nightsisters with their dark magic, thus creating an army of the dead to repel the Separatists.

He first kills Daka, disrupting the resurrection magic, and without reinforcements the remnants of the Nightsisters are helplessly slaughtered. Before she can be executed by Grievous, Talzin turns into smoke and vanishes, later appearing before Ventress. The apparition of Talzin encourages her to follow a new path before she dissipates, leaving the desolate Ventress to face an uncertain future."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The episode's Director's Cut was included in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season Four DVD and Blu-ray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
