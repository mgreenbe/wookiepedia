The city included the starport called Hariz Downside, and outdoor markets. It was connected to Giat Nor by a hovertrain. It was within Hariz that Nil Spaar reappeared after fleeing Coruscant. It was one of the only cities that allowed non-Yevethans to walk around unaccompanied. Spaar's flagship, the Aramadia, was stored here."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
