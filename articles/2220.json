They tried to remove the ship by using Banthas, but it freed a Mole serpent that was trapped underneath. A-Zulmun fought against the creature and was severely wounded. He escaped the mole serpent's grasp after he jammed his rifle in its mouth, right before it almost swallowed him completely as it did to the other tusken raiders. Later on, some of the surviving members of the tribe spotted the players of the story and saw it as an opportunity to take water from them or the Jawa beside them. A-Zulmun saw it as an opportunity to die fighting and dragged his injured self throughout the battle toward his enemies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the players healed his injuries, A-Zulmun informed them about the ship that crashed in front of the cavern entrance. He told them that it was a half a day's travel and he offered the Bantha's that his fellow tribe members had brought with them as a ride. A certain distance before they arrived at the crashed ship A-Zulmun informed the players that the shuffling of the Banthas attracted the mole serpent. If A-Zulmun could not be understood by the players, he got down from the bantha and motioned to the players to do the same. If the players ignored his warning, A-Zulmun followed them 50 meters behind the Banthas they rode."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mole serpent emerged and having fought the creature for a while, Ranon Djelkh appeared in a skiff and attempted stop them. When A-Zulmun saw this occurrence, he recovered a fallen tusken raider's slugthrower rifle and crawled up to a vantage point where Ranon was clearly seen. Once he arrived on the vantage point, he started shooting at Ranon until he was eventually killed by the players or shot by A-Zulmun. After the mole serpent was neutralized and Ranon was defeated, A-Zulmun climbed atop of the shipwreck and prevented any person from entering the grotto, including the players that helped him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was extremely distrustful towards outsiders, because for Tusken Raiders any other race was considered a menace.
