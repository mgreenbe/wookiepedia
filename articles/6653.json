Some of Ansel Hsiao's vessels, when they were included in the book, also had their ship classifications redone to take into account the system. Specifically, the Allegiance-class Star Destroyer was reclassified as a battlecruiser, and the Bellator-class Star Battlecruiser was reclassified as a dreadnought."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
