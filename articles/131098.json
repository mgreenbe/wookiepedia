Anakin is knighted as a Jedi Knight and Coruscant comes under attack by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This then serves as a diversion for General Grievous and the droid army to sneak in and capture Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from Coruscant. Season Three delves deeply into, and focuses mostly on, Anakin's story and the relationship between him and Obi-Wan Kenobi, while also showing their struggles during the war. It builds up many of the events leading to Revenge of the Sith, as it takes place closer to the film's timeframe. It is also an immediate lead-in to Revenge of the Sith\u2014the opening scene of which takes place only minutes after the end of Chapter 25. Although the Season Three chapters are still action-oriented, the longer running time allowed for more dialogue between characters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Contents"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
