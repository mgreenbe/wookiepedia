Gradually, over time, the Republic expanded across the galaxy, enveloping the comparatively small government. Though the region was not a member of the Republic, ministers from the Nouane system held considerable power on various worlds within the galactic government."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thousands of years later, the nomadic Mandalorian warriors raged a crusade against the Republic. They launched a series of attacks into Republic space from their homeworld in Mandalorian space, and one of their Coreward invasion routes passed directly through the Nouane system. As a result, the warriors conquered the regional capital. The beleaguered Nouanese people called upon the Republic for assistance, and once the Mandalorians were driven away, Nouane space joined the Republic as a semi-autonomous Allied Region. The region would enjoy this status through the end of the Republic and the early years of the Galactic Empire. Once the Empire was defeated, the Nouane region again declared its independence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nouane system, along with the planet that shares its name, first appeared in 2009's The Essential Atlas, written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
