While traveling, Kenobi spots a village ahead. This village is inhabited by several Plains Amani, who begin throwing spears at the Jedi visitors. Despite Kenobi's warnings, Skywalker dives from his mount and attacks the Amani. During the ensuing skirmish, the Amani attack the Jedi with blasters that fire precision laser darts. Before the Jedi can question them, all of the Amani flee into the wilderness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While inspecting the camp, Kenobi discovers several unusual footprints which he assumed belong to the Amani leader. While traveling on foot, Skywalker mentions his former Padawan Ahsoka Tano, for the first time since her departure. While setting up camp, the two Jedi talk about Ahsoka's decision to leave the Jedi Order. Skywalker chatisizes the Jedi Council for not standing by Ahsoka during her trial and for causing her to leave the Order. In response, Kenobi argues that it was her own decision to make and that she let her emotion cloud her judgement, something against the Jedi way. Skywalker then moves on to question how Kenobi would feel if he failed him, something Kenobi doesn't want to talk about."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Kenobi begins to sleep, he instructs Skywalker to remain on guard. However, Skywalker disobeyed his orders and fell asleep. The following morning, the two Jedi are captured by several Sugi warriors who were accompanied by an Amani.

When he interrogated the Jedi, Kenobi made up the story that he and Anakin were arms dealers who had traveled all the way to the Outer Rim Territories to buy arms from them. The Sugi leader responds that he has to talk with his boss."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Jedi and their Sugi captors then travel to several mounds where they encounter the Sugis' boss Endente and several more Sugi. While not revealing his name to the Jedi, he assumed that Kenobi and Skywalker had come to purchase the crystal. Endente revealed that he had already promised the crystal to the Separatist military leader General Grievous. The two Jedi then offered to pay double the price but Endente rejected their offer. While being led to the crystal, Kenobi assumed that it was a kyber crystal.
