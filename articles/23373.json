The Federation's actions were guided secretly by the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. Valorum dispatched ambassadors from Coruscant on the Judicial Department Consular-class space cruiser Radiant VII to the Lucrehulk-class Battleship Vuutun Palaa over Naboo. The ambassadors were secretly two Jedi Knights, the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, sent to negotiate the ending of the blockade with the Viceroy Nute Gunray. After Sidious ordered Gunray to begin the invasion of Naboo, the viceroy was skeptical, as he was concerned over the legality of invading Naboo. Sidious assured the Viceroy he would \"make it legal\" and told Gunray, upon being inquired as to what to do with the Jedi, to kill them.

Once on the surface, Jinn rendezvous with Kenobi where he met a Gungan named Jar Jar Binks in the chaos of the Federation invasion. After saving Binks from a troop carrier, he swore a life debt to Jinn for saving him, rendezvoused with Kenobi and planned to find shelter, which Binks offered to give them in the Gungan city beneath the ocean to avoid the approaching Federation forces. On the surface, Bibble's suspicions proved correct and upon realizing an invasion was underway, she soon switched places with her decoy Handmaiden Sab\u00e9.
