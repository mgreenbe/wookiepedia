Captain Terisa Kerrill had no other choice but jump to lightspeed to prevent total destruction of her ship. The Overseer dropped out of hyperspace in the Remitik system, desperately in need of repairs and proper munitions. After contacting a nearby Imperial munitions depot and demanding supplies to continue their hunt for Project Starhawk, its commanding officer Colonel Gralm, denied their request on the basis the Emperor assigned him to the depot, and that he decided how its resources were used, which now included the Overseer. Kerrill snapped back, explaining the Overseer was sent on this mission by Admiral Rae Sloane herself. As Sloane was not present, and Gralm had rebel guerrillas to deal with, Kerrill's forces were needed. Bitter with the situation, Kerrill's plan was for Titan Squadron to patrol the depot and scan any ships for munitions that could be acquired. During a rebel raid on the depot, the distraction would allow the ships to be remotely-piloted back to the Overseer and then Kerrill's forces would leave."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Titan Squadron launched from the Overseer sat in orbit close to the deport, and started their patrol. Titan Three started scanning freighters and shuttles. A pair of Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttles contained baradium, which would be ideal for their assault on the Starhawk. LT-514 confirmed he had remote access to the shuttles. It wasn't long before rebel ships arrived and started bombing runs on the three depot towers. Titan Squadron carried out the necessary actions to protect the depot by destroying waves of BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bombers carrying out bombing runs, and CR90 corvettes with RZ-1 A-wing interceptors and T-65B X-wing starfighters escorts. The battle escalated further with the arrival of an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate, UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft and more starfighters. At the right moment, LT-514 started remotely-piloting the baradium shuttles back to the Overseer while Titan Squadron escorted. As soon as the shuttles entered the hangar, Kerrill ordered Titan to board and for the Overseer to jump to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kerrill was not concerned with Gralm's complaints as Titan Squadron had fulfilled their mission. They now had the munitions capable of destroying the Starhawk as well as the location of the Nadiri Dockyards.
