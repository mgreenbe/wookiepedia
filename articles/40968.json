General Leia Organa tasked Shriv Suurgav with leading a team to the junkyard planet of Bracca to steal whatever starfighters they could find. Pacer Agoyo's sister, Puwanini, was a member of the Scrapper Guild working on Bracca. She provided the team with information that enabled them to infiltrate the junkyards unchallenged, by disguising themselves as Riggers and Hazmats. After arriving by train to one of the junkyard platforms, a group of stormtroopers, recognised Raidah Doon as a known criminal from Gheia Six and a firefight ensued. Sanrec Stronghammer was fatally injured but survived long enough to hold back the First Order forces, which enabled the rest of the team to swing across the gap above the Ibdis Maw to another platform. This was a whole platform of X-wings that Puwanini identified as being suitable, were waiting to be scrapped. Despite Stronghammer's death, the team was able to escape with one T-65B X-wing, two T-70 X-wings, and one T-85 X-wing, making it a small victory for the Resistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
