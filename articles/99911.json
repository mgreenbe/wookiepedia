During the war, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, went undercover at an illegal rancor fight featuring Old-One Eye on the galactic capital planet of Coruscant, about eighty kilometers away from the Senate Building.

Tano fell into the arena during the match and had to fight Old One-Eye and the other rancor, and Skywalker quickly joined the fight as well. Although the Jedi lightsabers had no effect on the rancors' tough hides, Skywalker was able to calm the beasts through the Force.
