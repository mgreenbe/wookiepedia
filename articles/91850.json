She was born on Colonial Station Camco, and was brought to The Expansionary Fleet complex on Naporar for sky-walker training when she was young. She started navigating when she was seven. At one point, she served as a navigator aboard the Tomra, where she met Thrawn. Her third Sight only lasted until she was thirteen, a year earlier than a typical Sky-Walker. She was adopted by the Chiss Ascendancy's Mitth family as a merit adoptive. She then became Che'ri's momish.

Thalias sought to prevent the mass suicide of what may be the last survivors of an otherwise extinct species, and sought to provide hope of rebuilding to the Magys.
