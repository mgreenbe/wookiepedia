He disliked the Chiss Ascendancy because they assumed themselves to be superior to all other species. According to Qilori, the Chiss were not unique in believing themselves superior, but they took such ethnocentrism to a much greater level, viewing other sentients as \"particularly clever animals.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chiss Junior Commander Mitth'raw'nuru hired Qilori to help initiate the Lioaoin pirate campaign. After their mission to the Lioaoin heartworld, Qilori hoped he would never meet Thrawn again. However, he was later hired by Thrawn, who had since become a Senior Captain, during the Nikardun conquests. By that time, Qilori had become a servant of General Yiv the Benevolent, the leader of the Nikardun Destiny."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After defeating Yiv during the battle over Primea, Thrawn demanded that Qilori never reveal how he managed to defeat the Nikardun leader. Thrawn invoked the Navigators' Guild policy of confidentiality to threaten to have Qilori thrown out of the Pathfinders and also the Pathfinders removed from the Navigators' Guild, if Qilori were ever to disclose Thrawn's tactics. However, Qilori came to be trapped on a seemingly-dead starship owned by Jixtus, to whom Qilori revealed that Thrawn was behind Yiv's defeat. Taking up Jixtus's offer for a bright future and revenge on the Chiss Ascendancy, Qilori then agreed to join his faction, the Grysk Hegemony. Jixtus tasked Qilori with learning the Chiss' means of navigating the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qilori harbored a strong dislike for the Chiss, whom he called \"blue-skins\", and their government.
