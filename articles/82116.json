This was most probably done early in the Lady's life, as this weapon was outdated by the time of the Galactic Civil War. This weapon drew immense amounts of energy whenever it fired its projectile-based ammunition; unfortunately this would cause another of the ship's primary systems to power down; this could be the shields, the laser cannon, the nav computer, the ion engines, or the vessel's maneuvering thrusters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lady was in the possession of Sithless Leethe when a group of Rebel wannabe's came to Docking Bay 35 in Mos Eisley, where he was selling the ship, sometime during the Galactic Civil War. Prior to this, Leethe had sold the ship to at least two other people; a \"Squid-face\" who had used it as a pleasure yacht before retiring to Eridicon IV, and another owner who hadn't been able to keep up payments for the ship and was terminated. Sithless sold the Lady to the group for 25,000 credits, which he informed them they could make in payments if they gave him a 5,000 credit down payment at that time. The only other condition of this sale was that the group took the Lady to Zoma V with its current cargo. What he did not tell them was that this cargo was ten metal crated full of Imperial weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately, before this group managed to board the Lady, it was impounded by the Empire. The group somehow managed to get past the Stormtroopers and boarded the ship where they found Slopper, one of Leethe's thugs, and took off from the planet Tatooine without gaining permission. When the ship left the planets atmosphere, it was immediately contacted by both Hawker Bryce-Kelly in the Queen's Victory whom they had arranged to race to Zoma V, and the Star Destroyers Belligerent and Vengeance, who ordered the group to land the ship back in Docking Bay 35. The group did not comply with these orders, however, and so the Vengeance ordered them to stand by and prepare to be boarded. Luckily, the group managed to escape after fighting four TIE/LN starfighters, and escaped into hyperspace, fleeing to Zoma V."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they arrived in the Zoma system, they were contacted by Bryce-Kelly who offered them drinks if they came aboard his ship, where they would also finalize their bet. Sometime after this, the Lady was used by the group to deliver a data cartridge to the Rebel's Reginard Base on the planet Reginard. It is thought that this group then joined the Rebellion, using this ship for many other adventures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
