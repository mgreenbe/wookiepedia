Shiv jokes about how he and Flanker always thought that due to all the desert training they received, the two of them would be stationed on a water world, but, instead, Shiv is now on Orto Plutonia, which he believes is even colder than space. Shiv tells Flanker that his squad has been tasked with testing an assortment of subzero gear, and that not all of it works. Also, the clones' food rations were not shipped in insulated canisters, and the low temperature is freezing them solid. Now, the clones have to boil their food, taking away what little flavor the rations had to start with. Shiv mentions to Flanker that his squad has not come across any Confederate battle droids, but has stayed in fighting shape by building snowmen and using them as target practice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shiv goes on to write that things got a lot worse when his squad started to encounter a very dangerous and mysterious species that they nicknamed the \"ice men.\" He says that all of the station's patrols who have apparently seen the \"ice men\" were killed. Shiv tells Flanker that things are not going well for him right now and reveals that he is on patrol with his commander, Mag. Mag and Shiv's CK-6 swoop bikes have frozen up, leaving the two stranded until dawn, when Glid Station can send out a gunship to pick them up. The two have built a small camp and set up a tent, and while Shiv is finishing up his letter in the tent, Mag walks in, wondering why Shiv is not resting for when it is his turn to take guard duty. Curious, Mag takes the datapad from Shiv's hands and, after looking it through, asks who Flanker is. Reluctantly, Shiv tells Mag that Flanker died during the Battle of Christophsis. As soon as Shiv says this, the \"ice men\" attack their camp, ripping open the clones' tent and killing Mag. As Shiv reaches for a blaster pistol, the \"ice men\" kill him as well, leaving the now-destroyed camp\u2014along with Shiv's letter\u2014to be covered up by the snow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Conception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"The Clone Wars: Cold Snap\" is a six-page webcomic in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars webcomic series that ties into the television series of the same name. \"Cold Snap\" leads directly into \"Trespass\", an episode in the first season of The Clone Wars television series.
