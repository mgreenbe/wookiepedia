Along with her sister Paige's medallion, the medallion was a stylized ensign of the Otomok system, representing the planet of Hays Minor. In 34 ABY, after Rose and Finn hired slicer and codebreaker DJ to disable General Armitage Hux's tracking system in order to help the Resistance in their battle against the First Order, DJ demanded Rose's medallion as payment for his services. Though Finn initially objected, Rose accepted the deal only to have the medallion returned to her after DJ used it to disable a locked door aboard the First Order Navy's flagship the Supremacy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
