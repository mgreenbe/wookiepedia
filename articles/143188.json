As his Izvoshra bodyguards board, he is blessed by another Kaleesh and informed that the Kaleesh people's hope against the Huk rests on his shoulders. Boarding the shuttle, he takes off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In mid-flight, a device planted on the shuttle detonates. The shuttle's explosion is witnessed by a cloaked figure watching through electrobinoculars. Sheelal's escape pod ejects from the burning wreckage into the water below. Later, a Banking Clan barge comes upon the wreckage, and two Magna Guards, supervised by the cloaked figure, pull the legless general out of the water. When a medical droid checks Sheelal's vitals, the figure blasts Sheelal with Force lightning, which functions as a defibrillator, keeping the general alive. Declaring the general ready for experimentation, the figure orders the droids to transport him to Geonosis. Holding Sheelal's Kaleesh bonemask, he removes his hood, revealing himself to be Count Dooku."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sheelal awakens in a green bacta tank, and is greeted by San Hill. Hill tells Sheelal that an InterGalactic Banking Clan frigate recovered the General's escape pod and brought him to Geonosis. Sheelal wants to go back to Kalee to be with his troops, but is told he will not survive the trip. Hill then proposes an experimental new treatment. Sheelal is interested in getting back, and is apathetic towards the Separatist \"New Order\". The Kaleesh lightly accepts the offer, but Dooku senses the shallowness of his agreement, and orders Poggle the Lesser to leave Sheelal in the tank for a while longer. He then shows Poggle the cryogenically preserved corpse of his old friend, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Months later, Sheelal is revealed in his ultimate cyborg appearance. Given the weapon of Sifo-Dyas as a gift from Dooku, Sheelal sits in the darkness, brooding. Dooku subsequently reports to his master, Darth Sidious, saying that the experiment was successful. Sheelal, his mind tampered with, has lost all carnality, but still has anger, pride, and an ingenious strategic mind. While Dooku speaks with Sidious, Sheelal, enraged at being referred to as a droid, finally explodes in anger, unleashing his wrath against his own IG-100 MagnaGuards. Brutally destroying them, Sheelal turns to the window. As one of the damaged MagnaGuards asks what's wrong in a continuous loop, the seething Sheelal answers:"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Count Dooku is watching General Grievous' ship through the macrobinoculars, the screen displays the word \"ACTIV[panel ends]\" written in Aurebesh. When the device inside the ship detonates, the screen in front of Grievous contains the word \"LOW\". After the explosion, a screen outside the bacta tank contains the words \"AM I DEAD\" (which is what Grievous asks San Hill)."}]}
