When activated, the field can be adjusted to give mild electrical jolts, to damaging bolts capable of giving severe burns and setting clothes on fire. When set on maximum, the belts internal power source can last up to forty five minutes of continuous emitting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
