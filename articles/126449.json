It was located in the Grumani sector. It was a stormy planet with many trenches, and a forbidding-looking mesa. In 1032 BBY, the planet was invaded and occupied by rival Sith Lord Odion's Odionate military forces. Later, Aunt Zoojoo revealed to Jedi Knight Kerra Holt that Skarpos was the location of the Helm of Ieldis, an ancient Sith artifact created prior to the Great Hyperspace War which was the target of Odion's Project Pandemonium. Disguised as a Novitiate named \"Mercy\", Kerra and the other Novitiates returned to Skarpos and were immediately besieged by Malakite's reinforcements and Sith Lord Daiman's forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
