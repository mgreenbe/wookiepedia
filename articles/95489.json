She was greatly concerned about Supreme Overlord Shimrra's order to attack Mon Calamari, openly saying that Shimrra was deranged in Choka's command grotto. While Choka himself was sympathetic, he warned the seer to be cautious about what she said outside the grotto. She also talked with the Royal Seers, saying that they would stretch the truth about when to attack to give Choka more time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
