In this year she traveled to the planet of Kashyyyk with fellow slavers Twool and Lix, hoping to capture a number of Wookiee younglings to sell. The group landed in the Shadowlands, the forest floor of Kashyyyk, where they encountered a group of young Wookiees led by Chewbacca. Hoping to catch the young group the slavers attacked, but were eventually beaten by the group.
