After the Resistance successfully evacuated the planet, the Raddus jumped to lightspeed, but was tracked through hyperspace by Snoke's flagship, the Supremacy. The woman saw the First Order forces on her monitors as the enemy fleet exited hyperspace and immediately notified Commander Poe Dameron that the First Order had found them. The command bridge of the Raddus was destroyed shortly thereafter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character was portrayed by Michaela Coel in Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, the second installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.
