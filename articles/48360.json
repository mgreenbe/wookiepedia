Their most distinguishing feature was the snake-like tendrils they possessed, which they used to locate and capture prey. The species' presence in the trenches made trench-diving on Nal Hutta particularly dangerous; however in the year 22 BBY, the Nautolan Jedi Kit Fisto claimed that they were no longer a problem, having previously spent a week trench diving on Hutta himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fire-kraken were first mentioned in the 2004 novel The Cestus Deception, which was written by Steven Barnes, and also received an entry in the 2008 reference book The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia written by Stephen J. Sansweet and Pablo Hidalgo. The novel used the plural to refer to the fire-kraken, suggesting there were more than one although the entry in the encyclopedia uses the singular suggesting that there was only one fire-kraken. This article assumes the former is correct and that the encyclopedia referred to a specific member of an entire species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
