San claimed she had come only because the salvagers had a surplus of connector couplings, and was bringing them spares on the house.

Arriving at the Colossus marketplace, San and Xiono attempted to warn people of the approaching monster, but were ignored, and two security droids attempted to arrest them for causing a panic. The sight of many more tentacles above water proved the truth of their warning, and San and Xiono were able to activate the pirate alarm that lowered the market's protective blast doors. When the door became damaged, San suggested that as she'd heard Xiono was a good pilot, he go help the Aces while she closed the door.
