Mostly used by military organizations, the weapon was mounted on a tripod and required two crew to operate while deployed as an emplaced weapon, although it was also possible for an individual of extreme strength to carry the weapon. Due to its robust, reliable nature and simple construction the HOB was fairly easy to deploy and take down or repair in the field. The weapon was considered powerful and had a high fire rate and energy draw, costing 6500 to purchase."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The HOB heavy repeating blaster was included in Dangerous Covenants, a source book released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2014 for the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
