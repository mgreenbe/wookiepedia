It was filled with organic Yuuzhan Vong torture devices, including an Embrace of Pain. It was connected to a secret hangar contained within the substructure of the ship's forward weapons turrets, signifying it was near or within said area. Jacen Solo brought his cousin Ben Skywalker here, where he put him in the Embrace of Pain and, unsuccessfully, tortured him in an attempt to turn him to the dark side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
