Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, the scavenger Rey carried a set of Pilex bit drivers including both \"Blissex-head\" and \"Wessex-head\" bit-drivers in her satchel of tools while she lived on the planet Jakku. She at some point wrote about these and her other tools in her survival guide. After she fled Jakku with the former First Order stormtrooper Finn and the BB unit BB-8 on the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon, Rey discovered that the starship's motivator needed repair. While fixing it she had Finn pass her a Pilex driver."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Blissex-head\" bit drivers first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015. It was not identified by the film but was named simultaneously in Rey's Survival Guide and Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, two reference books written by Jason Fry and Pablo Hidalgo respectively for release in conjunction with The Force Awakens. It is unclear which of the two types of bit driver Finn passes Rey onboard the Falcon, but as the visual dictionary shows props for both this article assumes both types were in the film.
