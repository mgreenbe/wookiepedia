It also gave a mild impact although it was not as destructive as thermal detonators, and was capable of disabling droids for a short period of time. One variant of the grenade could split into several fragments and individually explode. When Luke Skywalker went on a mission to Ben Kenobi's home with R2-D2, Boba Fett ambushed them with a flash grenade in an attempt to capture the boy. In 14 BBY, the Jedi Knight Cal Kestis infiltrated the Fortress Inquisitorius on Nur in an attempt to retrieve a holocron that contained a list of Force-sensitive children. During the mission, Kestis was confronted by the Inquisitor known as the Second Sister who attempted to use flash grenades to disorientate her opponent during their duel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
