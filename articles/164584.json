Jason Fry, the co-author of the Atlas, has stated that the star systems listed in Appendix section of The Essential Atlas are named after the most prominent planets or celestial bodies located in those systems. This article therefore considers Galpos II to be located in the Galpos system. The StarWars.com Online Companion to The Essential Atlas subsequently further overrode the Voyages SF 13 placement by establishing that the Woldona system was part of the Sevetta sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
