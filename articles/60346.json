The Mark I, II, III, & IV versions in turn allowed for a considerable increase in protection. During the height of the Galactic Empire, heat shields were often seen on probe droid drop pods. These same shields were affixed to modified Tech 4 PDVs during Operation Death-Hunter. These modified vessels were designed to carry Death-Hunter Cyborgs and the shields allowed safe crash landings on worlds where the cyborgs were assigned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In KotOR II, this upgrade can be used on all types of armor, except robes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
