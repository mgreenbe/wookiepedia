Thirteen was named such because of a programming error that made Thirteen respond to every query for a random number with 13. Grinder Thri'ag, the Wraiths' computer specialist, fixed this error, but Kell kept the droid's name. The astromech seemed to like the name, as it implied the droid was the thirteenth member of Wraith Squadron. The computing problem made a recurrence when Thirteen was hit by an empion mine, wiping its memory. Thirteen was destroyed with Kell's X-wing when Kell ejected after being shot down over Ession."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
