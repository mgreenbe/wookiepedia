A mountain plain was expanded and leveled to house the planet's largest starport, not only for practical purposes, but also as a display of prestige. Companies and individuals who could afford to maintain holdings and residents in the expensive districts surrounding the starport gained an instant boost in prestige. Few other species placed a premium value on land near a noisy spaceport, but to the enterprising Bothans, the thundering roar of arriving and departing spaceliners symbolized an intimate connection with the galaxy, and, by extension, its many information networks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
