Residing on the world for twelve years meditating on her failure, Kuro eventually left the world to return to active duty on Coruscant. After her initial departure, Quarren businessmen Lekket and Tallet hired the failed Padawan-turned bounty hunter to hunt down and kill Senator Tikkes for his role in their banishment from their homeworld Dac. Sing, who was also hunting down her former master, tracked both Tikkes and Master Kuro to Cophrigin where she planned to murder both of them. Attacking Kuro's retreat, Kuro, Tikkes, and a Jedi task force escaped Sing during a meteor shower which rained down on Kuro's retreat during the attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
