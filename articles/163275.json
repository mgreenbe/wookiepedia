The ship accidentally triggers an automated docking sequence, causing organic tendrils to lock onto the ship and try and draw it into a docking bay that, when closed, would be too small for the vessel. Captain Kaiya Adrimetrum deploys a team to the construct to try and deactivate the mechanism."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside, the boarding team discover the Codex, a powerful Force-enhanced object. Also on board the construct is an Imperial unit led by the bounty hunter Mist, who had suffered a similar fate to the FarStar.

The boarding party manages to find the controls to the mechanism and shut them off, freeing the FarStar from the grip of the tendrils."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
