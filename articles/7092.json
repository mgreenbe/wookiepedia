Once applied on a ruptured metal surface, it would crawl over the area, smooth out, and then seal down the fissures in the surface. It would hiss and steam as it did its work. In many cases, the resulting bond would be stronger than the original hull alloy. Animated metal sealant was a common sight in many a spacer's, or mechanic's tool kit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
