Vladick was based inside the Imperial Data Processing Facility on the planet Tazan and along with the clerk Hervey Douglas, the Human was responsible for ensuring the orderly running of the facility's contingent of stormtroopers. Sometime after the destruction of the planet Alderaan, the child Jastina Clines was imprisoned inside the Data Processing Facilty and Vladick and Douglas took pity on her, so they smuggled some toys and books into her cell, to keep her happy.
