They had entered the trench fairly close to where the thermal exhaust port was located, and Nett claimed that they \"should be able to see it by now\". When Dreis advised them to lookout for Darth Vader and his TIE fighter escorts, Nett claimed that there was too much interference on their sensors to detect them, and called to Red Five, Luke Skywalker, to see if he could spot them from his vantage point, with Luke being able to spot them just as they were swooping in on Red Squadron in the trench. Vader took out Naeco quickly, and Nett pleaded with Dreis to abort the run, as he was unable to hold the enemy fighters off for much longer. His pleas fell on deaf ears, however, as Dreis was convinced that he could make it to the exhaust port. Nett was ultimately shot down and killed by one of Vader's escorts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Theron Nett first appeared in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope where he was identified only as Red Ten.
