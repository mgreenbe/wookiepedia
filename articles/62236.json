After making contact with the planet's indigenous people, the Kentra, he became their spiritual leader, teaching the principles of Sword, Plow, and Spirit. Establishing the Temple of the Je'ulajists, he even created a series of computer programs which carried on his teachings long after his death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Order remained active after Tandre's death, his lightsaber, although completely drained of power, was kept as a holy relic, called the \"Sword of Honor\".
