In 21 BBY, the Defender served in a fleet with two others Venators including\u2014Resolute and Redeemer\u2014that was commanded by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano. The fleet was dispatched by the Republic to the planet Ryloth in an attempt to break a Separatist blockade under the command of Neimoidian Captain Mar Tuuk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the arrival of the Defender and the two other Star Destroyers in the Ryloth system, the vessels proceeded to launch the V-19 Torrent starfighter Blue Squadron under Tano's command, however, Tuuk was able to lure the Republic fleet into a trap, and while the starfighter squadron was distracted, the Neimoidian summoned Separatist reinforcements to the system, outnumbering and catching Skywalker's fleet off guard. The additional reinforcements forced Skywalker to order a full retreat, but not before all three Star Destroyers sustained heavy damage, with the Defender losing its starboard bridge tower and the Redeemer breaking apart in space under heavy fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the two remaining ships made their escape from the system, Skywalker devised a plan to take down the blockade without having to suffer anymore casualties, which resulted in the Defender being evacuated of all crew and passengers to the Resolute, and Skywalker taking control of the damaged Venator. The Jedi then returned to the Ryloth system in the Defender, where he spoke to Tuuk aboard his Lucrehulk-class Battleship, stating that he had returned to surrender the Star Destroyer and all its crew in return for relief supplies being transported to the Twi'leks on the surface. However, Skywalker's plan was soon discovered by the blockade, although too late, and the Jedi, evacuating in an escape pod, sent the Defender into the Lucrehulk, destroying both vessels. Despite the loss of the Defender, its sacrifice allowed the remaining Republic forces to break the blockade and ultimately liberate Ryloth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Venator-class Star Destroyer, the Defender was wedge-shaped with two bridges and a large dorsal hangar bay.
