In the mythology of Skye's native sentients, the S'kytri, that mountain was considered a goddess. The myths said that the chief god known as the Great Wind once mated with the goddess Krisklar, siring the S'kytri species itself. When a S'kytri died, his or her body was brought to Mount Krisklar for excarnation by flying skingles. During the Battle of Skye in 21 BBY, a number of mortally wounded S'kytri attempted to make for Mount Krisklar before breathing their last."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
