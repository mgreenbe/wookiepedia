Upon detonation, the grenade filled an area of ten meters in diameter with fragments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twisting the timer dial up on the top of the grenade set a time delay for up to two minutes, while pressing the activation panel on the rim of the grenade primed the detonite charge and started the timer.
