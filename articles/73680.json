The Kallig line fell into disgrace for centuries until one descendant, a former slave and the Sith apprentice of Darth Zash, encountered the Force ghost of Aloysius Kallig in the Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas. Eventually Zash would attempt to betray her apprentice in Kallig's tomb, resulting her apparent death and her apprentice taking the title Lord Kallig. With Aloysius's aid, his heir eventually rose to become Darth Nox, a member of the Dark Council. The young Dark Lord had restored their family name to greatness, being acknowledged as the heir of Kallig and Tulak Hord by Khem Val, Hord's greatest and most loyal servant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their family heirlooms were Kallig's Countenance and Kallig's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
