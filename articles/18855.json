The weapon was capable of wrapping around an individual's neck and breaking it. The bounty hunter Cad Bane carried a concealed bola on his person. The primitive natives of the planet Verig used a bola-like weapon, a long rope with stones tied to either end, to trip the large Pryss-creatures while hunting. Ewoks employed bolas during the Battle of Endor, where the necessity of a neck joint rendered stormtrooper armor ineffective against them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
