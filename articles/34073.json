He believed that the Metatheran Cartel was involved in illegal operations, and discovered something which he believed would sink the Cartel. Before he could compile proof and share it with anybody, he was kidnapped by a group of pirates dressed in the security uniforms of House Hirskaala. The pirates were in league with Velin Wir of the Cartel, and they took Darin to a landing platform they were using hidden in the jungle. Darin managed to escape, and disappeared into the jungle heading generally back towards Gadrin, but was never seen from again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
