Its captain was Barada Rakul, and it held a crew of five. Prior to the breakout of the Clone Wars, the vessel was seized after it was discovered to be carrying one hundred metric tons of ryll. Though the vessel was owned by the Besadii kajidic, Aruk Besadii Aora claimed that they had sold it to Desilijic thirty years earlier. Jiliac Desilijic Tiron disputed these claims, though he had initially accused the Judicial Department of entrapment before he discovered the vessel was owned by Besadii."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
