Following the Galactic Empire's Great Purge, she resided with the Tribe in a covert on the planet Nevarro, where she forged armor and weapons for her fellow Mandalorians. Around 9 ABY, she forged a new set of armor for the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin using the beskar he provided. During this time, she stopped an altercation between Djarin and another member of the Tribe, Paz Vizsla, when she reminded them of the way of life they were supposed to follow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of an attack on the covert by the Empire, the Armorer made it her mission to salvage what beskar she could from the deceased Mandalorians. When she met Djarin and his allies, she helped him restock his supplies and declared the formation of his clan after creating his signet, but stayed behind in order to continue collecting the beskar and cover Djarin and his allies' escape, before evacuating herself to parts unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Forging armor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the New Republic Era, the Armorer was a Mandalorian female who served as a Mandalorian Armorer for the Tribe and resided within a covert on Nevarro, forced to remain hidden following the Galactic Empire's Great Purge. By forging beskar armor in the ancient tradition of the Mandalorian people, she played a vital role in keeping her people's culture alive after so many Mandalorians had been killed in the purge. Around 9 ABY, she was visited by Din Djarin, a Mandalorian bounty hunter, who provided an ingot of beskar he had acquired from a bounty. The Armorer then identified the steel as a product of the Great Purge and asked if his signet was identified, to which Djarin stated it wasn't, but she assured him it would be revealed soon. She then forged a pauldron out of the beskar, reserving the excess for foundlings at Djarin's request."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Djarin completed his bounty and acquired a camtono of beskar as his reward, the Armorer was revisited by Djarin. She suggested that a full cuirass could be forged from the metal, to which he accepted. As she inspected the beskar, members of the Tribe slowly entered the armorer's quarters. She warned Djarin that the beskar would draw much attention. Paz Vizsla, a fellow member of the Tribe, commented that the beskar was Imperial property and that the Great Purge was the reason the Tribe was forced to hide. The Armorer replied by stating that surviving in such conditions was the source of their strength. Vizsla then ridiculed Djarin for conducting business with the Empire and attempted to shame him by removing his helmet, resulting in a brawl between them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She halted the fight by reminding them that the Empire no longer existed and that the beskar was returned to its rightful owners. She addressed the Tribe by describing the Way of the Mandalore and how the bounty hunter chose his way of life. The Armorer then asked Djarin if his helmet was ever removed at some point, to which he denied. Thus, she reminded everyone that their way of life was obeyed. After settling the tension, the Armorer began questioning Djarin on the condition of his armor. He stated that it was damaged by a mudhorn, but refused the signet as it wasn't killed nobly. Instead of forging the signet, the armorer forged whistling birds, explosive projectiles equipped on Mandalorian vambraces. She forged the armor and reserved some of the metal for the foundlings, again at his request."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The survivor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, Djarin and his companions Carasynthia Dune, Greef Karga, IG-11, and Grogu descended into the sewers in an attempt to escape Gideon's forces, who were looking to acquire Grogu. Din Djarin despaired when they found a pile of Mandalorian helmets, lashing out at Karga in rage, believing the Bounty Hunters' Guild had taken revenge on the enclave for helping Djarin escape. Much to his surprise, the Armorer was still residing in the tunnels, collecting pieces of armor that had been abandoned by their owners or stripped from the dead, while also defending Karga, in which the former explained that the Imperials discovered the enclave shortly after Djarin's escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Armorer assured Djarin that she hopes some of the enclave's members had escaped, but refused his offer to accompany the group off-world, saying that she intended to remain until she had reclaimed all of the available beskar. She also revealed that she knew of other beings with Grogu's abilities, classifying them as enemies of the Mandalorians, but that this individual was instead a foundling to be cared for. After discerning Djarin's affection for Grogu, she bestowed a signet on him that designated him and Grogu as \"a clan of two\" and charged him with returning the infant to its own people, at which point they parted. Shortly thereafter, a detachment of stormtroopers entered her chamber only to find the Armorer kneeling before the forge, holding her hammer and tongs. She then proceeded to attack and kill all of them with only her tools."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the skirmish on Nevarro, the Armorer had left the forge, and what remained of her workshop was taken over by Aqualish thieves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Armorer appeared wise, calm and collected. She was also very diplomatic for a Mandalorian. Without hesitation, she diffused the tension between Din Djarin and Paz Vizsla by reminding them of the way of life the Tribe followed, due to the Mandalorians being so few in number by that time. She was also a practical woman, who refused to abandon the large cache of armor pieces left behind by deceased or escaped members of the enclave until she had reclaimed what beskar she could."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Armorer melted down beskar in various shapes to forge armor and weaponry.

The visor was smaller to that of a normal female Mandalorian helmet with more rounded eyeholes instead of the typical angular design. She wore a fur coat with a brown breastplate alongside a dark brown kilt and dark green pants. She used various tools for forging weapons and armor pieces, as well as for combat. She used her forge to supply the Tribe with various items and weapons, such as whistling birds and jetpacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Armorer first appeared in the first episode of the 2019 Disney+ television show The Mandalorian, which aired on November 12, 2019.

The helmet features elements of traditional blacksmith design helmets balanced by the traditional Mandalorian armor look first seen in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, including the barn owl-shaped eyes.
