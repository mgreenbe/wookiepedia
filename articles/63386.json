Planning to capture the Emperor's Will's wealthy cargo, the Far Orbit is on its way to an ambush point near the Ringali Nebula, located in the Core Worlds' Ringali Shell. However, the frigate is pulled out of hyperspace abruptly by the gravity wells of the Imperial Navy's Immobilizer 418 cruiser Claw, one of the many Interdictors that has been sent out to locations around the Ringali Nebula to capture the Far Orbit, due to the shipping raids it has been committing against the Empire. The sudden change to realspace both injures Captain Dhas Fenoep Vedij, the commander of the Far Orbit, and knocks out the main hyperdrive of the privateer frigate. The frigate's secondary hyperdrive remains operational, however."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From there, multiple paths can be taken by the adventure scenario."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fleeing to the nebula"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Far Orbit tries to flee from the Interdictor, rushing past it to get into the Ringali Nebula behind the Imperial cruiser. Though the Claw is a faster ship, the Far Orbit beats the Interdictor to the nebula because the Imperial ship has to turn around, and its gravity wells are still draining its energy. Two minutes later, the privateers reach the nebula, where the sensors of both ships are muddled enough so that the Far Orbit can evade the Interdictor."}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "Escaping to hyperspace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Far Orbit then flees into hyperspace on its backup hyperdrive."}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "Boarding the Interdictor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After reaching the Ringali Nebula, the Far Orbit lures the Claw closer in a very risky move, while one of the privateer's shuttles moves in, and a boarding party cuts through one of the Interdictor's airlocks. The party seizes the bridge and uses stun gas to take out the rest of the crew, while the stormtroopers guarding the Interdictor are also dealt with.

Written by Timothy S. O'Brien, The Far Orbit Project was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication Pirates & Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the privateering vessel Far Orbit in its adventures. The illustrations for Hunter/Hunted were done by Storn Cook, and the scenario was three pages long. The preceding adventure was Raid on Brentaal, while the following adventure was The Grand Prize."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Of the paths that can be taken during the encounter with the Claw, the one that involves the Far Orbit fleeing into hyperspace is the one that is the most canon. This is because the Far Orbit might take too much damage fighting the Interdictor to be able to deal with the Emperor's Will later on, and the privateers might run into Imperial reinforcements that come to help the Claw if it is not dispatched early enough. Additionally, the Claw later appears in canon in the 1999 video game Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance, which is set three years after the events in The Far Orbit Project, which means that the Claw must have survived its encounter with the Far Orbit. Though the adventure says that the counterattack via boarding is the preferred path, the Claw is in Imperial hands in Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance, so the path revolving around the boarding is not the most canon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
