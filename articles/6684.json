The powerful Force wielder known as the Father described himself and his two children as such. The anchorites that lived on the planet Jakku were known to wear dark fancy clothing to control their body. They were also known to take in children as orphans. The faith of the anchorites had ties to the light side of the Force and a thousand years before the Battle of Jakku, the anchorites bound themselves to the Jedi. The Caretakers of Ahch-To's temple island reminded the scavenger Rey of the anchorites on Jakku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
