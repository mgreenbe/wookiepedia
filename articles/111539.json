The colony saw battle during the Third battle of Felucia. The famed RC-1138, clone trooper sergeant of the famed Delta Squad, had commissioned a Jedi Knight to destroy the colony so that his temporary battalion could use their colony as shortcut to the Nuro organization who was working with the Confederacy of Independent Systems and was stealing nysillin from farms. When the Jedi Knight reached the cave, they killed most of the rancor's offspring; Scratch saw and attacked the Jedi, however she was killed and failed in her attempt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
