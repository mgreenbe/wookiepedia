Believing it to be some kind of mistake, Kligson tried to call of the order.

Not one of the men he had trained and fought beside during the Clone Wars even hesitated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fortunately for Kligson, the leaders of the Grohl Liberation Front also had their doubts about the true intentions of the Empire, and had sent agents to spring an ambush of their own.
