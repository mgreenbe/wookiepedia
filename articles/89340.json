While the starship was stuck on the planet Tatooine due to a damaged hyperdrive, one of the pilots of the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps was sat at a table in the starship's main hold with a member of the Theed Hangar's ground crew. The pilot made use of the taloscope with the ground crewman watching while the Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi spoke with his Master Qui-Gon Jinn via comlink."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi later made use of a separate meson taloscope on board the ship when Jinn sent through data from a sample of the slave Anakin Skywalker's blood for analysis. After turning on the machine, Kenobi looked at the results on a monitor and discovered that Skywalker's Midi-chlorian count was off the charts, making it higher than twenty thousand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two distinct meson taloscope props were created for the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.

The name for the prop originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used in the 1999 reference book Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary, which was written by David West Reynolds. The second prop, used by Kenobi, was first identified as also being a meson taloscope by Star Wars Identities: The Exhibition, an exhibition that has been running since 2012."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
