She was raised by two Squib traders, Jaquilinbella-bessamarte and Rikkimikvonsantikki the Fifty-Fourth. Like many of her race venturing beyond their homeworld, Shimia, she wore height-augmenting robo-stilts, although she did not conceal them in shame behind a pair of trousers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, Shnozitski worked as a docking bay attendant on Nar Shaddaa. Shortly after the end of the Clone Wars, she met Obi-Wan Kenobi, who went to Nar Shaddaa to sell his starfighter, the Soulless One. Kenobi introduced himself as Ben, and asked Shnozitski to direct him to nearest local market. After receiving several Peggats from him, the Pacithhip recommended Kenobi to visit Paolo's Chop Shop. Shnozitski sent a series of holo images of the Soulless One to Paolo's Chop Shop for a decent referral fee. Immediately after that, she contacted a group of local thugs to rob Kenobi of the payment for the ship for a fifty-one-percent fee. However, the Jedi managed to defeat the attackers, and Vima-Da-Boda later promised him to punish Shnozitski for her actions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
