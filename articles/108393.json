Smaller than the Viper probe droids also utilized by the Empire, Prowlers weren't designed for long distance travel, and were instead used for local surveillance. The droids had multiple limbs, as well as a flat, disk-shaped body. A transceiver dish was positioned on the Prowler's underside, allowing it to send transmissions even after the droid was seemingly destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
