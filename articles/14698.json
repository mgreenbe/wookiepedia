The engagement was fought between Imperial TIE fighters and resistance fighter craft and ground forces that resulted in a victory for the Galactic Empire. The TIE fighters engaged the resistance's ancient starfighters and, in the first pass, destroyed all but two of the craft, which were flown by Lieutenant Blair and his wingman."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIEs formed into packs and made another sweep to finish off the enemy forces in a second pass. The TIEs destroyed one of the two last remaining fighter craft and damaged the other one, piloted by Lieutenant Blair. He then dove toward the ground, but the fighter's automatic ejection activated, making Blair the sole survivor of the resistance fighters.
