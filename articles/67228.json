The Empire intended to exploit the native Velabri as a source of slave labor. The Alliance offered what limited assistance it could, smuggling out government officials and their families just prior to the arrival of the Imperial forces. During the evacuation, Airen Cracken saved a transport carrying the family of Quillin Durand. In gratitude, Durand swore a Velabri Bloodvow to repay the debt to Cracken."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the evacuation, the free Velabri joined the fledging Alliance, forming a strike force known as the Velabri Lancers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
