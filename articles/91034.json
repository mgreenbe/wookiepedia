Following a battle at Bespin, Jedi Master Denia sent an Alderaanian Resistance team to the Almas Academy to acquire the Qornah Holocron, which she believed could help her to identify the species of the Imperial slaves she had seen on Bespin. The team landed on Almas and faced many hazards in the Academy, including traps and Imperial forces. Eventually, they encountered Inquisitor Valin Draco, who they attacked and almost killed. The mission was a success and they obtained the holocron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
