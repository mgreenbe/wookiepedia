It was a series of docking facilities located in the Fische's Cove close to the Jackrab Hole. The Tethers were the cheapest docking facilities available on the comet. However, transporting cargo from them to the living areas of the Point Nadir could be more expensive than paying the docking fee at The Slips, the expensive but well-accommodated docks at the end of the Cove. Additionally, Anjiliac clan was known to occasionally send thugs to collect additional fees from captains and crews that persistently docked in The Tethers in an attempt to get a free ride."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
