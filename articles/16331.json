At one point, he was captured by the bounty hunting duo Zuckuss and 4-LOM, and was kept prisoner aboard their starship, the Mist Hunter, for weeks. Eventually, Ford's family hired Han Solo and his co-pilot Chewbacca to rescue him. When Zuckuss and 4-LOM kidnapped him, hoping to collect the bounty placed on his head by Rekias Nodo, Solo managed to free himself and Ford thanks to Chewbacca, who had been smuggled aboard the Mist Hunter in a large barrel. Ford was, in turn, placed in the barrel, which was launched into space with a homing beacon so his family could find him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
