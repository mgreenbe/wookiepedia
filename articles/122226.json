The archaeologist was initially wary of Nod's intentions, but the Lorrdian was able to convince him that she was acting on behalf of the Sisterhood in selling the items. Once he had handed over his money, she decided to double-cross him and left with both the items and the credits.

As such, she was forced to live in a cloistered fashion, which soon bored her. With no funds whatsoever, she realized that in order to start a new life for herself, she would have to procure them from somewhere. Not caring how she went about it, Nod stole several valuable artifacts from her temple, and departed Lorrd post haste, for the galactic capital of Coruscant. There, she continued to wear her religious fatigues to mask her criminal intentions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Intending to pawn the stolen relics, she was contacted by Artuo Pratuhr, an archeologist who wanted to buy them for the Galactic Museum. Nod met with Pratuhr and his assistant, Zey Nep, at the Uscru Entertainment District's Outlander Club in 22 BBY, at the height of the Separatist Crisis. Initially, the archeologist was suspicious of Nod's intentions, but she claimed that the Sisterhood was selling the items to raise desperately needed funds. The clandestine nature of the sale was to conceal the fact that the Sisterhood was in such financial trouble that it needed to sell the relics in the first place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pratuhr agreed to the deal, but the criminal atmosphere of Galactic City caused Nod to make a snap judgment\u2014drawing a blaster on the archeologist, she took his money, and fled the Outlander Club for an outbound flight. A few days later, while waiting at the dock, Nod was confronted by Pratuhr, who caught up to her. She did not feel threatened, however\u2014she was armed, he was not. What Nod had not accounted for was the presence of Nep, who, standing behind her and disguised as a refugee, had her own blaster trained on her. Realizing that her plans were thwarted, she returned the money. Pratuhr then took her to the local authorities, and returned the relics to the Sisterhood. Nod was then incarcerated in CoCo Penitentiary for a considerable amount of time, during which she was pardoned by the Sisterhood for her crimes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Sisterhood of Beatific Countenance required lifelong servitude, Seib Nod did not find her servitude spiritually fulfilling in the slightest, and so, due to her boredom, sought out more material possessions. She was desperate enough to break free of her situation by turning to crime as a way of raising money for herself. Once she had committed one criminal act, she was prone to lying to others, and she found herself so changed by her one act that she felt free to perform another. When she was jailed, she was at such a point that the forgiveness of her fellow Sisters meant nothing to her. Nod had light skin. As with all members of the Sisterhood, Nod had scripture tatooed on her body, including distinctive facial patterns. While traditionally members of the Sisterhood wore their robes and masks outside their temple to hide their skin, Nod maintained her religious garb in order to hide her mercenary nature."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Seib Nod first appeared, unnamed, in the 2002 film by George Lucas, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, during the Outlander Club scene.

Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels identified the character as \"Nob Seib,\" leading \"What's The Story?\" author Tim Veekhoven, the following year, to ask continuity editor Leland Chee as to what the true spelling was.
