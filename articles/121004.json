The pirates in question possessed several starfighters typically operated by the Rebel Alliance, attacking with several squads of X-wings, A-wings, and Y-wings. The Alliance quickly deployed a responsive force led by Keyan Farlander to rush to the convoy's aid and to drive off the Scorpion. The assault was quickly thwarted, resulting in the frigate and her squadrons being destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
