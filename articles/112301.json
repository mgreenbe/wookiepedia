Used as part of the city's gas mining operation, the reactor stalk acted as a conduit, transporting gas between the reactor bulb and the overhead reactor shafts. Gas mined from the lower atmosphere of Bespin by tractor beams was forced through an opening in the underside of the bulb and transported through the reactor stalk, eventually reaching the reactor shafts where processing vanes extracted the Tibanna gas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The reactor stalk first appeared unnamed in the second Star Wars film, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, released in 1980.
