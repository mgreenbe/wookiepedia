In this capacity, he had a number of dealings with the bounty hunter Boddu Bocck.

She was known to work heavily for the Rebel Alliance, as well as making a mockery of Imperial Customs. She eluded Birket a number of times, and so when she \"kidnapped\" a boy from Brentaal, he decided to hire Bocck and his associates to aid in capturing her. Birket ventured into the lower depths of Cloud City, to the seedy section of Port Town to confront Birket. Offering 5,000 credits each up front to Bocck and his associates Beylyssa and Tolga, along with another 25,000 on completion of the mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Birket then traveled with Bocck to Tatooine to capture Okeefe's companion, Tru'eb Cholakk. In Mos Eisley, Birket made use of a Kubaz spy to tail Cholakk. While this alerted the Twi'lek that something was up, it also allowed Birket to set a trap around his quarry's ship, the Luudrian Star. With Cholakk captured, the Major ordered the ship flown to Okeefe's prearranged rendezvous point, Dead Bantha Gulch. There, he succeeded in capturing Okeefe, only to have her \"captive\", Darrik, escape. The boy had actually voluntarily accompanied the smuggler in a form of apprenticeship. On the loose, he managed to free Okeefe and Cholakk. Together they took Birket captive and fled the planet. Okeefe planned to turn the Major over to the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Major carried a walking stick with a knife embedded in the end.
