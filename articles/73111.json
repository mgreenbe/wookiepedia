Kaal was skeptical at joining the Sith Inquisitor, thinking that the latter had killed Zash, (when, in fact, Khem Val was the culprit), but Corrin convinced him and they pledge allegiance to their new Master. In 3642 BBY, Darth Thanaton decreed that all apprentices and disciples of Darth Zash be eliminated, which lead to the deaths of Corrin and Kaal at the hands of Lord Cineratus on Quesh.
