Any individuals wearing the color were considered valid military targets during times of conflict. During the Galactic Civil War, many of the Chagrians who joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic chose to work the color of war into their uniform, generally in the form of epaulettes, piping, combat webbing, or a combination of all three. This promoted solidarity between the Chagrian soldiers, and helped to identify individual Chagrians' dedication to the cause."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The color of war was first mentioned in Lead by Example, a 2016 supplement for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Age of Rebellion system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
