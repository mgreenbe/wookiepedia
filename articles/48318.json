On the planet's rocky surface, Captain Phasma orders the stormtroopers of the FN Corps to charge up a rocky mound. Finn trips while scaling the hill and also loses his helmet, which smacks the top of Captain Phasma's helmet. Phasma growls at him while Finn bows his head in embarrassment. Later, Phasma orders the stormtroopers to attack a large green, fire-breathing creature with four legs. The stormtroopers jump on top of the creature.

While fiddling with the controls, Finn is sucked down the garbage chute and lands on a pile of trash. Finn senses movement in the darkness and flees but trips.
