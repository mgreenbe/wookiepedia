The Corporate Alliance Policy Administration Directorate was reorganized along with other droid armies into more effective fighting forces. It was dissolved, along with most of its Separatist battle droids, when Darth Vader deactivated the master control signal after assassinating Passel Argente, his aide, and the rest of the Separatist Council on Mustafar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Forces"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Vehicles"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Organic Forces"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Starships"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The command structure of the Koorivar Fusiliers was similar to that of the Galactic Republic's Grand Army, though not equal in size.
