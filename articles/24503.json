The celebrations were led by Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, who presented the speech to a massive audience on the steps of the old Jedi Temple. The main event of the celebration was the incineration of the dead Jedi's lightsabers, including that of Grand Master Yoda, whose lightsaber was personally thrown into the flames by Amedda. Subjected to the searing heat, the kyber crystals within the lightsabers were unable to withstand it and exploded angrily in a great burst of blue light, forcing those closest to cower away in shock. The event was overseen by Emperor Palpatine and his newly-christened apprentice Darth Vader. While the event occurred, they discussed the history and creation of Sith lightsabers and Vader was given the task of constructing his own by Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems entered its conclusion by 19 BBY, Sheev Palpatine, Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, and secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, had continued to gain emergency power from the Galactic Senate. By the final stages of the war, a group of senators formed the Delegation of 2,000 to counter Palpatine's growing power and restore authority back to the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, Sidious declared the Jedi, keepers of peace and justice in the galaxy for thousands of years, as traitors, following a supposed assassination attempt. Sidious acted quickly, and subdued the alleged Jedi insurrection with the help of his newly designated Sith apprentice, Darth Vader, who was previously the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker family and the Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. Sidious also sent Vader to destroy the Separatist Council on Mustafar, and shut down the Separatist Droid Army, bringing the Clone Wars to an end. After the Separatists were defeated and the Jedi Order was destroyed, Sidious transformed the Galactic Republic into the first Galactic Empire, and established himself as its Emperor. The formation of the Empire was met by strong public and political support, with reactions to Palpatine's speech in the Galactic Senate Chamber being that of mass applause, although a number of senators watched in shock and disappointment as the Republic was washed away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The celebration"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the proclamation of the New Order, Sidious met with Vader, who was defeated in a duel on Mustafar against his former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and had suffered extensive injuries, injuries that required Vader to wear a life support suit. After leaving the Grand Medical Facility Sidious and Vader made their way to the celebratory event outside of the former Jedi Temple on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Sidious and Vader watched on from the Jedi Temple, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda conducted a speech on the supposed treasonous acts of the Jedi, and that society was now safe from their evil. Amedda continued, flanked by stormtroopers and Royal Guardsmen, and threw Yoda's lightsaber into an incinerator with the lightsabers of other lost Jedi. During Amedda's speech, Sidious lectured Vader on the newly formed Empire and that no one knew the true intentions of them. Sidious continued and spoke of kyber crystals, and bleeding them to turn the color of the lightsaber's blade crimson. Around that time, Amedda had the incinerator turned on, and the heat of the fire caused the crystals within the many lightsabers to explode. The explosion caused Amedda and several troopers to be knocked down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the event, Sidious transported Vader to the Mid Rim with his Theta-class T-2c shuttle and while traveling, Sidious asked how Vader felt in his suit, to which Vader replied that it was acceptable. When they landed, Vader asked why they had come to the Mid Rim, and Sidious replied that he had high hopes for what Vader and himself could accomplish, but informed Vader that he first needed a lightsaber, calling back to their conversation at the celebration event."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious gave Vader the quest of finding a living Jedi so Vader had someone to take the crystal from, and noted that it was a daunting task given how they had eliminated the Order. Still, Sidious proclaimed that he had great faith in Vader's resourcefulness and capability. As Vader disembarked, Sidious stated that he had left a ship for Vader's use, but it appeared that it was stolen by a band of outlaws, and stated that the galaxy cried out for order. Vader left and sought to recapture his starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The celebration for the eradication of the Jedi Order was first depicted in Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 1, a canon comic released in 2017, written by Charles Soule, and pencilled by Giuseppe Camuncoli."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
