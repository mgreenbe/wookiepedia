Unlike some other Imperial I-class Star Destroyers, such as Lawbringer and Relentless, the hangars within Devastator's ventral docking bay were split into two smaller sections, and the aft side featured a cover, so that the bays behind were not visible. Additionally, its tractor beam targeting array with diagonal support beams (located between its two deflector shield generator domes) was replaced with a communications tower with vertical support beams."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early years"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Devastator was the last of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyers to lumber out of Kuat Drive Yards before the facility began producing the Imperial II-class.

Appearing over the planet Scarif near the conclusion of the Battle of Scarif, the arrival of the Devastator proceeded to cut off the escape of the Alliance Fleet, immediately destroying a GR-75 medium transport by colliding with it, and disabling several ships, including the Rebel flagship Profundity which had received the plans for the Death Star. After boarding the Profundity, Vader proceeded to cut through Rebel troopers who were delivering the plans. Vader failed, and the plans were delivered to Leia Organa, onboard the Tantive IV, a CR90 corvette that was docked onboard the Profundity. Fleeing at the last second, the Tantive IV escaped from the system and Vader pursued the starship in the Devastator."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Tatooine"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving over Tatooine, a brief skirmish ensued over the planet, resulting in the Star Destroyer successfully capturing the Tantive IV.

The sole exception was R2-D2 and C-3PO's pod\u2014which even then was only because Imperial Gunners did not detect any life signs in the pod, and dismissed it as a malfunction."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Cylo incident"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader used the Devastator to track Cylo's fleet of Whale-ships in the Crushank Nebulae, courtesy of information from the doctor's colleague Thlu-Ry. As the Star Destroyer approached the nebulae, many of the abominations fled. This caused Vader to lead the chase in his TIE Advanced, supported by many TIE/ln starfighters. However, Cylo's flagship broke off from the main group, and attacked the Devastator with an ion pulse. With the ship disabled, Vader flew his TIE into Tulon Voidgazer's ship, just before the fleet could jump to hyperspace. They emerged over Kuat, the construction site of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor, which was to be under the command of Grand General Cassio Tagge. Cylo took over the Super Star Destroyer, but was soon killed by Vader, along with all of his abominations and staff. Due to Tagge's trust in Cylo, he was demoted by Emperor Palpatine, then killed by Vader. The Executor was given to Vader for defeating Cylo."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New command"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the transfer of his flag, Admiral Jhared Montferrat took command of the Devastator.
