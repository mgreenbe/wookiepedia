He was the commander of the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps, and the leader of Bravo Flight. Oli\u00e9's talents also landed him the job of the Queen's personal pilot, often flying the Naboo Royal Starship in the service of Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Due to Naboo's pacifistic nature, Oli\u00e9's skills were rarely in use, although he saw military action during the Invasion of Naboo. Following the battle, Oli\u00e9 suffered an inner-ear injury and was eventually succeeded as Naboo's royal pilot by Daneska Varbar\u00f3s. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Oli\u00e9 had become part of the Amidalans, a resistance group of Naboo which desired to hunt down and kill those responsible for Amidala's mysterious death, facing the Sith Lord Darth Vader when the Sith was tricked into going to Naboo by Sab\u00e9 so they could kill him for his role in the former queen's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Invasion of Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time that Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation, his only superior in the Royal Naboo Security Forces was Captain Panaka. Towards the beginning of the invasion, Bravo Leader Oli\u00e9, along with the rest of his pilots, were captured and arrested by Federation forces when they swept into Theed. Their Queen was also arrested, and Naboo was subjugated swiftly by the droid army. However, they did not anticipate the intervention of two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who were able to rescue the Queen, her entourage, Oli\u00e9, and his pilots. Oli\u00e9 had no time to comprehend what was going on, as he was quickly ushered into the Queen's Royal Starship, and ordered to set a heading for Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Escape would not come easily, as the Federation's blockade would provide Oli\u00e9 with a significant challenge. He was flying an unarmed transport against a fleet of heavily-armed capital ships. Although he tried his best, the ship sustained heavy damage during the escape, and lost its shield generator. R2-D2, one of the ship's astromech droids, repaired the shields, which allowed Oli\u00e9 to pilot the ship through the blockade to safety."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the escape, the hyperdrive suffered enough damage to prevent the ship from finishing the journey to Coruscant. Kenobi suggested that they land on Tatooine, a desert planet, and purchase the parts needed to make repairs.

After a few days, they returned with both the parts and a new member of the group\u2014nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker, an aspiring pilot. Oli\u00e9 took to the boy and offered him a few short lessons in starship piloting. When the Queen's pleas with the Galactic Senate to send aid to her besieged planet went unheeded, she decided to return and take matters into her own hands. Oli\u00e9 flew the group back to Naboo to confront their Trade Federation adversaries. Oli\u00e9's skills, combined with a lessened Trade Federation space presence, allowed them to land on the planet with enough time for Amidala to contact the native Gungans to enlist their help."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The battle for Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Queen had a plan\u2014the Gungan Grand Army would assemble and draw the droid forces out of Theed, she and Panaka would then sneak into the city and capture the Viceroy of the Trade Federation, Nute Gunray, and Oli\u00e9 and his pilots would attempt to knock out the Droid Control Ship.

The Federation launched Vulture droids in attempt to counter the Naboo offensive, and succeeded in destroying many of the N-1 fighters. Only upon reaching the enemy ship did Oli\u00e9 realize that the deflector shield was too strong, and that the battle seemed hopeless. Just when it seemed as though the Naboo fighters would fail in their mission, the Control Ship started to explode from the inside to Oli\u00e9's surprise as none of the Naboo fighters managed to hit it. To his surprise, a fighter flew out of the exploding ship piloted by Anakin Skywalker who had inadvertently joined the battle, landed inside the ship and damaged the main reactor. As the Droid Control Ship exploded, Bravo Flight jubilantly returned to their liberated homeworld to celebrate.

He was tricked into going to Naboo by Sab\u00e9, and once he arrived there, the Amidalans tried to kill him.

Recalling his meeting with Oli\u00e9 aboard the Queen's Royal Starship over thirty years ago, Vader asked Oli\u00e9 if he met Amidala and Skywalker and if he saw Amidala die, to which Oli\u00e9 told that he fought with them during the Battle of Naboo but he just buried Amidala. Vader thus responded that Oli\u00e9 and the other Amidalans were then of no use to him and broke free of the projector. Oli\u00e9 ordered the Amidalans to fight for Padm\u00e9 and Anakin, but Vader and his troopers easily dispatched them before Vader impaled Oli\u00e9 through his back with his lightsaber.
