The team sported two long-armed wing-strikers, but had a center striker who threw erratically and fullbacks who tended to turn the wrong way and miss tackles. Approximately six years before the Battle of Yavin, this team played a match against the AppSci SaberCats, who had been doing well for the season, only having lost one match to date. The SaberCats thrashed the Thrashers with a final score of 44-18, leaving the Thrashers feeling exhausted with their shoulders slumped by the game's third quarter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
