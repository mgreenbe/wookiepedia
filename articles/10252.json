Fearing that leaders such as Luke Skywalker was never going to return, the Contessa promoted Wedge Antilles to the rank of commander and tasked him with rebuilding his squadron. Antilles, along with his newly appointed executive officer, Lieutenant Wes Janson, recruited pilots into a reformed Red Squadron. They were given only days to complete their training before being assigned a mission. A nearby asteroid housing an old mining station was being used as a pirate base, which threatened the safety of the Alliance's rendezvous point, and therefore had to be destroyed. Red Squadron initially launched a scouting mission to gather intelligence and plan the mission over the following day."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antilles, led the squadron, in a pincer maneuvre on the pirate base, using two flights of three X-wings that converged from opposite directions with the objective of total destruction. The squadron was split into four flights: Antilles' and Janson's flights hit the targets on the landing field, while Scotian's and Elar's flights ran interference for Antilles' and Janson's flights respectively. Sila Kott and Tomer Darpen formed Antilles's wingmates, Keyser Salm and Barlon Hightower were Janson's, Ix Ixstra and Cinda Tarheel were Will Scotian's, and finally Grizz Frix and Penn Zowlie were Bela Elar's. The pirates launched Z-95 Headhunters, a Nighthawk fighter and an interceptor, resulting in a dogfight with the squadron's X-wing cover. Janson's torpedos took out the hangar, however Elar spotted a modified freighter, the pirate mothership, that tried to escape. Antilles, however, managed to destroy it before it was able to make the jump to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Of the twelve pilots that participated, only nine returned from the mission to the fleet's flagship Home One, after the deaths of Barlon Hightower, Ix Ixstra and Penn Zowlie.
