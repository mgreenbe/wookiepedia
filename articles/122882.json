It was to here that the leaders of the Confederacy of Independent Systems retreated at the end of the conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The war room was part of a secret command facility built onto the side of the Mustafar mining complex to act as a secure bunker for the Separatist Council. A landing pad was located outside the chamber, with a control room annex used to monitor approaching vessels. An observation balcony running the length of the war room's exterior provided a hellish view of the Mustafar mining operations far below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The war room itself was dominated by two large holographic display tables set into the chamber floor. The walls were covered in control consoles, holodisplays and status readouts from across the mining facility. The holotables displayed live feeds from various battlefronts during the Clone Wars, keeping the Separatists up-to-date on events in the galaxy while they were safely locked away in the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the war room was one of the most secure locations in the galaxy, it did not stop the new Sith Lord, Darth Vader, from embarking on his murderous rampage. Convinced that Lord Vader had been sent to look after them, the Separatist leaders were shocked when the Dark Lord turned on them inside their own War Room. With corpses already dropping to the floor, the surviving council members fled into the Conference Room annex, which would soon become their tomb. Later, the epic duel between Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi progressed through the bloody war room and out into the main collection facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
