Instead of using blasters, their hands ended in claws which could block lightsabers. They were distinguished from their B1 battle droid cousins by the slate-gray coloring covering their entire bodies. They were also taller than the standard battle droid model. Their claws can lift up to 10 times their own weight. The design was produced because the Trade Federation wanted a dedicated close-range combat droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These droids were replaced by the B2 Grapple Droid during the Clone Wars, a variant of the B2 super battle droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "B1 grapple droids appear in the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I Jedi Power Battles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
