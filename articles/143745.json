Searching for a new master, they accept positions as servers waiting tables at Doodnik's Caf\u00e9. They clumsily bumble their way about the place, spilling drinks and causing several disturbances. After one too many mishaps, Doodnik Sharpelz terminates their employ."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sollag Den enters the caf\u00e9 and offers the crime lord Kleb Zellock 40,000 keshels to find someone named Mon Julpa before the assassin droid IG-88 finds him. Kleb accepts the offer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two droids go to a nearby auction block and place themselves for sale. A young miner named Jann Tosh purchases them as well as a shoddy-looking work android. Kleb Zellock and his aide-de-camp, Yorpo Mog, arrive and notice that Mon Julpa is disguised as the android. Greedy for the 40,000-keshel reward, they begin to give chase. Having no idea who the third strange droid truly is, Jann and the others escape from Kleb's attack on a wheel bike. They drive out to the mine operated by Jann's uncle, Putch Gundarian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After settling down, they discover that the third android is not a robot at all, but a mute, addle-brained Tammuz-an.

He sends Yorpo to sanction the alien and a fight breaks out. Jann wrestles about with Yorpa until a woman named Jessica Meade enters and zaps the large brown alien with a miniature stunner. Zellock gets the upper hand however and captures Jann, Kez-Iban and the droids. He puts them to work in the mines digging for Nergon-14. Before long, Sollag finds Kez-Iban and presents him with the royal scepter of Tammuz-an. Upon accepting the scepter, Kez-Iban recovers his faculties and acknowledges that he is in fact Mon Julpa, the rightful heir to the throne of Tammuz-an. An evil vizier had used magic to strip him of his identity in order to take the throne for himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mon Julpa and the others decide to escape from the mines. They discover that Zellock's ore-cutters are cutting pockets into the bedrock, which is releasing flammable gas into the caverns. Too much of the gas will ignite the Nergon-14 causing a massive explosion. They fight past Zellock's miner droids and make their way into the criminal's office. Zellock plans on abandoning them and keeping all of his money for himself. Yorpa is angered to discover that Zellock plans to leave him behind and turns on him. The droids manage to knock Zellock out and deliver him to the nearest security station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mon Julpa is grateful to his new friends for helping him to regain his faculties.
