Later Kyp Durron's student Miko Reglia plunged down with his T-65 X-wing starfighter. He was also captured but died in Yuuzhan Vong custody. When the New Republic managed an offensive against the Yuuzhan Vong, they rescued Danni Quee and destroyed the battle coordinator yammosk, both inside Helska's frozen core. They managed to super cool Helska by using shielding ships to evaporate the surface ice, which upon re-warming caused the planet to shatter. Da'Gara and the yammosk were killed, and the Praetorite Vong were defeated and destroyed. After losing this fight, the Yuuzhan Vong were humiliated, and accelerated their invasion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
