Its Coreward boundary bordered the Inner Rim, and, moving clockwise, it also bordered the Itopol, Chitarghar, Trans-Jardeen, Extorin, and Thand sectors. No major hyperspace routes passed through the sector. The area within the sector was within space that was considered well-explored by 25 BBY, and it was within unaligned space during the Clone Wars. In 25 ABY the average population of a star system in the sector was less than one million. It contained the Agash system, which contained Ergeshui, the swampy homeworld of the sentient Ergesh species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
