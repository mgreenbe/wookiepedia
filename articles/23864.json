The G51 communications array had been commissioned by Galactic Empress Marasiah Fel following the end of the Second Imperial Civil War in 138 ABY to improve communications between Coruscant and the Outer Rim systems. That same year, the Imperial Knight Yalta Val was sent to the Carreras system to supervise the finishing stages of the Carreras communications array. However, he was ambushed and captured by the Sith apprentice Darth Wredd, who stole his armor and assumed his identity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Disguised as an Imperial Knight, Darth Wredd took command of Governor Biala's security forces and the communications array. He was able to remotely control the station and fly it towards his hiding place on the dark planet of Mala. Darth Wredd then used the Carreras communications array to broadcast a live recording and attempted to execute Val. However, Darth Wredd was thwarted by the junk dealer Ania Solo who freed Val and fled offworld. Shortly later, the Carreras communications array was destroyed during a collision with Mala. Darth Wredd also survived the explosion and launched an insurgency against both the One Sith and the Galactic Federation Triumvirate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
