The crew of the Uhumele docked here during their search for Dass Jennir. The city was garrisoned with stormtroopers when they arrived, but they managed to get through without much trouble. Beyghor Sahdett, Bomo Greenbark, Meekerdin-maa, and Ko Vakier later raided an Imperial guard station to hack into the Empire's databanks for clues on Jennir.
