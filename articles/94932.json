One of the four children of Izax and Scyva, Nahut was considered to be gray, formless and cold, and was denied worship by all except his mother Scyva. The Old Ways taught that Zakuulans should not follow Nahut into darkness, but should instead \"light the way\" to bring Nahut home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nahut originated as an experimental Iokath titanic wardroid superweapon, built by an ancient, but highly advanced people.
