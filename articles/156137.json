The comet's orbit intersected with that of the planet Needan, homeworld of the Geelan species. The comet eventually slammed into Needan's surface, forcing the planet into a wider orbit around its sun and cooling the surface temperature. The change forced the Geelan to move into domed cities to protect themselves from the cold."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
