Members of the Hutt species viewed the world as part of outlying Hutt domains, and the Republic colonization as an act of war. In response, the Hutts backed raids on Imram and other similarly settled worlds that led to the enslavement or death of many colonists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The events on Imram were later recorded in a report that was prepared as background for a public advisory against Rimward Republic colonization.
