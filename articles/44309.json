Prior to its destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's reign, the eatery known as Dex's Diner on the planet Coruscant served the pie. The diner's owner, Dexter Jettster, wrote in the menu of his diner that he had never seen a stranger animal than the pie's main ingredient, Endorian chicken, but had discovered that it was not without its uses. Along with the chicken, the pie was made with the vegetables celonslay, space-carrots, and Antarian peas, and was baked within a flaky pom seed flour crust. The pie was sold for 6.5 credits as a lunch item along with a choice of lunch side. The meat of the Endorian chicken in the dish was described by Jettster as succulent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Endorian chicken pot pie was mentioned in \"Dining at Dex's,\" a 2009 Hyperspace-exclusive article which was written by Gregory Walker and formatted as an in-universe menu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
