The majority of sources referred to the capital as Coral City. Dark Apprentice and several other sources identified the capital as Coral Depths City. The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia later identified that Coral City and Coral Depths City were the same city. In 2011, Dac was featured in the first three episodes of the fourth season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. The city shown in these episodes was identified as the capital city of Mon Calamari City in the young reader novel The Clone Wars: Warriors of the Deep. However, the city presented in the Clone Wars media was an underwater city, while Coral City was identified as a floating city. However, the 2015 roleplaying sourcebook Fly Casual later established that Coral Depths City and Mon Calamari City were one and the same.
