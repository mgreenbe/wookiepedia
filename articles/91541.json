After Ventress survived Dooku's assassination attempt, she sought revenge by going to her fellow Nightsisters for aid. Taking Karis and Naa'leth to Serenno, Ventress attempted to assassinate Tyranus, but the Sith Lord repelled the attack, defeating his assailants."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Asajj Ventress and her two Nightsisters became invisible and infiltrated Tyranus's palace. Ventress shot a poison dart into Tyranus's neck that blinded him, although he could still sense them through the Force and mistook them as Jedi. Ventress attacked Dooku with a lightsaber, beginning their duel in the Count's bedroom and eventually leading into his office. Ventress, who had managed to stay disguised during the entire confrontation, managed to disarm the Sith Lord and was about to strike the killing blow, but Tyranus defended himself by striking Ventress and her accomplices with Force lightning, throwing them out the window and over a cliff, ending the attack. However, the three Nightsisters survived and returned to Dathomir."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his attackers' use of Jedi lightsabers, Tyranus mistakenly believed that the Jedi had tried to assassinate him.

To arrange the plan, Mother Talzin contacted Tyranus, offering to provide one of the Nightbrothers to be his new assassin. Tyranus, seeing this as an opportunity to get the new apprentice he desired, agreed. After selecting Savage Opress to be their pawn, Talzin presented the hulking Zabrak to Tyranus, who was pleased with his new warrior, unaware of his true loyalties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
