Kaarde and his partner Quelev Tapper learned of the Morodins' sentience; however, Gamgalon learned of their discovery. To prevent this information from leaking out, Gamgalon, along with his employee Falmal and three other Krish, detained the duo and later killed Tapper when he attempted to escape. Gamgalon and group led Kaarde through the jungle until Gamgalon, along with Falmal, was killed by Mara Jade Skywalker with a blaster shot to the torso as she rescued Kaarde."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gamgalon also once attempted to remove a nine-hundred-meter-long space slug from an asteroid in the Hoth system for a one hundred thousand credit bounty\u2014though he foresaw that the difficulty of such an operation may have incurred additional costs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
