She told him about the ongoing conflict with Darth Skotia, her own superior. She wanted him dead as he was preventing her from achieving her plans so she sent her apprentice to infiltrate Darth Skotia's bunker and retrieve an artifact, the Trandoshan relic, which would be of use in the future duel with Skotia. First, however, he'd have to get the bunker's plans from a rebellious slave group near the bunker. The Apprentice complied so, and easily acquired the plans from the rebel slaves after slaughtering them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Infiltrating the bunker"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Apprentice reached the bunker's entrance and started fighting off Darth Skotia's Guard, a considerable force which Skotia had been amassing inside. The relic was in Skotia's own reliquary which was well closed. The Apprentice moved on to destroy several monitoring stations to disable the reliquary's locks. Each of the stations was personally guarded by one of Skotia's Sith apprentice but they were easily killed. After succeeding in destroying the stations and leaving a path of dead corpses behind, the Apprentice moved on to enter the reliquary but there was however one obstacle. Lord Ogathu was protecting the entrance and they fought to determine the Relic's fate. The Apprentice came victorious mortally wounding Ogathu and proceeded with retrieving the relic. However, Ogathu managed to recover and attempted to strike at the Apprentice, only to be killed by the latter by force lightning. The Apprentice then left the bunker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The relic would later be used in the duel with Darth Skotia where it turned Skotia's own Trandoshan acolytes and bodyguards against him.
