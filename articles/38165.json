Interstellar ships that made use of a dimensional drive were rather slow when compared to those that would later use hyperdrives. Due to this fact, crews were placed in suspended animation through the process of carbonite freezing to accommodate for trips that could last decades or even centuries. This technology was used by Sleeper ships from Coruscant to colonize planets like Kuat, Alderaan, and those in the Tion Cluster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
