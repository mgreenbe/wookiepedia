By the time of the Naboo Crisis in 32 BBY, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who served as a senator of the Galactic Republic under his public persona of Palpatine, possessed the Bane Statue. He kept it in his apartment suite on Coruscant, among a vast collection of unusual art objects that he either picked up on his travels or received from fellow politicians. Later on, Palpatine replaced the Republic by his First Galactic Empire, anointing himself Emperor. By 4 ABY, the Bane Statue had accompanied him to the second Death Star orbiting the Forest Moon of Endor. Along with other relics of Palpatine's senatorial suite, including a Triffian carving and a duo of fossilized trumpet weeds holding marine pearls, the Bane Statue resided in a private suite of the hundred-story Emperor's Tower which also housed the throne room. Ultimately, the Death Star was destroyed with everything it contained."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bane Statue was one of the art objects originally created for the apartment suite of Senator Palpatine in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (May 19, 1999).
