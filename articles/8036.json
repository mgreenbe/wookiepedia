Viest was a former slave and extremely sadistic; frequently making business associates partake in a specially designed game with a high risk of death in order to earn her approval or mercy. When Viest captured Han Solo, Leia Organa came to rescue him, using an insane mining droid to smash through Viest's control center. Just as Viest killed Caline Metara, two blaster shots from Sian Tesar and Alia Terae killed her at once."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
