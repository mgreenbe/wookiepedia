The Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing took part in the raid, bringing about many deaths. The New Republic Intelligence operative Caern Adan came to suspect the fighter wing's involvement in the attack and told his theory in a conversation with the reprogrammed IT-O Interrogation Unit IT-O several weeks after the Battle of Endor. When Adan and Lieutenant Yrica Quell later reviewed a massacre at Anx Minor aboard the Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ship Lodestar, Quell considered the event as thorough and in line as the 204th's actions at Beauchen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scene"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The raid on Beauchen was first mentioned in the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, the first volume of the Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron trilogy which was written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
