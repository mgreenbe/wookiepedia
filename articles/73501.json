During the Imperial Era, a group of prisoners on Kalarassi Five broke out of prison. Several bounty hunters, including IG-88, went to investigate, but were tricked into searching the slums by the escaped prisoners, who had disguised themselves in stormtrooper armor. However, IG-88 stayed behind, but was surrounded by the prisoners and destroyed.
