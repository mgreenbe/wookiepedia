Starting at the fringes of known space, the Mandalorian advance met with success, forcing Republic Navy Captain Saul Karath to throw up a defensive cordon in the Outer Rim known as the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line. Heavy fighting occurred along the barrier, and four months after the Mandalorian capture of the Flashpoint Stellar Research Station, the Mandalorians decided to attack one of the worlds on the line, Suurja. Over the next few weeks, Suurja, an agriworld with about 16 million colonists, was the host of three inconclusive battles. Although the two sides had already been fighting over Suurja for a period of about six weeks, both the Republic and the Mandalorians were still strong enough to continue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Karath led Republic naval forces again in opposition to the Mandalorians.

In the immediate aftermath, reports of provisioning problems with the Republic troops on Suurja surfaced, despite a recent levy to keep them better supplied. Soon after the end of the fourth battle, it and the other three skirmishes were reported upon in an edition of the Taris Holofeed news report from the nearby world Taris. In the release, Republic defense official Catronus Steffans was quoted as optimistically saying that the stalemate at Suurja represented a success of Karath's defensive cordon, and that it heralded an upcoming Republic pushback."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fourth battle of Suurja garnered its first, and thus far only, mention in The Taris Holofeed: Prime Edition, a short postscript to the 2006 comic Knights of the Old Republic 0.
