One year later, General Phennir and three other pilots of the 181st went on a diplomatic mission to the neutral planet Adumar, whose government also invited representatives from the New Republic. Phennir and his men won the hearts of the locals by frequently engaging them in customary aerial duels to the death, and they pledged themselves to the nation state of Cartann when its leader declared war on the rest of the planet.

His first action was to lure enemy forces into a trap at the planet Gilatter VIII, where mines awaited their ships.

Although the Five Worlds were members of the Confederation, Koyan independently used their Centerpoint superweapon against the Alliance, and Phennir responded by cutting the Corellians off from Confederate aid until Koyan was removed from power by his Minister of Information, Denjax Teppler.

Despite his lack of faith in the Empire, Phennir continued to serve for a further nine years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phennir was eager for glory, and he briefly strayed from his mission profile on Brentaal IV to challenge Tycho Celchu, one of the New Republic's best pilots. Despite his ambition, Phennir was indifferent toward the medal that he received from Isoto, maintaining the views from his earlier Imperial service that his actions during the battle had been just another opportunity to kill his enemies. He had no moral quandaries with killing, and he eagerly and frequently participated in Cartann's customary duels\u2013to\u2013the\u2013death while on Adumar. His actions and his respect for Adumari customs gained him considerable honor with the locals, which Phennir was quick to smugly flaunt to Wedge Antilles, his opposite number. Phennir had a low opinion of New Republic forces and was furious whenever Antilles upstaged him in front of their Adumari hosts. Confident that it would lead to Adumar joining the Empire, he was quick to pledge himself and his men to Cartann's war effort when the nation's Perator declared his intention to conquer the planet by force. Phennir's reputation during his Imperial career was one of combat savagery and backstabbing politics, but by 43 ABY, it had evolved into one of honorable service and pragmatism."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phennir disdained politicians, and during his service as Supreme Commander of the Confederation military, he openly insulted both Sadras Koyan and Denjax Teppler to their faces. He berated the former for using Centerpoint Station without his blessing, and he cut the entire Corellian system off from Confederate aid due to what he saw as gross incompetenece on Koyan's part. However, Teppler won both an apology and a measure of Phennir's respect when he showed candor while requesting an end to the embargo. Phennir believed that Koyan's Corellian spirit of freedom contributed to his \"mental deficits,\" and he insisted that Koyan be removed from power by any means necessary, else the entire Confederation would fall apart."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout his years as a pilot, Phennir enjoyed a celebrated career. He personally destroyed four Rebel transports at Derra IV and singlehandedly brought down a New Republic assault carrier at Brentaal IV. During the Orinda campaign, he led the 181st to victory over the Lusankya, an Executor-class Star Dreadnought. In 12 ABY, he was considered the Empire's greatest starfighter ace, and by the following year, the most famous surviving Imperial pilot. However, Wedge Antilles bested him in a dogfight over Adumar in that year. Phennir served as the 181st's executive officer for several years, a post in which he was responsible for squadron logistics. He also showed prowess as a tactician, successfully luring the Galactic Alliance into a trap at Gilatter VIII."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phennir stood below average height and sported fair, blond hair that seemed naturally unruly despite being cut into a military style. With dark blue eyes that suggested cutting intelligence, light\u2013colored skin, high cheekbones, and aristocratic, lean features, he was handsome but for a scar that curved across his left cheek. In 40 ABY, he still sported military uniforms that were reminiscent of the early days of the Empire, and his overall appearance lacked warmth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Turr Phennir was created by author Michael A. Stackpole as a character in the X-wing Rogue Squadron comic series, and he first appeared in the series' twenty\u2013second issue, which was penciled by John Nadeau and published in September 1997. He also appeared in the next three issues, the two former of which were penciled by Nadeau and the latter by Steve Crespo. All four issues were written by Stackpole and were part of the larger \"Rise of Isard\" story arc that was developed by Stackpole and editor Peet Janes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Author Aaron Allston later mentioned Phennir in the 1999 novel X-Wing: Solo Command and gave the character a major role in X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar, a book released later in the year. Phennir's only other appearances have been in three additional Allston novels, released in 2007 and 2009, and in the online MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. Phennir was added to the game in 2011 as a starfighter pilot whom the player character could engage in combat. Phennir's character has been further developed in various sourcebooks and in Death Star II Limited, a 2000 expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. Although the set used a screenshot of a TIE pilot from 1983's Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi to represent Phennir, the pilot flies a TIE fighter in the film, while Phennir has been established as flying a TIE interceptor during the battle. An illustration of Phennir in 2012's The Essential Reader's Companion was done by artist Chris Scalf. Earlier that same year, Phennir was also featured in The Essential Guide to Warfare, though not all content written about him made the final cut. In 2014, the StarWars.com article Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut released some of the cut content related to Phennir along with other material cut from the book. Author Paul R. Urquhart further went on to mention in his endnotes he had written that Omi Vane, the wife of the character Tofen Vane introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Hero of the Confederacy, remarried Count Phennir, and Turr simply adopted the \"Phennir\" surname to avoid raising too many questions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
