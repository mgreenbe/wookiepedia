The Talortai became an endangered species as a result, when their numbers had once been legion. Remembered in Talortai legend, the cull was said to have been perpetrated by an army riding on the backs of dragons as they cut down the population with blazing crimson blades. The cull had a profound effect on Talortai culture, leading the species' elders to institute strict rules against the use of their natural Force powers out of fear, as well as limiting their numbers and instituting severe punishment on nonconformity. The rules were still in place by the High Republic Era, and the Talortai Udi Dis, who had been cast out and joined the Nihil pirates, thought about the legends of the cull when he visited Rystan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
