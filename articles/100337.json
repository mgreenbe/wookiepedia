As he leaves, he drops one last comment, which the clones understand: \"One battle, one Jedi.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the planet on which this story takes place was left unnamed in the comic, Star Wars: The Comics Companion identified it as Aridka in 2006."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
