Darth Kruhl, a Sith Lord of Darth Krayt's Order and assassin under the command of Darth Maladi, was dispatched to Munto Codru in order to ensure the loyalty of the native Codru-Ji to the Sith Empire. However, Rikkar-Du, one of the most respected clan leaders of the planet, sought to unite his people against the Sith, for which he was assassinated, alongside his wife and son. After their deaths, Lord Kruhl ensured the loyalty of the planet via the elderly Kassek-Ka, who preferred serving the Sith rather than rebel against them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
