At some point prior to the Battle of Kal'Shebbol in 8 ABY, the Twi'lek free-trader Loh'khar the Finder used Galliwig's cantina to conduct business in. One day, Galliwig approached Loh'khar, who had recently acquired three fist-sized eggs in a business transaction, and commented that the Twi'lek appeared to have gotten the worse end of the deal. Loh'khar replied that, to him, there were no bad ends to any deal, since every one he engaged in was designed to bring in maximum profit for himself. Confused by the free-trader's statement, Galliwig offered Loh'khar twenty-five credits for the eggs, which Loh'khar refused. While Galliwig looked on perplexed, the eggs hatched, producing three Turazza sisters. Loh'khar bonded with the infant sentients, eventually naming them Nizzal, Vizzal, and Rizzal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galliwig had a swarthy look to him and spoke with a drawl.
