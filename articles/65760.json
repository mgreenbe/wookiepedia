Stemming from the original Senate Guard of the Galactic Republic, the Imperial Senate Guard inherited the duty to protect senators and to accompany them as they traveled the galaxy. However, their true purpose was to ensure that the Imperial Senate remained loyal to Emperor Palpatine, the architect of the New Order. A subdivision to this unit was the Imperial Senate Sentinel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 2 BBY, the Imperial Senate Guard's armor was a blue-colored version of the red and black suits worn by the Royal Guard and Shadow Guard respectively. They were trained solely in melee combat and equipped with cortosis staffs. Additionally, the guards also carried personal energy shields that were powerful enough to deflect lightsaber attacks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outwardly, the Imperial Senate Guard preserved the tradition of their predecessors by serving as protectors of the senators of the Galactic Empire. Their main loyalty was to Emperor Palpatine, however. Other duties of the Guardsmen included the protection of key Imperial installations and high-ranking officials, assassination missions, and the hunt of Force-sensitives. Although the Imperial Senate Guards were not formally members of the Imperial Military, they have at times worked alongside them if the objectives were important enough to require their presence, which included the above-listed duties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, several Imperial Senate Guards were attached to a military unit of stormtroopers and Shadow Guardsmen during a mission to locate the Jedi fugitive Rahm Kota. They successfully tracked Kota's location to a local cantina in Cloud City, but were subsequently annihilated by Starkiller, the secret apprentice of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who required the former Jedi General's expertise on fighting the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Senate Guard encountered Darth Vader's apprentice again on the planet Kashyyyk where they were killed by the Sith assassin in addition to numerous Imperial soldiers and Captain Ozzik Sturn. Their final confrontation with Starkiller took place on the Death Star I when the apprentice infiltrated the incomplete battlestation to save the founders of the Rebel Alliance from his former Master and the Emperor. Several members of both the Senate Guard and Royal Guard rallied to the Emperor's defense on the observation deck shortly after Starkiller defeated Vader in a lightsaber duel. Despite their failure to defeat him, Starkiller was ultimately slain by Palpatine just as the Rebel leaders escaped on the apprentice's starship, the Rogue Shadow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Senate Guard first appears in the PS3, Xbox 360, and PC versions of the video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.
