The rescue mission was the opening to the Battle of Geonosis, the first battle of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, not all the members of the strike team fought in the Petranaki arena. Some, like Adi Gallia and Siri Tachi, flew air support in Delta-7 Aethersprite-class starfighters.

Using two Republic TX-130S fighter tanks, Mace Windu and fellow Jedi Master Luminara Unduli fought their way through Separatist GATs, AATs, and Hailfire Droids, clearing the way for a convoy of transports carrying the strike team to the arena."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Arena skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon infiltrating the arena, the Jedi revealed themselves to Dooku and his Separatist counterparts, having secretly infiltrated the stands of the arena. The Separatists' newly-revealed droid army swarmed into the arena in their hundreds, filling the battleground with blaster fire, cutting down many of the less skilled or experienced Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidst the heated skirmish, Jedi Master Coleman Trebor attempted to engage Dooku in lightsaber combat.

All of the leaders of the strike force except Coleman Trebor survived, while some others were captured and still others (Barriss Offee and Pablo-Jill) escaped the battle. Only the timely arrival of Grand Master Yoda and the newly-created Grand Army of the Republic saved the strike team from impending destruction. Despite the high casualties suffered by the Jedi, their mission was successful, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Padm\u00e9 Amidala were rescued from execution."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The death of so many Jedi in the Geonosian arena considerably drained the Jedi Order, as well as creating several dissidents who refused to fight for the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars.

A cease fire ensued while Jedi Mace Windu argued that the Jedi would not surrender. Behind and to the right stood Padawan Anakin Skywalker and Senator Amidala, wielding a blaster. Jedi Knights Joclad Danva, Agen Kolar, and Luminara Unduli flanked them, while Stass Allie and Bultar Swan stood back to back as Master Shaak Ti and Roth-Del Masona prepared to defend themselves. Sora Bulq, Saesee Tiin, Tarados Gon, and Kit Fisto protected Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had bent down to check the pulse of a dead companion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Windu and Dooku continued to banter, a group of Geonosians brought forward Masters Ki-Adi-Mundi and Plo Koon, who had been captured outside the arena.

Also free of the execution ring were Bairdon Jace and Kai Justiss, who were both wounded due to lack of skill, Coleman Kcaj, who was hiding, Maks Leem, who was likely injured, and Voolvif Monn, Even Piell, and K'Kruhk, who were probably putting up a struggle for the droids attempting to capture them. Alta Ranga might have been captured or lay on the floor in fatigue because of his old age, T'ra Saa, Echuu Shen-Jon, Roan Shryne, B'dard Tone, and Selig Kenjenn were all captured but later broke free or were rescued by clone troopers.
