There, they worked for Zekka Thyne before he was sent to Kessel. While on Corellia, they got into a fight with Riij Winward and Rathe Palror, a fight they nearly won if not for the timely arrival of Hal and Corran Horn. Most known members were either killed or captured when the Imperials raided Thyne's fortress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
