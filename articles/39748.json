The blades could be retracted into the wrist sheathe and concealed under long sleeves, then extended with a flick of the forearm. A miner named Jake attacked Luke Skywalker with two double-bladed stilettos and double-bladed boots on Mimban."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the original novel of Splinter of the Mind's Eye Jake's double-bladed stilettos were concealed under his sleeves. This was because deadly weapons were illegal in the five mine towns, and any such weapons would need to be concealed. However in the comic adaptation Jake wears an outfit with the sleeves ripped off, and the wrist sheathes for his double-bladed stilettos can be clearly seen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
