He was assigned to the 85th Infantry Brigade and participated in the Battle of Haurgab around 19 BBY. This trooper was in the mess at the base when a group of pro-Separatist launched a missile strike from within the Republic-friendly city of Hadde. One missile directly hit the front entrance, and the resulting explosion flung metal trays from a rack across the room, striking the trooper and one of his comrades. Due to the fact he was in his fatigues, one of the trays cut off one of his legs at the knee. The other trooper was less lucky and was killed when a tray cut the top part of his head off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
