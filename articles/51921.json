The Alliance was a rebel faction dedicated to the restoration of the Galactic Republic, the government that the Empire had supplanted at the culmination of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The origins of the conflict could be traced to the Galactic Senate during the final days of the Old Republic, sometime after the end of the Clone Wars, where dissenting and prominent Senators, such as Bail Organa and Mon Mothma, secretly opposed the powers and authority that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine continued to accumulate under the guise of security and war-time measures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The war did not begin in its real sense, that of an Alliance against the Empire with its goals and ideals laid out for the galaxy, until nearly two decades after the rise of the Empire, when various Rebel leaders signed the Corellian Treaty and issued the Declaration of Rebellion. Likewise, several Imperial citizens, despite the Empire's atrocities, ended up siding with the Empire as they were reluctant to join a group similar to the Separatists from the Clone Wars. Initially, the Empire, especially Palpatine, did not consider the Alliance a significant threat, but rather as a political tool to further consolidate power that would eventually lead to the dissolution of the Imperial Senate and a massive, unprecedented military build-up. Resistance was galvanized after the Empire obliterated the planet Alderaan for Rebel sympathies, and after Luke Skywalker destroyed the first Death Star at the fateful Battle of Yavin. Thereafter that the threat posed by the Alliance became real to the Empire and more serious measures were drafted to restore Imperial control over the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The decisive moment came at the Battle of Endor, when the Alliance, against overwhelming odds, defeated the Imperial Military and destroyed the second Death Star, killing Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader and some of the best minds in the Imperial High Command.

Peace between the two warring factions was realized in 19 ABY with the signing of the Bastion Accords between Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon and Chief of State Ponc Gavrisom, ending over two decades of constant struggle. The Empire continued to exist as an autonomous entity in the years succeeding the war's end, and would eventually enter into an alliance with its former enemy during the Yuuzhan Vong War, and emerge as the galaxy's leading government over one hundred years later, seemingly bringing history back full-circle; however, the exploits of the Alliance and the New Republic were not forgotten, and the galaxy was still very different from what it had been during the Empire's reign."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Origins of the Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Disturbance in the Senate"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The emergence of the Galactic Empire was brought about by decades of engineering, manipulation, and deceit, masterminded by the cunning and elusive Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, and carried out by his various apprentices and willing (and not-so-willing) agents and puppets. Under the guise of the charismatic Senator Palpatine of Naboo, Sidious took full-advantage of the corruption and inefficiencies in the Republic bureaucracy to have himself elected Supreme Chancellor. Once in office, Palpatine proceeded to engineer the galaxywide Clone Wars, secretly controlling both the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, as a means to further draw powers to his office. Citing special emergency war-time powers and mandates required to maintain security against the Separatist threat, Palpatine accrued autocratic power over the Republic. At the war's end, Palpatine did not relinquish his powers, instead instigating the Great Jedi Purge by fabricating evidence that the Jedi Council had attempted to assassinate him.

Luke and Leia Skywalker would grow up to lead the Alliance against the Empire and become heroes on their own right; at the time, however, they were separated at birth to escape the wrath of their father, Anakin, who had transformed into Palpatine's third apprentice, Darth Vader. Leia was adopted by Bail Organa, and Luke was cared for by his family on Tatooine, Beru and Owen Lars.

The Senate was reorganized into the Imperial Senate, its powers and influence reduced as to become nothing more than a rubber-stamp assembly. Many Senators were all too willing to allow the Empire to come to pass, as many were under Palpatine's influence or saw it as necessary to secure galactic peace after the events of the Clone Wars. Much of the Galactic populace even saw the early Galactic Empire as an improvement on the Old Republic, particularly following the celebrated Reconquest of the Rim from 19 BBY to 17 BBY, which in years to come many Imperial Loyalists would remember fondly as the final removal of Separatists and criminals and the long-overdue restoration of the rule of law in the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few Senators, however, began to sow the seeds of dissent that would grow into the Rebel Alliance in the years to come; Bail Organa and Mon Mothma were some such Senators, including the late Amidala, who urged patience in defying Palpatine's regime. If they acted too quickly, too overtly, Palpatine would crush them, and lingering fears of Separatism and disorder meant that it would take nearly twenty years for organized resistance against the Empire to be realized. While Organa and Mothma planned their resistance in a series of meetings at Cantham House on Coruscant, during this time Palpatine and his cabal had nearly free-reign in instituting the various new changes to the galaxy. Humanocentric policies became prominent, advocating human supremacy. Some species, such as the Wookiees, Mon Calamari, Yuzzem, and Lurrians were reclassified as non-sentient and subjected to slavery (or \"domestication\", as Imperial policy officially stated). State-sponsored terrorism soon became a policy of the Empire, with such notions as the concept of rule through fear, popularized by then-Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's Doctrine. Examples such as the pacification of the Nembus sector and the Kwymar Suppressions exemplified this brutal approach to stifling dissent in the Empire. Finally, the Ghorman Massacre and the very concept of the Death Star made it clear that the Empire was willing to use any means necessary to maintain its power and control over the galaxy, with no regard towards sentient rights. But the Empire's own disregard for its citizens and implementation of the Tarkin Doctrine would prove to be its undoing, as many citizens became enraged by the sheer oppressiveness of the Imperial regime, causing dissent to spread like wildfire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ferus Olin's adventures"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Empire subjugated the Core World Bellassa in 17 BBY, former Jedi Padawan Ferus Olin started an underground resistance movement by forming the group known as The Eleven.

Though Ferus planned to give himself up, his safehouse was discovered by Boba Fett and D'harhan, a pair of bounty hunters in Malorum's employ. Ferus and Obi-Wan managed to evade the bounty hunters and return to Ussa to devise a plan to rescue to civilians with the other members of the Eleven.

At a TIE Fighter Construction Facility over Nar Shaddaa, Starkiller destroyed the militia led by Jedi Master Rahm Kota and left their leader for dead. On Raxus Prime, he killed the insane Aleena Jedi Kazdan Paratus. Finally, in a mission on Felucia, he killed Jedi Master Shaak Ti.

Vader utilized Marek as an unwitting double agent, letting him believe that he was still working against the Emperor. Marek recovered the blinded and despondent Rahm Kota from Bespin and convinced him to resume his fight against the Empire. He then returned to Kashyyyk, where Princess Leia Organa was being held hostage by Governor Ozzik Sturn, and successfully rescued Organa, killed Sturn, and disrupted the Empire's slaving operations against the Wookiees. Returning to Felucia, Marek fought against the Empire's attempted genocide of the Felucians and rescued Bail Organa from Maris Brood, Shaak Ti's grief-stricken apprentice.

Early victories were gained in battles at Mantooine and the Silken Asteroids, and the frigate Salvation was captured in a skirmish over Ylesia. A decisive moment was the liberation of Gial Ackbar from slavery in the Eriadu system. The Mon Calamari had been kept as a valet by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and had been secretly feeding the Alliance Imperial Military secrets for months.

The Mon Calamari Council nominally declared neutrality and heavily mined the routes leading into their sector, thus ensuring that any campaign to reclaim the region would be incredibly costly for the Empire. The Empire was hesitant to engage in such a campaign, fearing that anything other than a quick victory would embolden other rebellious systems.

Mon Mothma saw this as inevitably leading to a repeat of the Outer Rim Sieges, which would end with the Alliance's territories being ground down by the Empire's superior industrial base.

A proponent of the largely-unfashionable view that the starfighter corps should be a separate branch of the military, Dodonna believed that hyperspace-capable starfighters could undermine the Empire's control of space. He demonstrated this with raids conducted by BTL Y-wing starfighters that destroyed Star Destroyer fleets at Denab, Vnas and Tarawa. Thereafter, finding suitable targets for the Alliance Starfighter Corps became the priority for Alliance Intelligence, while Dodonna geared Ordnance and Supply and the Support Services to providing the materiel and men for raiding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Rebellion grew, starfighters became its primary combat force, though the majority of fighter squadrons were attached to Sector Forces, or to the increasingly-powerful Fleet Command. In the Alliance's early years, the brunt of space combat was borne by local Sector Forces, particularly Garm Bel Iblis' Corellian Resistance. Fleet Command was created to oversee the ragtag collection of cruisers that had escaped their home sectors, most notably the Alliance flagship Independence, which had escaped the occupation of Dac. The success of their starfighter tactics led many Rebel commanders to distrust cruiser warfare, but Mothma insisted on building up a battle line, led by the old CIS warships Rebel One and Fortressa. The new Alliance Fleet was under Dodonna's overall command, with its senior admirals including Gial Ackbar of Dac. The Fleet would roam the galaxy, challenging Imperial authority merely by existing, and waiting for the chance of a decisive battle with the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, diplomatic efforts were made by such rebel leaders as Leia Organa to win the hearts and minds of species across the galaxy to add to the rebel cause.
