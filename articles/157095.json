The droids were stopped after an energy projector was placed on the planet, immobilizing them. After the energy projector was installed, several other starships crashed on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han Solo and Chewbacca were later escaping from the bounty hunters 4-LOM and Zuckuss in the Millennium Falcon, entering the planet's atmosphere to hide in the cloud cover. The energy projector's immobilizer beam deactivated both of their ships, causing them both to crash on the planet. Solo and Chewbacca discovered the energy projector, realizing it was the cause of their power failure. Pursued by Zuckuss, the two climbed the pole to reach the energy projector, and knocked it to the ground, where it shattered. However, the destruction of the device allowed the scorpion-droids to rise out of the ground, no longer deactivated by the immobilizer beam. The droids began to climb the pole, trapping Solo, Chewbacca and Zuckuss at the top. 4-LOM, who had also been reactivated, shot at the pole, breaking it in half. He helped them fight off the droids as they escaped, running back to the Millennium Falcon. After they boarded the ship, the bounty hunters turned on Solo and Chewbacca. Solo pretended that the Falcon was losing power, leading Zuckuss to stun them with a stun net before escaping the ship with 4-LOM. Having tricked the bounty hunters, Solo and Chewbacca escaped the planet, leaving 4-LOM and Zuckuss to fight off the droids on their own."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
