Use of the power would shift any amount of matter either into an alternate dimension or compressing the molecules, making it completely vanish. Once the object had made its way through the space occupied by the matter, it could be recalled to its original state, from wherever the user was, leaving it so perfectly matched up that there was no evidence it had ever vanished and vice versa using the link already established."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Master Plett had this ability, using it to create several cupboards and doors in his house on Belsavis. Irek Ismaren eventually rediscovered this power while on Belsavis, as did Leia Organa Solo while his prisoner. Jorj Car'das demonstrated the ability to perform this ability, possibly learning it from the Aing-Tii."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
