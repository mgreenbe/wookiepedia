Headquartered on Eshan, the Command was ruled by an all-female council. The planet Bengali rebelled against Echani Command in 1154 BBY, beginning the Bengali Uprising, and it was joined by Thyrsus, another of the Six Sisters. Though Bengali rejoined the Echani Command less than a century later. Thyrsus continued to fight against the Echani Command for several centuries; it was not until 899 BBY that the Pact of Almera confirmed the planet's independence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
