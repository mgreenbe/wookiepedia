Its pair of advanced engines and specialized regenerating shields allowed the Jumpstar to match many other starfighters of its time, though it was outpaced by the best interceptors. In addition to a forward mounted laser cannon, the Jumpstar was armed with 8 marker missiles. These missiles were not designed to destroy an enemy craft, but rather attached a homing beacon that allows a Jumpstar to track its target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jumpstar HPF was capable of serving as a standard starfighter, though its specialized role was as a tracking vessel. Powerful engines, a set of retractable sensor arrays, and marker missiles made the Jumpstar a formidable pursuit craft.
