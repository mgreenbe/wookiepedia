Over time, Vilbum became a Jedi Master. Vilbum was later appointed to the role of Caretaker of First Knowledge, the only permanent seat on the Council of First Knowledge. As the leader of the five-member body, Vilbum presided over the Holocron Chamber within the southeast tower of the Temple and was one of the few Masters allowed to enter the Holocron Vaults of the Jedi Archives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 30 BBY, Vilbum presided over the activation of the holocron of Dark Jedi Volfe Karkko, an event which had not occurred over the life-spans of the past thirteen Caretakers. Summoning High Council member and Master of the Order Mace Windu to the Holocron Chamber, Vilbum informed Windu of the details of the holocron and its potential ramifications toward Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos, who was undertaking a mission to Kiffex. Because Karkko was imprisoned on Kiffex, Vilbum feared that the young Knight would be ill-prepared to face the horrors that awaited him. Windu disagreed, however, stating his faith in Vos and the other Jedi that would assist him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
