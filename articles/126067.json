Many important officials within the Sith Empire were known to retain their use and felt more comfortable knowing that a pair of Elite Warbots guarded their chambers instead of a dozen organic guards. Despite that being the case, within the Sith army, they were notable for being powerful combatants. They were highly effective and quite proficient in both melee as well as ranged combat. In addition, it was known that they were not too widely used by the Empire due to the expense involved in constructing them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith had constructed various different models of these warbots with each being armored and typically armed with a pair of blasters. Its main weapon was, however, an alchemically treated Sith sword which was able to combat lightsabers as well as deflect blaster shots. One variant were equipped with stun blasters and batons rather than Sith sword. These versions were typically used for training exercises but despite their less lethal armaments, they were not reprogrammed to behave any differently compared to more militant models which made them harsh teachers during such sessions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These droids were originally developed in the year 5000 BBY and were in use by the Sith Empire. They were used extensively when the Dark Lord of the Sith, Naga Sadow, led his people into the Great Hyperspace War against the Galactic Republic. Many of these dark side tainted droids were destroyed during that conflict though some managed to survive or were deactivated or placed into hiding. These droids would later resurface in other conflicts long after the destruction of the Sith Empire. This included the Great Sith War and the Jedi Civil War though most Sith Elite Warbots resided within the tombs of Korriban as well as similar such locations throughout the galaxy. Some were used by the Naddists during the Naddist Uprising on Onderon, tall and black, with armor resembling that of Warb Null."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the more modern age, these battle droids were a rare sight though were encountered by explorers and collectors who stumbled on these long forgotten warbots. Millennia later, Anakin Skywalker would encase himself in a black suit similar in appearance to the battle droids as prosthetic replacements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
