It was also borne by some Rebel Alliance officers, such as commando leader Palpatine Essex Yerac and Beryl Chiffonage, the tactician who developed the \"Rogue Doctrine\" for airspeeder tactics. Due to the often improvised nature of the Rebel military, however, there does not seem to be much consistency."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rank became more common during the Yuuzhan Vong War, however.

Although anomalous in terms of modern Anglo-American military, this corresponds, at least implicitly, to the system of the Napoleonic Grande Arm\u00e9e, in which major replaced lieutenant-colonel; following this model, it is possible that the rank of Major in Star Wars often denotes the equivalent of a real-world Lieutenant Colonel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
