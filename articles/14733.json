By 18 BBY, the Empire had subjugated the planet of Bellassa and killed Trever Flume's father and brother in a bombing. Orphaned by this, Trever Flume spiraled into an angry, confused depression from which he emerged as a member of the Bellassan black market, haunted by the deaths of each family member. Because of what his mother had said before she left, and his father and brother saying much the same thing before their deaths, he became deeply nervous when people he cared about promised to return from danger without allowing him to come."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Months after being orphaned, Trevor Flume explained his situation to the former Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi.

The Essential Guide to Warfare (2012) states that only clone troopers served in the Grand Army. Those clones were all men and nigh exclusively sourced from the bounty hunter Jango Fett. On the other hand, Jedi Generals and Jedi Commanders were considered part of the Grand Army and were not clones, but they significantly outranked the captains, who were clones. Nonetheless, there were non-clone branches of the Military fighting for the Republic, such as the Planetary Security Forces or the Judicials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another The Last of the Jedi book, Death on Naboo (2006), said that the Galactic Empire had killed Trever Flume's mother while she was fighting against them, but the Galactic Empire had not yet been founded when she died. Trever also remembered his mother dying on Bellassa, rather than at T'olan, in The Last of the Jedi: A Tangled Web (2006). These books conflated her with her partner and other son, whom The Desperate Mission established as having died at Imperial hands on Bellassa, but A Tangled Web also explicitly mentioned the deaths of those two as independent of hers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
