They were another security measure introduced by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine because of the growing risk of a war on Coruscant. Vannix Intelligence was known to use identichips with unique seals. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, all citizens were required to possess some form of identification, a regulation that some, such as Senator Bail Organa found unnecessary and irritating. While attempting to board his consular vessel, Tantive IV, Bail was forced to show his identity tag to a dubious Senate Guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Certain identichips bore distinguishing marks granting their owners a degree of legal immunity.
