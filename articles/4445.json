Going by the stage name \"Flutterplume\", so called for her exotic outfit and feathered mask and its resemblance to the bird of the same name, Kraeff managed to get a stable income to support herself and her apartment in Westwall District. Taking on four fights a week, Flutterplume hoped to make herself a small fortune so as to better help her parents, whom she sent credits to on a regular basis. When not fighting, Kraeff used a pair of vibroknucklers for her own protection on the streets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the gambler Illo Vandin wanted to see Kraeff throw her match to bring shame upon one of her avid fans and the Herglic's rival, the Pirate Queen of the Veiled Sorority.
