They were found on various planets including Kesh. The Keshiri had developed these irrigation systems prior to the arrival of the Lost Tribe of Sith in 5000 BBY. During the Time of the Rot, many of these waterworks had broken down due to neglect and war damage. By 2974 BBY, these waterworks had been rebuilt. During the Siege of Tahv in 2974 BBY, Parlan Spinner accidentally damaged a portion of the waterworks while piloting an ancient Jedi starship, which had been hidden under the Circle Eternal for millennia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
