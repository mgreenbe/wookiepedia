Several Jedi Knights such as Plo Koon and Luminara Unduli built their respective sabers to resemble Subartuk's. Key features of Subartuk's design included a radiator casing segment in the shape of a truncated cone, a ridged handgrip, and a blade modulation circuitry. The Sith lightsaber built by Darth Maul, although based on the Iridonia Zhaboka, had similar aesthetics. The design would later go on to Sentinel hilt in the New Jedi Order founded by Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the prequel trilogy of Star Wars, main characters like Anakin Skywalker, Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Yoda had unique lightsabers.
