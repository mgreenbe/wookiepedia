The vessel shared its name with Sixmoon, an astronomical object in the Velusia system. Under the command of Captain So-Hem, the ship was among a dozen starships in four rebel battle groups that made up a flotilla in the Elochar sector in 3 ABY. Another vessel there was the CR90 corvette Thunderstrike, the troop transport for the 61st Mobile Infantry, which So-Hem invited members of to visit the Sixmoon. At least two members of the 61st, including the soldiers Gadren and Roach, intended to accept the captain's invitation. Gadren offered another member of the company, the ex-bounty hunter Brand, to join him and Roach, but the former bounty hunter refused."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sixmoon was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
