AT-OT walkers had enough seats for at least 34 clone troopers, but they could carry more troops if required, thanks to the open-bed design. The vehicle's defenses included two forward cannons and two tail cannons. The AT-OT was not used for attack, it was mainly used for carrying a vast number of clone troopers onto the battlefield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the open top design making transport of troops a risky endeavor, the personnel walker was commonly used throughout the Clone Wars far from the front lines, only traveling far enough to deposit troops at the outer perimeters of battles.
