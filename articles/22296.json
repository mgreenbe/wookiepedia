Bred and trained on the planet Kamino, CT-7567 entered into Republic service at the Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY. He gained respect from Jedi officers and clone troopers alike as an honorable commander, becoming known as one of the best and toughest clone troopers in the Grand Army. He was even selected for special command training under Advanced Recon Commando Alpha-17, following which he took the nickname \"Rex.\" As the captain of the 501st, Rex served as second-in-command to Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, whose bravery and unorthodoxy in battle he came to share. He was close friends with Marshal Commander Cody, with their relationship mirroring that of their respective Jedi Generals, Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The four of them often received joint assignments to coordinate front-line campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Battle of Christophsis, Rex became a mentor to Skywalker's newly assigned Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, with whom he forged a strong bond. He also managed to rebound from the following Battle of Teth, an engagement he would never forget due to the near-complete eradication of his 501st unit, Torrent Company. While on a listening post inspection tour with Cody, Rex rallied a small team of rookie soldiers to retake Rishi Station, which they thereafter destroyed to thwart Confederate General Grievous's planned invasion of Kamino. He was soon deployed on tour aboard Skywalker's flagship, the Resolute, and joined Skywalker and Tano in leading 501st offensives at Bothawui, JanFathal, and other flashpoints across the galaxy. He took part in countless campaigns in the galactic theater of war, from the containment of the Blue Shadow Virus on Naboo and the liberation of Ryloth to other hard-won victories like the Battle of Malastare, the Second Battle of Geonosis, and the Battle of Kamino."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout his career, Rex proved to be an effective leader who truly cared for the men under his command, even as he began to doubt his own future\u2014and those of his clone brethren\u2014in the Republic.

His leadership was put to the ultimate test at the Battle of Umbara, when he was forced to unite the 501st Legion under an interim Jedi General, the obstinate and aggressive Pong Krell. Rex did not see eye-to-eye with Krell and found himself having to balance his troops' well-being with Krell's high-casualty plans. When Krell manipulated the 501st into a fatal confrontation with their comrades from the 212th Attack Battalion, Rex realized their general was a traitor to the Republic, and he risked charges of treason to lead his men in arresting Krell. The ordeal refined his hard-line obedience to orders, as he also learned the value of making his own decisions as a soldier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex's unwavering dedication to the Republic kept him on the front lines over the three-year span of the Clone Wars. He aided Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi in rescuing Togruta colonists from the Zygerrian Slave Empire and, in 20 BBY, offered his soldier's expertise to help the Jedi train local insurgents on Onderon to emancipate their world. In a stark turn of events, he and Skywalker apprehended Tano on Coruscant after she was framed for a bombing of the Jedi Temple, an incident that culminated in her departure from the Jedi Order. In addition, Rex and Skywalker gave pursuit of a longtime comrade, ARC trooper Fives, who had gone rogue after unearthing an anti-Jedi directive that had been bred into all of the Republic's clone troopers. Before Fives could prove his findings to Rex and Skywalker, the Coruscant Guard gunned him down for resisting arrest.

He served with Jedi Generals on multiple occasions and learned to respect their abilities; in turn, Jedi officers came to rely on him. Thanks to his aggression on the battlefield, he earned a reputation as one of the Republic Military's best and toughest clone troopers.

After Alpha-17 rewarded their individualism by granting them proper names, CT-7567 and CC-2224 became known as \"Rex\" and \"Cody,\" respectively, with the former keeping the origins of his nickname to himself. Rex often found himself working with Cody, particularly in a number of dangerous campaigns.

In the same year, a new elite unit was formed within the Grand Army: the 501st Legion, whose members' training surpassed even that of the lethal Advanced Recon Commandos. Rex was given command of the core group of the 501st Legion, with which he was tasked with patrolling the galaxy's lawless Outer Rim Territories. As part of his designated 501st detachment, Rex received his own troop detail\u2014Torrent Company, which became based out of the GAR clone barracks on the Republic capital world of Coruscant.

The 501st Legion garnered fame and veteran status under their leadership, and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine took notice of how Rex and his men adopted Skywalker's unorthodox strategies with repeated success. Under Palpatine's direction, the 501st grew into an amalgamation of clone units whose members underwent secret training and were moved across the galaxy's battlefields as the war effort required. Besides his friendship with Cody, Rex formed a working relationship with Denal, a fellow 501st member, and befriended Advanced Recon Force Sergeant CS-2207, nicknamed \"Boomer.\" He also became acquainted with Cody's own Jedi General, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

After signaling clone trooper pilot Hawk for an evacuation, Skywalker, Rex, and their men used their DC-15A blaster rifles' ascension cables to rappel over to the south tower. They avoided laser fire from the droid infantry below and arrived to reinforce Kenobi and Cody, who were holding out against overwhelming numbers. Once Kenobi temporarily impeded the droids' advance by Force-pushing a blaster cannon at them, the combined clone detachment took a turbolift to the roof for their evacuation. TJ-55 pursued them to the roof with more droid troops, and Rex, Cody, and the clones provided cover fire for Skywalker and Kenobi to cut through the droids.

Slick immediately broke into a run and ignored Rex's commands to halt, forcing Rex and Cody to pursue him through the base.

Upon learning from Gus and Chopper that Slick had been spotted running into the command center, Rex headed with Cody to apprehend the saboteur, leaving Slick's platoon and the other troops to seal the perimeter. In the command center, Rex and Cody noticed that Slick was hiding in the above ventilation shaft and engaged in a ploy to bait him out of his hiding place. While Cody secretly removed the ammunition from his DC-15S and left the weapon on the holotable console, Rex appeared to leave for the south exit to restart the base's power generators.

When Skywalker and Kenobi returned, Rex and Cody presented them with Slick, who, no longer comatose, attempted to justify his actions with his hatred for the Jedi. Slick's accusations elicited rebuttals from his clone officers, who countered that his exploits had endangered the lives of the clone brothers he claimed to love.

He conferred and joked there with the medic on duty, Clone Sergeant Coric, as well as trooper Ged, who was being treated for a shoulder injury.

Once Loathsom and his droid army had been driven into another retreat, a Republic Nu-class attack shuttle landed in Crystal City's Central Plaza. Although Kenobi believed that his new Padawan learner was on board, he and Skywalker found that instead of delivering some expected reinforcements, the shuttle had brought the young Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who had been apprenticed not to Kenobi, but to Skywalker. Rex was introduced to Tano at the base's observation post and was surprised to meet the new Padawan, as Skywalker had previously sworn never to take a Padawan. Rex could not help but chuckle when Tano nicknamed her new Master \"Skyguy,\" but Skywalker, annoyed with her hubris and arrogant behavior, told his captain to give her an \"acquaint of the position\" while taking her on his inspection rounds of Central Plaza's lookout points.

While near the Republic's setup of AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons, Tano noticed that the Confederacy was deploying a deflector shield, a development that alarmed Rex, who knew that such a shield would render the Republic's artillery useless.

Using an unencrypted comlink channel to appear more convincing to the Separatists, Rex ordered the clone forces to fall back before switching back to a secure channel.

After being forced to pull back his men, he met with Kenobi at the command center. Although Rex proposed that they use the heavy cannons in spite of the shield, which would cause fatal overpressure and result in severe collateral damage, Kenobi instead ordered him to mobilize a defense of the cannons while the Jedi Master himself delayed the droids. Despite his reluctance to leave Kenobi to fend for himself, Rex obeyed orders and retreated while Kenobi confronted the oncoming droids. As the shield approached the heavy cannons, Rex, Coric, and their men countered the advancing droids' fire from some rubble near the main street.

He quickly ordered the heavy cannons to commence firing on the exposed Separatists and their Armored Assault Tanks, to great effect. With Republic Admiral Wullf Yularen and Jedi Grand Master Yoda arriving with reinforcements to complete the process of securing Christophsis, Rex allowed himself to breathe and personally feel the deaths of his men, acknowledging the pain that came with losing them. Although LAAT/i gunships flew in and began to bombard the nearby droid lines, he braved the incoming fire to help Coric search through the debris for two surviving troopers whom they had located via their helmets' heads-up displays.

Rex and Torrent Company accompanied the two Jedi to the planet Teth\u2014where Republic Advanced Recon Force trooper scouts had tracked the Huttlet\u2014in an Acclamator-class transport. Because the clifftop monastery where Rotta was being held was a half-mile off the ground and was being guarded by a detachment of battle droids, Skywalker elected to launch a vertical assault up the cliff face to reach the monastery. LAAT/i gunships ferried Torrent Company to the surface, and LAAT carriers brought a pair of AT-TE walkers along as extra support. When the monastery's droid defenders opened fire on the approaching craft, Clone Lieutenant Hawk\u2014the pilot of the gunship carrying Skywalker, Tano, Rex, and their men\u2014closed the gunship's blast shields to deflect the incoming fire.

As a vertical crossfire commenced, the droid cannonades felled one of the AT-TE walkers, severing its grip on the cliff. Rex watched in horror as the AT-TE plummeted to the ground, taking all of the troops beneath along with it. When B1 battle droids on Single Trooper Aerial Platforms flew in to attack the clones in mid-climb, Rex trained his blasterfire at the airborne droids before Skywalker eliminated them. Torrent Company reached the monastery and destroyed the remainder of the droid infantry, albeit at the loss of half of its men.

Rex returned to the monastery courtyard and finished securing the castle with his troops. As midday approached, he learned from Skywalker that Rotta had been found and sent Coric to help transport the Huttlet with a backpack.

Their remaining AT-TE walker was shot down, and Torrent Company began to take heavy losses. Rex joined his men in retreating into the monastery, and with everyone else inside, Skywalker ordered his captain to shut the entrance door. He initially refused, as Skywalker would be locked outside with the droids, but when his general tersely repeated the order, he complied and fired a blaster round at the controls. Skywalker used the Force to propel himself through the closing gap and into the entrance chamber, sealing all of them inside. With three-quarters of their men dead, several wounded, and only three medic-trained troopers remaining, Tano convinced her Master that it was best to find medical attention for the sick Rotta.

To penetrate Gwori's defenses\u2014namely, a droid-operated blockade and a radiation beam that eradicated all life forms bound for the planet\u2014Skywalker chalked out a plan for a small strike force to be temporarily frozen in carbonite. R2-D2, whose presence would not cause much suspicion to the blockade's droid security, would then pilot the team to Gwori. After locating the shipyards, they would relay the coordinates to Generals Plo Koon and Saesee Tiin, who would eliminate the facility with a Republic squadron. Initiating preparations on Coruscant, Rex gathered a clone squad at carbonite freezing plant CT-642, where Skywalker assured his captain that they would not be frozen long enough for hibernation sickness to take effect.

However, Juhm was waiting for them just outside with a squad of B2 super battle droids and killed their clone companion on sight. Presented with the choice of capitulating or being immediately gunned down, Rex and Tano decided to comply with Juhm's demands and were taken away, leaving R2-D2 back in the cave.

All three teams would rendezvous at Point Rain and then assault the Ray Shield Fortress. With the plan set, the Jedi and their clone officers split up to begin preparations for the invasion. Once the fleet was ready, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano launched with their LAAT/i gunships and LAAT carriers, the latter craft hauling several AT-TE walkers; their deployment followed and preceded that of Kenobi and Mundi, respectively.

To collapse the wall and clear a path to Point Rain, Skywalker and Tano each took a backpack filled with thermal detonators and left Rex in command of the troops.

Together, the four Jedi devised a plan to cripple the droid foundry: Skywalker and Unduli would spearhead an assault on the foundry, acting as decoys for Tano and Offee to infiltrate the facility via the network of catacombs beneath it and plant explosives at the main reactor. Although a full frontal offensive would be risky due to the lack of cover along the canyon bridge, Skywalker and Unduli hoped to consequently entice Poggle into engaging them in open warfare. After the two Padawans had departed, Skywalker and Unduli began the assault. Deployed factions of B1 and B2 battle droids intercepted them on the canyon bridge, and Rex and his fellow officers headed the charge on the Separatists.

They and Skywalker eventually captured the Separatist leader in the catacombs beneath the Progate Temple, the lair of Geonosian Queen Karina the Great, who perished during their escape from the catacombs. With Karina dead, the Republic triumphed over the Geonosians and cemented its control of Geonosis. Shortly thereafter, Tano and Offee were assigned to take the Republic Pelta-class frigate TB-73 on a supply run to a medical station near the planet Ord Cestus.

While Skywalker and Admiral Yularen oversaw the space battle against Grievous's flotilla, Rex joined Cody, Kenobi, Ti, and Su in Tipoca City's command center to monitor their progress. However, as debris from the Separatist cruisers fell into Kamino's ocean, the space engagement proved to be a diversionary assault when the remains of the ships turned out to be disguised modules for Trident-class assault ships, which the Separatists secretly reassembled below sea level. Using the craft, Grievous and Ventress landed hundreds of droid troops in Tipoca City and rapidly beleaguered the vital cloning facilities. As the droids began to overrun the Military Complex, Rex and the others were joined by Skywalker, who returned to the war room to help organize the city's fortifications.

With the droids nearing the barracks, Rex and Cody followed 99 to the nearby armory to retrieve weapons for the others so that they could stage a retaliatory assault. The cadets hid in the raised retractable sleeping chambers to provide extra firepower at the right moment.

Fives' detachment was the first to meet Umbaran resistance in the form of an Impeding Assault Tank, a deadly crawler tank that burrowed out of the ground to ambush them. As several of the ray-shielded tanks surrounded them, Fives requested rocket launcher support from Rex, who sent one of his men forward with an RPS-6 launcher. When another Impeding Assault Tank injured that soldier, Kix tended to the fallen trooper while Hardcase took up the rocket launcher. By firing a missile directly into the cockpit of one of the tanks, Hardcase set off a chain reaction that blew apart the vehicle.

Sure enough, when Rex surveyed the area ahead with electrobinoculars, he saw that a far more deadly threat had been unleashed upon them: titanic six-legged juggernauts known as Umbaran mobile heavy cannons, each fitted with a powerful electromagnetic plasma cannon. He hurriedly ordered his men to fall back as the mobile heavy cannons opened fire, but the 501st platoons suffered severe casualties.

When Rex broke the news to Hardcase, Tup, Jesse, and Fives in the barracks, Fives proposed that they carry on with their illegal plan and accept the consequences, which would, at the very least, involve being court-martialed.

Although Fives and Hardcase managed to convince Krell that the incident was a result of an enemy booby trap encoded in the starfighter, Krell simply cited it to Rex and Fives as further reason that the craft were too dangerous for their use. Krell consequently grounded the fighters, leaving Rex exasperated with Fives and Hardcase's actions. That night, while leading a full perimeter sweep to patrol for enemy activity in the outlying forest, Rex was sought out by Fives, Hardcase, and Jesse, who revealed that they were going to attack the supply ship in spite of the consequences for disobedience. When Fives asked him if he intended to stop them, Rex resignedly replied that he would not be able to help them when they got caught. After returning to the airbase, Rex witnessed the trio's launch from the hangar bay, and Krell thereafter confronted him about the illegal launch.

Eventually, Rex witnessed with Tup a massive explosion through the clouds overhead, and he realized that Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase had destroyed the supply ship. When only Fives and Jesse returned, Rex learned that Hardcase had sacrificed himself to eliminate the orbital transport. They were then interrupted by Sergeant Appo, who reported that Krell had summoned them to the command tower. Standing before the general, Rex attempted to claim responsibility for his men's actions, but Fives insisted that he be punished instead, since he had committed the offense. Krell, caring little for the Advanced Recon Commando's display of honor, proclaimed that they would be court-martialed, for he brooked no insubordination among his troops.

When addressing the rookie soldiers of Rishi Station, he used the derogatory \"shinie\" slang to underline their inexperience in combat. He was pleased when the rookies rose to the challenge and acquitted themselves well in their first battle; he placed a handprint of Rishi eel blood on Echo's armor to recognize the trooper's transition to a seasoned warrior, and he also honored Hevy's ultimate sacrifice to destroy Rishi Station. He and Cody succeeded in sharpening the rookie clones into an effective fighting force. Rex inducted both Echo and Fives into the 501st Legion for their valiant service, and he later promoted them to Advanced Recon Commandos for their courage and determination during the defense of Kamino. Rex even saw a bit of himself in the two troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A disciplined captain, Rex was good at preserving a stoical front around his troops when facing setbacks. Even when deeply unsettled about the comm jammer situation at Kothlis, he was careful to maintain a focused outward attitude, to the point that Skywalker could only sense his unease through the Force. Although Rex was not easy to rattle, he was visibly startled when he overheard trooper Checkers complimenting his skills as an officer, and he snapped at Tano and Checkers to \"stow the chatter\" after that comment. As a commanding officer, Rex was efficient and thoughtful, and his decisions and conduct reflected his assiduity. He often stayed focused on the current situation by keeping himself busy, which he found easy to do on account of his countless day-to-day tasks as a soldier. He knew that over-preparation never hurt and kept his men ready for battle at all times. Opting for maximum situational awareness on the battlefield, Rex was not partial to the Republic's spacegoing navy. He preferred to have ground under his boots whenever possible, where he could use his natural senses to take in the environment around him, free of a starship's viewports. Even so, he learned to respect the willingness of civilian starship contractors to live or die by their workmanship's quality, since such workers often went space-side with assault craft in the war zone. He fell back on old-fashioned soldering whenever necessary, using hand signals to convey orders depending on the situation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex learned what he could from the Republic's HoloNet News information bulletins, being used to absorbing information in that manner from his early Kaminoan flash training. He sometimes made judgments based on the contents of his training; for example, he respected diplomacy as a kind of fighting for which he lacked training. On the other hand, he saw fighting simply as a skill in which he was versed, not claiming to absolutely like it. Unlike some other officers in the Grand Army, he respected malformed clones like 99, whose strong spirit earned his admiration, and was greatly saddened when 99 died during the Battle of Kamino. Some of Rex's views were less open-minded, particularly as he encountered different cultures on his tour of duty. At times he did not pay much attention to history or culture; he initially could not understand the Lurmen of Maridun and their pacifistic choice to avoid fighting, attributing such behavior to a lack of pride. He also looked down on the Lorrdian militiamen during the battle for Ereesus, though he learned to trust and respect their aptitude for kinetic communication. When it was too late for the Lorrdians to return to their own base, he welcomed them to bunk with his own men. The experience additionally led him to form a close working relationship with one of the Lorrdian officers, Sollaw ap-Orwien. On Onderon, Rex embraced his leadership role in training the local rebels, treating them as he would the troops under his command. He did not hesitate to push them, impelling them to perform maneuvers like the soldiers they strove to become.

He paid considerable attention to his hairstyle, as he found hair under a helmet to be bothersome and annoying. As such, he regularly kept his naturally black hair shaved to a fine polish to prevent it from interfering with his concentration on the battlefield. Even so, he dyed his hair a light blond, his most obvious unique trait, and let it grow out to a certain extent on various occasions. He experimented with other hairstyles as well, briefly dying his hair blue after choosing to support the Bylluran Athletic bolo-ball team when it reached the finals. However, he eventually deemed his new hairstyle undignified and inappropriate for a commanding officer, and he shaved it off to better fit in with his black-haired troops.

He trusted the men under his command and was a role model to them. He remained determined to achieve success in the face of danger, from frequently overwhelming enemy numbers to the life-threatening Blue Shadow Virus. Though he staked his life by the chain of command and did his best to honor superiors' orders, he also came to recognize the importance of a soldier's independence: He questioned orders instead of mindlessly obeying them and would adapt to shifting situations and plans as required."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex had several manners of etiquette as a commander that he strictly observed. He made a conscious effort to spend time getting to know all of his men on a personal level, and he consequently despised using the inconsiderate tally sensor to remember his charges' names because it was an admission that he could not tell his men apart from one another. He also valued his troops' privacy while not in combat. During the JanFathal operation, after the five rookie clones under his command opened up their own comlink channel, Rex avoided intruding on their conversation, even if they were cursing him for the recent loss of trooper Vere, and would have only overrode the frequency in an emergency. Outside of life-or-death situations, he abstained from barking out orders to his subordinates or superiors, believing that such conduct was improper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the absence of orders from superiors, Rex took matters into his own hands to ensure the survival of himself and his men.

All of Rex's traits in leadership were a testament to his effectiveness as a military leader, which was noticed by many of his colleagues, from troopers Checkers and Tup to Jedi General Pong Krell. Rex was well aware of his own talents as a leader and did his best to use them for the betterment of his men. His leadership skills were put to the ultimate test during the Battle of Umbara, where he was forced to balance the well-being of his troops with his commanding officer's strict orders. During that campaign, Rex found difficulty with uniting the 501st Legion under interim General Krell's leadership. Krell was focused on completing his mandates regardless of the cost, and he frequently employed strategies that the 501st perceived as reckless and costly. Though not afraid to speak out when he believed that he and his men were being treated inhumanely, Rex kept his men focused on their objectives and tried to set an example for his charges. He made an effort to respectfully cooperate with Krell despite the Jedi General's disagreeable behavior toward the clones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex was tenacious in safeguarding his men's lives, even if that meant deviating from Krell's often reckless plans.

Rex was receptive to his subordinates' concerns and welfare in ways that Krell was not, requesting a respite for the battalion after a twelve-hour overland march. Whereas Krell simply activated one of his lightsabers to silence dissenters, Rex listened to his soldiers' grievances even when he did not agree, such as during their preparations to seize the Umbaran airbase. As time went on, he grew more open to defying Krell's orders in order to preserve his men's lives. After Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase refused to abandon their plan to eliminate the orbital Separatist supply ship, even though Krell had outright rejected their proposal, Rex did not attempt to restrain the three soldiers from leaving, but he also made it clear that he would not be able to save them from Krell's wrath once they were caught.

When Fives and Jesse returned, Rex tried to take the full blame and punishment for their actions, claiming that he had ordered them to disregard Krell's decree, though Fives returned the gesture by honorably reporting the truth of their disobedience to Krell. In the end, Rex's concern for his troops' welfare outshone his adherence to Krell's authority: He openly disobeyed Krell's subsequent orders to execute Fives and Jesse. He knew that if such punishment was rendered even once, then all of the 501st Legion could eventually face a similar demise, and he refused to let his men be subjected to fear of execution. He was horrified when Krell manipulated the 501st into attacking fellow clone troopers from the 212th Attack Battalion; the incident instilled in him the need for justice to prevent a recurrence of such an atrocity. He thus resolved to lead his men into the \"uncharted territory\" of arresting Krell for treason against the Republic. Given the mutinous nature of his proposal, Rex knew that he could not force his men into participating and gave them the option to opt out, though all of them except for Dogma supported his decision.

At the Battle of Orto Plutonia, Rex knew that his men were risking their lives because of Cho's foolishness, but he nevertheless respected Cho's authority. Yet for all his wartime service, Rex's challenges were not only posed by his enemies. His loyalties and resolve were tested multiple times simply from his battlefield career. While he was aware that he and his clone brothers had been bred to fight for the Republic without a choice, he made the best of the situation. He knew that the politics and ideology of fighting were beyond his influence and instead focused on the day-to-day activities of looking out for his brothers in arms. When it came down to the nature of his commitment, it was not his relentless Kaminoan training or his loyalty to the Republic, but his dedication to his soldiers and Jedi officers that kept him in service. His compassion and selflessness as a commander was evidenced at Kothlis when, despite being severely injured, his first concern was for the welfare of his troops and comrades, not his own. His loyalty was so potent that even if he had not been born to serve, he could not imagine the prospect of abandoning his brothers and friends."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time, Rex learned to cope with his doubts about his origins as a clone trooper.

In that way, Rex put aside his insecurities for the greater good of the Republic. His strong loyalty to the Republic and the Jedi came into stark contrast with Sergeant Slick's hatred of the Jedi and betrayal of his comrades during the Battle of Christophsis. Rex had no respect for traitors like Slick and was visibly unsettled with Slick's perspective that the clone troopers were slaves to their Jedi commanders. Despite Slick's claim that he had been striking a blow for all clones, Rex drew the conclusion that the sergeant's actions\u2014particularly putting his brothers' lives at risk by performing espionage for the Separatists\u2014evidenced that he did not love and care for them as he so believed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex's commitment to the Republic remained undeterred during his later encounter with the clone deserter Cut Lawquane, who had left the Grand Army relatively early on in the war. After first meeting Lawquane, Rex displayed a lack of patience for those who would abandon their duty, and he made his contempt for the deserter known. Once he had assumed a more respectful attitude toward Lawquane, Rex maintained that his beliefs had not been programmed into him, as Lawquane suggested, and that they were undeniably his own. He believed that his military service made him part of the most pivotal moment in the Republic's history and that the Grand Army's failure to defeat the Confederacy would mean the insurrection of an inconceivable evil. Despite disagreeing with Lawquane's outlook and disapproval of the war, Rex came to respect Lawquane as possessing a different type of loyalty\u2014not to the Republic, but to his adopted family. Adding to his grudging but sincere regard for Lawquane was the deserter's brave effort to safeguard his family from invading droid commandos. When the time came to end his stay with Lawquane's family, Rex forwent his initial adamancy on turning in the fugitive Lawquane, opting not to report him as a deserter. He concluded that Lawquane was certainly not a coward and, before departing, politely refused his offer of a place at his farm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Clone Wars continued, Rex feared that the Republic was beginning to view the clone troopers as a deindividualized, disposable army. He nevertheless upheld the mindset that the clone troopers' responsibility was to carry out and die for their missions when necessary.

In spite of his doubts about the clones' place in the Republic, he preserved his belief in the system for which he and his men were fighting. He held that the clone troopers were not independent of one another, that they were part of something larger than themselves, and it was thus not up to them to disobey orders in favor of strategies that they deemed more effective. Yet he was forced to draw the line when his loyalty to orders required that he see out General Pong Krell's decree to execute troopers Fives and Jesse for insubordination. Rex consequently realized that in some cases, it was necessary to make one's own decisions instead of blindly following orders like battle droids. Although he retained his loyalty to the Republic despite the incident with Krell, the Battle of Umbara left a lasting impression on his outlook as a clone trooper.

Skywalker in turn thought highly of Rex, believing him to be the finest and most loyal trooper with whom he had worked, and introduced him as such to General Pong Krell. As a soldier, Rex was loyal to Skywalker not only on the battlefield, but also on a personal level.
