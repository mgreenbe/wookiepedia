He was one of Crix Madine's commandos. He died in 12 ABY when his A-wing hit an asteroid in the Hoth asteroid field en route to confirm New Republic suspicions on the underhanded schemes of Hutt gangster Durga Besadii Tai. A small piece of debris penetrated his rear shields causing loss of altitude control, his engine core to buckle, and slamming his vessel into a jagged asteroid where it burst into flames."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
