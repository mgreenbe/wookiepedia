He had no permanent base of operations and was frequently on the run from Imperial authorities, but was known to frequent Omze's Incredible Traveling Starport on occasion. Olgreen's philosophy was that he could best advance the cause of droid's rights by enhancing them and improving on their design and boosting their artificial intelligence. Enterprising rogue droids and fellow activists often sought out Olgreen for illegal droid modifications. He was also willing to work on commission, but his prices were steep."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
