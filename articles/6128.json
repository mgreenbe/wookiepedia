Sometimes referred to as simply Amalgamated Hyperdyne, the company produced the 578-R space transport before it was shuttered after being destroyed by numerous civil suits over safety recalls. The 578-R was prone to poorly timed errors and missing components, but intact examples went on to enjoy long lives in the hands of mechanics and outlaw techs due to their adaptability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
