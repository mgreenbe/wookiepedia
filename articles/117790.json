It was added to the game on November 1, 2007 with the introduction of the Tusken Army heroic instance. The chance of looting a Tusken King Rucksack schematic from the Tusken King's corpse was rare. Once looted, the schematic required a character of the Domestic Goods Trader profession to learn and craft the rucksack. The rucksack could hold slightly more items than a regular backpack, and it gave several significant increases to the player's combat statistics when worn. It also appeared as an \"Item\" card in the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game set Squadrons Over Corellia and was a reward for all players who completed the Tusken Army \"Heroic encounter\" that was released concurrently with the set."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
