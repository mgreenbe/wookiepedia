It was able to go for between 600 and 650 hours at sublight before needing to refuel, and it was equipped with lasers and missiles. Progga the Hutt chased the Hunter and its crew into the Unknown Regions because he wanted the cargo that they were taking to Drixo the Hutt. Commander Thrawn of the Chiss Ascendancy intercepted them with three fighters and the Springhawk. He destroyed Progga's starship in a 6 minute skirmish, after disabling the Bargain Hunter with a ship-sized conner net."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
