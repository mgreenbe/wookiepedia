Made of bantha hide and ancient wood from Tatooine's long-gone forests, urtyas could be easily folded and transported via bantha, thus accounting for the nomadic habits of the Sandpeople. Inside each urtya, individual Tuskens usually kept skulls of their ancestors and precious krayt dragon pearls. When Tusken Raiders set these tents up for what would be long periods in the hottest seasons of Tatooine, they would strengthen the material with layers of bantha spittle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
