The cockpit was built around an armored control pod flanked by twin conducting vanes that each housed an electromagnetic plasma cannon. The plasma cannon had the capability to decimate entire platoons of enemy troops with a single blast. The conducting vanes rotated and split open to serve as landing struts when the vehicle was powered down in a docked configuration. Although its cockpit was armored, its vanes were vulnerable to fire from Republic AT-RTs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Umbaran Militia deployed these vehicles during the Battle of Umbara. As the 501st Legion landed on the planet, the Umbarans set a line of hover tanks on a nearby ridge that caused many casualties to the Republic clone troopers that were approaching them head on. However, as the troops began to deploy AT-RTs, the versatile walkers reached the hover tanks and easily destroyed them from the side, clearing the path for the troopers on foot to dig in and take cover as more Umbaran forces arrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
