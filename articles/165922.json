When the Mandalorians under the command of Cassus Fett, who orchestrated the battle, attacked the planet Cathar in 3973 BBY, Xor participated by fighting and killing many members of the local Cathar species. As he did, the Twi'lek took pleasure in the carnage, due to his hatred of the Cathar people.

At some point after that, Xor encountered and murdered a Cathar male in the Lower City, although his wife and daughter, Juhani, were able to evade the Twi'lek. Two years later, Xor saw Juhani and attempted to buy her from the auction blocks on the world.

During his conversation with Juhani and Revan, Xor insulted the Cathar by trying to convince Revan to sell her to him.

He hated the Cathar species and desired to eradicate or enslave them, and was among the Mandalorians who attacked the world for the pleasure of destroying it. He also viewed Cathar slaves as pets that were kept for the amusement of their owners. Although he was injured during the battle on Cathar, he continued to fight with the Mandalorians. Xor killed Juhani's father when he ran across him on Taris, and was prepared to purchase Juhani on the auction blocks during the Mandalorian occupation on Taris. When he later encountered Juhani and Revan during the Jedi Civil War, Xor talked disparagingly to Juhani and taunted her, even going so far as to ask Revan if he wished to sell her to him. After Revan and the Cathar defeated him during his attempt to capture her, Xor attempted to pressure Juhani to give in to her hatred and murder him.

He was voiced by Neil Kaplan. In the Xbox version of Knights of the Old Republic, the character is depicted as a Human; however, he is a Twi'lek in the PC version. Some of his comments in-game seem to suggest that he was Human. However, Xor was officially canonized as a Twi'lek in 2008's Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide. In the game, he appears only after the player has learned all that they can about Juhani's past through conversation. If the player visited the spaceports on the planets of Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Manaan, or Korriban with Juhani in their party, Xor would confront the group. Alternatively, the player can convince Juhani to give in to her anger and kill Xor. He never appears at all if Juhani was killed on Dantooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xor is the only purple, male Twi'lek, and one of only two purple Twi'leks in Knight of the Old Republic, with the other being Yuthura Ban."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
