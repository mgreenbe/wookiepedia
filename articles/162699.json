The Muun was revealed to be Darth Plagueis and he asked the entire crew to take him back to his homeworld. After Wandau and the others came to the consensus and rejected his offer, the Sith Lord attacked. Wandau tried to take advantage of taking a seemingly defenseless Plagueis after the Muun threw his lightsaber at Semasalli and Blir', but Plagueis caught him with Force lightning. The impact hurled Wandau against the ceiling, paralyzing him from the waist down. He was still able to speak to Plagueis, mistaking him for a Jedi. To him, the Muun was a disgrace to the Order which he served; he could've just used the Force in a more peaceful manner. Plagueis, uncaring, replied in Wandau's native language that he was weak-willed and useless before putting him out of his misery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
