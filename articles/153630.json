Kitai later followed the florist to Jelph's farm on her uvak. Thus, Orielle started a close friendship with Jelph which set a chain of events that led to the discovery of Jelph's Aurek-class tactical strikefighter and the Night of the Upside-Down Meteor, which led to the death of Grand Lord Lillia Venn and the Time of the Rot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
