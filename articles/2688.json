The ship flies into Seelos' atmosphere and lands on top of Gregor and Wolffe's modified AT-AT walker, which now features a landing platform. When Hera Syndulla enters with Rex and the Imperial defector Kallus, Wolffe tells them that they were expecting them on the last rotation. Hera apologizes that they were delayed by the tough Imperial blockade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hondo Ohnaka replies that would be no problem with him. Hera and the others see Hondo and the Ugnaught Melch sitting on a nearby table. Hondo then climbs over the table and offers his services to Hera. Ketsu Onyo adds that he wasn't hard to find, and talks a lot for a smuggler. Hondo replies that he is a pirate, which he regards as more romantic than being a smuggler. Kallus then tells them that it is time that they discussed the mission. Hondo assumes that it is another smuggling run and asks how they are going to split the profits, before asking who they are liberating."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wolffe remarks that Rebel Command never sent a briefing. Rex responds that this mission is not for the Rebellion. Hera explains that this mission is for Ezra and that they are liberating his homeworld of Lothal and need help. She appeals to all of them. Wolffe thinks that that they have little odds of prevailing against a planet full of Imperials. Hondo agrees, but recognizes that the boy has spirit and stands for a time when there was something you could still believe in. Ketsu points out that Ezra is a Jedi. Wolffe says he followed the Jedi into battle many times. Gregor is willing to give it another go. When Hera asks if they are in, Hondo takes off his hat and says that there is nothing he would not do for that boy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ezra's gambit"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outside the Lothal cliff dwelling that serves as the Lothal resistance group and Spectres' base, Sabine Wren finds Ezra Bridger meditating outside the rocky mounds (where Kanan had his last meditation). When she checks on him, Ezra tells her that something has changed and that he has to talk to Hera. Cikatro Vizago informs Ezra that he has General Syndulla on the hologram and leads them into the command center. In the presence of the other rebels including Sabine, Mart Mattin and Ryder Azadi, Ezra announces that they must act now if they want to take Capital City from the Galactic Empire. Garazeb Orrelios responds that Ezra's plan is crazy, and questions the urgency."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra tells them that the Emperor is bringing Grand Admiral Thrawn back to Lothal and that it is now or never. Ryder thinks that they don't stand a chance against Thrawn due to the failure of the last attack. He thinks that their best course of action is to lay low, reorganize, and rebuild their forces. Ezra tells Ryder to trust in him, but Ryder counters that they need an army to retake Capital City.

The officer promises to commit more troops and takes his leave. Another officer bursts into the room to inform Pryce that she has received an incoming transmission on an old pre-Imperial frequency."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The transmission is from Ryder, which Pryce remarks is a bold move. When Ryder says that he does anything to survive, she curtly replies that strategy did not work for him. Ryder counters that he's still alive and offers to bring her \"something that she needs\". When Pryce asks if he has come to offer his head on a platter, Ryder tells her that he has come to betray the other rebels. When Pryce asks why he wants to betray them, Ryder claims that he doesn't want to return to an Imperial prison. Pryce offers Ryder an amnesty in return for bringing her Bridger, Syndulla and the other rebels. Pryce remarks that it is cowardly. When Ryder asks if they have a deal, Pryce tells him to send his coordinates.

He admits that he can't explain it, but says that sometimes the connection is strong while other times he is on his own. Sabine remarks that she hopes his plan will work and that he can use the Force. The two notice the wolves are running away. The rebels in the camp, including Mart Mattin and Jai Kell, sense sudden movement. Sabine asks Ezra if he heard that. Ezra warns Zeb that they are coming just as six Imperial patrol transports approach the encampment. The gunships begin strafing the camp, and deploy several jumptroopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sabine vows to handle the flyers while the rebels exchange fire with the gunships.

As they exit hyperspace above Lothal, Hera tells them to be ready to power down as the Ghost approaches Thrawn's Seventh Fleet. Kallus thinks that they weren't detected. Hera tells Hondo that it is time to join the Rebellion. He tells her to move towards a hyperspace lane. When Hera protests, he responds that it is technically outside a hyperspace lane and that their plan is to latch on to an arriving cargo ship. Kallus thinks Hondo is mad, and warns that the ship will crash into them. Hondo explains that as a pirate he is prepared to take that risk in order to help Ezra. He reassures them that he has done it many times, but is coy about his failures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on Lothal, Sabine takes out another jumptrooper.

Rukh falls over a roof and Ezra moves away. However, Rukh manages to cling to the rock face and scurries up the cliff. Meanwhile, the other rebels have taken a defensive position on top of the former Mining Guild ore crawler. Pryce orders her troops to storm the crawler. Zeb grabs a mortar and charges at a landing gunship, taking out several stormtroopers. He shoots at the gunship, causing it to fall off the top of the crawler. However, two more gunships land on top of the crawler and outflank the rebels. With his mortar out of juice, Zeb hurls it at the stormtroopers. Ezra then arrives and joins the fight.

The rebels take their chance, with Hondo telling Hera not to power up until they have latched onto the ship. Hera tells Rex to stand by with the magnetic clamp. At Hera's command, they latch onto cargo freighter EF-75. The Ghost rides the cargo ship through the Imperial blockade.

Rukh roams through the camp, with Ryder taking care not to shoot him to perpetuate the ruse that he is a traitor. As the Imperials encircle them, Vizago says he is going to regret the day he met Ezra. Ezra counters that the day is not over yet as an older rebel is shot down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Governor Pryce watches the battle from her gunship and orders her crew to target the ore crawler. The patrol transport fires a volley of missiles that destroy the middle of the crawler, causing the front and rear sections to collapse.

The Loth-wolves drive away or maul the remaining stormtroopers. Ezra and the rebels emerge to see the wolves driving the Imperials away and the Ghost pursing the gunships.

One of the wolves tosses a stormtrooper down a cliff, while Wolffe and Gregor exchange laughs. The remaining stormtroopers raise their hands and surrender.
