The card's mention of a twin mercenary, as well as Sheckil being from Concord Dawn, was intended as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the fact that actor Jeremy Bulloch played both Sheckil and the bounty hunter Boba Fett in the film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. At the time of the card set's release, Boba Fett was canonically established to have been from Concord Dawn as well, according to the 1996 short story The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett. However, any such connection between the two characters was trumped by the release of the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, which established Fett as a clone \"born\" on the planet Kamino."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
