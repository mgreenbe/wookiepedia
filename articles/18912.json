They were considered one of the most aggressive animals in the galaxy that was a sharp contrast to the tranquility of their homeworld. Brutally effective hunters, they were known for running down prey with their powerful front legs before they gouged them with their hook-like tusks that protruded from their lower jaws. Early Alderaanian settlers were initially shocked to encounter these violent beasts and bolraida attacks were the leading cause of death on the otherwise paradise world. They were also noted for being impossible to train with every attempt made to domesticate them ending in disaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
