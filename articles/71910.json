A native of Taanab, Jorsk smuggled supplies and weapons to the Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. While smuggling to the Rebels, Jorsk was caught behind Rebel lines when the Imperials staged an ambush. He was witness to several Rebels using flechette launchers on the interior of a LAVr QH-7 Chariot after blowing off the door. While admitting it was a fearsome anti-personnel weapon, Jorsk disliked flechette launchers such as the DF-D1 Duo-Flechette Rifle because of the amount of unnecessary damage they caused and the fact that law enforcement officers could easily pick them out and find a crime to blame on those who carried them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jorsk had a friend who had started a side-business repairing wrist-casters by fixing the firing mechanism and crafting new quarrels. He commented on the corresponding entry in the Datalog, as well as the one for the Model Q4 hold-out blaster pistol. Jorsk received a StarSlasher Blaster Carbine as a present from his father when the latter retired from smuggling. He loved the weapon, and gifted it to his own son while on a hunting trip."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
