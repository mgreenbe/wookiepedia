The ordnance was constructed for a time in the Tython system. They were used by Bartokk assassins in an attempt to destroy the Corulag Academy. Later, the Alliance to Restore the Republic used plasma bombs on Mon Calamari Star Cruisers; the bombs were set off as a diversion during the Battle of the Sixela system in 1 ABY. By 7 ABY, the Scohar Xenohealth Institute had acquired a plasma bomb as a precaution against a contagion outbreak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Before the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plasma bombs were among the ordnance constructed on the planet Nox, in the Tython system.

To this end, the Bartokks were sent to Sullust, where they stole a SoroSuub Corporation space yacht and six X10-D draft droids. Three of the droids had compact remote-cotrolled proton bombs installed into their torsos, each of the explosives shaped like geodesic spheres and carrying enough firepower to level a small city (or a quadrant of a city the size of Curamelle). The Bartokks planned to infiltrate the bomb-equipped droids among the other draft droids into the Academy Science Service tower and then trigger the bombs, causing the destruction of the Corulag Academy. However, the Jedi Grand Master Yoda succeeded in deactivating all the draft droids and, with the help of a security droid, deactivated two of the bombs while exploding the third bomb aboard the Bartokks' space yacht at a safe altitude in Corulag's atmosphere."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY, a group of Rebel Mon Calamari Star Cruisers released their plasma bombs to create a cloud of ionized gases a kilometer across. The cloud interfered with electronic systems. Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker and the mercenary Div were pursued by a squadron of TIE/LN starfighters through the cloud; the Rebels maneuvered downward at Div's command, letting the TIEs hit an Imperial Star Destroyer hidden by the cloud, causing serious damage to the starship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Zsinj campaign"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Scohar Xenohealth Institute on the planet Storinal held a plasma bomb around 7 ABY.
