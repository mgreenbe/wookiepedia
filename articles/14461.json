The Empire had been fielding a series of new TIE starfighters that were being used to raid and harass civilian convoys. It was suspected that the Empire intended to field these new fighters against the Alliance, so the disruption of this project became a top priority for the Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their investigation, the Rebels discovered that the starfighters were being researched and developed at an installation called the Bretie Facility, orbiting Nomlis III in the Kurdin system. It was found that the facility's databases contained sufficient data on the starfighters and their developers, so the Rebels launched an operation to raid the facility and steal all relevant data on the project."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving in Nomlis III space, the four X-wings from Red Squadron, under the command of Ace Azzameen, began an attack on the facility's standard and large gun emplacements. They moved on to destroy the station's supplies and the fleeing transports, which included a pair of Xiytiar-class transports. Meanwhile, Storm Unit used an assault transport to board Bretie Facility under the cover of a pair of A-wings. While the Rebel fighters continued to stave off TIE Experimental M1s and M3s, Storm Unit fought their way to the central computer, retrieved all data pertaining to the TIE Experimental Project, planted charges, then hurriedly made their escape. Bretie Facility was totally destroyed in the resulting blast, striking a major blow against the Empire's latest plans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the information obtained from the now destroyed Bretie Facility, the Rebels were able to uncover the location of platform Obsidian\u2014the home of the TIE Experimental Project.
