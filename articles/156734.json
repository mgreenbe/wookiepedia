During that year, the Jedi Knight Aayla Secura attempted to arrest Duum, but she was forced to flee. This Human, wearing modified Clone trooper armor and carrying a blaster, joined Sabat, Duum's chief of security, and other mercenaries to hunt down Secura on the moon of Cavamina Minor. They cornered Secura, but she ran; the rogue Force-sensitive Shon-Ju and his students intervened and attacked the mercenaries. This Human was knocked aside by an Ithorian. Sabat fled before Shon-Ju could engage him in personal combat, allowing Shon-Ju to treat Secura's injuries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This individual appears in a scene in the 2010 graphic novella The Clone Wars: Deadly Hands of Shon-Ju."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
