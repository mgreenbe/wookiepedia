Three Y-wings from Red Squadron disabled the stolen X-wings, allowing shuttles to deliver clean R2 units and the pilots to take control of their ships and fly them to the waiting Maximus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the Maximus was sent, along with the BFF-1 bulk freighter Ojai to rendezvous with the stolen freighter Phoenix in a quiet area, away from Imperial interests, in order to recover some stolen communications satellites. It arrived just as Keyan Farlander finished clearing the area of TIE starfighters launched during a surprise attack by the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Intrepid. The Intrepid fled shortly after the Maximus arrived and the Ojai docked with the Phoenix to recover the satellites. The satellites were later deployed by the CR90 corvette Jeffrey and proved essential in discovering the Death Star I project, intercepting an Imperial transmission and relaying it to the Rebel outpost AX-235."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the destruction of the Death Star, the Maximus was the first victim of the new Imperial vengeful offensive, and was destroyed by the Nihil after a savage series of missile volleys from its TIE/sa bomber squadrons.
