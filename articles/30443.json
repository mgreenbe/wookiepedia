Cortosis blades were made by a number of manufacturers and were widely available during the Jedi Civil War circa 3965 BBY, and were developed for a large number of reasons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first reason being that cortosis was capable of making many items lightsaber resistant when mixed with other ores or materials, in this way it found its way into many forms of vibroswords during the Jedi Civil War. Another use was to make pure cortosis blades, which were used to short out a lightsaber for an advantage. Blades like this were used by Jedi like Jedi Master Shadday Potkin against Darth Vader during the Conclave on Kessel. Many times they were capable of shorting out a lightsaber for minutes at a time, and proved to be very effective."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A type of assassin droid used by the Trade Federation during the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY wielded cortosis swords to duel Jedi.
