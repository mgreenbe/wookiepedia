After Doctor Chelli Aphra was swallowed alive by the Shadowfang Beast on X3-299-11 while attempting to steal an artifact, she hired several hunters to subdue the beast but not kill it, allowing her to escape safely. Squoxx was one of the hunters she hired, and he accepted the job.

He hid in a cave, managing to avoid being spotted by the beast. Two of his rivals, Nokk and Winloss encountered him, and pretended to help Squoxx so that they could use him as bait for the creature. They tied him up and threw him into the path of the Shadowfang Beast, but the creature was unable to locate him as it only navigated through sound. Winloss and Nokk managed to incapacitate the beast with an electro cudgel, and Aphra tried to make them kill it so that she could escape. While they threatened to shoot it with a crossbow, neither of them did, throwing the weapon behind them. Squoxx, still lying on the ground, lifted the crossbow and shot the beast, killing it. At the same time, he died of his injuries, collapsing back onto the floor of the cave."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Extremely loyal to King Prana, Squoxx would rather sabotage his hunting mission than let what he believed to be a competing crime syndicate outdo his employer.
