A group of would-be escapees attacked Hangar 84G, hoping to steal a transport. However, the Imperials had deployed the 501st Legion in response to the prison break, and these elite troopers were able to successfully defend the hangar bay and their Sentinel-class landing craft. They also managed to secure the detention block where the riot originated. Finally The 501st moved deeper into the station, killing all the escapees and destroying their transport in Hangar 85G."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
