He made a career in the field of archaeology. In 10 BBY, Xathan authored One Thousand, One Hundred and Thirty-Eight Wonders of the Ancient Galaxy, which was published on Beshka by TriPlanetary Press. In Ten years later, the young Human Tash Arranda consulted that book while redacting an essay recounting a visit she made to the planet Lorrd with her adopted uncle Mammon Hoole. In 4 ABY, Xathan and his assistant Fem Nu-Ar were hired by the Empire to find the planet Seoul 5. They eventually found the planet, which was once the home of an ancient race of Humans. But when Xathan and Nu-Ar brought the Imperials to the planet, they were imprisoned. They were later rescued by Han Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a reptiloid, Xathan was tall, with green skin and yellow eyes.
