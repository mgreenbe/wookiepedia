After receiving a single coin from the Suerton gambler Wodi, whom he had just lost a game of zinbiddle to, the Heptooinian gambler Kaljach Sonmi angrily threw the coin, which landed in the cocktail glass of the surprised agricultural baron. Sonmi, who worked at the Canto Casino as a proposition player, later supposed the coin landing in the baron's glass to be one of the reasons he was quickly fired.
