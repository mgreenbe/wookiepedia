This minister was present in the Toydarian palace alongside King Katuunko and a few other ministers when Alderaanian Senator Bail Organa and Naboo Representative Jar Jar Binks approached them, asking for aid for the suffering Twi'lek on Ryloth. But Neimoidian Senator Lott Dod arrived in a bid to make sure that no relief supply ship is sent to Ryloth. Katuunko then proposed for a debate. After both factions finished their debate, the defense minister suggested they help the Twi'leks as compassion was a way of the Toydarians. Katuunko officially denies the Republic their rights to a base on Toydaria, but afterwards he secretly meets Organa and Binks and tells them that the humanitarian factor has actually gained his favor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
