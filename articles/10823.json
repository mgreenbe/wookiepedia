Known as the Great Warrior Poet, Avamarivash was a large sponsor of the arts and was quite a different leader than his eventual successor Maravada the Silent as he frequently bedded many women and erected monuments to the glory of his people after fighting vicious wars. A history of Avamarivash's reign could be found in the Chamber of Speech in Kaleth up until the Cold War-era and the Jedi Order's return to Tython."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
