The gloves were made of heavy fabric, and reinforced with an exoskeleton of metal and armor plates. The framework protected hands from being cut and crushed, and the exoskeleton could be locked in position for extra gripping endurance. While perfect for loading and unloading cargo, they were useless for fine manipulation such as firing weapons or even pushing buttons.
