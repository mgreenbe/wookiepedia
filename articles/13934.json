After fighting near the surface for a while, they fought upwards, drawing the Yuuzhan Vong force away from Dubrillion, and towards Lando's Folly. They wove in and out of the asteroids, using the Force to guide them, destroying much of the invasion force. This proved too much for Anakin Solo, who lost his concentration and made a blind hyperspace jump. Fortunately for him, his parents arrived at the system his ship, Calrissian Runner, came out of hyperspace in to bring him back. They returned, but the victory was bittersweet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Jedi Order Sourcebook incorrectly presents the ships that the Solo children piloted in this battle as TIE/IN interceptors.
