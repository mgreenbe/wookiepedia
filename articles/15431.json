The aim of the diplomatic mission was to prevent Ansion's secession (and, by default extension, the secession of up to forty or more other alliance-entwined star systems) from the Galactic Republic\u2014a Sith- and Commerce Guild-led plot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was Bayaar who loaned a Borokii knife to Jedi Master Unduli to secure for the Council of Elders its required tuft of albino surepp fur, which would afford the Jedi an audience with them. Bayaar was struck dumb with astonishment when Unduli actually accomplished the feat and dismissed the fact that she'd lost his knife in the process: he mused that his offworlder friends were powerful indeed, and told them he would remember the moment for his grandchildren. Having helped make them presentable for their meeting with the Borokii elders, it was Bayaar who later advised the Jedi of the council's readiness, after its deliberations, to declare its acceptance of the terms of the Jedi's proposal to ensure Ansion's retention within the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bayaar, the foremost warrior of the elite Situng Borokii subclan, also served as captain of the honor guard to the Jedi as they traveled back to Cuipernam to influence the final secession vote (the ambassadors from Coruscant having now achieved the sought-after accord with the Alwari overclans). While en route to the municipal hall where the Unity Council had convened, Bayaar and his troops successfully defended the Jedi diplomats against thugs hired by Soergg the Hutt and his majordomo Ogomoor, who had been tasked by Commerce Guild Presidente Shu Mai to prevent any Jedi interference with the vote to secede."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bayaar possessed a confident, intrepid, but also a friendly and good-natured personality that was encouraging to the Jedi, who quickly grew fond of him.

He would much rather have been out on the prairie, patrolling a picket line, weapon in hand. Even so, Bayaar found that he rather liked the \"squinty-eyed offworlders\" who had been charged to his care, and the contemplation that any of them might be injured or killed troubled him greatly. He was delighted also with the ingenious outcome of the Borokii-Januul skirmish, masterminded by the Jedi to \"set an example\" for both overclans: not one warrior was injured or killed, though Bayaar had expected to lose many friends that day, among both his clan and the offworlders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bayaar, in his role as sentry leader, was richly attired in lightweight armor that gleamed in the sun.
