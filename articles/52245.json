Most of the members wanted another former smuggler to replace Poyiu; however, pilot Aven Cholus, a survivor of the Wellte-ir Massacre, was promoted instead. Even though she brought her own Anxarta-class light freighter with her, the Agent, she was disliked because of her non-criminal background. Similarly, Cholus was not familiar with the smugglers' MO. She was also very depressed because she blamed herself for the losses on Wellte-ir. Due to all this, the Gale Team experienced a decrease in their efficiency. Cholus was blamed for that, demoted and moved away from the Gale Team."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
