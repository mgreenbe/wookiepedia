Of magick origin, it manifested as a greenish mist channeled from or through a glowing orb/crystalline object and was required to be spoken in a special language. Though powerful, the spell's effects would last only as long as the caster was active; should they cease maintaining it or be killed whilst using the spell, the undead would become immobile corpses once more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The incantation was used by Old Daka, the eldest of the Dathomiri Nightsisters, to aid the Nightsisters' forces against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, during the battle, Daka was killed by General Grievous, causing the undead returned to their original state. The living Nightsisters, who lost most of their forces, were then quickly overwhelmed and massacred. Several years later, Merrin, one of the last surviving Nightsisters, used the spell after the former Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis visited Dathomir."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
