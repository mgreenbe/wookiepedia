While trekking through the mountains to a meditation site, Seta-Le fell through a patch of ice into a cavern and became trapped, with her lightsaber broken by the fall. However, she managed to use her weapon's components with the cave's crystal formations to generate a scattered beam that melted through the ice wall of the cave, allowing her to escape. The ice formations left behind by the beam subsequently became a point of interest for other Jedi pilgrims."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seta-Le was first mentioned in the \"Jedi Pilgrimages\" Codex entry in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released in 2011, though her species was not specified."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
