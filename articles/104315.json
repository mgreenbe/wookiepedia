He used it to escort guests and captured guests to his secret base inside a deserted mining facility in Hutt Space. It was fitted with lavish guest accommodation and also housed eight I-7 Howlrunners, which were used to defend it. Due to his paranoia, Niuv would often disguise himself as the ship's pilot and fly it himself, as he didn't trust the crew. He also secretly fitted it with a hyperdrive, which only he had the security codes to activate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
