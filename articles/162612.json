AP-5, as a former Imperial droid, had no problem, but Chopper was flagged, although the stormtroopers on guard duty failed to notice. Instead, a signal was transmitted to Imperial controller LT-319 aboard his surveillance starship in deep space, and the controller and his crew subsequently hijacked Chopper in an attempt to find out where the Phoenix Cell's base was located."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A walkthrough identification scanner first appeared in the Star Wars Rebels season 3 episode \"Double Agent Droid\", which aired in 2017.
