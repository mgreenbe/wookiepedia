Her favorite movie is The Empire Strikes Back. When she heard she had an appointment for the casting, she ran out and got a few of the comics and one of the first three novels. She loved Mara right away, especially in the Zahn books. She has been the image of the Lucasfilm's character, Mara Jade, for Star Wars merchandise. At the time the original photos were taken in 1999 she was known as Shannon Baksa, from her first marriage in 1994.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before 1998, Mara Jade appeared only as an illustration, but after that, illustrations attempt to simulate McRandle's look. According to the short story Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade, Mara Jade was present in Jabba's Palace under the guise of Arica while Luke Skywalker was held captive. Before the release of the Star Wars DVDs, there was a rumor that Shannon was to appear in the Special Edition version of Return of the Jedi as a cameo. However, this did not occur."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shannon has said that a small part in the movies for fun for the fans sounds great.
