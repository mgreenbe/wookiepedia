After receiving approval from Emperor Palpatine for a design for an unshielded craft, the Navy itemized their requirements and sent it to SFS. Sienar was inspired by the designs of Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighters, and the Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptors from Kuat Systems Engineering. The initial designed lacked structural reinforcement to allow for atmospheric flight. Later design upgrades added strengthened wing spars which allowed the fighter to enter a planet's atmosphere. The Navy authorized production of prototypes for both designs, and eventually decided to procure the alternate design with the bulked-up pylons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE fighter prototype was described in the 2019 book TIE Fighter Owners' Workshop Manual."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
