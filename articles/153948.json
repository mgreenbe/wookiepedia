Following the Galactic Civil War, he bore witness to a feud between the people of his village and a group of indigenous Tusken Raiders. Around the year 9 ABY, these tensions came to a head when Mos Pelgo's marshal, Cobb Vanth, brokered a truce between the villagers and the Tuskens in order to band together and kill a krayt dragon that plagued both groups. The villager voiced his repulsion to the idea, angered that the Tuskens had raided the small town's mines in the past."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, while loading explosive devices onto the Raiders' bantha mounts, the villager entered into an altercation with a Tusken, who accidentally dropped one of the charges. At the behest of Vanth, however, the man dropped the subject.
