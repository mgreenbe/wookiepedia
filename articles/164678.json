It possessed at least one section, OC-356, which gave details on Chewbacca, a Rebel Alliance member, although it lacked information on the specific relationship between Han Solo and Chewbacca, or the circumstances behind their meeting, which led to it asking C-3PO for these details, who denied knowing anything as he wasn't present at the time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
