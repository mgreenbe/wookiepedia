The Aleena regularly relayed in-system data to an ancient observatory on Narthex, Catadra's moon, where a unit of on-the-run Galactic Empire personnel resided. After the Imperials bought the kidnapped New Republic Intelligence agent Caern Adan at an auction, the New Republic pilots Yrica Quell and Nath Tensent were directed to the Aleena by Sarvada Dream, the partner of Adan's kidnapper. The Aleena admitted to relaying data to the Narthex observatory, and the pilots went to rescue Adan from the moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
