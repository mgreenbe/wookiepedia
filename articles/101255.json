When the orthodox Jedi raided their fortress, the Ordu Aspectu were forced to activate a device that seemingly caused them to disappear, perhaps ascending to a higher form of existence. However, according to the younger Aphra, another version of probable events was that the Ordu Aspectu had kidnapped Jedi Padawan learners, whom they callously sacrificed in an attempt to gain the immortality they sought. Aphra also stated that the Ordu Aspectu might not have existed at all, and the term might simply have been an argument between Jedi grammarians of more recent years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ordu Aspectu were first mentioned in the second issue of the Marvel comic book series Star Wars: Doctor Aphra, written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Kev Walker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their leader being called Rur and their fortress's location on Garn harkens back to the Order of the Terrible Glare, which was created by Alan Moore for the 1982 Legends comic story Blind Fury!.
