After consecutive Imperial victories at the worlds of Diado and Metalorn, and later the siege of Sy Myrth itself, an Imperial task force of the 12th Sector Army under the command of Admiral Adar Tallon and General Jan Dodonna, led by the Praetor-class Star Battlecruiser Battalion, chased down Toora's flagship, Defiance's Banner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Toora's fleet was cornered at the planet Trasemene, the Battalion's batteries ripped apart her fleet, resulting in an Imperial victory.
