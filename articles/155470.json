When hyperspace travel was being permitted again in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, the child and her parents travelled aboard the passenger starship Journeyman when it departed Cerea. However, the Journeyman was crippled by a piece of hyperspace debris, as the hyperlane it was travelling on had been reopened prematurely. In the ensuing chaos, the infant was separated from her parents. When several Jedi boarded the Journeyman after encountering the scene in the transport Vessel, Padawan Reath Silas rescued the child from the burning ship, during which she ripped out his Padawan braid. The child was later successfully returned to her grateful parents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
