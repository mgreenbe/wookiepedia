Living in seclusion Maul was driven to madness and became a local legend. After his betrayal at the hands of both Count Dooku and Asajj Ventress, Opress located the lair using the talisman given to him by Mother Talzin and a local Anacondan by the name of Morley.\nThe cave was very harsh, full of junk and mist. Maul had his residence in the end of the tunnel, in a larger room, where he lived next to a huge fire.\nMaul was apparently feeding on Junkers and other living creatures, who were brought to him by Morley, in return of some \"leftovers\". Opress also found the cave by falling into it, after being betrayed by Morley. When Morley looked for the leftovers of Opress, he was choked to death by the Nightbrother, and his body was thrown onto the fire. Opress then found out that a Jedi took his brother's legs.\nMaul was apparently brought back to Dathomir where he was treated by Talzin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
