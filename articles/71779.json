Their distinguishing features included a crown of bright red eyes, long pink tongues, and carapaces of rigid plates covering their otherwise soft bodies. Lacking teeth, they swallowed prey whole. They were particularly fond of Lasat meat. They were known to use their prehensile tongue to snatch prey on the surface while remaining underground, but could emerge from the earth to attack directly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the proclamation of the Galactic Empire, some clone troopers of the defunct Galactic Republic (Rex, Wolffe, and Gregor) retired to Seelos, where they would hunt joopas, which Gregor described as delicious. Some time after the fifteenth celebration of Empire Day, the rebel team known as the Spectres traveled to Seelos in search of the clones, whose skills could help the fledgling rebellion. In order to help the clones catch a joopa, Spectres member Garazeb Orrelios, a Lasat, agreed to be used as bait."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
