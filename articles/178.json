This allowed each sector army to coordinate one corps-level operation, four brigade-level operations, sixteen regimental missions, and sixty-four battalion-level operations concurrently on different planets throughout the sector army's theatre of operations. Each corps was also paired with four Republic Navy assault lines, containing two Acclamator-class assault ships and two frigates, allowing great strategic mobility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In practice, the Grand Army of the Republic typically kept one corps in each sector army intact, but divided the others into hundreds of fast-moving raiding companies, with only a dozen or so formations operating at the battalion or brigade level, most of them usually drawn from the reserve corps itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Plan remained the same under the Galactic Empire, though the brigade was replaced by the battlegroup."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
