As a member of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic, Marseph participated in a battle against a Separatist dreadnought, although their Venator-class Star Destroyer was damaged and crash-landed on the Zeffo's surface. The Padawan survived the initial crash, however, he did not realize Order 66 was executed shortly after. He and his master regrouped, trying to escape from the turned clone troopers. When his master eventually died from a bleed out after fighting the clones, Marseph buried her among the Venator wreckage. Although not explicitly stated through the force echoes, it's stated on the final passage prompted by the echo that he succumbed to his wounds not long after his master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marseph first appeared, albeit only audibly, in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
