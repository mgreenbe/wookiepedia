Windom refused to open the door to Tashu's cell, citing protocol. However, Sinjir persisted and Windom reluctantly allowed Sinjir to interrogate Tashu. From Tashu, Sinjir learnt about a secret Imperial prison on Kashyyyk called Ashmead's Lock."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Sinjir and Temmin's team freed the Ashmead's Lock prisoners with the help of Han Solo, Windom installed a transponder above Hanna City's opera house under orders from Fleet Admiral Rax. The liberated rebel prisoners had been implanted with inorganic biochips and were central to Rax's plan to assassinate the New Republic leadership on Liberation Day. This transponder was used by Rax to relay signals to the former prisoners who involuntarily met up with Windom. Windom coached the former prisoners for the upcoming attack and equipped them with small, concealed graphene blasters. Traducier used his position as a guardsman to position the unwilling assassins near key New Republic officials including Chancellor Mon Mothma and General Crix Madine at the Old Gather-House and Senate Plaza."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the eve of Liberation Day, Windom was briefing the former prisoner Brentin Lore Wexley when his son Temmin discovered them chatting. To prevent discovery of the plot, Traducier ordered Brentin to finish off the intruder. Brentin stunned his son and hid him inside a crate. On Liberation Day, the former prisoners received a signal from Rax which caused them to attack New Republic officials and military officers. Chancellor Mothma and Commodore Kyrsta Agate were seriously wounded while General Madine and Adviser Hostis Ij were rumored to have been killed. The attack derailed the upcoming Imperial-Republic peace talks with Grand Admiral Rae Sloane and set the stage for the Battle of Jakku."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Windom managed to assassinate the defector General Jylia Shale and also freed Yupe Tashu under orders from Fleet Admiral Rax.
