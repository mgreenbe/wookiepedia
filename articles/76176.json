When the odor was simulated and produced by the bomb, the New Republic could launch the missile at enemies such as the Yuuzhan Vong during an attack. Once coated with the substance, the Yuuzhan Vong would be attacked by slashrats and killed by the enraged beasts. During one such application of the weapon, Jedi Knights Corran Horn and Ganner Rhysode were able to escape with the imprisoned scientists from the planet during the Yuuzhan Vong War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
