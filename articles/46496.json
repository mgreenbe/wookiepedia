Manufactured by Arakyd Industries, it was equipped by a 1-meter lens-tipped extensible stalk, allowing it to look round corners. Able to see in low light and into the infrared spectrum, it came with a claw appendage, a blaster, a heuristic processor, locked access, an integrated comlink, sensor units, an improved sensor package, and a video recording unit.
