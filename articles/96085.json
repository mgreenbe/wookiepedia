Initially the observatory, notable for its collection of telescopic devices, had attracted only academics and occasional tourists trying to escape the overcrowded planet below. But when the exploration of the galaxy began anew after the Great Sith War, locals discovered that they could use the devices to discover and explore new astronomical bodies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the co-operation of the Galactic Republic, Metellos 3 became the first of several \"Planetary Futures Exchanges,\" offering the rights to the newly discovered astronomical objects. Since expeditions to the Outer Rim worlds were quite expensive, the investors wanted to know the risk and potential reward in advance. The Metellos Exchange provided this information, based on the astronomical data gathered, and then auctioned the claims. The Exchange itself however, was affiliated with the Raff Syndicate, an organization criminal by it's nature. It's people legally got a piece of every transition on the market, only people kept showing up with various counterclaims. So they pretended to pay them to go away, while sending them to the Negotiation Room, located at the top of the observatory tower instead. The glass in the observation tower was meant to magnify and increase the intensity of Metellos's already powerful sunlight and incinerate anyone in the room. Rohlan Dyre and Jarael were the only known individuals to escape the room alive, due to Jarael using her latent Force-sensitivity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
