Shortly after Palpatine announced himself Emperor, he was employed by a con artist who he knew as \"Mouse\" Temple, to transport Mon Mothma from the Inner Rim planet of Renor to the Outer Rim. Several members of Mon Mothma's team were captured by ISB agents, though Mothma herself escaped, only to be captured by Pel Talon. When Jax learned of this, he arranged to go to Snake's Den and plan on how to free Mothma. Jax was successful, and Mothma went on to become a major leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
