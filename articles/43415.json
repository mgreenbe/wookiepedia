During the expedition, Vanto and Captain Parck were summoned by Colonel Barris to investigate a hut that did not appear to match anything of known design. The Imperial scouting party also found eight boxes near the hut that were inscribed in a language unknown to most of the Imperials, and which turned out to be Sy Bisti.

In his childhood, Vanto had heard stories of the Chiss and that they used the Sy Bisti language. While the Chiss could understand both Sy Bisti and Galactic Basic, he was more proficient in the former. Since Vanto knew Sy Bisti, Captain Parck tasked him with serving as a translator between his Imperial superiors and the Chiss prisoner.

Thrawn was unwilling to do so to avoid jeopardizing his position at the Academy.

While Deenlark had enough evidence to take disciplinary action against Orbay and Turuy, he was reluctant to risk the political fallout of punishing scions of wealthy and influential Coruscanti families. In response, Thrawn proposed transferring the three trouble-makers to the Skystrike Academy on short notice in order to scare Orbay and Turuy into not causing any more trouble.

Their first meeting with Thrawn proved to be a brief and awkward encounter and they took leave, claiming that they had to catch an airbus to their landing platform. Shortly later, Vanto discovered to his dismay that he was to be assigned as an aide with the rank of Ensign to Lieutenant Thrawn, who was the Weapons Officer aboard the Gozanti-class cruiser Blood Crow. Despite his friendship with Thrawn, Eli feared that being an aide would adversely affect his career advancement in the Imperial Navy.

The Blood Crow saw action trapping smugglers, rendering aid to distressed vehicles, and defusing potentially damaging political situations in the Mid Rim and Outer Rim Territories. Captain Virgilio was subsequently replaced by Captain Filia Rossi and Senior Lieutenant Nels Deyland. Captain Rossi resented the fact that Thrawn had his own aide. Despite her antagonism, Thrawn managed to convince her to let him keep several Clone Wars antiques including a droideka, two buzz droids, half of a STAP, and a hyperspace ring which he had purchased with his own expenses until they reached the planet Ansion.

In fact, Cygni was the leader of the pirates who was also the enigmatic rebel leader known as \"Nightswan.\" While Captain Rossi was reluctant to aid the kidnapped crew since she had more pressing issues to attend to at a Ho'Din settlement on Moltok, Thrawn managed to convince her to let him and Eli remain behind with three other crew members: Ensign Barlin and the technicians Layneo and Jakeeb.

After Cygni and most of the pirates had reboarded the Dromedar with the stolen tibanna and jumped into hyperspace, Thrawn hatched his escape plan. With the help of the technicians, Thrawn activated one of the buzz droid and used it to cut a hole through the cage. Eli along with the other Imperials and ship crew then managed to overpower the remaining pirates. The other pirates were killed when the second buzz droid exposed the entrance chamber and amidships section of the vessel to vacuum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite rescuing the crew and capturing the pirates, Captain Rossi was displeased with Lieutenant Thrawn for taking risks. In retaliation, she suspended Thrawn and Ensign Vanto from duty and left them at the Imperial base on Ansion. Despite this setback, Thrawn put their suspension to good use by interrogating the captured pirates about where they had hidden the tibanna. With Ensign Vanto and Admiral Plor Wiskovis acting as witnesses, Thrawn managed to convince three of the captured pirates to reveal the location of the tibanna in return for protecting them from the feared Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. While the pirates discussed Thrawn's offer in Sy Bisti, Thrawn and Vanto eavesdropped and learned that the pirates had taken the Dromedar and its tibanna cargo to the planet Uba. The pirates accepted Thrawn's offer and claimed that Cygni and Angel had taken the Dromedar to Cartherston on the planet Keitum.

The Lothalian Senator Domus Renking introduced them to his citizen advisory officer Arihnda Pryce. When Yularen regaled Renking and Pryce with the story of how Thrawn and Vanto had overpowered the pirates, Vanto reassured the Colonel that he was not overstating their case.

The two learned that Cygni had escaped the Imperial cordon and that he had somehow found a way to extract the tibanna from twelve of the cylinders recovered from the Dromedar. The Imperial authorities had also taken interest in a shadowy individual known as Nightswan. At the time, the Empire was unaware that Nightswan was a pseudonym for Cygni. To both Eli and Thrawn's relief, Lieutenant Thrawn was cleared of any wrongdoing by the court-martial. Since Eli came from a shipping family, Thrawn asked him about the Imperial Navy's unusual purchase of doonium. The two speculated that the doonium was being used for some unspecified mega project."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the court-martial, Vanto was approached by Culper, an aide of Moff Ghadi.

When Culper revealed her true motives and mocked Vanto for his Wild Space origins, he turned down the offer. Culper then warned him that Moff Ghadi would make certain that Vanto's career would be of no importance. She told him to get comfortable with being an Ensign, exposing Moff Ghadi's intention to curtail his career.

Eli and Thrawn found Cheno to be a more cooperative commanding officer than Captain Rossi or Culper. Thrawn and Eli had managed to hunt down the smugglers by using a trail of mollusk meat and makorr predators to follow their underwater transport. In their haste, the smugglers had dumped the mollusk meat overboard to make room for the iridium instead of periodically releasing smaller chunks of the meat. In private, Thrawn praised Eli for his growing aptitude for the art of tactics. Eli also discussed his months-long investigation into the Imperial Navy's procurement of large amounts of doonium for a hidden project. Eli and Thrawn also talked about reports that Nightswan had been procuring Clone Wars equipment and smuggled metals for unknown purposes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Ensign Vanto took part in the Imperial pacification of the Umbaran homeworld of Umbara.

Vanto found that Thrawn had been studying the art of the Umbaran people.

Despite Admiral Gendling's predictions that the Umbarans would not attack, the Umbarans dispatched 400 Vulture droids to attack the Imperial squadron. Eli noticed that the Vulture droids were coming from an Umbaran moon. The Imperial ships were overwhelmed by the tiny nimble fighters, which exploited gaps in their deflector shields to inflict damage. During the battle, Thrawn studied the Vulture droid's attack patterns and concluded that they were being controlled by a transmitter on an outlying moon.

Thrawn's plan worked and the Umbarans capitulated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Admiral Gendling was furious that Commander Cheno had countermanded his orders and warned there would be repercussions. Following the battle, Eli briefed Thrawn about his findings that the transmitted had been operating from a building owned by a group of humans. These humans were strangers to the Umbaran system. Despite the lack of hard evidence, Thrawn believed that Nighswan had a hand in the Umbaran rebellion due to his involvement in mining and metal smuggling. After analyzing the shipping records, Eli and Thrawn reached the conclusion that Nightswan had engineered an Imperial takeover of Umbara's mines since it would be easier for him and his smugglers to bribe Imperial inspectors than the Umbarans.

While Thrawn was upset that the Imperial Navy had punished a competent officer who had won the battle and saved many lives, Eli explained that Admiral Gendling had been slighted by Cheno and had used his political connections to exact revenge. Eli also reassured Thrawn that it could have been worse since Cheno had protected Thrawn from being \"thrown to the wolves.\" Eli explained that the Imperial Navy hierarchy did not accept Thrawn because he was not human and not from the Core Worlds.

During their visit, Eli and Thrawn encountered Arihnda Pryce, a former aide of Senator Renking who was now working for the Higher Skies Advocacy Group. Thrawn also took part in a sparring exercise with the dojo's owner, the Togorian Instructor H'sishi.

Thrawn realized that Vanto had held the rank of ensign a full year longer than was customary, even though he had done nothing that would delay his promotion.

Eli also suggested that the human colonists were smuggling precious metals inside the shellfish, explaining the spike in shellfish exports over the past four months. Eli and Thrawn thought that Nightswan had instigated the Cyphar dispute.
