A female who finished her rite of passage into adulthood was given an early start, and she was pursued by adult bachelor males. The first male who caught her, won her and the pair were mated for life. However, Abyssin females were the faster runners, therefore a female's feelings for a given male had an influence on the race."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
