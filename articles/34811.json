During their time together, he found a lost temple on Ziost and the crystal caves of Molavar. Around 3643 BBY on Tatooine, he led the investigation into the secrets of the long abandoned Czerka Arms base. At some point, he was captured by the Sand People after he slaughtered a number during his search for the secrets he sought. He was found injured inside of one of the caves by an Imperial individual, where he died soon afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Silthar first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 MMORPG produced by BioWare and LucasArts.
