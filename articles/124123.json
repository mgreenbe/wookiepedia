Covered in snow and rocky mesas, the Lake was located near the planet's  Jedi Temple, where generations of Jedi younglings took part in the Gathering ritual, during which the younglings discovered their kyber crystals. Some time before the Great Jedi Purge, Jedi Master Ooba-Neba Nocci led a group of younglings to undertake the Gathering. Prior to entering the Jedi Temple, Nocci and his students gathered in the Shattered Lake around a campfire, where Nocci instructed the younglings to use their skills wisely in the coming trial."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, in 14 BBY, the Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis traveled to Ilum after his lightsaber was destroyed on Dathomir. In the midst of a great snowstorm, his crew landed their ship, the Stinger Mantis, on the Shattered Lake before he and BD-1 journeyed into the Temple. After constructing a new lightsaber, Kestis returned to find Imperial forces closing in on the Mantis. With his new weapon, he battled two AT-STs in the Lake before leaving the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
