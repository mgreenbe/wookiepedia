During The Last Resort's days sitting idly in the Lower City of the planet Taris, Vandrayk made many modifications to the ship's systems, including configuring a powerful rapid-fire laser cannon at the expense of The Last Resort's shields and hyperdrive. Vandrayk paid little attention to the ship's life support systems, allowing allergens and molds to build up in the Last Resort's air filtration system, which were released when the ship flew again. The ship also had a comm unit capable of broadcasting holographic messages. The Last Resort had a sizable cargo deck that also contained Vandrayk's workshop as well as several \"Camper special\" compartments that he used for smuggling sentients. Like all 578-R space transports, The Last Resort had a number of components and systems licensed by the Corellian Engineering Corporation, which made the ship easier to customize, as replacement parts were extremely easy to find."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Living compartments were located on the upper deck, accessible from the main deck via only a single ladder that led into the ship's bridge\u2014toward the front of the ship was the cockpit, which had four seats, two up front for a pilot and co-pilot and one on either side, along with flight controls and transparisteel viewports. The crew cabins were two separate rooms, each with a single bed, surrounding the ship's airlock and dorsal hatch. The cabins were connected on either side by a small crew lounge, which contained a hologame table, and the ship's engine room. On the lower level, The Last Resort had two boarding ramps toward the rear of the ship and a single trash receptacle in the center of the cargo deck. The Last Resort used a magnetic suction tube to quickly bring droids and other metal objects quickly onto the ship. The vessel featured a pair of engines located at the stern, mirrored by two floodlights at the bow. The Last Resort boasted a maximum speed of 800 km/h at sublight and was equipped with a Class 3 hyperdrive. Also equipped with a navicomputer, The Last Resort was normally crewed by two individuals but could be flown effectively with only one aboard. The Last Resort required a gunner to operate the ship's laser cannon. The 31.5-meter-long ship had room for ten passengers, 40 tons of cargo, and four months' worth of consumables. As a 578-R space transport, The Last Resort was valued at about 75,000 credits new and 28,000 used."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Junkyard days"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manufactured by Amalgamated Hyperdyne on the planet Corellia, The Last Resort was one of the last 578-R transports to leave the company's assembly yards before Amalgamated Hyperdyne's demise over civil suits relating to safety recalls.

Vandrayk eventually added a passenger, a young Offshoot named Jarael, whom Vandrayk helped escape from the notorious slaving ring known as the Crucible. The pair settled in the Lower City of the planet Taris, bringing The Last Resort down in a barren junkyard known as Junk Junction. Parked on top of a disused clothing factory and unregistered with the Galactic Republic, The Last Resort became the home for the two Offshoots for several years, disguised so thoroughly with tents and awnings that most visitors never realized that it was a starship. Always very handy with machines, Vandrayk turned The Last Resort into his own personal junk-hauler and additionally placed booby traps in the massive piles of trash located on the approach to the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Known to the outside world as \"Camper,\" Vandrayk tinkered with the ship so extensively that by 3964 BBY he had forgotten what he had done to which systems.

The pair of Offshoots were content with their anonymity, but everything changed for them in 3964 BBY, when the two most wanted men on Taris showed up at The Last Resort: Zayne Carrick, a Jedi Padawan falsely accused of slaying his classmates at Taris' Jedi Tower, and his Snivvian \"accomplice,\" Marn Hierogryph, a self-styled \"crime lord\" who had had dealings with Vandrayk before and wanted his help to ship Carrick off-world. The fugitives' arrival attracted the attention of law enforcement and a group of pursuing Jedi Masters, prompting Vandrayk and Jarael to immediately dash up to the ship's cockpit and take to the skies. The ship had not flown in years and quickly lost power after leaving Taris' atmosphere, but Vandrayk was able to restore power just as Taris patrol craft closed in on the ship.

Tokare did not believe Carrick's story, and the conversation was quickly terminated when Jarael knocked out Carrick with her shockstaff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Carrick incapacitated, Jarael brought the ship back into the shelter of the asteroid belt\u2014Carrick's \"stunt,\" as Jarael had called it, had attracted the attention of the Jedi Masters still pursuing them.

Vandrayk dropped off Carrick and Jarael on the promontory where the Jedi had gathered, but with the ship's shields still not functioning, Vandrayk had to pull The Last Resort around to the other side of the moon so that they were not obliterated by asteroids.

Before the pursuers could make a move, however, The Last Resort flew in and destroyed the personnel carrier with a single laser blast, giving Carrick and Jarael the opportunity they needed to board the ship and escape with the droid, T1-LB. Although Hierogryph had a clear shot on Carrick's former Master, Lucien Draay, Carrick told him to leave Draay behind and retreat to the asteroid belt. Once The Last Resort was ensconced deep within the debris field, Vandrayk began trying to retrieve T1-LB's memory data in the ship's cargo hold. Vandrayk succeeded in restoring the droid and even gave it the ability to speak, which it previously lacked\u2014in the droid's memory, they found a recording of the Jedi Masters having a vision in which one of their Padawans was going to bring about the demise of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic, and their decision to slay their apprentices. The crew of The Last Resort did not have much time to dwell on this revelation, as they soon found themselves caught in a tractor beam from a new, unfamiliar starship. Hierogryph recognized their captor as the Oroko, personal vessel of pirate and bounty hunter Valius Ying, an acquaintance of Hierogryph's.

Although Carrick briefly tried to steal The Last Resort and escape himself, he eventually acquiesced and decided that he was going to turn himself in for the good of Vandrayk and Jarael. Surprised by Carrick's selfless act, the group decided to save him. Hierogryph bribed the Oroko's first mate to release The Last Resort in orbit around Taris, and the ship provided covering fire on the Taris Jedi Tower before Jarael swooped in to save Carrick from execution in the nick of time.

The plan worked, but Carrick only had enough time to load a couple pallet-droids' worth of provisions onto The Last Resort before the Mandalorians attacked Vanquo for real. Jarael, who had wielded Carrick's lightsaber as \"Jedi Master Q'Anilia\" during the ruse, was mistaken for the real thing and swiftly captured by the invaders. Unarmed, Carrick, Vandrayk, and Hierogryph could do little to save her\u2014instead, they decided to make for The Last Resort to regroup and find another way to save Jarael. T1-LB charged ahead carrying Vandrayk over his shoulder and, although beset by Mandalorians on its way back to the ship, the group managed to carve a path through the horde with the help of T1-LB's massive strength.

T1-LB lifted them into The Last Resort in the nick of time, losing part of his arm in the process\u2014Vandrayk immediately charged the cockpit, attacking the Mandalorian with Jarael's shockstaff and casting him into the cargo bay below. T1-LB then immobilized the Mandalorian after a brief fight, and the intruder was locked into a \"Camper special\" smuggling compartment as Vandrayk launched the ship into hyperspace, following the signal from a locator bracelet that Jarael wore toward Mandalorian Space. After hearing this, the Mandalorian finally spoke up; the would-be ship thief was Rohlan Dyre, the leader of the shock infantry on Vanquo and a \"runner\" who was on his own quest to find the truth behind the Mandalorian conflict with the Republic. Dyre revealed that the Mandalorians were taking Jarael to Flashpoint Station, a captured Republic scientific research station that was currently used to hold captured Jedi for experimentation by Demagol, a Mandalorian scientist who was attempting to discover the source of their Force talents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Jarael a few hours ahead of The Last Resort, Carrick and Hierogryph were left with enough time to come up with a plan to save her.

Dyre took Carrick to meet Demagol, attacking the scientist once the three were alone\u2014the unconscious Demagol was stowed in a storage closet while Carrick put on his armor and walked outside with Dyre. As Dyre chatted up the other Mandalorians on duty, Carrick used the Force to surreptitiously attach scavenged Vanquo mining charges, dropped from The Last Resort by T1-LB, to several stolen Republic ships. Once everything was set, Hierogryph, dressed as a Republic Navy officer, messaged Flashpoint Station from The Last Resort's cockpit. Hierogryph set off the charges, destroying several ships and causing great damage to the station's solar shielding, additionally claiming that the Republic had begun installing self-destruct features into all of its vessels should they be captured. The Mandalorians quickly fled, leaving Carrick and Dyre to go back to Demagol's bunker to free Jarael and a number of other captive Jedi. Unbeknownst to everyone else, Demagol overtook Dyre when the latter returned to collect the scientist from the storage closet, incapacitating the shock infantryman and switching places with him. Although the Jedi wanted \"Dyre\" to return with them to Republic space, Jarael had piqued Demagol's interest\u2014he instead sneaked onto The Last Resort as the ship raised up from Flashpoint, hiding in a \"Camper special\" to avoid detection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the madness on Flashpoint behind them, The Last Resort next traveled to the resort banking world of Telerath, in order to retrieve a large sum of money from one of Hierogryph's bank accounts that had been frozen after the Padawan Massacre\u2014Vandrayk and Jarael were hoping to go back to a life of anonymity, and Hierogryph wanted to help them out with some cash. The crew put the ship down in a lot near the resort's music pavilion, and Vandrayk and Jarael ventured forth, with the former disguised as a \"Baron Hyro Margryph,\" hoping that the bankers would believe that the frozen account could be explained away as an error due to the similarity of \"Margryph\" to \"Hierogryph.\" Carrick and Hierogryph stayed behind in The Last Resort's cockpit to monitor the situation, which quickly went awry when the bounty hunting Moomo Brothers kidnapped their banker, a man named Arvan. Carrick and Hierogryph gave chase, discovering that Arvan was actually Arvan Carrick, Zayne's father, and that the Moomos had been hired by Taris Jedi Master Raana Tey to watch Arvan.
