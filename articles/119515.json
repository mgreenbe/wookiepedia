During the Clone Wars, Salissian mercenaries worked for Count Dooku and the Confederacy of Independent Systems on the planet Drongar. The world was home to the bota plant, valued by both the Confederacy and the Galactic Republic, and as a consequence, the planet was heavily contested in 20 BBY.

Ji was a deadly melee fighter\u2014having been a former Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si champion\u2014and was working as a combat instructor for the Republic forces on Drongar. He engaged the Salissians, killing all three in blindingly quick strikes, and taking a trophy from their bodies. The attack was captured by a cam droid that was eventually retrieved by the Sullustan journalist Den Dhur. Later, an elite Salissian combat team undergoing training on Drongar encountered Ji in a clearing on the planet's surface. Initially, three soldiers were felled by pinpoint blaster shots by Ji. Two more mercenaries, accompanied by a B2 super battle droid, emerged from the forest, and were also killed by Ji; one's neck was snapped by the Bunduki. When two more mercenaries approached, Ji shot their blasters out of their hands before engaging them in hand-to-hand combat. He killed these and two others, before slowly being overwhelmed by the Confederate forces. Ji struck the last blow, detonating a thermal grenade to take his own life and those of the mercenaries surrounding him. This second fight was also captured by cam droid, this time prearranged by Ji. The footage was sent to Dhur, who wrote a scathing article on Ji, whom he believed to be a psychopath. However, Dhur's editors rewrote the story, painting Ji's massacre of the Salissians as heroic. The Salissians' defeat at the hands of Ji was later made into a HoloNet News documentary, calling Ji the \"The Martyr of Drongar,\" and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine dedicated a statue to Ji at Monument Plaza on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, a number of Salissians worked for the Falleen Prince Xizor, a contender for leader of the Black Sun criminal organization.
