The daughter of Chancey Yarrow, Sylvestri inherited her mother's starship, the Switchback, at the age of eighteen after Chancey's apparent death in a Nihil attack. Sylvestri, her copilot Neeto Janajana, and her ancient security droid M-227 attempted to make a living as traders, but the galactic instability caused by the pirates led to them barely scraping by. An encounter with the Nihil in the Berenge sector, during which Sylvestri and Janajana discovered that the pirates had somehow developed the ability to knock ships out of hyperspace, led them to abandon the Switchback. Sylvestri had wanted to stay and fight, but Janajana persuaded her that a last stand was futile and that it was imperative they report the Nihil's new capabilities to the Galactic Republic and Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sylvestri Yarrow, nicknamed Syl, was a human female who lived during the High Republic Era. Born around the year 249 BBY to Chancey Yarrow, Sylvestri grew up on her mother's starship, the Switchback. Sylvestri was unaware that her mother had been educated in hyperspace theory at the Academy of Carida, a military college, or that she had even gone to college. Chancey's interest in inventing a gravity well projector had gotten her ejected from the program, and it had brought her to the attention of Lourna Dee, a Tempest Runner of the Nihil marauder organization. Sylvestri was raised believing her mother to be a mere hauler and member of the Byne Guild who championed the oppressed and opposed the Nihil, not a collaborator and hyperspace genius."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chancey Yarrow would later describe her daughter as having always been a sulky child. When Sylvestri was twelve years old, Chancey had enraged her by refusing to allow her to attend a festival on Zeltros with a friend."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the many lessons that Chancey taught Sylvestri was that politics was where truth went to die. Before Sylvestri was allowed to pilot the Switchback, her mother taught her how to to navigate the old-fashioned way: using a star chart, not relying on the navicomputer. Once, she mistakenly transposed the numbers in her flight calculations, causing them to fly toward Hynestia instead of Haileap; from that mistake, she learned to always double- and triple-check, and she had certain coordinates  memorized. Another of her mother's lessons was that despite the galaxy being a vast and uncaring place, they should be neither selfish nor irresponsible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At thirteen, Sylvestri spent a year with her \"auntie Lourna\" learning from the Twi'lek woman how to defend herself in close quarters. During that time, Dee knocked the girl unconscious, broke her arm twice, and possibly fractured her jaw more than once; Dee told Sylvestri that no one would pull their punches with her and that she was lucky to be alive. The girl took for granted why she was being taught so much about self-defense and security, as the life of a hauler was dangerous. She did not question why her mother made her repeatedly do exercises with a drill instructor's precision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yarrows and their crew members had been part of the Byne Guild, a merchant guild that was supposed to represent the interests of its members. Some of the Yarrows' friends in the guild were on the Legacy Run when it was destroyed in the Great Disaster of 232 BBY by the Nihil. In the aftermath, the Byne Guild was dissolved for forcing members into abusive contracts as indentured crew. Around the time of the disaster, Lourna Dee made contact with Chancey Yarrow to present an opportunity to build her gravity well projector with the assistance of Mari San Tekka, who was held captive by Marchion Ro to provide unique hyperspace navigational paths. Dee believed that the device, later dubbed Gravity's Heart, would weaponize hyperspace. The genius was interested in pursuing the work."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Love and heartbreak"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chancey and Sylvestri Yarrow journeyed to the planet Tiikae, a small world that was overseen by the San Tekka clan and had a temple of the Jedi Order. At the temple, Chancey had smiled at the Jedi; she had always spoken highly of them, though she had also advised her daughter that their mind tricks would not work on a being who was wary, focused their thoughts, and fortified their mind against the Jedi's telepathy. The few months that Sylvestri spent on Tiikae were the happiest time of her life. At one point, Chancey left her there for a month, possibly to meet with the Nihil and broker a contract for her services. However, she told Sylvestri that she was to study repairing hyperdrives and sublight engines with Roy and Klanna, a family of Ugnaughts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A San Tekka cousin, Jordanna Sparkburn, had left her speeder bike with the Ugnaughts for repairs. Sylvestri Yarrow was partway through repairing the repulsorlift when Sparkburn came to check on the progress. Yarrow and Sparkburn quickly fell in love, and for four weeks, the happy couple spending their days together and stayed up late to watch auroras in the night sky. Yarrow began to entertain the thought of her mother never returning, freeing her to move in with Sparkburn, when she learned that her mother would be arriving to collect her. The night before her departure, Yarrow asked Sparkburn to leave and tour the galaxy with her. Sparkburn, who was training to become the next deputy on Tiikae after her aunt retired, could not set aside those responsibilities or leave her home, and declined to leave with her. When Yarrow's mother returned the next morning, Sparkburn did not show up to say goodbye before the Yarrows left the planet."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The great loss"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Less than two weeks after leaving Tiikae and breaking up with Sparkburn, Sylvestri Yarrow suffered another loss.
