They could grow as long as three meters and become as thick as the arm of a Kiffar. Snakes moved smoothly over surfaces with a distinctive twisting motion. When angered, they started hissing and thrashing. Some snakes were venomous, and their bites were painful.

Some small specimens resided in Yoda's hut; one such creature startled Luke Skywalker while he was preparing to leave Dagobah to rescue Han Solo and Leia Organa.
