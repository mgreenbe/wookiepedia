They were apparently fairly volatile, as demonstrated by Vergere at Ebaq Nine.\nThough not maneuverable by its own, the agility could be improved by adding adjustable thrust-vector controls and thrust control jets, as with the A-wing. But even with that, the craft is nearly impossible to regain a stable flight even from some of the best pilots in the galaxy, as seen when Arvel Crynyd, a lone A-wing pilot, lost control of his craft and crashed in to the Executor's bridge during the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
