On his first assignment after graduating, Echo was tasked with guarding the Rishi Station moon base, where he, along with Fives, Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex,\" Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody,\" and Hevy, who sacrificed himself during the fight, aided in warning the Republic of an impending Separatist attack on Kamino.

Echo was later tasked with a mission to Lola Sayu, where he joined a group of Jedi and experienced clone troopers to retrieve coordinates to the Nexus Route from the Jedi Master Even Piell, who had been imprisoned on Lola Sayu's Citadel lead by Commandant Osi Sobeck. After Piell and his surviving men were rescued, the group headed for the landing field to escape on a shuttle. However, when Echo noticed a commando droid target their shuttle with a laser turret, he advanced to secure their ship, ultimately being blown up with the ship in a massive explosion that led his comrades to believe he was killed.

When Rex found traces of Echo's survival, he, accompanied by Clone Force 99 and Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, led a mission to rescue Echo on Skako Minor. They succeeded, and, in turn, Echo used his cybernetic capabilities to turn the tide against the Separatists on Anaxes, leading to the Republic's victory.

He sarcastically received the nickname \"Echo\" for having a tendency to repeat orders during training exercises, which greatly annoyed his fellow troopers. Echo lived in the barracks of Tipoca City, where he endured physical and mental training, and was identified by the designation CT-21-0408 as a cadet. Like all clones, Echo was a genetic copy of the once renowned bounty hunter Jango Fett, although, due to the millions of clones straining what DNA was left of the deceased Fett, it was speculated by the Kaminoan Administrator Lama Su that Echo, along with the other cadets in his unit, was too deficient to be a soldier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one of their final training exercises, Echo and Domino Squad\u2014the cadets CT-4040 \"Cutup,\" CT-00-2010 \"Droidbait,\" CT-5555 \"Fives,\" and CT-782 \"Hevy\"\u2014had failed to work together on the battlefield and began to fight amongst each other during the exercise. Echo insisted that the squad simply follow orders to pass their training, for which he was mocked by Hevy as the squad cast blame for their repeated failures on each other. The string of recent disappointments by Domino Squad caused their trainers\u2014the Togruta Jedi Shaak Ti, the Siniteen Bric, and the Arcona El-Les\u2014to grow concerned about their chances of successfully being inducted into the Grand Army of the Republic. Shaak Ti observed that Echo had issues adapting to the battlefield, as he was too busy trying to impose the rules of the exercise on his squad-mates. Meanwhile, Bric stated his wish to flatly abandon the whole squad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, the ARC trooper \"Colt\" visited the cadets with the intention of pitting them against their final test: the Citadel Challenge. On the mock-battlefield, Echo and Domino Squad were expected to face nonlethal battle droids and climb to the top of a citadel. However, the squad was unable to work together yet again, automatically failing the test when they chose to leave an injured Droidbait behind. Colt reprimanded Echo and the others for breaking the most important rule of working together as one. Following their failure, Echo and Fives requested a transfer to Bravo Squad, a group that had easily passed the Citadel Challenge, as they were unable to cooperate with the rest of team. Shaak Ti denied their request, insisting the clones reassess their teamwork before they attempt their last chance at the final challenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next day, Echo and Domino Squad went into the challenge with a renewed inspiration; Hevy had received encouragement from the malformed clone 99, a member of the maintenance crew, while Cutup had proved resilient when Bric tried to goad him into a fight. Echo and his team coherently made their way through the battle droids on the battlefield, making it to the citadel without trouble. However, they were unable to conventionally scale the tower when they realized their ascension cables were not with them, having been removed by Bric beforehand without their knowledge. In a surprise to Bric, the clone cadets managed to strategize and used the citadel's blaster cannons to scale the tower after neutralizing them, leading to their success. Shaak Ti, in that moment, believed the squad to be one of the best she had ever seen.

Echo served under Clone Sergeant \"O'Niner\" and, although Hevy disliked their boring assignment, took a liking to the quiet outpost, using the time to catch up on Republic Army regulations. Despite the seeming simplicity of their post, the squad did not realize the importance of the Rishi Station, as it was a listening post to ensure that no attack came to Kamino, their homeworld, by broadcasting a continuous all-clear signal. Unbeknownst to Echo or the rest of the stationed clones, the Separatist Alliance General Grievous planned on invading Kamino with a fleet of Munificent-class star frigates and Droid Control Ships, all of which were in orbit near the Rishi moon. Grievous sent an infiltration squad of BX-series droid commandos, an advanced type of battle droid that the clone troopers had not seen up to that point in the war, to covertly take over the Rishi outpost. After killing CT-327, the clone who was posted as the sentry outside, the commando droids made their way into the outpost and attacked the clones. When the initial wave of defense, including Sergeant O'Niner, were all quickly eliminated, Echo and the others fell back.

The trio fired a droid attack flare into the sky to warn the unsuspecting Republic forces, and, above, the Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody\" and Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" saw the warning flare and blasted the disguised droid that had just greeted them. The two experienced clone troopers were then attacked by the droid commandos that had been hiding nearby, and their shuttle was destroyed by a thermal detonator. To escape the blast, Cody and Rex jumped off the landing platform, finding their way to the clone rookies shortly after. Echo and the others were then forced by Rex to remove their helmets to prove they were not droids, just moments before a Rishi eel attacked the clones again before it was killed by the Clone Captain with a single shot to the eye. Once the danger had passed, Rex sized up the three troopers, telling Commander Cody that they had some \"shinies\" to work with. When Echo asked what that meant, Captain Rex strode over to the eel carcass, explaining that their armor was shiny and new, just like they were in terms of combat experience. He then placed his hand, covered in the blue blood of the eel, onto Echo's chest, leaving his handprint on his armor.

Echo and the others experienced their first droid kills during the assault. As Echo and Hevy took down the last droid, they had a brief exchange about who got the credit for the kill. However, after Cody checked the all-clear signal, he realized the droids had hard-wired it, making it impossible to deactivate immediately. The clones realized they had little time once a landing craft of battle droids sent by Grievous to reinforce the droid commandos, which had not checked in, arrived on the platform outside. Rex suggested the clones instead destroy the Rishi Station, which would force the all-clear signal to cease, warning any nearby Republic fleets. Echo recommended using the station's liquid tibanna fuel reserve for the job, as the substance was highly explosive and was regularly used to heat the station from the cold Rishi weather. Rex and the others agreed, and they armed themselves to repel the oncoming droid assault."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Cody, Fives, and Hevy held the droid forces at bay, Echo and Rex prepared the explosive tibanna by arming it to the station's GNK-series power droids and linking them to a detonator.

Once the clones made it outside, Hevy was unable to follow after he was gunned down, but he successfully set off the detonator, completely obliterating the Rishi Station and the battle droids in the explosion. Once the all-clear signal stopped broadcasting, the Republic fleet, realizing that invasion could be imminent, entered the Rishi system and engaged Grievous' fleet, forcing the outnumbered Separatist General to flee.

Echo asserted that they did not deserve the honor since they had failed to defend the outpost, but Cody reminded him that they had saved Kamino from potential invasion.

They informed 99 of the death of Hevy, who had given 99 his graduation medal before leaving Kamino for the Rishi Station. 99 was eager to help the two clone troopers in preparations for the oncoming Separatist assault and joined with Echo and Fives.

Echo and Fives, desiring a better sniping position, agreed to make their way to the armory with 99 when a group of cadets that had been separated from the others appeared. Echo and Fives both tried to inspire confidence in the clone cadets, reminding them that they were fighting for their home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The entourage of clones successfully reached the armory near the barracks, where they were confronted by General Grievous and a group of battle droids. Kenobi showed up and confronted the general himself, dueling Grievous in lightsaber combat and leading him away from the armory.

The troopers ran out of grenades to use against the droids, so 99 made his way to retrieve more, but he was shot down from behind, much to Echo's dismay. As they defeated the last of the droids, the clones gathered around 99, with Echo holding the old clone in his arms. Soon after, the battle was won as the Separatist Droid Army, including Grievous and Ventress, was routed all throughout Tipoca City, and the clone troopers mourned the death of their clone brothers.

The 501st, including Echo and Fives, was tasked with Piell's rescue, led by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Piell was being held at a prison known as the Citadel on the planet Lola Sayu, a prison built specifically to hold Jedi. To get to the Citadel covertly the rescue group was frozen in carbonite, which prevented their life signs from being detected aboard their transport. Subsequently, the astromech droid R2-D2 and a group of reprogrammed battle droids piloted the shuttle into Separatist space over Lola Sayu.

Despite Sobeck sending his forces after the rescue group, Echo and company were able to fight their way\u2014which included avoiding electrified magnetic walls\u2014to Piell's location, where they freed him from the prison's interrogator droid. Piell informed his rescuers that his crewman, Captain Wilhuff Tarkin, had memorized one half of the Nexus Route coordinates, while he had memorized the other. Echo and company then fought their way to free Tarkin and the rest of Piell's surviving crew, before they split up, with Kenobi and Piell creating a distraction for the others to escape and meet up afterward.

In the meantime, Echo and Fives held off attacking battle droids as their group made its way through the tunnels, with the Padawan Ahsoka Tano taking point until they reached a fuel pipeline. Unaware that Kenobi and Piell had been captured, Echo and the others used the fuel line to make their way to the rendezvous, where they expected an extraction by R2. When the astromech failed to arrive, Skywalker led Echo and the others on his \"Plan B\": to board the shuttle by force.

The droid successfully fired upon the crew's escape shuttle, causing a large explosion that caught Echo in the blast. He was thought to have been killed in said blast, as Fives and the others saw only his charred helmet. Without a transport, the crew retreated from the battle scene and called the Jedi Council for aid, requesting an evacuation.

Tambor had the intention of using the clone for counterintelligence, accessing Echo's knowledge of strategic Republic algorithms, as, despite claiming neutrality in the war, the Techno Union was secretly allied with Separatists. Tambor took Echo to Skako Minor, where the clone trooper was placed in stasis\u2014preventing him from regaining control of his consciousness\u2014and forced to remotely feed information for the Separatists' campaign on the planet Anaxes.

Echo regained consciousness and remembered only his last moments at the Citadel, but once Rex helped him orient himself, realized what was happening and was happy to see Rex had returned for him. Immediately afterward, Tambor surrounded the stasis chamber and threatened the crew with the Decimator droid, but Echo, once Tech safely disconnected him from the computer system, was able to aid in their escape, using the knowledge of the base he acquired during his time spent connected to its computers. Echo guided the crew outside through the ventilation shafts; meanwhile, Wrecker destroyed his empty stasis chamber. After making their way out, the crew used the native keeradaks to fly away from the base, evading pursuit by the aerial D-wing droids. Their flight led to the village of the local Poletecs, natives Rex and the others had already encountered beforehand, where Rex used Echo as an example of Separatist cruelty to rally the Poletecs to fight alongside them.

Although Rex was hesitant due to Echo's physical state, Windu was open to Echo's plan of infiltration. Echo proposed using his own Separatist capabilities against the Confederacy army, and planned to board Trench's dreadnought to feed him false information about the Republic's strategies. Echo ensured his allies that Tambor, despite his Separatist allegiance, knew that Trench would have him killed if he found out Echo was no longer in Separatist hands.

Once the Havoc Marauder reached Separatist space, Echo used his socket-arm to interface with the starship's computer systems and masked the ship's identity, fooling the Separatist blockade into letting the transport dock with Trench's flagship as if it were a Separatist shuttle. Once aboard, Echo and the infiltration crew made their way to a nearby communications vault, where Tech rigged an interface for Echo to use and masked his signal, making it appear as if Echo was still transmitting from Skako Minor.

Echo was immune to the command, however, because his experience at the hands of the Techno Union had rendered his chip inoperable. The Bad Batch heard blaster fire and turned around to see Billaba falling at the hands of her own troops. Echo and his squad-mates tried to approach Dume, who had been told to run, but he ignited his lightsaber and warned them to stay away from him. He then vanished into the nearby forest. Echo asked what had happened, and Tech explained that the comm chatter was transmitting a single message, \"Execute Order 66,\" on repeat. Unsure of what was unfolding, Hunter sent Echo and Tech to check with the commander to discern what was going on while he and Crosshair pursued Dume into the forest.

Wrecker was confused, and Echo simply reiterated that they had been away a long time. As the ship entered Kamino's atmosphere, two V-wing starfighters approached and requested a clearance code. Echo was surprised, wondering how the starfighters did not know who they were, but Tech speculated that it was just a protocol drill.

Just then, a Jedi's corpse was carried by under a sheet, and their lightsaber fell to the ground near the squad. The shock trooper retrieved it and asked Hunter if there was a problem, but he denied the trooper's accusation.

Wrecker added several tally marks to the wall for the successful missions the squad had undertaken since their last visit home, leading Echo to point out that Kaller had not been a win. Sitting at the table in the centre of the room as the others largely dispersed to their bunks, Echo vented about what had happened on Kaller, wondering how the clones could have turned on Billaba so abruptly given that some of them had served under her for years, as the claim that the Jedi had all committed treason made no sense. Tech noted that it was well known that the Kaminoans had engineered the clones with behavioural programming which inhibited certain traits in order to make them more obedient, suggesting that this was to blame. He further suggested that the Bad Batch's genetic mutations, which the Kaminoans had enhanced, made them largely immune to the programming, although he could not be certain. When Hunter brought up the fact that Echo was technically a reg, leading Echo to wonder why he had not reacted like the others, Tech theorized that Echo's experiences at the Citadel and being subjected to experimentation afterwards had disrupted whatever programming he had been engineered with, noting that percentage-wise, he was more of a machine than a man.

As the Batch and many regs watched in a large room, Palpatine claimed the Jedi had attempted to assassinate him and their \"rebellion\" had been crushed, before proclaiming the reorganization of the Republic into the first Galactic Empire. Echo was unnerved, but after Palpatine finished his speech, all of the regular clones in the room began cheering, leading Tech to make an arch remark about their programming. Afterwards, as they walked through the hallways, Echo was uncomfortable with serving an empire, noting the clones were soldiers of the Republic. Crosshair displayed apathy towards the change in response, but Tech noted that the eradication of the Jedi was a fairly big difference. Hunter realized the squad was being followed by a young girl who introduced herself as Omega, before making it clear that she was familiar with the squad and its members. When she was asked why she was on Kamino, Nala Se walked up and said the girl was her medical assistant before leading her away, leaving the Batch confused."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, as the Bad Batch sat down in the mess hall, Wrecker dismissed the notion that he could be programmed, despite Tech's assertions that the facts supported his hypothesis. They were then joined by Hunter, who informed them that he had overheard the regs talking about Imperial had arrived on Kamino to evaluate the clones. However, they were all confused when Omega showed up and decided to sit with them. Her presence, however, led to mockery from a passing trooper, and Omega's response to his behaviour was to throw food at him, starting a brawl between the Batch and the regs. Echo was exasperated as this was not the first time, briefly facepalming before joining the fight. Crosshair continued eating until his meal was disrupted by Echo being knocked across the table, leading him to join the brawl in irritation. At a disadvantage due to having only one hand, Echo was knocked to the ground by another clone, but before he could get up, he was distracted upon seeing Tarkin and Lama Su observing the brawl from above. A warning shout from Tech came too late for Echo to avoid being knocked out cold with a tray."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Echo was taken to the medical bay, where he was examined by medical droid AZI-345211896246498721347.

When Echo did wake up, he briefly panicked upon realizing where he was, batting away the medical equipment and yelling to \"get them off\" before he became more aware of his surroundings. AZI-3 introduced himself, but when he addressed Echo by his designation number, Omega corrected him about the clone's name. The rest of the Batch arrived, Wrecker smugly exclaiming to Crosshair that the sniper owed him two credits since Echo was, indeed, alive. AZI-3 told them that Echo's condition was stable, but left after dramatically informing the others that they appeared to be genetically defective and that they must be shocked. Tech remarked about the squad being more deviant then defective, and Echo informed his squad that Tarkin was the Imperial sent to evaluate the clones. When Tech asked if it was indeed the same Tarkin from the Citadel rescue, Echo confirmed it, saying that he had not liked clones back then and that it was a danger. Hunter said the squad had been summoned by the Prime Minister, so they would soon find out, and they left, leaving Omega behind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All clones were built to be loyal to the Republic, and Echo was no exception. He was by the book and a stickler for the rules. This often grated on his fellow cadets, who called him a \"know-it-all.\" He showed considerable respect for his trainers during his time as a cadet. While posted on the Rishi Moon, he enjoyed the downtime that bored and frustrated his squad-mates, using it to read and catch up on military regulations. He frequently quoted said regulations to his teammates to explain or suggest strategies. From his time as a cadet, his compulsion to repeat orders to his teammates gained him the nickname \"Echo,\" which stuck with him throughout his career. Although inexperienced at the time of the Rishi Moon incident, Echo adapted quickly to battle using both his mental and military training. Echo was commended on numerous occasions for showing bravery, courage, ingenuity, and skill in battle or otherwise during his service to the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Echo developed a particularly close bond with Fives, which continued after the two were the only members of their squad to survive the Rishi Moon. Conversely, he often clashed with Hevy, who chafed at his obsession with rules and got into physical altercations with him when they were cadets. Despite the friction in their relationship, Echo trusted Hevy and grieved his death when he sacrificed himself to destroy the Rishi Moon outpost.

Even though he felt very close to Rex, he decided to join the Bad Batch in the aftermath of the battle, feeling that he fit in with the unique squad.

After his induction into the Grand Army of the Republic, Echo bore the standard white armor that all clone troopers were issued. Echo and his teammates at the Rishi Moon were referred to as \"shinies\" by Captain Rex, due to their new armor being unscathed and for Echo's inexperience with combat. After Rex killed a Rishi eel in defense of Echo and the clone troopers before they took back the Rishi Station, he stamped his hand, covered in the eel's blood, on Echo's armor. Echo carried this stamped handprint on his armor for the rest of his time with the 501st, even after his promotion to the rank of ARC trooper. With his new rank, Echo was issued standard ARC trooper armor and he clad it in blue paint; this armor, along with his helmet, was destroyed when he was nearly killed on Lola Sayu.
