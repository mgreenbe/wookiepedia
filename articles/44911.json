The Hub was commanded by Major Steen Borkas in 14 BBY. During a plot to assassinate Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, members of the Free Ryloth Movement including Isval bombed the station's satellite dishes in an attempt to hamper Imperial rescue efforts. Despite this, Borkas and his men managed to repair the station's dishes. One satellite, Dish 3, survived the assault. This enabled Moff Delian Mors' forces to reinforce the Emperor and Vader before the Free Ryloth movement could kill them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
