At some point before the Battle of Yavin, 261 was among the many droids used to maintain operations aboard the Death Star battle station. However, the astromech went rogue, stealing secret documents and escaping in a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle. The Imperials then hired the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk, who traced 261 to Tatooine and retrieved it from a clan of Jawas.
