The power allowed a Fallanassi to make marks or inscriptions that were undetectable by normal or even artificial senses. Other Fallanassi could uncover the marks by using the Sense Scribing power. Fallanassi used the power to leave trails for other Fallanassi to follow, and the marks remained even if the surface was defaced or partially destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
