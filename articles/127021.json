Led by Gorr, Skreek and the other pirates attacked the platform a second time. Skreek flew in aboard a speeder bike alongside Gorr as he spotted the engineers Kazuda Xiono and Jarek Yeager attempting to install a targeting computer to activate the Colossus' turbolasers. Gorr disembarked with Skreek and a Hassk pirate to stop them. While Yeager sent the Hassk falling to his doom, Gorr latched onto his hoverlift, and Skreek engaged Xiono. Yeager then rammed his hoverlift into Skreek, knocking him unconscious. When he woke up again, Yeager was still fighting Gorr on the hoverlift, and Xiono was climbing back up to the ledge after briefly falling off. Skreek confronted him, but he grabbed a spear and stunned him.
