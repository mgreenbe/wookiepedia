The hunter and his guild had altered the freighter to be a slave vessel, which they used to obtain captives and transport them to Wasskah, moon of Trandosha, to be released and hunted down as prey by the Trandoshans. The Vermin-Thrax was equipped with a chin turret set under the cockpit and powerful floodlights, while its hold was converted into prison cells. The front of the vessel featured imagery of the teeth of a demon from Trandoshan folklore in order to strike fear into Garnac's victims."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Garnac's guild captured the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, transporting her and several other prisoners aboard the Vermin-Thrax to Wasskah. On the moon, Tano encountered Jedi younglings Jinx, Kalifa, and O-Mer, and the four eventually resolved to fight back against the Trandoshans. Though Kalifa was killed, the Jedi managed to ambush the Vermin-Thrax on its next stop on Wasskah. In a fight between Tano and one of the pilots, stray blaster bolts damaged the vessel's controls, and the Vermin-Thrax broke apart, crashing onto the moon. The Jedi were accompanied by the freighter's only captive, the Wookiee Chewbacca, while Garnac and his hunters discovered the Vermin-Thrax's wreckage the next day."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
