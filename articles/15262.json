In the battle, Rebel Alliance forces landed on the planet's surface and fought with forces of the Galactic Empire, making their way to the planet's city. Due to the city being located deep within the terrain of Nevarro, which provided no viable cover, the rebels suffered heavy casualties. Thus, the Empire retained control of the planet until the end of the war in 5 ABY, though an Imperial remnant operated on Nevarro after the war's end. In 9 ABY, the Mandalorian Din Djarin asked the former rebel shock trooper Cara Dune if she had ever been to Nevarro while the two were travelling to the planet. Dune detailed the history of the battle while revealing she had never visited the planet before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle on Nevarro was mentioned in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning,\" the seventh episode of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ live-action series The Mandalorian.
