Shortly after Order 66, the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal, which had been carrying former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, fell out of hyperspace above the moon after former Sith apprentice Maul, previously a prisoner on the vessel, destroyed its hyperdrive. The Star Destroyer was caught in the gravitational field of the moon. Tano and Clone Commander Rex managed to escape before the ship crashed, but the remaining clone troopers aboard were killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, during the Imperial Era, Galactic Empire forces led by Darth Vader visited the crash site, and Vader discovered the abandoned lightsaber of his former apprentice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The moon appeared brown and green from space, with white clouds and largely rocky terrain, and had an atmosphere breathable to humans and Togruta. It also experienced seasons, with the barren area where the Tribunal crashed at the end of the Clone Wars becoming snow-covered by the time the crash site was discovered by the Galactic Empire some years later. The moon was located somewhere between the Outer Rim planet Mandalore and the Core Worlds planet Coruscant, near a larger blue-and-white astronomical object. Convorees were known to live on the moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal, which had been travelling from Mandalore to Coruscant, was thrown into chaos when the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, publicly Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, issued Order 66, a secret directive that compelled the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic to turn on and kill their Jedi commanders via control chips implanted in their brains. Former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano was onboard the Star Destroyer, having captured the renegade Sith Lord Maul, a former apprentice of Sidious, during the Siege of Mandalore. She and Clone Commander Rex intended to deliver him to the Jedi High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Tano narrowly escaped the bridge, she was forced to release Maul from the Mandalorian vault he had been imprisoned in as a diversion for the mind-controlled clones, allowing her the time to follow up on a clue Rex had given her before capturing him to remove his control chip and bring him back to his senses. Maul, left to his own devices, destroyed the starship's hyperdrive, severely damaging it and forcing it out of hyperspace, where it was caught in the gravitational pull of the moon, setting it on a collision course. As the Tribunal fell towards the moon, Tano and Rex reached the hangar control room and discovered the situation the ship was in. However, as they were fighting their way through the hangar to steal a shuttle, Maul took advantage of the situation to take it for himself, with Tano attempting to prevent his escape but ultimately being forced to let him go in order to defend Rex from clone reinforcements that had arrived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Tribunal, falling apart, hit the moon's atmosphere, Tano and Rex found a working BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber in the repair bay to escape in. Tano, defending against more attacking clones, Force-threw Rex over to the starfighter. Onboard one of the bridges, a naval officer ordered the Star Destroyer's retrorockets fired, but was informed that they had lost lateral control just before everyone on that bridge was killed by an explosion, throwing the ship completely out of control. As the attacking clones and Tano were knocked off their feet, Rex got into the Y-wing and yelled for Tano to get over to the ship, but as she leapt for it, the Y-wing was knocked free of the Tribunal, sending her tumbling through the atmosphere. Rex managed to gain control of the starfighter and flew back to get her, with Tano running over falling debris to reach him. When the Tribunal crashed, everyone still onboard was killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterwards, Tano and Rex went to the crash site, salvaging useful items from the wreckage, as well as the remains of her personal astromech droid R7-A7, who had been taken out by blaster fire during the hangar firefight. They also buried the bodies of every clone trooper they could find, marking the graves with the clones' helmets on sticks. Tano, despairing, abandoned her lightsabers at the crash site in order to fake her death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some years later, during the Imperial Era, the now snow-covered crash site was discovered by Imperial forces. The Sith Lord Darth Vader, who had been Tano's master prior to her departure from the Jedi Order and his fall to the dark side, visited the crash site and recovered one of her abandoned lightsabers, taking it with him when he left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tribunal's wreckage and gravesite on the moon was the only known point of interest, lying there for several years before the Empire found it. By the time the crash site was discovered by the Empire, all of the grave markers Tano and Rex had erected for the dead clones had fallen down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The moon first appeared in \"Victory and Death,\" the series finale of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, which premiered on Disney+ on May 4, 2020.
