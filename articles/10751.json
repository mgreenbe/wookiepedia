Because the user of an automated cargo pod didn't have to go through the hassle of requisitioning a freighter, they were considered to be a very convenient and secure method of shipping. Typical automated cargo pods were one meter long and conical. They were equipped with a communications package so that proper identification codes could be broadcast and thick insulation so that the items held inside the pod were not damaged. If an owner felt his was especially valuable, the pods could be armed as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
