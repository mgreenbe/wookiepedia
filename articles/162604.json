Walker mounts were designed to offset the limited maneuverability of large-scale weapons that needed to be assembled to be used on the battlefield. In effect, walker mounts allowed a weapon to move by itself. The walker mount could be operated in one of two ways; by an operator \"driving\" the mount, or by the use of a control unit for remote movement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
