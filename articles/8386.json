Subordinate to the network leader, area coordinators took the leader's directives and turned them into actionable tactical operations. Area coordinators were at a high risk of capture and exposure, as they coordinated and even accompanied various cells on operations if needed. If an area coordinator was captured and made to expose information, they could comprise an entire section of the cell network and the network leader. Many area coordinators carried suicide pills in case of capture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
