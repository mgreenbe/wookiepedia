At some point by the date 38:4:1:02, the individual Hyannis was involved in a firefight on Maro Della. During the skirmish, Hyannis prepared to fire a Model MGL-1 micro-grenade launcher. The magnetic rings that propelled the weapon's projectiles, however, had degraded due to lack of maintenance and failed. As a result, a micro-grenade was jammed in the weapon's barrel, and Hyannis had to throw the launcher away before the grenade detonated within seconds. Hyannis later mentioned the incident on Maro Della in the illegal database Gundark's Gear Datalog."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maro Della was mentioned in the 1997 sourcebook Gundark's Fantastic Technology: Personal Gear, which was published for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
