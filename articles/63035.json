Available following the Battle of Yavin during the Galactic Civil War between Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the guide included a section on the starport in the city of Lola Curich, which was located on the planet Lianna. In that section, the publication described and praised the Lianns' use of preservatives and spices in cooking, mentioning how they were used in combination with less interesting foods. It suggested that travelers buy food on the streets of the spaceport, where they could eat for only five credits and still fully sample the local cuisine. Foods suggested by the travel guide included fish sticks, VegeParsine, choya bread, and Dalkash ale."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "How to Do the Allied Tion on 25 Credits a Day first appeared in Mission to Lianna, an adventure written by Joanne E.
