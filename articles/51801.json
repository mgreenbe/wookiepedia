Unlike most Jedi of the era, Jedi Slagistrough did not serve in the Army of Light in the crusades against the Brotherhood of Darkness. Instead, Slagistrough continued to maintain order within the Service Corps, aiding worlds devastated by the New Sith Wars and providing food for soldiers on the front lines. When his brother and sister Jedi within the Order proposed that a guidebook to the life of the Jedi be written, Jedi Slagistrough agreed to work on the project, contributing a chapter describing the inner workings of the Service Corps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While it did not make it into the finished edition, Daniel Wallace, author of The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, released a list detailing the genders and species of each of the authors of the in-universe The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force.
