Trying to stay hidden so that no First Order patrol officer would see her, Rey met Nambi Ghima who gave her a husk necklace and asked her name to which Rey replied her name was Rey. When the youngling asked her last name she replied she didn't have one. Just then she connected with Kylo Ren. During the connection, Ren told Rey that Darth Sidious wanted her dead, however, he had other plans. Rey told him how he still could not get over what he did to Han Solo. Ren said he will find another way to turn her over to him, then he snatched her necklace the young Aki-Aki gave her earlier. Running over to Dameron and Finn, Rey told them it was time to leave because she had been discovered by Ren. Along the way, they were confronted by First Order stormtrooper FN-2802 who tried to alert the other stormtrooper in that area but was killed by a masked smuggler. Telling them to follow him, he led them into a large vehicle and revealed himself to be Lando Calrissian, much to the enjoyment of Chewbacca. Calrissian told them that Leia Organa had sent him a message. However they were interrupted by the First Order. As they departed, Rey told Calrissian that the Resistance badly needed pilots, but Calrissian told her that his flying days were over. Calrissian asked Rey to give Leia his love, but Rey retorted to give it to her himself."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The escape"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Locating skimmers to use to escape, Dameron was able to hotwire two of them. As they fled the Festival, they were spotted by First Order jet troopers who followed them in pursuit. Trying to get them of their tail, Rey, Chewbacca, Finn, and Dameron tried to outmaneuver them to no avail. They were forced to shoot at them while they were split up. They were however able to defeat the jet troopers, however they fell into quicksand. While they were sinking,  Finn tried to tell Rey something however they had sunk in the quicksand before he was able to. Finding themselves in a hidden cave Rey asked Finn what he was going to tell her, but Finn told her he didn't want to say it in front of Dameron much to his dismay. Later on they discovered the remains of Sith assassin Ochi and his blade. Seeing that it had Sith language, they tried to see if C-3PO could translate, but he couldn't because of programming block. Before anything could happen they were attacked by a vexis. Finn and Dameron got their Glie-44 blaster pistols out to shoot the beast, but Rey was able to Force heal the wounded beast which then left, creating a hole for them to escape. Meanwhile, the Knights of Ren arrived on the surface of the planet, searching for Rey and her allies. Leaving the cave they went to Bestoon Legacy which Rey knew from an unknown time."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Duel with Ren"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at the ship, Rey sensed Kylo Ren in pursuit. Leaving to confront him, she told Finn that she would be right back. Going out in the desert, she drew her lightsaber and was able to cut of the wing of his TIE/wi modified interceptor, causing it to crash. When Finn told Chewbacca to go find Rey, Chewbacca was spotted by Knights of Ren Ap'lek and Kuruk, who captured him and gave him to the First Order. Realizing that Chewbacca has been captured, Finn alerted Rey of the situation. Seeing a First Order transport leaving, Rey used the Force to stop it. However, Ren, who survived the crash, used the Force on the ship as well. As she began to be overpowered by Ren, Rey grew angry and, without understanding her capabilities, accidentally used Force lightning, which destroyed the transport. Horrified due to believing she had killed her friend as well as the surprise of her display of a Force power associated with the Dark side of the Force, Rey looked on in shock as the ship crashed to the ground. However, before Ren and his forces could catch her, Finn helped her back to the ship. The group fled from the oncoming TIE/fo space superiority fighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving on the Bestoon Legacy, Rey, Finn, and Dameron learned that C-3PO had the language inscribed in his memory. Decided not to let Chewie's death be in vain, they decided to go to Kijimi, where Poe knew an old ally to get the language out of C-3PO. Meanwhile the First Order captured the Millennium Falcon and the Sith dagger and transported it to the Steadfast, where General Armitage Hux informed Allegiant General Enric Pryde that they captured a valuable prisoner, Chewbacca, boasting that the Wookiee used to fly with Han Solo, angering Chewbacca at the mention of his late best friend's name."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
