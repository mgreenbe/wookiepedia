At some prior point during his Imperial service, he hired Cal Handro, a pilot who was in truth a spy for the Alliance. During his service in Restuss, he led a group that rescued Handro, who was wanted dead by Alliance Sergeant Major Wolff Kalos, from a Rebel-operated safe house outside another city on Rori named Narmle. The spacer whom Kalos had directed to the safe house knew M'Kae was involved, and went to Restuss to speak to the Imperial officer. M'Kae was initially unwilling to give away Handro's whereabouts, although he was willing to give away the information for 10,000 credits. Upon being bribed, M'Kae revealed to the spacer that Handro was taking a trip to show a new pilot his route to the planet Kashyyyk, and subsequently, in exchange for his life, tell the Empire all he knew about the Alliance. After getting M'Kae's information, the spacer went to pursue Handro, which ultimately culminated in a skirmish above Naboo between the spacer and Handro's escort. The skirmish ended when the spacer successfully destroyed the Warlord Heavy Cruiser occupied by Handro."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Empire eventually began researching a technology in Restuss called a Star Core, an object small enough to fit into a backpack, yet powerful enough to power an entire planet or battlestation.

While the Avenger pursued the Falcon, the freighter at one point outmaneuvered the Star Destroyer, causing it to almost collide with another pursuing Star Destroyer. The Avenger chased the Falcon into the Hoth asteroid field, where the fugitive ship evaded the Star Destroyer by taking cover in the mouth of a space slug housed in one of the asteroids. The Avenger suffered significant damage when it traveled into the asteroid field to search for the Falcon. Eventually, the Avenger spotted the Millennium Falcon after the freighter reappeared.

Unbeknownst to Needa and his crew, the Millennium Falcon simply landed on a blind spot of the Avenger's conning tower. While the Falcon was no longer visible on the Avenger's scopes, M'Kae spoke to Needa and reported that Lord Vader demanded an update on the pursuit of the Millennium Falcon. Needa decided to personally apologize to the Dark Lord for failing to capture the freighter, and ordered a TIE/sh VIP shuttle to be prepared for his visit to the Executor. Needa gave one last request for his crew to continue their search for the Falcon, before traveling to the Executor to rendezvous with Vader, who ultimately executed the captain for his failure. The Star Destroyers of Death Squadron would eventually disperse into hyperspace in search of the Falcon, not knowing the freighter was still hiding on the Avenger's conning tower. The Avenger prepared to go to hyperspace in the opposite direction of the rest of the fleet, emptying its garbage into space beforehand.

Failure to do so would result in the player returning to Kalos, who would direct them to M'Kae's base to find incriminating evidence of M'Kae's dealings with Handro, and kill the base's general, Brant Korra.

If this was done, then Wolff Kalos and M'Kae switched roles, with Kalos being the one who saved Cal Handro, and M'Kae being the investigating officer who wanted to kill the treasonous Handro, who was double-dealing with the Alliance. M'Kae directed the player to the Imperial Safe House, where Kalos's forces saved Handro. The player then went to Kalos, and had to either bribe the Rebel 10,000 credits or return to M'Kae if they did not have that amount of credits. If unable to bribe Kalos, M'Kae would send the player to Kalos's base, where they would acquire information on Kalos' family, and blackmail him into revealing the information on Handro. Regardless of how the player got the information out of Kalos, this would initiate the battle against Handro. If the player was not initially successful, they would return to M'Kae, who revealed that Handro's hyperdrive was damaged, and thus he was unable to escape, allowing the Imperial operative to return and still get him. This could be repeated until the player succeeded. Upon completing the mission, the Imperial would return to M'Kae, who would award the operative 5,000 credits and a Bothan inspired BlasTech Special Ops Bola carbine.
