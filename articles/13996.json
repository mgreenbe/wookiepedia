Jedi Master Aayla Secura commanded the Republic's troops as they moved into position in readiness to engage the Separatists; however Palpatine gave word that Order 66 be carried out, leading to the clones turning on Secura and killing her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The site of a major hyperspace route and thus a heavily contested planet in the Clone Wars, the Outer Rim world of Felucia was sought by both the Confederacy of Independent Systems and Galactic Republic. Early in the war, the Confederacy led an First Battle of Felucia|assault on Felucia and secured the planet, overcoming the forces of Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano and establishing an orbital blockade. Breaking through the enemy starships, General Plo Koon led the successful evacuation of the Jedi and their clone troopers, though the planet had still fallen into the hands of the Separatists. Such a loss set back the Republic's efforts in the entire Thanium sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the Republic had managed to establish Medical Station HCTFF2 over Felucia, but the Haven medical station was attacked by a Separatist fleet and destroyed. When Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi were sent to investigate, they were met with a waiting automated vulture droid deployment station, which deployed several vulture droids that took down their T-6 shuttle. Upon crashing on Felucia, the Jedi became embroiled in a conflict between the Ohnaka Gang and a group of Felucian farmers. Later, Skywalker, Koon, Tano, and their clones were again deployed to Felucia, having been tasked with taking over Separatist-controlled portions of the world. Learning that the Republic sought to take out TZ-33's outpost, General Grievous attempted to secure his control over the Felucia system by dispatching reinforcements, but the Second Battle of Felucia still ended in a Republic victory by taking out the Confederate outpost. During the final days of the war, the Commerce Guild poisoned Felucia's waters in an attempt to prevent the planet from being of value to the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Outer Rim Sieges, Jedi General Aayla Secura, Clone Commander CC-5052 \"Bly,\" and their troopers in the 327th Star Corps were deployed to the planet to capture Shu Mai, Presidente of the Commerce Guild and member of the Separatist Council, as well as stopping the poison from spreading, leading to conflict with the force of the droid army stationed on Felucia. At one point during the battle, Secura flew her Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor and pursued a HMP droid gunship. At another point, Secura and her troops stood together before engaging a target. Additionally, at some point two clones standing near each other were fighting in the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Secura and the 327th marched through the wild underbrush in search of Confederate forces. By this time, Mai was not on Felucia and was instead with other members of the Separatist Council on Mustafar, having been transferred from their base on Utapau. Eventually, Secura and her troopers located enemy forces gathered in a clearing directly in front of them. However, as the OG-9 homing spider droids and Armored Assault Tanks advanced, Bly received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. Forced to obey the Chancellor's command by their inhibitor chips, Bly, Clone Lieutenant \"Galle,\" and the other clones followed its directive, shooting Secura in the back before she could react. Secura was finished off by fire from the clones surrounding her before full-scale combat operations could begin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Felucia first appeared in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. While developing the film's story before a script was written, it was initially proposed by concept artist Derek Thompson to have several Padawans accompanying the clone troopers to the battle and aiding them against the droids, but the idea was dropped as the Padawans eventually had to die anyway."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
