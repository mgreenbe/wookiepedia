A known screenshot of Cordh exists, depicting him as a randomly generated male Twi'lek under the \"dressed_commoner_fat_twilek_male_02\" Interchange File Format. However, because the game files do not include the exact template used for Cordh, it cannot be concluded that he always spawned as a Twi'lek. Furthermore, it should noted that the known screenshot of Cordh was taken from one of two defunct Japanese servers, which used different character templates for some of its NPCs. In any case, while the canonical species of Cordh cannot be definitively determined in the Star Wars Legends continuity, the quest dialogue identified Cordh as male. The questline that involved Cordh was disabled sometime after launch, due to missing strings in string file."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
