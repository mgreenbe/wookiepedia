Over several years of knowing one of the cantina's regular patrons, the mercenary Bazine Netal, Ooda had an unspoken agreement with her to never ask questions or get too friendly. On one occasion when Netal was waiting for a client in the cantina, Ooda chastised the mercenary for maiming two other patrons that had tried to flirt with her. In way of apology, Netal tipped Ooda several credits, which the waitress accepted, before informing the mercenary that her client was on his way. Ooda had no idea who the client was, but also had no interest in knowing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ooda first appeared in the short story \"The Perfect Weapon\", which was written by Delilah S.
