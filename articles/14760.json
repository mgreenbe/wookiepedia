It resulted in the capture of Princess Leia Organa by Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many of the local Rebel enemies of the Galactic Empire were captured or killed, with most operations being carried out in parts by the Desert Sands and the renowned 501st Legion of stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was part of the Galactic Civil War, a major conflict that opposed the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. An unwitting instigator to the battle was the disguised Alderaanian diplomatic corvette Tantive IV, being used as an important vessel in the Rebel Alliance fleet, most notably in the operation to steal the plans of the Death Star: the new Imperial superweapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The theft of these plans was the aim of the wider Operation Skyhook. It successfully occurred during a distracting Rebel prisoner revolt on the Death Star, being supplemented by partial documents stolen during the Battle of Danuta and the Battle of Toprawa. Immediately, an Imperial assault on a makeshift Rebel base on Polis Massa was initiated, being tasked with retaking the stolen plans. This, however, failed in recovering the lost schematics. Nonetheless, the information they did receive on Polis Massa caused them to conclude that the Alderaanian Senator and Princess Leia Organa was involved in the theft. As Alderaan had been a nuisance to the Empire for years, it came as little shock to the 501st legion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next attempt in the recovery effort involved the Emperor Palpatine's feared enforcer, Sith Lord Darth Vader, taking his legion of Imperial stormtroopers, the 501st Legion, to where the Tantive IV was harbored\u2014within the Tatoo system. They managed to track the Tantive IV with the unknowing aid of the protocol droid U-3PO, who had earlier been programmed to act as a sleeper agent and covertly placed on the ship's droid pool on Ralltiir. The information that the Tantive IV held the plans had been obtained by captured Rebels, as well as a Bothan who revealed it to the Emperor on Bothawui."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Recovering the plans"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon reaching the Tatoo system, the Imperial fleet was ambushed by a pirate fleet near the planet Tatooine. Upon taking out most of the pirate attackers, the Navy then hid in the surrounding nebulas, avoiding detection by Rebel Alliance Blue Squadron, led by Raymus Antilles, who were scouting the area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Tantive IV moved toward the uplink station, Interdictor-class cruisers were activated, preventing it from escaping. A clash between the Imperial fleet and the Alliance fleet broke out, with both sides taking several casualties in the crossfire. The Star Destroyer Devastator pursued Tantive IV out of the battlefield and chased it around the planet Tatooine, Vader's homeworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A laser bolt hit near the engine section of the Tantive IV, disabling the main reactor and preventing the vessel from entering Tatooine's atmosphere. The Devastator moved in and caught the corvette in a tractor beam. Vader then dispatched a TIE boarding craft filled up with troops, to board and secure the ship as soon as possible, but later the crew of the destroyer attached a portable accessway to the corvette."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Devastator also captured what they thought was Tantive IV, but in fact it was just a decoy called Tantive V. After searching the ship and finding no one except Gungans, Tantive V was set adrift into space and the Devastator continued to pursue Tantive IV."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inside the Tantive IV"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As troopers of the 501st Legion stormed the hallways of Tantive IV, a skirmish erupted between them and Rebel troopers defending the ship, with one of the stormtroopers being killed just as he boarded the ship. Due to the use of grenades, both sides incurred heavy casualties, but the 501st broke through, capturing the main Rebel barracks and clearing the way for Lord Vader's arrival. Vader himself was personally displeased with Tatooine being the location of their capture of the Tantive IV, due to it being his hated homeworld and it bringing back bad memories of the last time he saw his mother. Vader personally destroyed all security terminals on the bridge, in order to send the defenses into disarray, and disabled a turbine console to steal a set of access codes, in an attempt to gain entry to the ship's escape pod bays. He and a set of Imperial bodyguards then set out through the corridors, killing some Rebel troopers and capturing many more. The team then stormed the cockpit of the corvette."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the initial lightfight, the astromech droid R2-D2 and protocol droid C-3PO slipped through the confusion, but eventually ended up separated. R2-D2 then met with Princess Leia Organa. Organa, anticipating that she was cornered with no option of escape, ordered R2-D2 to use the escape pods to ensure the plans weren't recovered by the Imperials, and managed to record a SOS transmission intended for Kenobi, requesting for his assistance in delivering the stolen plans to her father, Bail Organa, on Alderaan. Sensing someone arriving, she then hastily placed the datadisk containing all the pieces of the Death Star blueprints, and left for the shadows just as C-3PO arrived looking for the R2 unit. R2 then suggested to C-3PO to follow him to the escape pod section."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the first stages Vader captured most of the soldiers, including the ship's captain, Raymus Antilles. He dealt with Antilles personally. In addition, while escorting the already captured soldiers as well as searching the vessel, the Imperials also had their droids R2-Q2 and R4-M9 scour the ship's databanks for the stolen Death Star plans. However, the 501st commander reported back to Vader with bad news: the stolen plans were no longer on the ship's main computer. This resulted in Vader interrogating Antilles by stranglehold on their transmission interceptions relating to the plans, and what they'd done with them. Antilles attempted to deny any interceptions and that the Tantive IV was on a diplomatic mission due to being a consular ship. Vader then questioned where the ambassador was, but Antilles died before he could answer, Vader having crushed his neck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader then proceeded to order the 501st Legion to search for the missing plans and also locate and retrieve the passengers, including the ambassador and bring them to him alive. After giving this command, Vader proceeded to utilize an IT-O interrogator droid on several of the remaining prisoners to extract any information on any knowledge of the Death Star plans. The 501st Legion then managed to find the ambassador, who was none other than Alderaanian Senator and Princess Leia Organa, whom they proceeded to stun, with DV-692 performing the actual stun, although not before one of the soldiers ended up shot by Organa in the chest, killing him. Vader then personally confronted her, and ordered for her arrest under the charge of treason, unaware at the time that she was his own daughter. Shortly afterward, Commander Daine Jir protested Vader's decision, citing that it carried too much risk of generating sympathy among the Imperial Senate towards her plight and thus worsen the situation regarding their fight against the Rebels, although Vader reminded him that she was their only link to the secret Rebel Base. When Jir pointed out she's more likely to die than tell him anything, Vader assured him to leave it to him to get it out of her, before promptly ordering for a distress signal to be sent to nearby vessels, and then report that the Tantive IV hit a meteor storm and all onboard had been killed due to the ship's destruction. In addition, the Devastator also destroyed any escape pods that were utilized by any escaping Rebel personnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel protocol droid C-3PO, along with R2-D2, an astromech droid vital to the Rebellion, subsequently escaped the ship: R2-D2 having secretly obtained the Death Star schematics Vader had been so eager to recover. R2-D2 chose to escape via an escape pod despite droids being forbidden, both due to Leia's orders, and due to prior experience in the Maramere system. The Devastator also prepared to destroy the escape pod C-3PO and R2-D2 were on, but stopped when they realized that it contained no life signs, and subsequently dismissed it as a malfunction. Nonetheless, they reported the incident to Vader via Commander Nahdonnis Praji shortly after ordering Jir to send the fake distress signal, who deduced that the escape pod must have been where Leia stashed the Death Star plans, and ordered them to search Tatooine for the plans, and for Praji specifically to personally see to it as well. The planet Tatooine had already been scouted some time ago by Imperial operatives who had not reported any Rebel presence on the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around that time, the smuggler Han Solo arrived at Tatooine in his starship the Millennium Falcon. On his way to landing he destroyed multiple TIE fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, a distress signal was sent to a Rebel base on Kolaador. Soon after the capture of the Tantive IV, a small squadron of X-wings arrived from Kolaador. Commander Ru Murleen, Rookie One and Thurlow Harris, flew their fighters in space above Tatooine and turned their weapons towards an Imperial-class Star Destroyer. Using their proton torpedoes, they managed to strike a critical blow and headed to the surface. However they were not in time to prevent three TIE/LN starfighters from attacking and destroying their base, located near Anchorhead. Acting quickly to prevent the TIEs reporting their presence back to their commanders, Rookie One gave chase through Beggar's Canyon and destroyed all three Imperial fighters. Captain Merrick Simms survived the destruction of the Anchorhead base flying in his X-wing and then joined the three other Rebels."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Desert Extermination"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Vader ordered Commander Praji to lead personally the search the Death Star plans on Tatooine's surface. He assigned Captain Kosh's local garrison to the task, while Commander Jir's 501st was readied. These events coincided with the arrival of the Star Destroyer Inquisitor in the system. Under command of General Malcor Brashin, the Inquisitor was carrying Captain Terrik and his Desert Sands for training exercises and eventually to relieve the 37th Detachment stationed on the planet. Primarily, the Star Destroyer accompanied the Desert Sands to test the experimental Battlefield Holographic Control Interface during the exercises of Captain Terrik's troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alerted to the situation, the Desert Sands quickly landed on the planet to undertake the search for the Rebel corvette's escape pod. Split into Alvien, Drax and Zeta Squadrons, the sandtroopers explored the deserts of Tatooine for hours. Terrik personally commanded Zeta Squadron which was assisted by dewbacks, one HAVr A9 floating fortress and two Arunskin 32 cargo skiffs from the local garrison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Imperial sandtroopers attempted to construct command stations in the Dune Sea, they were assaulted by the fierce, nomadic Tusken Raiders. Soon after, Rebel soldiers appeared and a three-way battle broke out near the Tusken camps stationed around a fierce Sarlacc. The Rebels were able to deploy some Rebel combat speeders and X-wings to support their troops but the small army was completely eradicated by Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crashed escape pod was eventually found in the Dune Sea by Davin Felth of Zeta Squadron. The sandtroopers discovered evidence that the pod's occupants were droids, in the form of a piece of metal that fell off from R2-D2. They followed a trail leading away from the escape pod and discovered that the droids had been intercepted by a Jawa sandcrawler. They eventually intercepted the digger crawler, where they learned from the Jawas that the droids had been already sold to moisture farmers. Captain Terrik then ordered his men to attack the sandcrawler, leaving no survivors among the Jawas. To cover up the Imperial attack on the Jawas, they left gaffi sticks nearby in order to implicate a Tusken Raider raid as being responsible for the attack. The Imperials then largely destroyed the Sandcrawler with a Reconnaissance Troop Transporter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperials then proceeded to pay a visit to the moisture farm that had purchased the droids. Its inhabitants, Owen and Beru Lars, not only refused to hand the droids over, but their patriarch, Owen Lars, also spat at Terrik. The soldiers, under Vader's personal orders via hologram, noticed that a landspeeder was missing from their garage. The Sith Lord ordered the establishing of checkpoints to detain any droids entering Mos Espa or Mos Eisley spaceports. Vader eventually watched the troopers carry out his orders on their helpless victims. They executed Lars and Beru and cremated their remains."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droids were in fact in possession of their nephew: Luke Skywalker.

With their new unexpected ally, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, they wished to find a transport in order to leave the planet and bring the Death Star plans to Alderaan. But Mos Eisley was believed to be the refuge of the fugitive droids dispatched by the Rebellion. With the stolen schematics in its databanks, R2-D2 had become a high-priority Imperial target and Imperial sandtroopers scattered throughout the city, to retrieve information about the stolen plans, with Alvien Squadron in particular manning various checkpoints. Ironically, the sandtroopers of Alvien Squadron ended up unwittingly allowing the wanted droids to pass by, thanks to a mind trick placed by Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few local Rebels, using guerrilla tactics, kept the sandtroopers on their toes by coming out through alleys, striking suddenly, and then shrinking away. Armed stormtroopers, some on dewbacks, casually strolled through neighborhoods and homes, interrogating anyone they wished.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the droids made their way to the Mos Eisley cantina in order to look for a pilot to the Alderaan system. There, they finally met with the pilot who would soon fly them: Han Solo, and his copilot Chewbacca. In the cantina, Skywalker encountered the Aqualish scoundrel Ponda Baba, who threatened to kill him. In defense of the young man, Kenobi was forced to use his lightsaber, removing Baba's arm. A patron, Garouf Lafoe, rushed to notify the Imperial troops upon witnessing a scuffle including a man wielding a lightsaber. Upon the troops' arrival, Luke and Obi-Wan had already vacated the premises. Meanwhile, the spy Garindan informed the stormtroopers of the droids' location, and that the smuggler Han Solo was helping the droids escape Tatooine. Captain Mod Terrik and Zeta Squadron moved into Docking Bay 94, where they engaged Solo in a firefight, only to have him escape. During the firefight, Terrik was gunned down by one of his men, Imperial traitor and Rebel sympathizer Davin Felth. The Falcon then flew through the Dune Sea, destroying several probe droids in order to keep its position unknown from the orbital Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Millennium Falcon's escape, a \"pacification\" campaign was waged in the streets.

The loss of the Death Star plans would ultimately result in the Rebel's amazing victory in the Battle of Yavin not long after.
