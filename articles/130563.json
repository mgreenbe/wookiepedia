The original Star Tours closed in 2010 (July 27 in Disneyland, September 8 in Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World) while Disney engineers built the updated and renovated ride, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, which opened on May 20, 2011.

Much is made of this throughout the ride queue, and the design and theme of the inside holding area is convincingly modeled to look like a spaceship boarding terminal. This area is stocked with Audio-Animatronic characters that seem to interact with the ride patrons including Mon Calamari technicians and versions of C-3PO and R2-D2, as well as a life-size mock-up of the StarSpeeder 3000, the \"starship\" that guests embark on.

As the doors close, the ship's bumbling RX-24 pilot droid, a.k.a. \"Rex\" (voiced by Paul Reubens), chats up the guests about the trip as he sets up. All goes well until a slight mistake on Rex's part sends the ship down the wrong tunnel and plummeting into a maintenance yard, just managing to escape into open space before a giant mechanical appendage nearly crushes the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once in space, the ship enters hyperspace, but Rex disengages its hyperdrives too late to stop at the ship's intended destination\u2014and instead gets caught inside a comet field. The ship becomes trapped inside one of the larger comets and has to navigate its way out through a maze of passages and chambers. Just when all the trouble seems to be over, the ship encounters a Star Destroyer and finds itself caught in its tractor beam. However, a timely attack (providing assistance by destroying the tractor beam generator) by a Rebel X-wing fighter allows them to escape. Soon the ship and its tourists find themselves accompanying the Rebellion on a massive assault on the Death Star (which Death Star is unspecified). Rex uses the StarSpeeder's lasers to eliminate TIE/LN starfighters while a Rebel destroys the Death Star in the same manner as Luke Skywalker does in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. A final light-speed jump sends the StarSpeeder back to where it started, but not before a near-collision with a fuel truck in the spaceport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ride that became Star Tours first saw light as a proposal for an attraction based on the 1979 Disney live-action flop The Black Hole. It was planned as an interactive ride simulator attraction, where guests would have had the ability to choose the ride car's route. After preliminary planning, the Black Hole attraction was shelved due to its enormous cost (approximately $50 million US) as well as the unpopularity of the film itself. Instead of completely dismissing the idea of a simulator, the company decided to make use of a partnership between Disney and George Lucas that began in 1986 with the opening of Captain EO (a 3D musical film starring Michael Jackson) at the California park. Disneyland then approached Lucas with the idea for the Star Tours amusement ride.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With his approval, Disney Imagineers purchased four large military flight simulators at a cost of $500,000 each and designed the ride structure. Meanwhile, Lucas and his team of special-effects technicians at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) worked on the first-person-perspective film that would be projected inside the simulators. When both simulator and film were completed, a programmer then sat inside and, with the aid of a joystick, manually synchronized the movement of the simulator with the apparent movement on the film. On January 9, 1987, at a final cost of $32 million (almost twice the cost of building the entire park in 1955), the ride finally opened to throngs of patrons, many of whom dressed as Star Wars characters for the occasion. In celebration, Disneyland remained open for a special 60-hour marathon from 10:00am on January 9, 1987 to 10:00pm on January 11, 1987."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Ride system"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Tours utilized a Thomson hydraulic motion base cabin featuring 3 degrees of freedom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The film was front projected onto the screen from a 70mm film projector located beneath the cockpit barrier.

The program\u2014entitled A Vacation In Space and designed to promote the ride\u2014aired in late 1986, and was hosted by Gil Gerard and Ernie Reyes Jr.. The show looks at how Star Tours was made, as well as the history of space travel and space-related films. Some highlights of the program include a segment at the beginning, where C-3PO and R2-D2 make an appearance and perform a rap song, as well as a segment at the end, where Reyes boards the StarSpeeder 3000\u2014giving away some teasers of the ride itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of the Star Tours experience, upon exiting the StarSpeeder 3000, passengers are led to a store which sells merchandise based on Star Wars and the ride itself. This includes action figures, clothing, etc. At Disneyland the store is The Star Trader. At Disney's Hollywood Studios, the store was originally called Endor Vendors, and had a theme based on Endor with a facade modeled after the back door of the Endor shield generator bunker. Around the release of Episode I, that store was replaced by Tatooine Traders, themed to resemble the buildings of Mos Eisley and Mos Espa. Both stores include some exclusive merchandise sold only at Disney theme parks, including action figures of the various droids seen in the ride and queue and StarSpeeder 3000 toys."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Canonicity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The canonicity of the events depicted in Star Tours has been disputed for many reasons, the most obvious being the inclusion of the Death Star. Since R2-D2's presence aboard the StarSpeeder precludes the events taking place during the Battle of Yavin or the Battle of Endor, the Death Star seen in the ride video has been considered by some to be the Death Star prototype, as seen in Jedi Search and Champions of the Force, and its destruction to be a depiction of the prototype's destruction at The Maw. However, it does not match that prototype's skeletal construction, and R2-D2 is accounted for during that event. Also, the Star Tours Death Star is close to Endor, far from the Maw's location. This may indicate it is a so-far-unrevealed Death Star, or that the ride's events are simply not canonical. Leland Chee, in a timeline he created, implied that the first possibility was true. Others have suggested that the Death Star is a modification of one of the habitation spheres seen under construction over Coruscant. This was later confirmed in Supreme Commander Ennix Devian's entry for the second part of the blog series The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The events of Star Tours may take place after Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back since after the destination of Hoth is advertised on the large video screen in the queue area, C-3PO mentions the events of the film. In 2005, Lucasfilm's Leland Chee tentatively dated the events of the ride at 4.3 ABY. This was later confirmed in the 2013 blog Convenient Daily Departures: The History of Star Tours, which also explained R2-D2 and C-3PO's presence at Star Tours as being their being loaned to the company by their owners during the latter stages of the Nagai\u2013Tof War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As with all material released prior to April 25, 2014, questions of canonicity regarding Star Tours apply only to the continuity of the Expanded Universe, now known as Star Wars Legends, and its story is considered entirely non-canon within the current continuity of canon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legends references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the events of the ride themselves may be questionably canonical, the Expanded Universe (now known as Legends) made a number of references to the fictional travel agency and its ships:"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Canon references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cameos"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many background characters seen in the pre-flight videos and the ride film itself are portrayed by ILM employees who worked on the attraction.
