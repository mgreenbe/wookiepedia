When the dovin basal was found to be pulling Dobido into the world, the Mayor jumped down the hole with a thermal detonator, killing both the creature and himself. Even though Solo had warned him that destroying the dovin basal would come too late to save the planet, he insisted, saying that he wanted to make sure the creature couldn't possibly escape the destruction of the world. Solo considered it a noble sacrifice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
