Gerin was taken as a hostage by Ren when the pirate escaped from Tammuz-an after he and his crew were captured during the Battle of Tammuz-an. Fleeing to the bog moon of Bogden, the pirate captain attempted to use Gerin as leverage to secure the release of his crew and his ship, the Dianoga. Mon Julpa dispatched Jann Tosh, Jessica Meade and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to rescue Gerin but, after arriving, the group were attacked by a pack of sungwas. When Ren reported the failure of the rescue mission, Toda agreed to turn Julpa and Ren's crew over to him in exchange for Gerin's release. However, Toda and several of his guards hid aboard the Dianoga and took Ren by surprise, securing his capture and Gerin's return."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
