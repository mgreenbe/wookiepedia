At the time, the Crest was featured prominently on the banners hanging from the walls of Castle Organa on the Apalis Coast. Much later, during the three-year time span of the Clone Wars, the Prince Bail Organa often wore a silver belt buckle in the shape of the Crest of Alderaan. In the last days of the Alderaanian culture, that crest was featured on the uniform collar of the Alderaan Royal Guards and was used to mark royal vessels such as the Tantive IV."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many years after the destruction of his homeworld in 0 BBY, the Alderaanian Cal Omas, who served as the last Chief of State of the New Republic, also wore a belt buckle identical to the one Prince Organa once owned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Crest of Alderaan was first mentioned in 1977, in the first issue of the Marvel Star Wars series of comic books, which retelled the opening events of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.

Since then, the Crest has appeared in many episodes of the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars in which Organa himself appeared."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The portrait of Cal Omas drawn by Brian Rood and featured in the 2012 reference book The Essential Reader's Companion showed him wearing the same belt as Bail Organa.
