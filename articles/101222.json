Founded approximately one thousand years before the Battle of Yavin by the Sith Lord Darth Bane, it was intended to replace the Brotherhood of Darkness and institute a rebirth of the Sith. The guiding principle of the Order was the Rule of Two, which was developed by Bane through the teachings of Darth Revan's Holocron. Under this new tenet, only two Sith Lords were allowed to exist at any given time; a master and an apprentice. The Rule stipulated that after learning everything the master had to teach, the apprentice would attempt to kill the master and take an apprentice of their own. The intended effect of this rule was to ensure that each successive master would be stronger than the last. Ultimately, Bane intended that his successors would be able to amass enough power in secret to engineer the fall of the Republic and the destruction of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane's expectations of the new Order were met with his death at the hands of his own apprentice, Darth Zannah. The tradition was carried on over the next millennium, even though many Sith who followed in Bane's lineage were appalled at the thought of being slain by their own apprentices. After centuries of operating in secrecy, the Grand Plan for revenge was initiated by the Sith Lords Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious. Sidious, who usurped his Master's position, ultimately fulfilled Darth Bane's dream: the return of Sith dominance throughout the galaxy. With the betrayal and near destruction of the Jedi Order, Sidious dissolved the Galactic Republic and replaced it with the Galactic Empire. Ruling as emperor in his public guise as \"Palpatine\", Sidious' reign was prophetically ended by his own apprentice\u2014the Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker. Though he returned in the form of several clones, each inhabited in turn by the Emperor's dark spirit, Sidious' final demise in 11 ABY ended the line of Bane and Zannah."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The collapse of Darth Bane's Sith Order, however, did not bring about the final end of the Sith itself. Lumiya, a former Hand of Emperor Palpatine and the self-proclaimed Dark Lady of the Sith, formed her own Sith and incorporated the Rule of Two in its philosophy. She regarded her greatest achievement in the form of her apprentice Darth Caedus, a grandson of Anakin Skywalker and the first active Sith Lord since the reign of Darth Sidious. During the time of Lumiya and Caedus, another Sith Order had come into existence, one that was far less connected with the old Order of Darth Bane: The One Sith, founded by the former Jedi A'Sharad Hett, rejected the Rule of Two. Under the Rule of One, the new organization permitted the existence of many Sith Lords, all of whom ultimately answered to the authority of a single Dark Lord. This was known as the Rule of One."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Bane's reformation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Order of the Sith Lords was formed approximately one thousand years before the Battle of Yavin by a Human male Sith Lord named Bane. Initially a member of the Brotherhood of Darkness, Bane delved deep into the secrets of the ancient Sith Lords to increase his own knowledge and power in stark contrast to most of his contemporaries. Bane's investigations led him to the conclusion that the Brotherhood was a perversion of the Sith; ultimately little more than a copy of the Jedi Order, the Sith's mortal enemies. Disillusionment and contempt for the Brotherhood drove Bane to journey to the planet Lehon where he discovered the holocron of Darth Revan. Bane was inspired by the ancient Dark Lord of the Sith. Through Revan's philosophy regarding the dark side of the Force, Bane saw the power and discipline that he felt a Sith should have; qualities which he believed had been lost under the Brotherhood of Darkness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon renaming himself as Darth Bane, the new self-proclaimed Dark Lord of the Sith was more convinced than ever that the Brotherhood could never defeat the Jedi Order. To do so would require a drastic reshaping of the Sith as a whole; a reshaping that required the annihilation of the Brotherhood. During the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, Bane betrayed the Brotherhood to the Jedi, allowing the Republic to send critical reinforcements to the beleaguered Army of Light. Thus, the final battle of the New Sith Wars ended with the triumph of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic. With the exception of Bane, all members of the Brotherhood were exterminated by the thought bomb, an ancient Sith technique unleashed by the Sith's own leader, Lord Kaan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Brotherhood destroyed, the galaxy at large believed the Sith to be extinct. Darth Bane did nothing to disprove this assumption, feeling that as long as the Jedi remained convinced that the Sith could never return, he was free to proceed with his plans to create a new Sith Order. His work began shortly after discovering a Force-sensitive Human female child on Ruusan. Sensing her potential in the Force, Bane took the orphaned Zannah as his Sith apprentice. Throughout the course of Zannah's training, Bane not only indoctrinated her with devotion to the ancient tenets of the Sith Code, but also exposed her to certain modifications of his own that were added to the new Sith philosophy. Instead of the thousands who were admitted into the former Brotherhood of Darkness, the Order of the Sith Lords only permitted the membership of two beings; a Master, the embodiment of the dark side's power; and an apprentice, the disciple who coveted said power. This creed, known as the Rule of Two, became the core tradition of Bane's Sith Order. Its main focus, as envisioned by Bane, was to prevent the Sith from becoming destabilized by the ambitions and intrigue of too many members. Furthermore, Bane wanted the dark side to be concentrated into just two individuals, as he believed that its power was finite and had been diluted among the many members of the Brotherhood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rule of Two also served to ensure the continued survival of the Sith by dictating that the Order should operate in secret. By limiting membership to just two Sith Lords, Bane believed that he could keep his machinations hidden from the Jedi. He fully believed in the power of the dark side, but also felt that two Sith Lords could never defeat the entire Jedi Order in a direct confrontation. Rather than openly challenging the Jedi through martial means, the Dark Lord concluded that the Sith's rise to power would be far better served by utilizing cunning, stealth, subterfuge and\u2014a virtue borrowed from their own enemy\u2014patience."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Together, Darth Bane and Darth Zannah steadily worked toward the ultimate goal of their organization from their hideout on the planet Ambria. Aside from the Jedi Order, Bane also targeted the Galactic Republic as another victim of the Sith plot for retribution. But rather than contributing to the complete destabilization of the galactic government, the Dark Lord wanted to ensure that it remained intact throughout the coming centuries. Given that the Republic unified much of the known galaxy under one system of government, Bane believed that the Republic's collapse would lead to the creation of numerous small, independent states. In Bane's opinion, destroying the numerous smaller states would have been a far more difficult task than toppling the single, large government of the Republic. Hence, he dispatched his apprentice on many missions aimed at preempting Anti-Republic movements, such as a Separatist movement on Serenno. Through the machinations of Bane and Zannah, the Separatists were goaded into launching their insurrection long before their movement was ready for a conflict with the Republic. In the aftermath of their failure to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Tarsus Valorum, the Separatist organization was eventually disbanded and Serenno remained with the Republic. At the same time, Bane and his apprentice also concentrated their attention on the study of Sith magic, learning all but forgotten dark side techniques found in ancient scrolls. This task was largely left to Zannah however, as Bane himself stated that he had no affinity for such arcane abilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane's fledgling Order was nearly destroyed when the Jedi Knight Johun Othone convinced the Jedi High Council to investigate the possibility of the Sith's survival. Along with Jedi Master Valenthyne Farfalla, Othone led a Jedi task force on a hunt for the resurgent Sith. Tracking Bane and Zannah to Tython, the Jedi made an attempt on the lives of both master and apprentice. The Sith ultimately survived the confrontation, but Bane was severely wounded during the fight. Darth Zannah was not prepared to allow her Master to die, if only because she felt that there was much more to learn from Darth Bane. She traveled back to Ambria to enlist the help of the healer Caleb, whom she believed represented Bane's best chance for survival. Upon arrival however, Caleb refused to help them, even under threat of torture or death. Darovit, Zannah's cousin, offered to convince Caleb to help Bane, but only if Zannah agreed to surrender herself into Jedi custody along with Bane. Zannah agreed to her cousin's terms, and he contacted the Jedi Temple and asked them to send a team to take custody of the two Sith. However, Zannah had lied to Darovit, pledging to surrender to the Jedi for the sole purpose of convincing him and Caleb to repair Bane's injured body. Once their task had been completed, Zannah killed Caleb and used the dark side to drive her cousin insane. The team had been sent by the Jedi Council arrived on but only found Darovit utterly consumed by madness. In his madness, he attacked the Jedi task force, but was cut down almost immediately. Darovit's behavior led the Jedi to believe that he had been the Sith Lord that they had been sent to apprehend, driven mad by drawing too heavily on the power of the dark side. As such, they believed the Sith menace to be truly extinct at last. This assumption lead them to make the decision to leave Ambria without conducting a more through investigation; Zannah and Bane had in fact been hiding, cloaked by the dark side, in the very hut in which Darovit had been killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Darth Bane recovered, his apprentice explained how she had manipulated the Jedi Order into believing that the Sith were finally destroyed. Darth Zannah also explained that\u2014in spite of the risk of discovery and capture\u2014she still needed her Master in order to finish her training, but would not hesitate to kill him as soon as her powers eclipsed Bane's.

Posing as brother and sister\u2014Sepp and Allia Omek\u2014the two lived in a mansion and possessed considerable wealth, which had been appropriated from the vast accounts of the former Brotherhood member Qordis. Much of this wealth was used to create a vast network of spies and contacts. By this time, however, Darth Bane's health had begun to deteriorate at an accelerated rate due to the harmful side-effects of his deep immersion in the dark side of the Force. Though unafraid to accept his own death, Bane feared for the future of his Sith Order. In the ten years that had passed after his near-death experience on Tython, Bane had waited for his apprentice to kill him and become the next Dark Lord of the Sith. Yet as far as he could tell, Darth Zannah seemed either content to serve at his bidding, or was simply waiting until her Master was too feeble to pose any challenge. As a result, Bane became obsessed with discovering some way to prolong his life in order to train a new apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, unbeknownst to Bane, Zannah had decided that the time had finally come for her to challenge Bane and attempt to claim the title she had coveted for so long. She also decided to claim an apprentice for herself in advance. Her choice fell on the Dark Jedi Set Harth. However, the selection of Harth as her disciple was a rushed decision; Zannah would have preferred someone more interested in the continuation of Bane's Sith rather than a fallen Jedi who cared only about himself. By the time Zannah and her apprentice tracked Bane's location to Doan, the Dark Lord had discovered information on how to prolong his life. Through the holocron of Darth Andeddu, Bane learned of the ability to transfer one's own spirit into another body. Shortly after learning this information however, Bane had been captured by an Iktotchi female known as the Huntress and her small strike team. In the employ of Caleb's daughter Serra, the Huntress had brought Bane to Stone Prison on Doan, where Serra had intended to kill him on the assumption that he had killed her father. Zannah and Harth arrived on Doan shortly thereafter, with Zannah intending to kill Bane and take his place. Bane managed to escape his captors, and encountered Zannah, who accused him of betraying the Rule of Two and attacked him. During Bane's confrontation with Zannah, the unarmed Bane managed to hold off Zannah long enough to escape. However, Serra, learning of Bane's escape, activated a series of explosives in the prison, intending to collapse it. During the duel, Harth abandoned Zannah and stole Andeddu's holocron. Intending to flee Doan with it, he proceeded to the prison's hanger, where he had the misfortune of attempting to steal a ship belonging to the Huntress. She confronted him, and when he attacked her, she gave pursuit. However, Harth managed to evade her, and lead her on a fruitless game of cat-and-mouse throughout the hanger. Eventually, the two of them called a truce as each knew that the prison was close to destruction, and that their confrontation would most likely result in both of their deaths if they stayed much longer. Reluctantly, the Huntress allowed him to escape just as Bane arrived in the hanger. Having realized through the Force that Bane could give purpose to her currently meaningless existence, she pledged herself to Bane. Having been on the lookout for a suitable candidate for apprenticeship, Bane accepted her pledge. The two of them then escaped Doan on the Huntress's ship, and set a course for Ambria."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zannah later tracked Bane to Ambria, the planet where a decade ago she had vowed to kill him one day. There, she encountered Bane and the Huntress, who had since been re-christened as Darth Cognus. Unwilling to be denied the position she had been prepared for throughout most of her life, Darth Zannah challenged the Dark Lord to a final duel, which Darth Bane eagerly accepted. Cognus, having been instructed by Bane on the importance of the Rule of Two, promised both not to interfere in the duel and to pledge her allegiance to whomever emerged victorious. The Master and his former apprentice fought as near-equals, but Zannah was outmatched with regard to her lightsaber skills and raw power. In desperation, Zannah utilized her knowledge of Sith magic; tapping into the dark side nexus on Ambria, she unleashed a wave of dark side tendrils against the Dark Lord. Bane tried to avoid the conjured tendrils, only to have his arm grabbed and vaporized by one. Bane, on the verge of defeat, made one final attempt to thwart his apprentice. Using the knowledge he gained from Darth Andeddu's holocron, Bane released his essence from his body and transferred it into Zannah's, vaporizing his own body in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The duel then transcended into a battle of wills; Zannah's spirit fought with all of its strength to reject Bane's essence and maintain control of her own body. The struggle lasted a few moments before Darth Zannah overcame her master, expelling him to Chaos. Though Bane had left a slight psychic imprint on her, the being that remained was wholly and unmistakably Zannah. With Bane dead, leadership of his Sith Order was transferred to Darth Zannah, the new Dark Lord of the Sith. Claiming Darth Cognus as her apprentice, Zannah declared that they were both part of Darth Bane's legacy; the Order of the Sith Lords lived on through them, and so did its founder's plot for revenge against the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The split"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Cognus eventually took an apprentice of her own, the three-eyed Human mutant Darth Millennial.

One such Sith Lord was Darth Vectivus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 552 BBY, the Sith Lord Darth Gravid rejected the dark side of the Force. He came to believe that in order for the Sith to survive, the Order had to become more like their Jedi counterparts by embracing the light. His apprentice, Darth Gean, did not share her Master's new beliefs and was appalled by his apparent blasphemy. In keeping with his new philosophy, Gravid began destroying nearly five hundred year worth of accumulated Sith lore. Gravid was ultimately killed by Gean, but not before he had managed to destroy most of the artifacts and writings in his fortress. Thus, many ancient dark side techniques and rituals\u2014including essence transfer\u2014were lost to future dark side practitioners. Though his actions had set the Grand Plan back by decades at the very least, Gravid's madness had an unintended, positive effect on the generations of Sith to come.

The line of Sith Lords proceeded on after Ramage's time, and eventually led to the reign of Darth Tenebrous around 167 BBY. His own Master was the Sith Lord who created a wound in the Force, thereby allowing the Jedi to sense the dark side for the first time in centuries.

Through the Force, Tenebrous foresaw the birth of a powerful darksider who would become his apprentice.

Born as Hego Damask, Plagueis's father and mother were manipulated into meeting each other by Darth Tenebrous, who wanted to ensure the birth of his future prot\u00e9g\u00e9.

While searching the galaxy for an apprentice, someone cunning in mind and powerful in the Force, Plagueis operated in the public domain under his birth name as Magister Hego Damask of Damask Holdings.

But what started out as a simple business trip to a Mid Rim world became what Plagueis saw as a piece of his destiny, shaped and influenced by the will of the dark side. On Naboo, the Dark Lord discovered a teenage Human noble named Palpatine, the seventeen year-old son of Cosinga Palpatine, an aristocrat of mediocre standing. Outwardly, Palpatine appeared to others as friendly, unassuming, and guileless; an intelligent young man, somewhat shy and withdrawn, who possessed a keen sense of politics and a passion for competitive racing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though proud to hail from House Palpatine, one of the Royal Houses of Naboo, Palpatine was aggravated by his family's lack of wealth and prestige in comparison to some of the other aristocratic families.

Furthermore, he resented his mother for being too weak to challenge her husband's will, and his siblings for treating him like an interloper. His hatred for the members of his family was further intensified by fear of his father. That fear was not due to the threat of punishment through physical harm; Palpatine was afraid that his father would disown him if he ever crossed the line too far, thus cutting him off from the life of rank and privilege."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before long, Darth Plagueis became a mentor and idol to Palpatine, who viewed the elderly Muun as a blessing.

Home to Mother Talzin's Nightsisters, Dathomir was also populated by the Nightbrothers, a clan of Zabrak males born and raised as warriors and slaves to the Witches of Dathomir. While touring the streets of Blue Desert City, Sidious was approached by an enigmatic Nightsister who begged him to take her child. The infant, a male Zabrak named Maul, was strong in the Force, and the Nightsister hoped that\u2014under Sidious's care\u2014her son would find a life better than that of a Nightbrother.

Even though the use of another apprentice technically violated the protocol of the Rule of Two, Plagueis approved of Sidious's plans for Maul, but under the strict understanding that the Zabrak's training would be limited to the role of an assassin rather than a full-fledged Sith Lord. Darth Plagueis oversaw Maul's training\u2014first in their secret droid-run facility on Mustafar and later in the Orsis Academy\u2014through Sidious' reports and regarded him as a capable fighter, eventually coming to accept him as Sidious' apprentice, despite their original arrangement.

The Kaminoans found Yinchorri DNA was not manipulable enough to effectively instill certain traits like obedience into the clones. They suggested to Plagueis that a Human template would be easier to replicate and modify in order to meet Plagueis' exact expectations. The Grand Plan was further modified after Sidious advised his Master about how the Jedi could not simply be destroyed; they also had to be demonized in the eyes of the galactic populace so that the Sith's actions would be justified and accepted. Hence, Plagueis decided that the Human clone army would not fight against the Jedi Order in the war to come. They would instead fight for the Galactic Republic, under the command of Jedi officers. Their loyalty, however, would ultimately belong to the Supreme Chancellor alone. In order to avoid any chance of the Jedi learning about the Sith's role in the creation of clone soldiers, Plagueis knew that he needed a Jedi to commission the Kaminoans to create an army for the Republic. As Hego Damask, the Dark Lord manipulated Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas into placing the order for an army with Kamino, but without the authorization or knowledge of the Jedi High Council.

Furthermore, his conception occurred without a natural father. According to Jedi prophecy, the Chosen One would be created by the will of the Force in order to destroy the Sith, thus restoring the Force back into balance. Sidious was amazed by the revelation of this discovery, but he was not nearly as surprised as his Master. Upon learning of Skywalker's existence and the nature behind it, Darth Plagueis was struck with a mixture of shock, awe, outrage and even fear. Although he had made great strides in the manipulation of midi-chlorians, his attempt to coerce the midi-chlorians into spontaneously creating life had not only failed, but had noticeably backfired. The Dark Lord suspected from the start that the Force had purposely created Anakin to undermine\u2014and ultimately undo\u2014the Sith Grand Plan as a balancing act to Plagueis's machinations. At that moment, it seemed to Plagueis as though the centuries of planning and waiting patiently on the Sith's part was all for nothing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Regardless of whether Skywalker was the Chosen One or not, Darth Plagueis refused to turn away from his plot, decades in the making by then. He instructed Sidious to pass on orders to Maul that Qui-Gon Jinn was to be killed no matter what.

While Amidala led an alliance of Naboo resistance fighters and the Gungan Grand Army against the Trade Federation, the Senate voted for Palpatine as its new leader. With his apprentice finally at the highest level in the Republic's government, Plagueis intended to share in the control of the executive branch once Palpatine proclaimed him Co-Chancellor. But Darth Sidious\u2014who had subtly manipulated Plagueis into setting the stage for the Clone Wars\u2014would have no such thing. Shortly before being sworn into office, Sidious manipulated Plagueis into becoming overly intoxicated.

The child\u2014much like a young Palpatine from years ago\u2014yearned for adventure and a life of significance, but resented authority and was rather skilled at hiding his anger.

The new doctrine paid lip service to Bane's Rule of Two in that only two beings could have the Darth title bestowed upon them at any given time. In all other ways however, it deviated substantially from Bane's philosophy. Where Bane's doctrine dictated that the master should train an apprentice earnestly and with the intention of making the apprentice as powerful as possible, Sidious's doctrine detailed the need for an apprentice to function solely as an instrument of the master's will, not as a potential usurper. As such, Sidious never passed on teachings to any of his apprentices that might have enabled them to contest his power. In addition, while the Rule of Two dictated that the dark side should be concentrated into just two beings, Sidious planned to eventually create a cadre of lesser darksiders in addition to a Sith apprentice to help enforce the rule of his Empire.

With his brother, Maul even contemplated overthrowing Sidious and ruling the galaxy as the Dark Lord of the Sith. Unfortunately for the two brothers, Sidious eventually decided that Maul had become enough of an irritant to attend to him personally.

He easily bested the two nascent Sith Lords, killing Oppress and kidnapping Maul for some unknown purpose. By 19 BBY, the final phase of the Grand Plan came into effect.
