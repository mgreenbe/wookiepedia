Lakuviv was an ambitious ranking distant of the Xodlak family who sought to advance his career and attain the rank of Cousin, and to return the Great Xodlak family to the spot it had once held among the Ten Ruling Families of the Ascendancy. In his ambitions, Lakuviv inadvertently played into a scheme by the Grysk Jixtus and Haplif of the Agbui to draw the Chiss Ascendancy into a civil war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy, Lakuviv served as the Xodlak family Councilor for Redhill province of Celwis, headquartered at the city of Redhill. While serving there, he was approached by a Chiss mid-ager named Coduyo'po'nekri accompanied by three Agbui named Haplif, Shimkif and Frosif. The Agbui claimed to be \"cultural nomads\" hoping to learn about the culture of the Chiss. In fact, they hoped to draw the Ascendancy into a civil war. The Agbui gave Lakuviv a valuable nyix brooch, which led him to plot to acquire more of the rare metal for the Ascendancy and his Xodlak family. Lakuviv believed the nyix used in the Agbui's jewelry would lead to the Xodlak's return to the Nine Ruling Families, and his own promotion from Ranking distant to Cousin or even Blood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lakuviv dispatched his Senior Aide Xodlak'ji'iprip \"Lakjip\" to visit a mining settlement on a supposedly nyix-rich Agbui mining world that Haplif told them about. Upon Lakjip's return and confirmation of what she saw, Lakuviv and Lakjip plotted to claim the planet for the Xodlak family. The pair believed that acquiring the mining world for the Xodlak would enhance the Xodlak family's status enough to allow it to rejoin the Nine Ruling Families and advance their careers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lakuviv declared a Xodlak family emergency posing as Patriel Xodlak'oo'nifis, summoning all available Xodlak family members from the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet to Celwis, in an attempt to seize control of the Agbui mining world.
