At that time, the galaxy was locked in the Great Galactic War, a conflict between a reconstituted Sith Empire and the Republic, but, as a gesture of peace from the Sith, the two factions met on the planet Alderaan to negotiate an end to hostilities. In reality, this was just a ruse to allow the Sith fleet to directly attack Coruscant. Orbital Security Station Six was the first facility to encounter the mass of Sith warships, requesting clearance codes from the Sith flotilla. Moments later, the satellite was destroyed in a barrage of turbolaser fire from the Sith fleet before the assault party descended upon the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orbital Security Station Six was an orbital satellite used by Coruscant Security to monitor starship traffic on and off the capital planet of the Galactic Republic, Coruscant. It shared this role with other orbital security stations assigned to various other planets in the galaxy. Orbital Security Station Six was painted red and gray and roughly resembled the Aurebesh sigil  in form. One side of the craft was adorned with two cylinders lined with blue and black surfaces. There was a way to transfer workers aboard the station on- and off-planet as their shifts changed. The station had designated rooms on the inside, from which workers monitored the skylanes. Several instruments, such as various computers, assisted them with this task. The facility was equipped with a subspace transceiver, allowing the crew to communicate with Coruscant Control and ships when it was required."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orbital Security Station Six was in orbit above the planet Coruscant in the year 3653 BBY, monitoring starship traffic on and off Coruscant for Coruscant Security. Femi, a female Rutian Twi'lek who worked aboard the craft, checked into a dispatcher over a radio, reporting that there was nothing in her vicinity. Femi then noticed an armada entering Coruscanti space and, surprised by the unexpected arrival, requested clearance codes from them. The reformed Sith Empire and the Republic were currently meeting at Alderaan to discuss terms for ending the Great Galactic War, a galaxy-wide conflict that had been taking place between the two factions for almost three decades, and the unexpected arrival of the Sith fleet caught Femi off-guard. Rather than transmit a response back to her, the Sith fleet destroyed Orbital Security Station Six, killing the crew, after the Sith Lord Angral, the leader of the assault, ordered his ship to fire upon the satellite. This began the Sacking of Coruscant, a battle that resulted in great repercussions upon the Republic, strong-arming the government into ceding many outlying worlds to the Sith in exchange for a truce."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The orbital security station had at least two crew members. Femi was responsible for checking into traffic control. Alongside her was a fair-skinned humanoid co-worker who serviced other panels aboard the craft. Femi and her co-worker wore a uniform with a black torso, white shoulder pads, and white sleeves. Their pants were also white."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orbital Security Station Six was created for the first issue of the opening arc of Star Wars: The Old Republic, Threat of Peace, a web comic serving as a prequel to Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game produced by BioWare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
