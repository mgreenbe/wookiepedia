She oversaw the test of Toth's new weapon Trihexalon on Point Modie on the planet Maramere. Jedi Master Adi Gallia and Reti intervened to protect the innocents.

However the Lok Revenants had the same idea which resulted in her forces on a Tug of War for the parts, Bella lost all of the parts but she did have a back-up plan in case of this. She sent a couple of Sabaoth Frigates to try to stop the Tritus from heading to Lok but even that had failed. She then went to Lok with Toth make a stand against the Lok Revenants but the pirates placed the Orbital Defense Cannon on one of Lok's moons known as Khons which started the Second Battle of Lok."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the defenses failed and Nym destroyed the foundry.
