They had bony ridges that ran along their spines, two clawed legs, and red, leathery wings with an average span of three meters. The dragons were also distinguished by their large fangs, piercing yellow eyes with sharp vision, and long, pointed beaks. Condor dragons had green skin, and the Ewok shaman Logray claimed that their skin was too thick to hurt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Condor dragons were carnivorous predators. When hunting, condor dragons launched from high buttresses and flew in spiral swoops. They often screeched while attacking. Large condor dragons were reputed to snatch Ewoks from the backs of their pony steeds. Although condor dragons preyed upon many species, such as the rearing spiders, they found Ewok ponies to be unpalatable. Some condor dragons were also scavengers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The dragons usually captured prey alive and brought them to their eyries. Their nests could be found in caves, canyons, and on crags. Condor dragons were both nocturnal and diurnal. Some condor dragons could be trained, such as the one owned by the Tulgah witch, Morag."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morag, the Tulgah witch, enslaved a condor dragon and used the beast to devour sunberry trees, which were used by the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village. Without the sunberries, many Ewoks became sick. Long after, in 3 ABY, Morag's condor dragon stole two sunberry trees from a grove near Bright Tree Village, frightening the Ewoks Wicket Wystri Warrick and Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka. The dragon brought the trees to Morag, who then ordered the beast to destroy every berry tree in the grove. Aware of Morag's plot, the Ewok shaman Logray created a special soap that was used to coat the trees and render them invisible. When the condor dragon returned to the grove, it was unable to see the sunberry trees and left."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On another occasion, Morag created a poisonous potion and commanded her condor dragon to disperse it across the Ewoks' berry forest. In response, Logray made an antidote that negated the poison's effects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, Chief Chirpa of Bright Tree Village used magic to illustrate a tale in which Morag rode on the back of a condor dragon to steal the Sunstar/Shadowstone. He also recounted how Logray, in his youth, had courageously lassoed the dragon's tail and flown to Mount Thunderstone. Sometime later, Warrick engaged with Duloks\u2014the Ewoks' warring cousins\u2014and a condor dragon was set on him, grabbing him by the leg and taking flight. Warrick's friend Teebo leapt onto the beast from a hang glider and slayed it with an axe, rescuing Warrick."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Sanyassan Marauders raided Bright Tree Village in 3.5 ABY, the Ewok Warrick and the Human girl Cindel Towani fled into a cave along a sheer cliff and encountered a hungry condor dragon.

For the film, the dragon was realized by Industrial Light & Magic through stop-motion animation.
