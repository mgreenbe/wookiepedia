When Abeloth learned that the Jedi had managed to kill about a thousand Sith she commanded Korelei to kill all the Jedi by the next dawn. Korelei explained that this wasn't possible as they had not captured any Jedi, and explained to Abeloth that Wynn Dorvan, who was now serving as her adviser, was hiding information about the Jedi. Korelei suggested revealing the Sith to the people of Coruscant, but Wynn disagreed as that would lead to open rebellion against the Sith. Korelei attempted to kill Wynn with her shikkar but Abeloth caught it and agreed with Wynn that civilian deaths were not in their interests. Wynn told Abeloth and Korelei that the best plan of attack would be to lure the Jedi to the Sith occupied Jedi Temple. After death of High Lord Ivaar Workan she was chosen as one of Abeloth's host bodies and became High Lord herself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korelei was strong enough to ascend to the rank of Sith Lord within the Lost Tribe. Korelei was skilled in Force torture, which she used against Wynn Dorvan during his captivity. She was also capable of using the Force to probe an individual's mind.
