It was not as accurate as a standard blaster, and therefore was not as heavily restricted as weapons-quality blasters. The cutting blaster produced a \"cold blast\" of energy which lasted for a second and half and was capable of cutting down brush and small trees. It was referred to as a cold blast as the pulse was unlikely to produce a spark or start a fire. The weapon needed around four hours to charge off of a standard starship's power systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
