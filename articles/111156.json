Many high-ranking Imperials searched for the elusive gauntlet until Trioculus and the Central Committee found it.

In 4 ABY, members of the secretive, Imperial-aligned Prophets of the Dark Side, led by their Supreme Prophet, Kadann, on Coruscant, predicted that Galactic Emperor Palpatine would be defeated by his nemesis Luke Skywalker during the impending Battle of Endor. Enraged at such a negative prophecy, Palpatine decided he no longer required the services of Kadann and his disciples. The Prophets fled to Dromund Kaas but were tracked down by legions of Imperial Inquisitors, who slew many of them. Palpatine believed that all of the Prophets had been killed, but in truth, a number of them, including Kadann, had gone into hiding on remote Bosthirda. Their prophecy ultimately came to pass: Palpatine was killed at Endor and an Empire devoid of leadership fell into disarray."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months later, in 5 ABY, a number of Imperials who held power on Coruscant devised a scheme to keep their subjects loyal and content. Under Palpatine, religion had been almost entirely outlawed, so acting-Emperor Sate Pestage ordered the creation of a new religion to which he hoped the masses would flock. He commissioned former Director of Imperial Intelligence Cronal\u2014once a Prophet of the Dark Side himself\u2014to found the Church of the Dark Side, which the Empire claimed was led by the restored Prophets of the Dark Side. The plot was also intended to help certain Imperial Moffs retain power. A number of Imperial Intelligencers were drafted into the scheme to impersonate high profile Prophets, and Ubooki was assigned to masquerade as Supreme Prophet Kadann, while his Null comrade Heingort Giddis acted as High Prophet Jedgar. The Church of the Dark Side was very successful, and its members were idolized by both Imperial citizens and members of the Imperial Military and other institutions. The \"false Kadann,\" as he became known by those who were aware of his true identity, lacked the Force-sensitivity of the actual Prophets, but made a number of \"prophecies\" anyway, relying on a far-reaching network of spies and informants to provide him with information which he could use to make educated guesses. When these guesses proved incorrect, the Prophets relied on other, mundane means to make them come true. They were unscrupulous in these endeavors and were content to resort to murder, bribery, or any number of crimes to uphold their fraudulent reputation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Prophecy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, however, the phony Prophets grew dissatisfied with following orders and decided to form their own Imperial faction, answering to no higher authority. The devotion shown to them by their Imperial subjects meant that they had great support. Kadann established his headquarters at Space Station Scardia, located in the Null Zone in the Mid Rim. The region was very remote and suffered from heavy radiation, so few beings ventured into the Prophets' territory. Kadann took with him huge amounts of expensive artwork and stolen valuables, turning much of the space station into his own personal museum. While the majority of Imperials remained loyal to Ysanne Isard, who had taken the reigns of the Empire after Sate Pestage, Kadann's network of spies was loyal only to him; that, combined with the reverence most religious Imperials held for the Church of the Dark Side, made he and his cohorts powerful individuals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kadann took to wearing the true Supreme Prophet's hallmark sparkling black regalia and using trance-inducing tree bark from Endor, as well as colored chalk powder, to make himself appear mystical and clairvoyant. He also adorned himself with a number of lofty titles, such as \"Dreamer of Dark Dreams, Supreme Prophet of the Empire.\" After spending some time attracting the attention of Imperial warlords and the fledgling New Republic, Kadann made his first major prophecy since leaving Imperial Center: he \"foretold\" that the rightful heir to Palpatine's Empire would find and wear the Glove of Darth Vader, an almost indestructible gauntlet that had supposedly survived the destruction of the second Death Star at Endor. Many Imperial warlords, desperate to gain Kadann's \"dark blessing\" and become Emperor, scrambled to locate the glove, with little initial success. The newly founded Central Committee of Grand Moffs was hailing Trioculus as the rightful heir to the Empire, because he was, they claimed, Palpatine's son. While many accepted his claim for the throne and flocked to his banner, others refused to stand by anyone who did not have Kadann's blessing. Thus, they searched for the glove and eventually located it, on Mon Calamari. Trioculus' right-hand-man and effectively the power behind his would-be throne, Grand Moff Bertroff Hissa, arranged to meet with the Prophets at Scardia Station, though Kadann had little respect for Trioculus; like the false Prophet, he was a fraud."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kadann had his agents research Trioculus, and they found that he was not who he claimed to be: while Palpatine had fathered a three-eyed son, albeit unconventionally, his third eye was located at the back on his head, while Trioculus' was on his forehead. Kadann's spies learned that the true son of Palpatine, Triclops, had been killed because he suffered from insanity. Trioculus, Bertroff Hissa, and some of their personnel arrived at Scardia Station to meet with the Prophets. Kadann met them in the Chamber of Dark Visions and greeted Trioculus, but he was disrespectful toward the former slavelord, accusing him of lying about his ancestry and murdering Palpatine's true son, over whom he had authority while overseeing slave operations in the Spice Mines of Kessel. Trioculus denied murdering Triclops, and Hissa explained that Palpatine's son had been secretly banished to a secure facility on the planet Duro. The Grand Moff informed Kadann that the Central Committee deemed Triclops too unstable to rule the Empire, but that Trioculus would be a suitable figurehead to whom many would ally themselves, and who could keep the Empire in one piece. Kadann was satisfied with his reasoning, and gave Trioculus his dark blessing\u2014as well as another apocryphal prophecy. He told the former slavelord that there was a prophecy of a Jedi Prince from the Lost City of the Jedi on Yavin 4, who could challenge and topple he who donned Vader's gauntlet."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Coup"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trioculus went to Yavin 4 and razed the moon in his search for the Lost City of the Jedi, but, with the help of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and the New Republic, the Jedi Prince\u2014known only as Ken\u2014escaped, and Trioculus was unable to locate the Lost City. Around this time, Trioculus stopped wearing the Glove of Darth Vader because it was deteriorating his health, donning a replica gauntlet instead. Kadann's spies learned of this, and Prophet Jedgar quickly fetched the true glove for his master, who kept it amongst his art collection. Trioculus and Hissa put great effort into capturing Ken, ultimately apprehending him at Cloud City, Bespin; however, Trioculus himself fell into a trap set by crime lord Zorba Desilijic Tiure. The self-proclaimed Emperor was imprisoned in carbonite, and Ken escaped into the custody of the New Republic. By this point, however, Kadann had no intention of continuing to co-operate with the Central Committee; he wanted power for himself, intending to launch a coup d'\u00e9tat and usurp Trioculus' rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kadann gathered all of his fellow ersatz Prophets to make another prophecy, telling them what their futures held in store, even though all present knew it was spurious.

Like Trioculus' reign, however, it was not legitimate; Ysanne Isard was the official head of the Empire at that time, but Kadann was still held in great reverence by a portion of the Imperial populace, who supported him steadfastly. In addition to large numbers of ground forces, he commanded many Star Destroyers. He ordered his excited \"disciples\" to retrieve ancient relics from the planet Duro; when the relics were placed at the feet, he promised to destroy the light side of the Force. He also made another grandiose, false prophecy that when a being \"pierced by gold\" visited Mount Yoda on the planet Dagobah, the New Republic would begin to crumble.

The false prophets boarded Grand Moff Hissa's Moffship and Jedgar informed the Moffs of Kadann's coup. He decreed that their lives would be spared if they pledged allegiance to Emperor Kadann; when Hissa refused, Jedgar blackmailed with him sensitive information compiled by Kadann's spies that would identify Hissa as an Imperial traitor, and the Grand Moff eventually relented and accepted Kadann's rule. Jedgar transferred Trioculus' body onto the Scardia Voyager and returned to Kadann's headquarters. With fellow false Prophet Gornash, Kadann had the carbonite slab destroyed, wiping away any trace of Trioculus. Gornash suspected that it might not have been Trioculus they destroyed because Vader's supposedly-indestructible glove would have survived, but when Kadann showed him the true glove in his collection, Gornash's doubts were alleviated. Kadann was adamant that he had not made a mistake and destroyed a fake, but in actuality he was wrong: Zorba had outwitted everyone, publicly displaying the replica carbonite slab that Kadann had just destroyed, while the true Trioculus remained aboard his ship, the Zorba Express."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Trial of the Central Committee"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Kadann believed he was destroying all trace of Trioculus, Jedgar went to Duro to retrieve the planet's treasures.

After a large amount of toxic fluid threatened to wipe out Jedgar's forces, he fled the planet, empty-handed. With his newfound power, Kadann wanted to implement some changes to how his empire was run: he wished to reduce the power of any groups, such as the Grand Moffs, which could threaten him. Fearful of this, the Central Committee went rogue and abandoned the Empire. Kadann sent a large force to locate and apprehend them, but it was initially unsuccessful. The Moffs chanced upon Zorba Desilijic Tiure over Tatooine and found Trioculus' real body in his ship. They disposed of Zorba and revived the former slavelord but he was soon assassinated by the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Kadann made yet another fraudulent prophecy, claiming that when Luke Skywalker was imprisoned in Scardia Station, Ken would betray the location of the Lost City to the Prophets.

Zorba informed them he had vital information on the activities of the Central Committee, but he knew nothing Kadann was not already aware of. The false Supreme Prophet hoped that Zorba might know about the Lost City of the Jedi; he was desperate to locate it so that he could access its main computer library, which contained much hidden knowledge of the Jedi that Kadann could use against his foes, but Zorba had no information. However, the Hutt proved useful in that he recorded a statement declaring the Grand Moffs traitors, giving consent for it to be used as evidence against them in their trial. Eventually, Kadann's forces apprehended Hissa and his accomplices, and immediately held a sham trial\u2014the jury members were all Prophets of the Dark Side, with Kadann serving as the judge and Defeen, a Defel interrogation and torture expert, as the chief prosecutor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grand Moffs Hissa, Muzzer, Dunhausen, and Thistleborn were taken to the Chamber of Dark Justice for the trial.

Muzzer, Dunhausen, and Thistleborn pleaded guilty, but Hissa refused to, claiming that for service to the Prophets on Duro he should be hailed as a hero. The jury disagreed; they found all the Grand Moffs guilty, but decreed that Hissa, as the Central Committee's leader, should be punished more harshly than the others. Kadann sentenced each of the traitors, Thistleborn to three years' hard labor on scorching Bnach; Dunhausen to four years in prison on icy Hoth; Muzzer to five years serving as the sentry of the planet Arzid, home to deadly macaab mushrooms, tentacle-bushes, and arachnors; and Hissa to a slow and painful death."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Lost City"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the trial drew to a close, Prophet Gornash entered the chamber to inform Kadann of a breakthrough in the search for the location of the Lost City of the Jedi.

The latest transmission had given exact details and co-ordinates as to the Lost City's entrance and was presented to Kadann by his subordinate. The faux Supreme Prophet was suspicious about the information, though, believing it had reached him too easily.

The two, as well as a number of their New Republic allies, had encountered Kadann's forces by chance, though their comrades had escaped. Skywalker and Ken were taken to a cold chamber aboard Kadann's flagship, where they were interrogated by the faux Supreme Prophet. Kadann eventually persuaded Ken to drink a beverage containing avabush spice, a powerful truth serum. However, as Ken only consumed a small quantity of the avabush spice, it did not have the full effect, merely slowing his reactions and making him groggy. Hoping to lure Ken to ally with him, Kadann promised to provide him with the identity of his parents once they reached Yavin 4. Eventually, some time after the interrogation had finished, the Scardia Voyager arrived at Yavin 4.

They eventually reached the Jedi Library, and though its caretaker droid, DJ-88, attempted to stop them, Kadann had his men access the computer. He spent some time studying its records on the New Republic. Once satisfied, he turned his attention to Ken, using the computer's database to show the Jedi Prince his parents: Triclops, Palpatine's true son, and Kendalina, a Jedi who had escaped Order 66 in 19 BBY.
