This trooper helped fend off the droid boarding parties onboard the Negotiator and attempted to jump on Grievous. However, he was caught and thrown to the ground before being strangled by the cyborg general. When the fighting came to a pause, Kenobi witnessed the trooper being strangled to death and swore that Grievous would pay for murdering the trooper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
