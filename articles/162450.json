The blaster was designed specifically for sustained close-range use, utilizing its dallorian construction to absorb more heat than a standard blaster. The pistol's expensive custom-made finish made it impervious to furnace fire. They were also small and compact enough to fit into a jetpack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Favoring agility and precision over high capacity, Jango Fett had a pair of WESTAR-34 blaster pistols custom-made. Designed for brief but intense surprise attacks at close range, the pistols had weight-minimizing modifications and were made of an expensive Dallorian alloy which could withstand sustained-fire heating that would melt most ordinary blasters. During his duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi on Kamino, Jango lost one of his WESTARs to the raging sea. He continued to use his remaining blaster against Jedi Knights on Geonosis, killing Coleman Trebor. Jango managed to finish off the Reek in the Execution Arena with one shot from his pistol. Jango then lost his second blaster to Mace Windu's lightsaber seconds before Mace decapitated him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quinlan Vos also carried one of these when he was undercover as Korto Vos. After Jango Fett's death, Boba acquired two custom WESTAR-34s that Jango Fett had specially made to fit Boba.
