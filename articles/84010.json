Like Lumiya, Flint was also given basic instructions in the Sith ways by Darth Vader, who sought to see which of his two secret apprentices was the better choice to have at his side when he decided to overthrow Darth Sidious.

The young Sith prospect was a highly-trained Imperial Sovereign Protector within Darth Sidious' Royal Guard. Unlike the super majority of his fellow guardsmen, who were unquestioningly faithful to Sidious, Jax was loyal only to himself and his ambitions. When Sidious returned from the dead by inserting his spirit into several clone versions of himself in turn, Jax masterminded a plot to bring a premature end to the return of the resurrected Emperor. His machinations led to the poisoning of the Emperor's clone supplies, which proved to be the catalyst behind the final death of Darth Sidious. Jax immediately attempted to install himself as the next emperor, but his ambitious designs on the Imperial throne were ended along with his life by fellow guardsman Kir Kanos.

Since Vader failed to succeed his master and take on a true apprentice, there was no one who was qualified to carry on the Sith tradition in the line of succession founded by Bane. Yet prior to his death at the Battle of Endor, Vader trained a number of secret apprentices in the ways of the dark side of the Force in his plot to eventually overthrow Sidious. One of his disciples was Lumiya, a Force-sensitive agent of the Galactic Empire who suffered extreme injuries at the hands of Vader's own son, Luke Skywalker.

Though she held Vader's son, the Jedi Luke Skywalker, responsible for the demise of her instructors, Lumiya's ultimate objective in life became the preservation of the Sith. With Sidious and Vader gone, much of their knowledge was lost as well. The line of the Sith Lords since Darth Bane and Darth Zannah was broken, and without true successors to their legacy, the Sith as a whole was teetering on the edge of oblivion.

The ancient doctrine, as envisioned by Bane, commanded that the power of the dark side could be divided between only two Sith Lords throughout the entire galaxy at any given time; one Sith Master personified power, and a single Sith apprentice coveted it.

When the plan ended with Vader's death, Lumiya sought out one of her fellow prospective students, a Force-sensitive stormtrooper named Flint. Ironically, she and Flint were originally supposed to fight to the death in order for Vader to see which of the two was stronger, but the Dark Lord's premature death left them both without a master to complete their training. Lumiya eventually tracked Flint's location to Vader's abandoned citadel on Vjun, where they fought to see who deserved the rank of Sith Master.

Betrayed and left without an heir to the Sith legacy, an outraged Lumiya swore to exact vengeance on her renegade pupil for turning his back on her and the dark side of the Force.

The Dark Lady eventually found a suitable candidate in a Force-sensitive Royal Guardsman named Carnor Jax, whom Lumiya had discovered through her alliance with Director Ysanne Isard of Imperial Intelligence. Although Jax received only minimal training in the dark side of the Force, his ascension as Lumiya's apprentice ensured the Sith's survival for the time being. Through Jax's position in the Royal Guard, Lumiya intended to place the Galactic Empire under the rule of the Sith once again.

Around this time, however, the galaxy learned of Darth Sidious' survival through a combination of cloning technology and an ancient Force technique, both of which together enabled the fallen Emperor to place his soul within a temporary vessel. His choice of hosts fell on genetic duplicates of his original body, grown to full maturity at an abnormally accelerated rate through the use of the Spaarti version of cloning. However, the Dark Lord's return was brief; his ultimate downfall was brought about by his enemies in the New Republic and, ironically, by traitorous elements within his own Inner Circle.

The chief culprit behind the destruction of his clone supplies was Carnor Jax, who had been appointed to the ranks of the Emperor's most trusted members of the Royal Guard, the Imperial Sovereign Protectors. Roughly a year after his return, Darth Sidious died for the final time, never to return again as his soul was dragged into the abyss of the dark side. With Sidious gone forever, Jax immediately attempted to install himself as the next emperor. Yet his designs on the throne were prematurely ended, partially due to his own treachery. Kir Kanos, a fellow guardsman and loyal follower of the slain Emperor, hunted and killed Carnor Jax for his role in the demise of Darth Sidious. With yet another apprentice who failed to achieve the full status of a Sith Lord, Lumiya was forced to hide in exile on the Sith world of Korriban, but continued to remain vigilant on the unfolding of galactic events throughout the many years that she spent in hiding."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A new direction for the Sith"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the galaxy was subjected to a full-scale invasion by Nom Anor's race, the Yuuzhan Vong, in 25 ABY, Lumiya discovered that, though she was without an apprentice to carry on the legacy of the dark side, she was not the only one who continued to pursue a plan to rebuild the Sith. A former Jedi Master of the Old Republic named A'Sharad Hett, traumatized by the Great Jedi Purge and disillusioned with the Jedi way, submitted himself to the ancient Sith teachings of XoXaan. Shortly after his capture by the Yuuzhan Vong, Hett was discovered by a fellow exile known as Vergere, who, like Hett, was once a member of the fallen Jedi Order before immersing herself in the lore of the dark side. Although the Fosh ex-Jedi Knight initially saw potential in Hett, she was greatly disappointed to realize that her prospective student lacked the same beliefs that she possessed. Rather than adhere to Darth Bane's Rule of Two, Hett believed that the Sith had to be rebuilt in an extremely radical manner, and thus he brainstormed a new tenet known as the Rule of One. Instead of only two Sith Lords at a time, Hett wanted to create a new Sith Order composed of many darksiders, all of whom would operate under the absolute authority of a single Dark Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vergere, a strict adherent to the teachings of Darth Bane, refused to participate in any plan to rebuild the Sith by discarding the Rule of Two, and thus left Hett to suffer at the hands of the extra-galactic invaders. At some point during the Yuuzhan Vong War, Vergere met the Dark Lady Lumiya, whom she found to be a far more promising disciple than the heretic A'Sharad Hett. The Fosh explained her own connection to the Sith through the late Darth Sidious, whom she once had the opportunity to learn from as an aspiring Sith apprentice. She also revealed how the former Jedi Hett, by then known as Darth Krayt, founded the One Sith, a drastically re-envisioned Sith Order that was based on his own ideals. During her time with the Fosh, Lumiya completed the training she had begun many years ago under Darth Vader through Vergere's wisdom, thus achieving the status of a full-fledged Dark Lady of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Darth Krayt escaped from the Yuuzhan Vong and fled to Korriban where he built the foundations of the One Sith, the self-anointed Sith Lord hoped to recruit Lumiya to his cause, however the Yuuzhan Vong prevented Krayt's minions from bringing Lumiya to their master. But as with Vergere, Lumiya had no interest in discarding the Rule of Two for Krayt's heretical views. Furthermore, she was convinced that the One Sith was too slow and inactive to pose any real threat to the meteoric rise of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Order. Unwilling to deviate from the traditions of Bane and Zannah, Lumiya rejected Krayt's vision and pursued a plan to rebuild the Sith Order in its orthodox form."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The teachings of Vergere provided Lumiya with a new sense of purpose in life. Her personal ambitions and feelings of self-importance were superseded by the need to fulfill a destiny\u2014the restoration of peace and stability throughout the galaxy by imposing order through Sith teachings and the power of the dark side. Yet both women were well aware that neither of them was suitable for the ultimate task; Lumiya's Force potential had been severely diminished by her cybernetic implants, and Vergere was tainted by her collaboration with the Yuuzhan Vong. Hence, they planned to recruit and train a new Dark Lord of the Sith, the one who would champion their cause as a benevolent dictator.

Lumiya and Vergere had neither the time or energy to train a young Force-sensitive from scratch, and thus they naturally looked to the most powerful members of the Jedi Order. Among the Jedi that they considered, both Lumiya and Vergere were heavily interested in the descendants of Darth Vader. While Leia Organa Solo, daughter of Darth Vader, was a natural leader and a capable politician, she was also too fearful of her father's legacy. Her daughter, Jaina Solo, was discarded as a possibility because of her tendency to be ruled by her emotions, rather than the need to serve the greater good. Mara Jade Skywalker, though not of Vader's blood, was powerful in her own right and\u2014like Lumiya\u2014a former Emperor's Hand.

During the war against the Yuuzhan Vong, Solo proved his ability to wield great power with responsibility through his refusal to fire Centerpoint Station, an ancient space facility capable of unleashing devastating energy beams through hyperspace, against the Yuuzhan Vong, due to his belief that it would be an overly aggressive action. By slaying Warmaster Tsavong Lah of the Yuuzhan Vong in personal combat, Solo demonstrated his willingness to dispense with power when necessary. Deciding that he was their best candidate, Lumiya and Vergere came to believe that Jacen Solo would become a Sith Lord who was different from the many others who wielded the dark side for personal gain and glory. Solo would be their champion who embraced power, not for the sake of power itself, but for the sake of creating a peaceful galaxy. Hence, Vergere manipulated events that led to Solo's capture and torture at the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong. Although he had been chosen as the next Sith Lord, he was still far from being perfectly qualified at the time. Vergere wanted Solo to be broken by the Vong and isolated from the Jedi's influence.

Vergere had no intention of allowing her dream die because of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9's recklessness, and so she killed the Yuuzhan Vong warriors that were threatening Jaina, but at the cost of her own life. Yet while Solo lived on, hope remained through Lumiya, whose overriding responsibility was to finish Vergere's work and facilitate the conversion of Jacen Solo. When the war ended a year later, the Yuuzhan Vong surrendered after the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar and the galaxy was reunited under the rule of the Galactic Alliance, the successor-state of the former New Republic.

The traumatic events that he experienced during the Yuuzhan Vong War, including the death of his younger brother, Anakin Solo, altered much of his outlook on the galaxy. He began to wonder why the galaxy had a tendency to slip into so many wars, even with the Jedi actively trying to keep the peace. Most importantly, and unknown to Lumiya, Jacen had experienced a disturbing vision during his five year sojourn which made him far more receptive to Lumiya's plans. During his stay on an unidentified planet in the Maw, he had gazed into the Pool of Knowledge, a dark side nexus that allowed him to see the future.

After explaining the origins of her residence and its connection to Darth Vectivus, an ancient Sith Lord who wielded the dark side without falling to megalomania, \"Brisha\" revealed her true identity as Lumiya. Though Dinn wanted to immediately kill the Sith Lady, Solo was intrigued by her knowledge and persuasive argument that a Sith could harness the dark side without becoming a self-serving tyrant. Lumiya, once an admirer of Darth Sidious, dismissed the fallen Emperor as an insane sociopath who betrayed the Sith way by seeking power only for his own sake, rather than the sake of the galaxy. She also pitied Solo's grandfather as a sad individual who lost everything he ever cared about. In so many Sith Lords of the past, Lumiya reasoned that they were all evil because of the fact that they all began as troubled individuals in one way or another; yet there were a few exceptions like Vectivus who wielded power responsibly and for the greater good.

In order to strengthen the image of the Alliance's stance against the criminal activities of Corellian terrorists, it was decided that a Jedi should head the Alliance's new police force. At the same time, however, the situation provided a perfect opportunity for aspiring Sith Lord Jacen Solo to begin his first steps to securing the absolute power that he would need to reform the galaxy.

However, Veila's obsession with Anakin Solo, as well as her refusal to move beyond his memory, frustrated Darth Caedus to great lengths. Furthermore, Veila also lost some credibility in the Dark Lord's eyes due to her constant failures to locate the Jedi's secret base. Yet in spite of Caedus' criticism, Veila forced herself to try harder to prove her worthiness to him. When the Anakin Solo traveled to the Confederate world Fondor, a group of Fondorian starfighters moved to intercept the GAG Star Destroyer. Caedus left the decision on whether or not the Anakin should fire on the fighters first to Veila. With their shields lowered, the Anakin's personnel stood at the risk of losing many lives if the fighters chose to attack first. Despite a few moments of indecision, Veila ordered the Star Destroyer's gunners to destroy the enemy targets. As the Anakin Solo returned to Coruscant, Veila struggled with internal conflict over the thought that she may have killed innocent opponents who did not launch the first strike. Yet her willingness to exert destructive power with ruthlessness when necessary also redeemed her in the eyes of Darth Caedus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to further test his prospective prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Caedus dispatched Veila on a diplomatic assignment to Bastion where she would propose an alliance with the Imperial Remnant. Although Gilad Pellaeon, the Imperial Head of State, despised Caedus, the influential members of the Moff Council were intrigued by the idea of joining with the Galactic Alliance, especially if the reward meant an expansion to their greatly diminished empire. Regardless of Pellaeon's objections to commit Imperial forces to the Alliance's war, the Remnant ultimately agreed to Caedus' proposal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tahiri Veila's successful mission to Bastion and her involvement with Darth Caedus turned her into a rising star within the Galactic Alliance. After being recruited into the Galactic Alliance Guard as a junior lieutenant, many within the Alliance, including Cha Niathal, saw Veila as Ben Skywalker's replacement at the Dark Lord's side. Her final test manifested itself during the Second Battle of Fondor. While the Moffs ambitions could be counted on to work in Caedus' favor, Pellaeon's blatant hatred for him was a threat to Caedus and his plans. Hence, he ordered Veila to remain on Pellaeon's flagship, Bloodfin, both as his emissary and to ensure that the Remnant remained loyal to the Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the battle commenced, Admiral Niathal attempted to undermine her colleague's authority by accepting the surrender of Fondor without first consulting her Joint Chief of State. In retaliation, Caedus denounced her as a traitor and declared himself the sole Chief of State of the true Galactic Alliance. Due to his immense popularity within the military, the majority of the Alliance fleet chose to side with Caedus. Much to the dismay of the Moffs, however, Pellaeon ordered the Remnant fleet to join with Niathal's force. But Veila interceded on Caedus' behalf and argued that, without him, the Galactic Alliance would fall and the war would be lost. When Pellaeon refused to rescind his order and rejoin Caedus, Veila fatally wounded the aging Imperial Head of State with a blaster shot through the chest. With Pellaeon dead, the Moffs hastily assumed command and instructed all Remnant starships to fight for Caedus and the Alliance once more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once Darth Caedus learned of Gilad Pellaeon's assassination, he immediately congratulated Tahiri Veila on saving the entire Galactic Alliance. Instead of feeling pride, Veila admitted the guilt she carried for shooting an extremely old man. In spite of this, however, Caedus approved of her actions and the fact that she did not revel in the act of killing. In many ways, the two former Jedi followed a similar journey into the dark side of the Force. Like Veila, Caedus had to endure sacrifice and agony to become a Sith Lord. He had suffered the betrayal of his entire family; he was forced to kill those who once trusted him. Like Caedus, Veila severed her ties to the Jedi and their ways in order to embrace the philosophy of Lumiya's Sith Order. She killed Pellaeon, not in anger or because of a malicious streak of cruelty, but because she was determined to ensure that Caedus would not fall at Fondor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, Darth Caedus fully believed that he was destined to rule the galaxy with Tahiri Veila at his side. The Dark Lord had found a worthy apprentice at last, and thus Veila's ascension as a Sith Lady restored the Rule of Two as a practiced tradition. Regardless of the losses at Fondor, Caedus and his new apprentice successfully withdrew their remaining forces back to Coruscant.

By this time, however, Caedus had an epiphany; he failed to live accordingly by the teachings of his fallen master Lumiya. He had forgotten that, in his original persona as Jacen Solo, he became the Dark Lord of the Sith to serve the galaxy\u2014not to oppress it. When Caedus' training began, Lumiya warned him that the path to the dark side would be painful. To grow stronger as a Sith Lord, Caedus was supposed to embrace the pain of betrayal and sacrifice. But without Lumiya's guidance, Caedus realized that he became increasingly vain, despondent and obsessed with vengeance. In short, he became more like the vast majority of Sith Lords, all of whom were destroyed by their inability to serve anything other than their own interests."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His failure to control his temper also damaged his reputation, amongst the Galactic Alliance Guard, the Imperial Remnant and even the Galactic Alliance in general. Hence, Caedus felt personally responsible for some of the Alliance's worst setbacks, such as the loss at Kuat, Kashyyyk and the debacle at Fondor, which nearly cost him the war and his life. Although he took the betrayals of each member of his family, the treachery of his young daughter, Allana, pushed Caedus to the brink of madness. As a consequence, he even executed Lieutenant Patra Tebut, a loyal and reliable officer in the GAG, by Force choking her to death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The revelation of his ill-tempered actions, as well as their consequences, provided Darth Caedus with a new perspective. Thus, he waged an internal struggle to regain control of his emotions in order to lead the Galactic Alliance without the distractions of petty grudges and feelings of self-importance. He decided that, as a Sith Lord, he would use the dark side by embracing the love he felt for family, his sense of duty to the countless beings of the galaxy, and the sacrifices that he made to become the Dark Lord of the Sith. From that point on, Caedus exercised his powers with a great deal of restraint and, due to his new resolution, struggled to control his temper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon finally discovering the Jedi base's location at the planet Shedu Maad, Darth Caedus took the Anakin Solo and a detachment of Imperial starships to force a final outcome with the enemies of the Galactic Alliance. It was also at this time when he decided to end his apprentice's misconceptions about Flow-walking. Tahiri Veila was outraged by the revelation of her master's deception; she had fallen to the dark side of the Force after pinning all of her hopes on the false idea of preventing Anakin Solo's death in the past. Caedus knew that Veila would most likely never forgive him.

As Veila led the shock troopers of the Imperial Elite Guard on a mission to infiltrate and destroy the Jedi base on Shedu Maad, Jaina Solo infiltrated the badly-damaged Anakin Solo and confronted her twin brother in a final duel to the death. She caused many injuries to the Dark Lord, but also suffered severe wounds in the process as well. In the midst of their vicious battle, Darth Caedus was ultimately slain when Jaina, consumed with the utter need to kill her own brother, stabbed him through the heart with her own lightsaber. On the planet's surface, Ben Skywalker successfully took advantage of Tahiri Veila's disillusionment and convinced her to abandon the ways of the Sith.

The Moffs were also forced to surrender and accept Jagged Fel as the Imperial Remnant's new head of state. The combined might of the Alliance, the Jedi and the Remnant forced the Confederation to surrender as well, and thus brought an end to Corellia's galactic-wide insurrection. Among the concessions that were made to strengthen the bond between the new allies, Natasi Daala, a former officer in the Imperial Navy, was appointed as Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance.

Many of her actions while in office were blatantly influenced by her Anti-Jedi sentiment, and thus created a new round of tensions between the Jedi Order and the government of the Galactic Alliance. Despite her promises of forging a galaxy that did not require the Jedi to solve issues and dilemmas, Daala's campaign and open hostility against the Order failed to gain widespread support among the Senate and the people of the Alliance.
