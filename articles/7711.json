The last models of this type were produced before the height of the Galactic Empire, approximately 10 BBY, when Sienar Fleet Systems concentrated their efforts on the TIE/LN starfighter market, which was more profitable for them than selling light freighters. One of the last units produced was The Agent, used by the Rebel Alliance Scandium Team and Gale Team."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
