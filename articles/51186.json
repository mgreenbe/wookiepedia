Finding widespread use in tunneling applications, they were used where dirt and rock had to be removed and transported from a dig site. Because of the nature of the machine, it could be used to cut through virtually any material. The disintegrator could be used manually, or mounted on a support tripod."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
