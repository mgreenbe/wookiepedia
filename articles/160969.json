It would display holo-signals in, but, instead of projecting a three-dimensional image, images on a holoscreen would be shown like any normal screen in two-dimensional format with the exception of the weight and space from a solid flat panel screen. It could be attached to a wall and viewed in a room. It was capable of receiving different transmissions, including Channel 1. Establishments such as the Outlander Club on Coruscant had wall-mounted viewscreens, showing various sporting events including Podracing, Odupiendo racing, and nuna-ball. Viewscreens could be used for in-house events that were not broadcast publicly, such as events in the Taris dueling ring, which could be seen on viewscreens in the Upper City Cantina. Depending on the species using viewscreens, the effects for the viewscreens may vary. For example, the Empire had a slight static appear before flashing into view when using their viewscreens via a hologram, while the Neimoidians and the Trade Federation instead had the transmission incoming or ceasing give a slight wave effect as well as featuring a slightly white area surrounding the transmission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
