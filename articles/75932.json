However, before Khypes could contact the native Voss and demand their surrender, his starship exploded, and the battle cruiser's escorts were destroyed as well only moments later. The fleet's destruction, the cause of which could not be identified, shocked both the Galactic Republic and the Empire. The Empire suspected Republic sabotage or a secret Voss weapon, and the Republic theorized it was the result of infighting among the Sith. Both the Republic and the Empire began diplomatic relations with the Force-sensitive Voss as a result, hoping to form an alliance with the species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Khypes and his battle cruiser were first mentioned in the Codex entry \"The Imperial Attack on Voss\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
