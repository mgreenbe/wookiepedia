Scheduled to have been released in 2009, development on the expansion went as far as final playtesting before reaching approval for distribution before the game was discontinued during the acquisition of WizKids by National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) from Topps. Due to the separation of the Star Wars license from the PocketModels trademark through the sale and liquidation of WizKids properties by Topps, there are no current plans to produce the expansion by NECA. The game was to have included elements from several Star Wars properties, such as The Clone Wars TV series, Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, and Star Wars: Starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New gameplay rules and concepts in the Clone Wars Conquest expansion was to include:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New types of ships:"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
