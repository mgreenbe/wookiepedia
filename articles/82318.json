Shortly after its conquest, she hosted a party on a luxurious skyhook, to which Sei'lar was invited. She was delighted to reunite with Sei'lar, who was making a name for herself in Rogue Squadron. She was also impressed by Sei'lar's boyfriend, Gavin Darklighter. The fact that Darklighter was a Human excited mild disapproval among many of the guests, but Dan'kre easily accepted him. Dan'kre eagerly caught up with her old friend at the party, though a slight commotion was made when Karka Kre'fey challenged Darklighter to a duel after Darklighter honestly answered Kre'fey when asked if the Bothan's grandfather, Laryn Kre'fey, had fouled up at the First Battle of Borleias.
