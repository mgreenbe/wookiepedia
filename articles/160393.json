Unlike Barr's other disciples, Verla's connection to the Force made her a candidate for Jedi training. As a result, Barr assumed the role of Jedi Master by teaching Verla to control her powers. Verla was loyal to Barr and supported his plan to sow the seeds of rebellion against the rule of Emperor Palpatine.

Verla and her Master were confronted by the Inquisitors in Bel City, but the Jedi successfully manipulated the clone Purge Troopers to execute Order 66 against the Inquisitorius, all of whom once served the Jedi Order prior to the fall of the Galactic Republic. After escaping the Inquisitors, Barr ordered Verla to leave the planet and survive while he remained behind to personally confront Vader in single combat.

A survivor of the initial Great Jedi Purge, Barr sought to avenge the Jedi Order by fomenting a rebellion against the Sith-controlled Galactic Empire. To that end, he recruited several acolytes to his cause, including Verla. Unlike her fellow disciples, Verla demonstrated an ability to wield the Force. Recognizing her potential, Barr took it upon himself to train Verla in the ways of the Force as her de facto Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 18 BBY, a year after the accession of Emperor Palpatine, Verla was hiding on the oceanic planet Mon Cala with Bar and the other acolytes. During the Battle of Dac City, Barr was informed by King Lee-Char that the Sith Lord Darth Vader and three Imperial Inquisitors had arrived to hunt the Jedi. Verla's Master revealed to his students that Vader was, in fact, Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Knight and the Chosen One destined to bring balance to the Force. Barr told the acolytes of how the Sith Lord had helped destroy the Jedi, showing holograms of it through his R1-series astromech droid Endee."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Chase to Bel City"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having succeeded in starting a war between the Mon Calamari and the Empire, Barr and his students watched the conflict through a hologram projected by Endee. After Lee-Char informed them that Vader had discovered their location, Barr and his acolytes evacuated their refuge only to be confronted moments later by the Sith Lord and his Jedi hunters. Three acolytes were killed during the ensuing pursuit; another two elected to remain behind in order to provide Barr and Verla more time to escape the planet. However, the Padawan and his last acolyte were cornered by the Inquisitorius in Bel City.

Barr confronted Vader, but was slain in a lightsaber duel against the Dark Lord of the Sith.

Verla tried to become a Jedi but had many encounters with the Inquisitorius and rare occasions a visit from Darth Vader himself. She lived a hard life, trying for years to find a teacher and lightsaber, only finding fear, pain, and death. Everyone she grew close to was killed off by agents of the dark side, or she had to leave behind when she had to run and pondered how she survived. She did seem to become familiar with certain things about the Jedi history as she was aware of the High Republic Era, and knew what holocrons were. Added with she knew the saying of \"Do or do not. There is no try.\" She eventually became aware of an ancient Jedi outpost located on Tempes. She knew what she needed was inside a Lightsaber and holorons, but never entered when she arrived feeling something dark and malevolent inside. She sometime after that eventually gave up on her Jedi path, thinking she was told to do something by a dead man."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Starting over"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 3 ABY, Verla lived on Serelia and worked at the fishing docks on the oceanic planet. Sometime after his duel against Darth Vader on Cloud City, the Jedi trainee Luke Skywalker experienced a Force vision while training with a blaster in which a hooded Verla grabbed his falling lightsaber after losing it during the duel and asked him to follow his destiny. Upon receiving a similar vision while searching his lightsaber through the dump of Cloud City, Skywalker once again got a glimpse of a hooded Verla holding his lightsaber while standing on the waters of Serelia and asking him to follow his destiny."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Luke arrived on Serelia, Verla was discussing with the hauler droid TRK-R, who was going to collect a cargo of fish Verla had fished. Upon approaching her and asking her if she was a Jedi, Verla dropped the catch of fish on Skywalker and TRK-R before fleeing, thinking that Skywalker was another Inquisitor hunting her down. Fleeing across the water with her boat, Verla lured Skywalker onto an island and trapped him. With Skywalker at his mercy, Verla asked him what he wanted, and Skywalker told her about his vision and that he was a Jedi like her. However, Verla told him that she was no Jedi and proceeded to share her views on the Jedi to the young boy once she realized he wasn't an Inquisitor. However, as she told him about the Jedi Purge, the Inquisitorius and Darth Vader, she sensed something in him when she uttered the Sith Lord's name. After probing Skywalker's mind, Verla realized with horror that Luke was none other than Darth Vader's son.

When Barr succeeded in turning clones against the Inquisitorius, Verla expressed amazement at her Master's ability to use Order 66 to their advantage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later on her life, however, Verla's views on the Jedi changed considerably. When Luke Skywalker met with her on Serelia during the Galactic Civil War, Verla told him that whoever wanted to be a Jedi was a fool and that all things he had heard about them were only the positive aspects of their Order while omitting their failures. She considered Skywalker to be a poor, deluded kid and a sucker who might have thought that he had a Jedi destiny for wiggling a rock with the Force one day. By this time, Verla had also grew to be paranoid that upon first meeting Skywalker, she fled from him as she thought that the boy could be an Inquisitor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Force-sensitive, Verla possessed the ability to wield the power of the Force.

Even before her training began, Verla was able to levitate a small object as a demonstration of her talent. By the time she confronted the Inquisitorius, Verla had gained enough knowledge to enhance her physical abilities, allowing her to leap over the Jedi hunters with the aid of the Force and her Master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Verla first appeared in the canon 2018 comic Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 14 written by Charles Soule and penciled by Giuseppe Camuncoli.
