A massive force of Star Destroyers are bombarding the planet, reducing its surface to rubble. On the surface, a group of stormtroopers are in battle with a large group of Jedi with heavy casualties on both sides. The attack is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Darth Vader, who has arrived to complete the destruction. Several of the remaining Jedi charge Vader, attempting to cut him down, but they are no match for the Dark Lord of the Sith who easily dispatches with his attackers. The leader of the Jedi, appalled by the deaths of his allies, steps forward, claiming that Vader will pay for the slaughter. Vader begins to choke the man with the Force, but he is able to resist, launching himself at the Sith Lord. However, Vader is prepared for the attack, and he stabs the man through the chest. Unseen by Vader, a young Jedi Padawan, Tao, approaches the slaughter. The Jedi leader, with his dying words, pleads with Tao not to attack, asking that Tao live through this encounter. Vader turns to face Tao, who, although badly injured, has ignited his lightsaber.

He finds Han Solo and confronts him about leaving to avoid the upcoming battle. Han shrugs off the criticism, and Luke leaves, but not before Han wishes him good luck. The X-wing starfighters of Red Squadron begin their attack on the Death Star. Darth Vader enters the battle in his TIE Advanced x1, shooting down the enemy pilots. Luke and his wingmates, Biggs Darklighter and Wedge Antilles, begin their Trench Run. They are pursued by Vader, who kills Biggs and forces Wedge to withdraw. Before Vader can shoot down Luke, he is interrupted by the arrival of the Millennium Falcon, piloted by Han. The smuggler shoots down one of Vader's wingmates, causing the other one to become distracted and collide with Vader's starfighter.

The citizens of the planet have heard rumors that the Rebels have won an important victory. Although worried about the possible danger the Rebels might pose, the citizens reassure themselves, claiming that they are safe as long as the Emperor is with them. Amidst cheers for the longevity of the Empire, Darth Vader arrives on the planet where he is greeted by several stormtroopers and a scarfaced Imperial officer. Vader dismisses the officer's greeting, telling him to use any means necessary to uncover the identity of the Rebel pilot who destroyed the Death Star. Vader makes his way to the Imperial Palace to speak with his master, Darth Sidious. In the Emperor's throne room, Vader is greeted by his master, who rebukes him for his failure at Yavin 4. The Emperor claims that he can see right through Vader, witnessing his inner thoughts about his past.

Vader is amused by Tao's belief, and he tells the boy to attack him. Tao strikes at Vader, but the Dark Lord easily deflects his attacks. Vader claims that Tao is not attacking with enough ferocity, and he orders his student to use his anger and hate him. Tao is unable to harness his anger, and he cries out, claiming that he can't use his hate."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Part 2"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader yells at Tao, claiming that his student should have no problem hating him.

Tao vows that he will become strong, and Vader, satisfied, says that the lesson is over. Vader leaves his tower and boards a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle. Vader travels to a Star Destroyer to oversee the launching of several shuttles. During the operation, he is contacted by the scarfaced Imperial officer who gives him a holoprojector containing the name of the Rebel pilot. Vader activates the hologram to see the face of Luke Skywalker. Vader recalls the face of the young man on the Death Star who had fired at him after he had killed Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Vader tells Tao to go wherever he likes but that he will have nothing more to do with him. Sometime later, the Coruscant populace is looking up as a massive warship begins to cast a shadow across the city. Vader is standing with Palpatine on a balcony, and he presents the ship, the Executor, to Vader as a gift.

A Tusken Raider, a survivor of Anakin Skywalker's mission to Tatooine, has come to avenge his slaughtered brethren. The Tusken has learned Basic and studied how Vader fights. With his own lightsabers, the Tusken attacks Vader, who becomes awed by the sense of rage contained within the being.

Similarly, Tao ended up mentioned in Ennix Devian's section on the second part of the blog \"The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire\" as one of Vader's secret apprentices alongside Galen Marek (Starkiller) as well as being one of the few people alongside Devian and Marek to have the honor of facing Noghri Death Commandos during training.
