But before he can revive that elite corps of protectors, he must first rebuild himself! He has spent time as the Emperor's thrall, and the taint of the dark side still tugs at his subconscious.

Balmorra had been independent after the Battle of Endor, but following Palpatine's reappearance had become the Empire's main producer of AT-STs. With the Emperor's apparent death, they have rebelled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to salvage Balmorra's factories, Sedriss lands AT-STs, stormtroopers and Umak Leth's SD-9s on the planet.

In response, Sedriss unleashes Shadow Droids, starfighters with the brains of fallen Imperial aces empowered by the dark side of the Force.

Wedge suggests that the shipment go through to Byss, but controlled by Rebels, while Luke advises that the droids be used to liberate worlds controlled by the Empire. Everyone decides to go with Wedge's plan. Mothma tells Luke to focus on restoring the Jedi Knights while the Alliance deals with the Empire. Luke's Holocron reveals the location of Ossus, a world where Jedi artifacts may be found. Solo and Leia depart for Nar Shaddaa, where they hope to track down Vima-Da-Boda and draw upon her ancient knowledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Byss, the Executor Sedriss discovers that Dark Side adepts Nefta and Sa-Di are killing the remaining clones of Palpatine and plan to seize control of the Empire for themselves.

With only a space truck left, Salla and Shrug plan to head off to Byss to recover the Starlight Intruder. After being confronted by an array of bounty hunters, including a clan of Gank killers, and the news that the Hutt clans had doubled the bounty on them, they had little choice but to head into the lowest levels of the city where Vima-Da-Boda lived. When they arrive back at the garage, they discover a brigade of stormtroopers on the Falcon and a droid message telling them Salla and Shrug have \"left the moon for good\". Using the garage's secret access chute, the Falcon flies down to the heart of the city, unfortunately where Boba Fett had patiently waited for the Millennium Falcon to take off. In the ensuing battle, Han managed to shatter a stabilizer on Slave I, causing Fett to veer out of control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After an hour and seven wrong turns, their second attempt at penetrating the depths had greater luck; they had just found Vima-Da-Boda when Fett attacked again. His assault was defeated when Chewbacca ignited his jet-pack (a repeat of Fett's earlier undoing), and the Falcon soon took off again. However, their immediate departure was sabotaged by Mako Spince who from his perch in the Traffic Control spire forwarded their location to the waiting darksiders aboard the Star Destroyer. The Destroyer locked on with a tractor beam, and the Millennium Falcon was about to be caught in its firm grip. Taunted by Spince, Han figured out a clever dodge: he piloted the Falcon under the spire and the beams inexorably ripped off the spire and pulled it into the Star Destroyer itself, killing Spince and destroying the engines and engineers of the ISD. Lacking engineers, and in a decaying orbit, the Destroyer plunged into the surface of Nar Shaddaa, killing all hands aboard, as well as millions of Nar Shaddaa residents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine dispatches Sedriss and Vill Goir to capture Skywalker and Solusar, who had journeyed to Ossus in a search for ancient Jedi artifacts.

The Ysanna use concussion arrows and the Force in an attempt to defeat the two Jedi, but their inexperienced and clumsy attacks proved easy for the Jedi to hold off.

Solusar quickly kills Goir, but Sedriss, outmatched by Skywalker, takes Jem hostage, backing against a tree.

To all the combatants' immense surprise, the tree turned out to be a millennium-old Jedi Master named Ood Bnar. Sedriss and Bnar faced off. The two perished in the ensuing explosion of Force energy which Bnar created. However, even in his death, Bnar had protected his cache of ancient lightsabers\u2014a gift to the would-be Jedi and a future Neti in his place. With the aid of the Ysanna, Luke discovered precisely what he had hoped for: an intact Jedi library."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elsewhere, Lando Calrissian and a team of Rebel commandos were hiding aboard a shipment of War Droids space-bound for Byss. Meanwhile, the Emperor was impressed by the new superweapon at his disposal, the Galaxy Gun. This weapon, kept near the protection of Byss could allow him to obliterate anything in the galaxy. When he received word of Sedriss' and Goir's deaths, he replaced them with Xecr Nist and Tedryn-Sha, empowering the two with the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the War Droid shipment arrives, and the Rebel commandos use them to attack the Emperor's Citadel. Initially, the Rebel assault is successful, as the droids prove to be superior to the Citadel defenses, but their success is halted when Palpatine unleashes the Chrysalides; Rancors mutated by Sith alchemy into crazed, nigh-invulnerable dervishes of destruction. The Rebel force is decimated, and only rescued at the last moment by a force of smugglers led by Salla Zend and Shug Ninx."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were allowed to escape by the Emperor, who was secretly tracking them, planning to destroy their destination with the now ready Galaxy Gun.

Han Solo and Princess Leia then take refuge with their infant twins on the planet New Alderaan. There, Luke explains about a great Jedi power known as battle meditation. They plan to regroup with Lando and Wedge...if they were still alive. Han and Chewbacca left the planet to search for them. During the night, Luke had a terrible nightmare that he and Darth Vader were one. Little did he know that robotic bugs were injecting poison into his veins. He woke up and saw two darksiders ready to kill him. Jem Ysanna and Leia defeated the two darksiders, but Jem was killed.

Thankfully, Han arrived with Salla, Shug and an X-wing battle group based in a nearby system.
