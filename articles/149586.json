They had two heads, each head having its own personality and temperament. Both heads shared the same awareness, therefore they were very alert and observant. Troigs were a very clever and curious species, able to learn many languages and produced plenty of great scientists. Both heads of a Troig had individual names but they could be combined for clarity. For example, the great podracing announcer Fodesinbeed was an amalgamation of the two heads, Fode and Beed. Fode and Beed provided commentary on the sport in two different languages. Their natural habitat was forest or jungle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
