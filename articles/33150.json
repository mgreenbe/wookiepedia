He cheated to stay away from his wife, the Duchess of Dargul, Mistal; even in that venture he cheated, he used his computer skills to make himself the perfect choice for the Duchess. Though he was caught cheating on Umgul by Lando Calrissian, which was a crime punishable by death on Umgul, he willingly chose to return to the Duchess over death (although it appeared to be a close decision). He along with the Duchess attended the playing of the Cathedral of Winds on Vortex as invited dignitaries (he clearly resented his position as her consort)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
