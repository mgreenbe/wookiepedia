Several meters long and over a meter wide, the serpents were carnivorous, despite the apparent lack of other life on the moon. According to local myths, a goddess had banished the serpents to the planets' moons. During the Eiram\u2013E'ronoh crisis, three Jedi\u2014the Jedi Master Laret Soveral and the Padawans Orla Jareni and Cohmac Vitus\u2014encountered numerous serpents while traversing the moon's caves in search for the monarchs of Eiram and E'ronoh, who had been taken hostage by the Directorate. Vitus's own master, Simmix, had instructed him to read up on the legends, though he had only skimmed through the readings, believing that they would not be of use. After killing the first serpent that attacked them, Vitus saw a faint resemblance between the creature and his Fillithar master, who had been killed when their T-1 shuttle crashed onto the moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
