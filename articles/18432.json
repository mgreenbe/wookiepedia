The Mandalorian Din Djarin, who needed a place to keep his foundling, Grogu, while he himself went on a mission, dropped the foundling off in the classroom where the student was being taught. Grogu, seated next to the student, held out his hand and babbled as though to ask for a cookie. While the student refused and continued to enjoy his snack, Grogu, much to the student's surprise, used the Force to move the entire sleeve of macarons to his own desk. He then proceeded to eat the macarons, which he discovered a taste for."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Djarin returned to depart Nevarro with Grogu, the youngling took the remaining cookies with him and continued to snack on them while the Mandalorian engaged a trio of Outland TIE fighters aboard the Razor Crest. During the fight, Grogu held the macarons over his head. He later vomited some of the cookies onto his robe following the TIE fighters' destruction, having been nauseated by Djarin's piloting. Djarin hastily\u2014albeit ineffectively\u2014tried to clean up the blue vomit with a cloth, referring to the incident as \"onboard maintenance\" via comlink to Marshal Carasynthia Dune and Magistrate Greef Karga. Djarin and Karga had been discussing what they owed each other, and while Karga offered to repay the former with a drink, the Mandalorian declined, citing his need to clean up Grogu's mess."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blue macarons first appeared in \"Chapter 12: The Siege,\" the fourth episode of the second season of the live-action series The Mandalorian and the twelfth episode overall, which aired on November 19, 2020.

Done by Christian Alzmann, the concept image showed a beige cookie, while the final product was blue.

Favreau explained that property master Josh Roth discussed how the cookies would look for the episode. Favreau wanted the cookies to be blue as a homage to the blue milk from the film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Roth ended up baking macarons for the show, but instead of a traditional sandwiched macaron, he used half of the full cookie. Favreau described the flavor as that of blue raspberry.
