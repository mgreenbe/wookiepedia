Although it was heavier at six kilograms and not as manageable as standard blaster rifles, riot blasters could subdue large groups of civilians. The Subduer-9 could emit a wide cone of stun blasts, which rendered targets unconscious and made it easy to place them in binders and awaken in prison cells hours later. The cost of the Subduer-9 was 1,250 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although many considered riot blasters to be appropriate peacekeeping tools, the Galactic Empire had a reputation of unleashing them against peacefully protesting citizens without provocation on backwater worlds.
