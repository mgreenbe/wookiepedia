Stationed aboard the Harrower-class dreadnought Ziost Shadow, he learned from a captured pirate Shaedo about an upcoming Hutt bazaar on the planet Darvannis and recruited the Empire's best heroes for preventing the Hutt Cartel from acquiring more military assets. Throughout his military service to the Sphere of Laws and Justice, Orlec had become known as a bane to criminal elements throughout the Outer Rim. His patriotic stance on law and order, however, would result in two crime lords placing individual bounties on his head. In retaliation, Orlec demolished the power bases of both crime lords within weeks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
