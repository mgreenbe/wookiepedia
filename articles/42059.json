Several of these ships were stationed on the first Death Star. The shuttle had limited hyperdrive capability and generally carried a crew of six on board, with facilities to transport and maintain twelve more Human-sized patients. The shuttle was unarmed and marked as noncombat medical transport, meaning that neither the Rebel Alliance or the Empire would fire on it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One such shuttle, numbered 5537, was hijacked by Imperial defectors Celot Ratua Dil, Memah Roothes, Kornell Divini, Villian Dance, and Teela Kaarz as they escaped the Death Star before it was destroyed at the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
