Hiding in an abandoned droid factory in the badlands of the planet of Vornax, Feleen equipped himself with a personal deflector shield scavenged from an old droideka and ambushed Fett with a small army of partially scrapped war droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bantillian was quickly outsmarted and outmanoeuvred by Fett, who doused the surface of his deflector shield with oil and set it alight.

Furious at being duped, the bounty hunter cut off Bantillian's head, placing a thermal detonator in its mouth, and presenting it to Drex, whose court was destroyed in the resulting explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
