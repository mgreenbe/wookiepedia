Upon arrival, the New Republic warned them that they aren't in Imperial territory, but Titan Squadron ignored them and continued to take out the outer defenses of the platform, starting with the missile turrets. As Titan squadron began to target their shields, the outpost deployed T-65B X-wing starfighters to engage them. Two GR-75 medium transports attempted to flee but were destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the outpost's shield and turbolaser defenses were down, the Lambda shuttle Gladius arrived and docked with the outpost, deploying stormtroopers to extract Thorn. Meanwhile, Titan Squadron fought waves of A-wings and X-wings launched from the surface. As soon as Thorn was extracted, Titan Squadron escorted the shuttle out, but were blocked by a New Republic fleet of CR90 corvettes and EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates. They managed to narrowly escape just as a MC75 Star Cruiser entered to stop their retreat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Agent Thorn could not identify the exact location of Project Starhawk, she was able to discover that a New Republic convoy containing engineers was traveling from Hosnian Prime to the project's secret base, through the contested territory of Desevro, concealing themselves in a nearby debris field.
