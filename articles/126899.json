Corrun Falt learnt that the Exile had reached the restoration zone and commissioned mercenaries to prevent her from impeding on their planetside operations. But the mercenaries were also on the hunt for the Zabrak engineer Bao-Dur who allied with Surik. The four were able to defeat the mercenaries and enter their base before locating a shuttle that could take them to the planet's polar region to find their stolen vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corrun Falt learnt that Meetra Surik and her allies were en route to their restoration zone planetside and ordered the Czerka-affiliated mercenaries to keep her out from their facilities. The Exile's shuttle was shot down when an air defense tower opened fire and forced Atton Rand to crash land the shuttle that rendered them unconscious and uninjured. The engineer Bao-Dur (who collaborated with the Ithorian herd) located Surik (whom he knew from the Mandalorian Wars) and the two decided to locate the Ebon Hawk closer to the Czerka base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bao-Dur had committed sabotage acts against Czerka but was soon apprehended and imprisoned. But HK-50 droids broke into the base and revived the resting droids and defense turrets to kill the Czerka presence. Bao-Dur fled in the confusion and used his repulsor fist to disable the force field that contained him. Czerka sent two salvage teams that were killed save for one Twi'lek male while the mercenaries were tasked to hunt Bao-Dur down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skirmishes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Restoration zone"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surik and her allies first traversed the restoration zone and were forced to dispatch probe droids and mercenaries; Falt had posted extra guards throughout the zone when he learnt that Surik was heading planetside. Surik was also forced to confront and kill a Rodian and a Devaronian who escaped Citadel Station for murder when the two tried to kill Surik for the Exchange. The team were also able to disable and slip past several mines and turrets along the path that impeded their progress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was also a Twi'lek commander who tried to trap Surik with mines and her two warbots. But Surik was able to defeat the droids and the Twi'lek before she headed closer to the Czerka base where she was able to defeat over ten mercenaries and guards (where she learnt about Falt's involvement from one of the mercenaries). Bao-Dur was also able to use the computer terminal at the landing platform to determine that Surik's stolen vessel was taken to the polar region."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Czerka base"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base was primed with turrets and poisonous mines that impeded their progress for a limited time before a computer terminal allowed for them to be disabled. But sentries were also patrolling the base and were defeated. Surik and her allies were also able to meet with the Twi'lek survivor that Czerka sent to investigate the base and helped him back to the entrance so he could be retrieved. Bao-Dur suggested a shuttle in the hangar to make their escape but said that codes were needed to open the hangar; the team were able to open the hangar after defeating several droids but were in turn forced to defeat a tank droid that was roaming the hangar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surik and her allies were able to flee the base in their shuttle but the HK-50 droids were able to pinpoint where she was heading to; this enabled the droids to follow her to the polar region to shoot her vessel down with a homing missile. The droids were defeated and Surik was reunited with the Jedi Master Atris who resided in the region with the Handmaiden Sisters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
