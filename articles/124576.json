The Comet was a dingy, damp, unkempt hole of a freighter, designed to transport as many people as possible without caring for any luxuries. Recreational facilities were at an absolute minimum, although there was a viewing deck which allowed a great view of the surrounding stars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was on the flight from Lanthrym that Cermack Rustill boarded the ship. During the flight, Consolidations Unlimited attacked and disabled the ship, capturing both Cermack, and seven other passengers, taking them aboard the Tarnta's Fang. It is unknown if this ship was then destroyed, or simply left disabled in space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
