The Imperial Remnant forces, under the command of Admiral Galak Fyyar, captured the facility in order to obtain the Artusian crystals which were crucial to his project to infuse Force power into Human subjects. After Imperials took control of the facility most of the miners, who worked in the colony, were imprisoned while others were transported to Kejim research labs where they were used as test subjects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Remnant had a relatively large garrison at the facility, numbering around 300 personnel, with at least eight AT-STs and a squadron of TIE/LN starfighters supporting them. The facility was also protected by two Ion cannons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 12 ABY, the facility was infiltrated by the New Republic mercenaries Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors.
