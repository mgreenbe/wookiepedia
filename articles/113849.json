All the Rebel transports were destroyed and every member of Renegade Flight, including Ketku and \"Renegade Three\", was killed. Ironically, the capital ship design that launched the fighters that destroyed Renegade Flight was developed as a result of the Renegades' victory at Ton-Falk. A plaque commemorating the lost pilots hung on the command deck of the Rebel frigate, Chancellor, while Skywalker and Wedge Antilles expanded Rogue Flight to a full squadron to fill the gap left by the loss of the Renegades."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Wars Encyclopedia and Who's Who in Rogue Squadron place Commander Narra and Renegade Flight at the Battle of Yavin.
