Gonster of the Twin Hills used sparkle seeds to power the magic cap, a piece of clothing which could neutralize the Raich. When poured on top of the hat, the sparkle seeds activated the cap's powers. The cap could then be placed on the Raich's head to trap it as a tree."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ewoks Teebo and Latara once obtained sparkle seeds from the Gonster during the Raich's temporary return. During the final showdown with the creature, Teebo was able to put a handful of the seeds onto the cap just before Wicket Wystri Warrick placed it on the Raich's head. The addition of the seeds stopped the Raich and turned him back into a harmless tree."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
