On frontier worlds, orbaks were often domesticated for use in agriculture, transport, and occasionally warfare. Their tusks were used to uproot the grasses that they ate, and their sturdy hooves were well-adapted for uncertain terrain. They were related to other riding beasts, including pulga, fathiers, bordoks, and tris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orbaks could be tamed to become very loyal riding mounts.
