Located in the Nomad Mountains, the base was inhabited by Gramo Murah and his band of Ragtag goons. After the Battle of Yavin, Murah's goons entered into a violent conflict with another criminal organization, the Meatlumps, fanatical anti-technology thugs. Around 1 ABY, the Corellia Times reporter Vani Korr tasked a spacer to deal with the Meatlump lieutenant Strilath Farles in exchange for information about the Meatlumps. Farles wanted his revenge on the Ragtags who humiliated him and the adventurer accepted to rid him of Gramo Murah and his gang. The spacer attacked the Ragtag bunker and finally killed Gramo Murah and some of the Ragtag goons. The spacer also destroyed their stash of stolen goods."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ragtag Base was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
