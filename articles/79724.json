As Rebel Alliance pilots learned to exploit the major weaknesses of Star Destroyers, commonly called \"Trench Run Disease\", Imperial officers grew increasingly concerned over the growing relative effectiveness of these heavily armed and shielded starfighters. After the first Death Star's destruction at the Battle of Yavin by a handful of Alliance starfighters, the need for greater starfighter defense was clear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Admiral Ilon Drez proposed using the KDY Lancer-class ships to screen enemy starfighters to allow dominant Star Destroyers to pummel enemies in ship-to-ship combat. This was then approved by the Imperial Naval Command. The final iteration of the craft ran a slim 250 meters with twenty quad laser cannon batteries designed specifically for starfighter hunting. However, this came at cost of having no capital grade weaponry or shielding, leaving the ships vulnerable to other capital ships. The ship was also quite slow, allowing many fighters to simply outrun it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With a high build cost and requiring a relatively large crew of over 800, the Imperial Starfleet found the Lancer-class too expensive for full fleet deployment. A few frigates made it into various fleets, but most admirals preferred to use, and subsequently lose, their TIE starfighters as anti-starfighter options. As a result, most Lancer-class frigates, like smaller ships before them, were assigned to planetary defense and rear guard operations along with interdiction and anti-piracy patrols in the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Remnant and beyond"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was not until the emergence of Grand Admiral Thrawn in 9 ABY that Lancer-class frigates were put to good use.

While the Defense Fleet incorporated some into planetary defense fleets, most were decommissioned, although the design principles of the Lancer-class were revisited when the New Republic developed the Ranger-class gunship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moruth Doole used two Lancers to defend Kessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the New Republic recommissioned many Lancer-class frigates for use against coralskippers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
