Part of the Cold War-era Senate, Daheel played politics with his colleagues in an attempt to get justice for his people. While attempting to appear friendly with Senator Gunaray Dod, Daheel secretly detested the Neimoidian, believing him to be in league with the criminal organization Black Sun, but lacking any proof.
