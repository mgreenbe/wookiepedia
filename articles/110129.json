Skywalker was told that his new droid\u2014R3-S6\u2014was to be delivered to him. Right after R3-S6 was dropped off inside Skywalker's Venator-class Star Destroyer, he met Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, and was inspected by Tano near her master's freighter, the Twilight. When Tano introduced the astromech droid to its newly assigned owner, she attempted to relieve Skywalker's melancholy over the loss of R2-D2 by pointing out R3-S6's color scheme\u2014gold; since her master was the leader of the Republic Navy's Gold Squadron, Tano believed R3-S6 would make a good companion for the Jedi Knight.

After the Jedi spotted a Trandoshan scavenging freighter, named the Vulture's Claw, in the debris field, Skywalker docked with the freighter, and left the Twilight with R3-S6 and Tano to find R2-D2. The freighter's owner, Gha Nachkt, greeted the two Jedi, took interest in R3-S6, and offered to trade a C-14 droid for him; Tano, however, rejected his deal. With R3-S6 and Tano by his side, Skywalker told Nachkt they wanted to find his R2-series astromech droid and would pay him credits if he had R2-D2 in his ship. Having accepted Skywalker's offer, Nachkt allowed him, R3-S6, and Tano to search through his storage room.

After Skywalker and Tano destroyed the two droids, Skywalker berated R3-S6 for disobeying him. Unbeknownst to Skywalker and Tano, Nachkt overheard the two Jedi from behind a nearby door. R3-S6 opened the portal, and Skywalker pointed his lightsaber at the Trandoshan's neck and demanded that he reveal R2-D2. However, Tano insisted that R2-D2 was not on the ship. Conceding failure, the two Jedi and R3-S6 boarded the Twilight and redocked with the Resolute. Skywalker told his Padawan that he was preparing for a mission to sweep through suspected Confederate space.

The signal alerted Grievous' nearby fleet, and a group of Munificent-class frigates jumped to R3-S6's and Skywalker's location. Skywalker ordered R3-S6 to prepare to jump into hyperspace, but the droid detached the starfighter from the hyperdrive docking ring, negating their chance to escape. Eventually, Vulture droids left the frigates and attacked the starfighter, but Skywalker successfully destroyed them with his fighter's blaster cannons. When R3-S6 deactivated the blaster cannons and the starfighter's engines, more Vulture droids appeared. The droids, however, were destroyed by the timely intervention of Tano and Clone Captain CT-7567, nicknamed \"Rex,\" who both decided to help R3-S6 and Skywalker after they noticed Skywalker's tracking beacon had been activated. Tano and Rex, who were on board the Twilight, lowered the freighter's aft cargo bay door, which would allow Skywalker's starfighter to board the ship. R3-S6 reactivated the fighter's engines and enabled Skywalker to pilot the starfighter into the Twilight's aft cargo bay, and, once inside the Twilight, Skywalker and R3-S6 joined Tano and Rex inside the freighter's cockpit."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Allegiance revealed"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R2-D2 was, in fact, aboard the Vulture's Claw and sent a transmission to the Twilight.

Skywalker restored the signal's strength himself and ordered his pilot, Rex, to track the message. The trail led the group to the moon Ruusan 2. As the Twilight hovered above the discovered Confederate listening post, Skytop Station, Skywalker wanted to let Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi know of the station's presence. Skywalker ordered R3-S6 to contact Kenobi using scramble code \"1477\" and told Kenobi of his plan to rescue R2-D2 in the station with R3-S6, his Padawan, and a group of clones.

Having landed on top of the station, Skywalker cut a hole through the station's hull with his lightsaber, allowing R3-S6 and the group to enter. Inside, R3-S6 used his scomp link to access a port and bring up a holomap of the station. Skywalker ordered Tano and Rex to destroy the station's reactor core; he would separate from the group to find his lost droid. As R3-S6 and the party searched for the reactor core room, R3-S6 broke away to report to Grievous that Skywalker planned to destroy the station via hologram. R3-S6 ended his transmission with the cyborg general when Tano appeared near him, and he rejoined her and the clones. R3-S6 and the group made their way to the reactor room, which was protected by a ray shielded door.

Near a dark corridor, Tano saw R3-S6 and beckoned him to come toward her, but the droid turned on his astromech droid light and flashed it at Tano, simultaneously alerting Grievous of her location. The Padawan evaded the General's attack and hid once again. Soon, R3-S6 conferred with Grievous, a conversation Tano overheard; she realized then that R3-S6 was a Separatist spy. R3-S6 departed the storage room and found Rex and clone trooper Denal near the reactor core room where they had placed explosive charges. The trio made their way toward the station's hangar bay, only to find the rescued R2-D2 with Skywalker near the Twilight. Skywalker asked of his Padawan's whereabouts, and Rex revealed that she had engaged Grievous in a lightsaber duel.

When the Vulture droids attacked Skywalker and the clones, the Jedi Knight ordered R2-D2 to open the hangar bay's door through an astromech port in the station so that the Twilight could evacuate, and R3-S6 secretly followed R2-D2. On a catwalk, which led to the astromech port, R3-S6 slammed into the other droid, and the two engaged one another with their slicing tools. To end the brawl, R2-D2 used his shock arm, which briefly incapacitated R3-S6. The R2 unit then activated his rocket boost jets and released a stream of oil on the catwalk. R3-S6 evaded the resultant inferno, but he failed to notice R2-D2's followup attack, a full-body shove that knocked R3-S6 off the catwalk. R3-S6 used his tow cable to hang onto R2-D2 and avoid the fall, but R2-D2 severed the cord with his cutting tool. R3-S6 fell from the catwalk, collided with falling debris, and was destroyed.
