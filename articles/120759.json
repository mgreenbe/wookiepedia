Since it was not an actual spice, it was not a crime to possess it, as scarn could also be used for legal substances. In order to become a spice, it had to undergo refining and chemical manipulation to make it full-fledged scarn. It grew on Cyphar and was the center of attention in a land dispute there. Darth Maul once posed as a member of a fictitious cartel to work with the thief Zek Peiro, who he believed to be Force-sensitive, to steal shipments of scarn. In the end, Maul killed Peiro during their mission together in an attempt to sate his bloodlust for killing Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
