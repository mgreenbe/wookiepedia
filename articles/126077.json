The remnants of the original Sith Empire established a reconstituted Sith Empire in the galaxy's Unknown Regions. This Empire, was created after Sith survivors of Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow's disastrous campaign against the Galactic Republic fled known space to escape persecution by the Republic and its Jedi Order. Led by the Sith Lord Vitiate, the refugees wandered aimlessly through space in search of a new home. Twenty years after their departure from the original Empire's territory, the Sith discovered the forgotten world of Dromund Kaas and settled it to begin the process of rebuilding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the rebuilding process, Vitiate proclaimed himself to be the Dark Lord of his order and Emperor of his people. Under the care of the Emperor and his Dark Council of Sith Lords, the Empire established its capital of Kaas City and began building a mighty war machine, with the intent of eventually returning to combat with the Galactic Republic once more. The Empire worked towards that goal for over one thousand years, gradually expanding and gaining more power and influence. During that time, the Sith were discovered by Jedi Knights Revan and Malak, who were forcibly turned to the dark side of the Force by the Emperor and became Sith. Although they were sent back to serve as the vanguards of the Empire's eventual invasion, they broke free from his conditioning and formed concurrently their own Sith Empire, but the Republic defeated the two and their remnant, and knowledge of the Empire remained hidden."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around three hundred years later, the Sith Empire\u2014still under the command of Vitiate \u2014was ready to return to the greater galaxy.

Despite several setbacks in its campaign towards the core, the Empire surged forward once more, crippling the Republic economy through an alliance with the Mandalorian warrior clans. However the blockade was eventually broken by Hylo Visz, and reinforcements from the Republic which brought the war into another stalemate. After nearly 3 decades of fighting, the Empire surprised the galaxy when the Dark Council extended an offer of peace to the Republic. Desperate, the Republic senate accepted, but during peace talks on Alderaan, the Empire launched a sneak attack on the Republic capital of Coruscant. The attack was successful, allowing the Empire to force the Republic to sign their draft of the document that would end the war, the Treaty of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the war at an end and the Empire stronger than ever, the Emperor retreated from the public view and passed responsibilities of the day-to-day maintenance of the Empire to the Dark Council. As a result of the Empire's co-existence with the Republic, an interstellar Cold War emerged in the immediate aftermath of the Great War, during which time the Empire engaged in proxy battles and small conflicts with the Republic and its allies. When war did break out again, the Empire started to suffer catastrophic defeats that ranged from losing members of its leadership, including the Sith Emperor himself. Additionally, the Empire began to weaken even further due to infighting and internal struggles between power-crazed Sith Lords. It soon became just as vulnerable and desperate as the Republic it was fighting. The infighting was the turning point for the Empire when Darth Marr assumed leadership. With the help of the their most powerful allies, he was able to stabilize the Empire. Marr ensured a bright future and even organized an alliance with the Republic in dealing with threats such as Revan and Vitiate. The Emperor's Wrath was tasked with preserving the Empire and led the Empire's forces in the battle against Darth Malgus and the Dread Masters alongside Darth Marr."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 3636 BBY, the Eternal Empire invaded the rest of the galaxy, defeating both the Sith and Republic and establishing political, military, and economic control over both superpowers. During the conflict, many of the remaining members of the Dark Council were killed or otherwise disappeared under mysterious circumstances, except Darth Acina. The sudden disappearance of her rivals, such as Darth Nox and the Empire's Wrath, allowed her to seize complete control of the Empire's remnants and crown herself Empress of the Sith. Despite the new external threat, neither the Republic or the Empire would agree to officially end hostilities or discuss any sort of partnership. The earlier cooperation forged by Marr due to his reasonable leadership, though, would have a lasting legacy over the course of the decade, eventually paving way for members of the Empire to willingly join in an official alliance with Republic defectors against their common enemy. The defeat of the Eternal Empire would ultimately lead to another war between the Republic and Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Empire was defeated and its territory absorbed by the Galactic Republic, which was now the dominant superpower in the Galaxy.

When his research team found success in 4999 BBY, Vitiate then offered the people hope, calling all remaining Sith Lords to his world where he promised to aid them in completing a great piece of Sith magic that would bring about the salvation of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "More than eight thousand Sith Lords answered the call, but when they arrived at Nathema, the scholarly Vitiate dominated their minds and enslaved their wills to his own. With the others acting in concert, Vitiate then led them in performing the most powerful and complex ritual of Sith magic ever attempted: a ritual that stripped the Force itself from the entire planet of Nathema, killing every living thing on the world and transferring all of their power into Vitiate. Now immortal, Vitiate shed his name and became known solely as the Sith Emperor, and he blamed Nathema's destruction on the Republic's Jedi protectors. Gathering the remnants of the shattered Empire on Korriban, particularly those of the younger generation, the Emperor and his followers boarded a small fleet of starships and departed on a exodus to Dromund Kaas, though only he knew of their destination."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor ensured that the fleet's journey took them almost twenty years so that the people came to rely on him as their savior and ultimate leader, and he erased all hyperspace routes to Nathema and all mentions of Nathema from history beyond the name of the Ritual of Nathema, which Imperial scholars later celebrated as one of the greatest achievements of the old empire. When they finally reached Dromund Kaas in 4980 BBY, the Emperor addressed his people as they gathered before his throne on the jungle surface, and he declared a reconstituted empire that would one day return to the galaxy and gain their revenge against the Republic for the destruction of their civilization.

Vaiken's forces battled terentateks and other fearsome creatures in their efforts, and the Empire's records made note of the fact that Vaiken slew a terentatek single-handedly on the site of the future government citadel. With Vaiken's success, the settlers set about building Kaas City and the Imperial Citadel, which they based on the original Great Citadel of the Old Empire on the planet Ziost and the Sith Academy on Korriban.

The people of the Empire completed an expansion of the Temple on the Emperor's orders while also working on Kaas City, and after it was completed, the Sith ruler used it as both a storehouse for powerful artifacts and as a tomb for his enemies. The Emperor conducted a number of Sith magic rituals in the early years of the Empire, and the Sith magic affected Dromund Kaas's atmosphere, generating a near-constant cloud cover and causing powerful thunderstorms as the world became permanently storm-wracked. His experiments also generated a powerful dark side Force nexus within the Dark Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early in the Empire's history, the members of the Dark Council each chose an area of the Empire's society and government as their sphere of influence. Darth Zavakon, who chose the recovery and study of ancient knowledge, came to realize that the Empire was suffering because his fellow Sith were unwilling to share the knowledge and secrets they discovered in Sith ruins and tombs. Zavakon therefore conducted an experiment where he dispatched a team of archaeologists and military officers to investigate ruins that other Sith had already surveyed. Zavakon's team made significant discoveries that the Sith had missed, as they had not compared their findings like the archaeologists, and the team's success led the Dark Council to authorize Zavakon to form the Imperial Reclamation Service\u2014a branch of the Imperial Military devoted to the recovery and preservation of knowledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having secured their new homeworld, Odile Vaiken set about laying the foundations for the Imperial Navy, though he knew it would take centuries to complete.

Vaiken lived long enough to see the production of the first of his newly-designed Star Destroyers, and Vaiken's achievements earned him the title of Grand Moff from the Emperor himself. In the years afterward, Vaiken led the Empire's first campaigns out from Dromund Kaas to conquer alien societies and worlds around the capital, though he was killed during one such mission in 4904 BBY. Vaiken was fondly remembered by the Empire centuries after his death, with the Imperial Navy naming their staging area Vaiken Spacedock and the Imperial Military using his training methods for centuries afterwards, and an eternally-burning flame known as Vaiken's Torch was lit in the jungles of Dromund Kaas to symbolize the Empire's undying dedication to their revenge on the Republic.

As the centuries passed, other cities were built across Dromund Kaas and came to cover much of the planet, though stretches of untamed and dangerous wilderness remained, and the Imperials developed lightning spires\u2014towers that converted lightning strikes into energy\u2014to power their cities and take advantage of Dromund Kaas's constant storms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several centuries into the Emperor's reign, a Dark Councilor named Darth Lokess summoned her fellow Councilors to a secret meeting in the middle of one of Dromund Kaas's many violent storms.

However, the Emperor somehow learned of their plot, and as the twelve ascended the steps of the Citadel with the intention of confronting the Emperor, he acted: Lokess's co-conspirators died in a flash of light, and Lokess was whisked into the bowels of the Citadel where she was tortured and ultimately killed by the Sith ruler as a warning to those who would challenge him. Less than four centuries after the Great Hyperspace War, the Sith Lord Vodal Kressh attempted to challenge the Emperor's rule with an army of slaves that he had bred on the planet Athiss.

Not long afterwards, around 3978 BBY, the Emperor decided to test the Republic by sending a Sith emissary to Mandalore the Ultimate, the leader of the Mandalorian warrior culture, though the rest of the Empire was unaware of his actions. On the Emperor's orders, the Sith manipulated Mandalore's mind, convincing him to wage war on the Republic as a way for the Emperor to test the Republic's martial strength.

In 3756 BBY, Barel Ovair was tasked with an important mission by the Emperor to prepare the way for an eventual invasion of the Republic by first eliminating any potential enemies that might stand in the Sith Empire's way. This included an ambitious mission to the tomb of Naga Sadow on Yavin 4 in order to slay the Sith spirit that resided there to prevent it from interfering in the Emperor's plans.

As they approached and beamed their reports back to Republic space, the Sith warships fired and utterly destroyed the lightly armed diplomatic team.

However, the worlds of Sernpidal, Belkadan and Ruuria turned against the Republic whereupon they revealed their true allegiance to the Sith Empire. The Republic fleet was thus caught in-between the enemy forces and was devastated leading to what few remaining vessels to flee the battle. This shifted the movement of the early part of the war to the Sith's favor as the departure of the enemy fleet meant that many regions were now left uncontested. This allowed the Sith Empire to seize the Minos Cluster thus gaining its rich resources, conduct a strike against the Sluis Van Shipyards which destroyed it and cut off the Rimma Trade Route.

To that end, he opted to extend an olive branch to the Galactic Republic.

One of the casualties of this attack was the loss of the Jedi Temple and the capture of the Senate Tower thus allowing the Sith to hold the entire world hostage.

This would lead to the Empire quickly snatching them up, seeing as, even though the acquisition of those certain planets were not within the terms of the agreement, the Republic was far too weak to stop the increasing Imperial war machine. With entire star systems at the mercy of the Sith as far deep as the Inner Rim, the Republic scaled back on its previously aggressive stances as to not aggravate the growing Empire.

For nearly a decade, the Empire conducted espionage against the Republic, learning many of their secrets, with Imperial Intelligence becoming one of, if not the most, significant bureaucracy in the Empire. Although no official engagements occurred between both governments, a series of bloody proxy wars broke out across the galaxy on what were seen as being primarily contested worlds, such as Balmorra, Alderaan, and Ord Mantell. That aside, there were several instances in which elements from each faction engaged one another, although those were generally limited to small-scale skirmishes between independent operatives working alone, special forces, Jedi, and Sith. Despite the hostility between both factions, there was limited cooperation between several leaders on both sides, which often led to uneasy collaboration on rare circumstances. One such example was a combined effort to stop a droid army from unleashing a contagion on the galaxy, upon which they launched an orbital invasion on the remote world of Sebaddon. Although the brief and fatal alliance fell apart in the end, also resulting in the death of Sith commander Darth Chratis, it would not be the last collaboration between the two nations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the treaty, the Emperor gradually became more and more reclusive, eventually turning over complete political control of the Empire to the Dark Council.
