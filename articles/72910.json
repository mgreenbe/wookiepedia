The droid consisted of a block-like body with blue and red plating, and had a raisable hydraulic platform attached by two rods to the top of its body. The platform was also attached to the body by several wires and had an articulated lamp at one end."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35 ABY, a K1-RF workbench droid was set up in the aisle between two shelves of droid parts in the workshop of the droidsmith Babu Frik in the Thieves' Quarter of Kijimi City on the planet Kijimi. The Resistance agents Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron had to be careful not to lean against the workbench droid when they visited the workshop to have a complete redacted memory bypass performed on the protocol droid C-3PO, although Rey did lean her quarterstaff against it. Shortly after the group's visit, the workshop was destroyed when the Final Order obliterated all of Kijimi, although Frik managed to escape beforehand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A K1-RF workbench droid first appeared in the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker and was visible in the final trailer released prior to the film.
