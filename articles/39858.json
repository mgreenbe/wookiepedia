They were large, aggressive-looking humanoids with chin horns, sharp claws, and thick skin that were commonly brown in color and had poor eyesight but superior senses of hearing and smell. Capable of living hundreds of years, Dowutins never stopped growing and by their fifth century were typically so massive that their loud footsteps and voices warned other species away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dowutin species was native to the frigid Core Worlds planet of Dowut near the Unknown Regions and spoke the Dowuta language. Young Dowutins were forced to fend for themselves from an early age. Because of this, those who quickly learned hunting skills survived. Their size and strength made them prized as hired muscle, but most Dowutins' pride dissuaded them from such work, as they viewed other species as weak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dowutins were known for their mercenaries.
