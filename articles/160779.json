It was manufactured by Greel Wood Logging Corporation and used mostly in construction works and to cut down greel trees and other large vegetation. It was also used to breach hulls and bulkheads during boarding actions by military and pirate forces. The vibrosaw was difficult to wield properly as a weapon because it was so large and cumbersome, however, some individuals such as Xenon Nnaksta made effective use of them in melee combat. Since the vibrosaw was viewed as a tool, it was legal to own one and not as restricted as other vibroweapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
