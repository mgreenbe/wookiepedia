They countered Imperial Rapid Repetition Defense Measures by altering its own primary coding sequence, rewriting portions of itself to avoid detection. This causes the spike to deteriorate, meaning it was only useful for one application. MicroThrust computer spikes were packaged in a tough, plasteel casing with a computer interface port allowing connection to a portable computer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Models"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
