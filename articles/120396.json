She finally managed to escape them, and hid in the cargo bay of the Ebon Hawk, which had landed at the Jedi Enclave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While at the Enclave, Revan met Lur Arka Sulas, who was searching for the girl on behalf of her parents.

The dialect that Revan learns from Sasha is unrelated to the one created by Karen Traviss. There is a glitch involving Sasha in KOTOR which allows the player to get unlimited dark side points. The player must simply tell Sasha to leave, then talk to her before she does and again tell her to leave. This gives the player more dark side points than would normally be given without exploiting this glitch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
