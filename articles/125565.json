However, silicon could only bond with two other atoms, whereas carbon could bond with up to four other atoms at once, and was therefore able to form long molecular chains and rings, the backbones of organic molecules. Because of the limitations of silicon, silicon-based lifeforms were extremely rare."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Silicon was the base element for vacuum-breathing species like the space slugs and mynocks and the mineral lifeform rainbow gems and Shards.

The research facility on Q'Maere, headed by the Qektoth Confederation scientist Drigor Tarrens, was known to conduct experiments with silicon biology. However, these experiments failed, and the facility was left to be managed by students of the University of Sanbra."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
