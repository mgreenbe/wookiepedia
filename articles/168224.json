Several conveyor belts were used in the cafe as makeshift tables, which could seat up to twenty patrons at a time. The restaurant was owned by the Kubaz chef Zerwirr, who had been disappointed with the low volume of business in his establishment. However, despite the lack of competition, most customers elected to cook at home, owing to the Kubaz predilection for serving insects as a delicacy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zerwirr's Cafe was introduced in the 2016 Fantasy Flight Games adventure book Friends Like These as part of the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
