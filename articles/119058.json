However, Anor betrayed them and sabotaged the hyperdrive of the living world of Zonama Sekot, causing massive amounts of energy to build up in the hyperdrive. Despite this, the energy buildup did not result in the devastating explosion Anor wanted, as Zonama Sekot funneled the energy into a blind hyperspace jump."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
