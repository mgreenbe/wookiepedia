Freyyr was indeed feral by the time they met him and, not recognizing the ex-Jedi Jolee Bindo who had helped him to escape slavery at the hands of the Czerka Corporation, attacked them both.

Bacca's Ceremonial Blade was a sacred relic to the Wookiees and the symbol of authority for all chieftains since Bacca himself. With the blade in their possession Freyyr, Revan and his companions ascended back to the village, after a brief confrontation with some of Chuundar's lackeys, and then led a revolt against Chuundar and his backers, the Czerka Corporation, killing Chuundar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Freyyr once again became chieftain of the village, and upon his son's request, gave Zaalbar the blade in gratitude and as a sign of repentance for exiling him years before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the alternative dark side ending, Revan can kill him and help Chuundar.
