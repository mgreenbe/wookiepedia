At young age, he became interested in Nova Blades pirates that have settled in Rishi, believing them to eventually become aggressive. Arankau studied them and when they finally attacked, led dozens of Rishii against them, non-lethally wounding every one of the pirates. The Nova Blades never bothered Rishii again, nor did Arankau have to fight. In 3637 BBY he welcomed Jakarro, Lana Beniko and their companion to a Rishii village on the Sky Ridge Island."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
