Often cited by film purists, this phrase more specifically refers to a change made to the A New Hope Special Edition, in the scene involving the characters Han Solo and Greedo in the cantina. In the original version, after Greedo says, \"I've been looking forward to this moment for a long time,\" Han replies, \"Yes, I bet you have\" and shoots Greedo under the table while Greedo is pointing a blaster at him. (Thus, Han didn't merely shoot first; he was the only one who fired.)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Special Edition, Greedo shoots at Han and misses, without explanation, from point-blank range, and then Han shoots him. Later, it was altered again to have Han and Greedo shooting at almost the same time (though Greedo still shoots first), with Han dodging out of the way of Greedo's shot. With such a short time between each shot, it could be assumed that Han was already planning to shoot Greedo, rather than reacting to Greedo's shot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The principal objection from critics seems to be that the change dilutes and compromises Han's rebellious and ruthless nature. The change is felt to detract from Han's antiheroic qualities, and diminishes the character's growth and development over the story from a Machiavellian smuggler who cares only about himself (and his co-pilot Chewbacca) into a committed member of the Rebel Alliance fighting to bring freedom to the galaxy, as his shot is clearly in self-defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A secondary objection considers the improbability that Greedo would miss at that range if he fired deliberately. Thus, his gun must have discharged accidentally, a rather unromantic death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This retroactive sanitizing was loosely paralleled in a 2002 DVD version of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, in which the firearms held by police officers in the original 1982 film were digitally altered to two-way radios."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although fan criticism of \"Greedo shot first\" is generally considered to be a legitimate point of view, the incident also provided early inspiration (and ongoing ammunition) for those who engage in verbal attacks on George Lucas, a practice known as \"Lucas bashing.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The scene in various media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In the scripts"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The January 15, 1976 script portrays the scene thus:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "HAN\nYes, I'll bet you have."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of light.

When Solo states \"Over my dead body!,\" Greedo draws his own blaster, points it at Han's heart and replies, \"That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.\" Solo replies, \"Yeah. I'll bet you have.\" The narration then says that \"Greedo disappeared in a blinding flash of white light as Han pulled the trigger. The thump as Greedo's body slumped onto the table made the other cantina patrons look over.\" There is no mention of Greedo having fired a shot.

This ambiguity, along with viewers' desire for Han Solo to be a cold-blooded killer, caused the audience to draw the wrong conclusions; that is, they only thought Han shot first. Wide shots he added in later releases of the film served to make the actual results of the encounter more obvious. The suggestion, coming several years after the first occurrence of the alleged \"change,\" appears to contradict the film's script and other evidence suggesting that Greedo originally did not fire at Han."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Repercussions in Star Wars media"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Other mentions"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Reception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like most revised changes to the Star Wars original trilogy, the alteration of the Han/Greedo scene proved to be controversial not only for fans, but including some of the filmmakers.
