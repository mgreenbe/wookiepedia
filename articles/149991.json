This usually happened by docking with the structure or with the use of tractor beams. Capital ships used tugs to load and unload cargo containers. Tugs could be equipped with hyperdrives, like the Heavy Lifter, but were more frequently without. Likewise, tugs were usually unarmed, but variants with weapon-equipped models existed as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
