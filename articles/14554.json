However, Kanos\u2014in full Royal Guard armor\u2014leapt into combat, killing scores of Imperials and turning the tide of battle, even saving Sinn when a TIE interceptor was about to kill her.

Commander Mirith Sinn, the head of New Republic operations on Phaeda, contacted New Republic High Command and ensured that support would be incoming. Rogue Squadron, piloting a collection of E-wings and B-wings, dropped out of hyperspace and engaged the Steadfast's complement of TIE fighters at over 2-1 odds, their first mission since they had been reorganized into a multi-fighter unit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Sinn climbed onto a captured Skipray Blastboat and joined the fight in orbit, however, General Wedge Antilles entered the system in the Super Star Destroyer Lusankya, forcing the surrender of Vivant's forces.
