Since garbage chute sensors identify types of waste and direct them to the right compactor, Luke, Han, Leia, and Chewbacca ended up in recyclable waste owing to their armor and weapons. Once inside, they were unable to leave because the door was magnetically sealed, preventing blaster bolts from penetrating. A dianoga attacked and almost killed Skywalker when it took him underwater. When the creature released Skywalker, the walls began to rumble and edge toward each other, threatening to crush the companions trapped inside the masher. However, they were saved when C-3PO, Skywalker's protocol droid, managed to have all the garbage mashers on the Detention Level shut down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thirty-four years later, during the Battle of Starkiller Base, Solo asked Finn, a former First Order stormtrooper who had sanitation duties at the base, if the location happened to have trash compactors.
