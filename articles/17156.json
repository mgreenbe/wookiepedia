The gel was heated, and continued to burn until frozen in the vacuum of space, or burnt up in an atmosphere. When attached to the hull or shields of a vessel, the gel attempted to burn through the obstruction to inflict damage on the target. By remodulating a ship's shields, pilots were able to force the gel to detach."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
