A Star Tours-owned StarSpeeder 1000, having escaped from an Imperial-conducted raid at Spaceport THX1138, eventually got involved in the conflict while attempting to safely deliver a Rebel spy to his allies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, several Lucrehulk-class battleships were sent to Naboo, which resulted in various Rebel-affiliated Nabooians deciding to attack them in space with N-1 starfighters. . The Luchrehulk-class ships then unleashed several Vulture droid starfighters to attack the N-1 squadrons. Shortly thereafter, a Star Tours-owned StarSpeeder 1000 carrying a Rebel spy had arrived at the battleground via hyperspace. Some of the fighters then broke off from the battle to escort the ship down to the hangar, but they were pursued by Vulture droids, with the escort soon shot down. The StarSpeeder 1000, however, ended up going into the water to evade capture, eventually arriving at the Naboo Rebel hangar after traversing the Naboo core, although not without making a forced crash landing that resulted in a N-1 starfighter tail either piercing the cockpit or only tapping it and provoking a startled Pit Droid into throwing paint on the cockpit window."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mission is based on a scenario from the ride Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, which featured the use of the StarSpeeder 1000 ST-1401. Because of the nature of the ride, the skirmish over Naboo is issued randomly, although it is always the last portion of the ride. In large part because of the random nature of the ride, the StarSpeeder 1000's flight number is not given in the article."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle is similar to the Naboo Space Battle nearing the end of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, and was likely developed as an homage to it. It is unknown who owned the Lucrehulk-class battleships, although the time period the ride took place (1 BBY-0 BBY) rules out the Trade Federation or the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the attraction was first produced, two alternate gags for the Naboo sequence were created to add extra variation to the experience: The Starspeeder crashing into Jar Jar Binks when traveling through the Gungan city and a Pit Droid throwing paint onto the Starspeeder instead of the N-1 Starfighter piercing the window. These wouldn't be activated until 2015 when the attraction received an update based around Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
