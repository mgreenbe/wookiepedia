They were used as a form of electronic warfare by severely hindering enemy sensors and targeting computers, as well as blocking all communications in the given area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hundreds of such devices were present on the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin, forcing Rebel pilots to visually scan their targets from within the cockpit. Presumably the 220-SIG did not interfere with the sensors and targeting computers on the craft it had been installed on, as the Death Star's turbolasers targeting and sensor arrays were unaffected."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
