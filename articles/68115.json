At some point during that year, Gumb worked for Haugg Nerf Industries, a death stick distributor disguised as a nerf-packaging plant, owned by an individual known as Groff Haugg. The facility was located in the Industrial District of the Republic's capital planet of Coruscant. While working at Haugg Nerf, Gumb received a bounty on his head for rigging the deck in a high-stakes sabacc match by using a skifter. An anonymous source offered a reward of 2,500 credits if Gumb was captured alive and 1,250 credits if he was simply killed. The bounty listed Gumb's last known location as the Coruscant Entertainment District. During the same year, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett infiltrated Haugg Nerf Industries while searching for information that would help him in his hunt for the five million credit bounty on Komari Vosa, a former Jedi and the leader of a secretive criminal cult known as the Bando Gora, which was rumored to be behind a large increase in death stick demand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his infiltration of Haugg Nerf, Fett found Gumb near a control panel and captured him alive, claiming the bounty placed on the Guineo's head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like many Guineo, J'Meeb Gumb had hairless, pale yellow skin, and stood over two meters in height.

In the game, Gumb is one of five bounties located in the Industrial District, which is the second level on the game's second world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Bounty Hunter, the player controls Jango Fett, and since claiming Gumb's bounty is not essential to the game, the player has several ways to go about doing so. The player can ignore Gumb entirely, kill him and not claim the bounty, kill him and claim the bounty, or capture him and claim the bounty. This article assumes that Fett captured Gumb alive, as doing so gives Fett the maximum reward possible. J'Meeb Gumb's name is similar to the fictional serial killer Jame Gumb, who was the primary antagonist of the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, which was based on a novel of the same name."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
