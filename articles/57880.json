They were equipped with a mechanical reservoir that acted as a second heart, injecting a secret combination of chemicals into the soldiers' bloodstream, giving them a boost of speed and aggression. They communicated via high frequency data streams transmitted from the central disk in their faceplates. Soldiers were armed with the latest black market technology, such as the Tostovin Munitions percussive cannon, carried by Bala-Tik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Guavian Death Gang was chased out of the Core Worlds by their fellow criminals, unwilling to conduct their business alongside the ruthless cabal. After their ascendency as a major criminal organization, they gained a reputation for coercion.

They were accompanied by Kanjiklub when they threatened Han Solo and expressed their impatience with him and his endless excuses, after Solo delayed on repaying them the 50,000 credits he foolishly borrowed. When Bala-Tik recognized BB-8, he told Solo that the First Order was looking for the droid and for the fugitives Finn and Rey. Upon hearing this, Rey thought of activating the blast doors on either side of Han and Chewbacca to trap both the gangs, but she activated the wrong doors, releasing the three rathtars Han Solo was keeping on his freighter instead. The rathtars devoured most of the Guavian Death Gang and Kanjiklub, leaving only Bala-Tik and possibly a few other soldiers. During the battle, Han Solo and Chewbacca escaped on the Millennium Falcon with BB-8, Rey, and Finn. Bala-Tik then contacted the First Order and told them that BB-8 was on the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Open warfare"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war between the First Order and the Resistance, the Colossus intruded into Guavian Death Space while hiding from the First Order, and as such was involved in a skirmish against Guavian starships, although the Colossus managed to escape after the Ace Squadron engaged the Guavian fighter ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Guavian Death Gang was developed for the saga film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
