It described several prominent sentient species of the galaxy, and was written under the patronage of Darth Vader and Lieutenant Pandur, the Imperial Liaison Officer to Korfo II. Unfortunately, the work was rife with Imperial propaganda, and thus not completely reliable; for instance, longstanding non-Human members of the Galactic Republic such as the Mon Calamari and Columi were said in the work to have only recently been discovered by the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rin's high expenses during the production of this article earned Rin the scrutiny of Major Herrit of Imperial Intelligence. In turn, Herrit's complaints earned him a new assignment: obtaining a Duinuogwuin corpse for Rin's studies. Herrit died in the course of this mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime afterwards, Obo Rin wrote Catalog of Intelligent Life in the Galaxy, Revised Edition, containing most of the same material, together with changes suggested by Lieutenant Pandur.
