Due to the high Imperial presence, available preys offered low bounties, and Skorr began considering looking for job elsewhere. However, just then, Gribbet noticed a group of newcomers, including Han Solo and partners Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, who had stopped on Ord Mantell to repair their transport, Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skorr changed his mind, tempted by the reward Jabba Desilijic Tiure offered for Solo's life.

Solo understood he needed a plan. First, he left the Falcon, empty, on the dock, but preheating her engines, so that Skorr could believe Chewbacca was there. However, Chewbacca would go to the meeting point with another transport, one with a tractor beam to pick up Solo and his friends."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skorr asked Gribbet for the exact place where the Falcon was, and believed that Chewbacca was there.

He and Solo took the probe from the saber. Under Organa's idea, they placed the probe on a escape pod, and threw it to a Imperial-controlled area. Skorr chased the pod and, when he understood his mistake, his ship was trapped by the Imperial flagship's tractor beam. The Admiral decided that these prisoners would be an example for others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gribbet was never heard of again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
