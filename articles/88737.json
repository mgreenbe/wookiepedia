Inside the halls, different plaques contained the combatants' ashes, as well as a holographic message which could be played back at any time. These holograms would often spread the cause of the respective group, and reveal past exploits as well as the family of the warrior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battles had a heavy impact on the rest of Melida/Daan: Hospitals and clinics often did not have enough supplies or material to provide healthcare, there was a general lack of food, and economics on the planet consisted of constructing, manufacturing, and distributing new weaponry to the conflicting sides. Around 44 BBY, much of the middle generation was dead, due to the immense battles which took place, killing those combatants old enough and willing to fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Melida/Daan Civil War ended when the Young forced a surrender from the Elders.
