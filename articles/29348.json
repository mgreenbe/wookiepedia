This Star Destroyer was part of a flotilla including Commodore Idel's Star Destroyer and Captain Shan's Star Destroyer which attempted to recover Emperor Palpatine's stolen yacht Imperialis. During the pursuit, both Conro and Shan's ships locked their tractor beams onto the Imperialis. However, Lando Calrissian drew Conro's tractor beam onto Shan's ship, causing the two vessels to collide. This allowed Calrissian and his team to escape with the Imperialis into deep space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
