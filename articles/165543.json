In 0 ABY, at the time of the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Xad was on the space station StarForge Station, located in the StarForge Nebula. That year, the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Far Orbit docked at the station, and Xad applied for a berth on the ship in response to a call for new crew members to crew the vessel; the Far Orbit was a new privateering vessel for the Alliance after some of its crew had mutinied out from under Imperial control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike most of his species, Xad was curious about the galaxy; that curiosity also led him into multiple fights and scrapes. Xad was a cold-hearted, natural predator, and he possessed a sharp mind and wit. The Falleen also had many qualities that Humans found noble. As a Falleen, Xad could use pheromones to his advantage, and he could breathe underwater for up to twelve hours. At some point in time, he wore a shirt with a ruff around his neck and carried a sword. The Falleen also owned a blaster pistol and a Deck Sweeper stun blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xad first appeared in Preparing for War, an adventure idea from 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication, Pirates & Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the privateering vessel Far Orbit.
