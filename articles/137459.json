The handle was hollowed out which allowed for the storage of very small items used for survival like a fire rod, a short length of wire, or an energy cell. It also had a built-in digital compass. The survival knife was used by explorers and issued to military pilots in case they were shot down and survived their vehicles' destruction and needed to survive in a hostile environment. Like the combat knife, the survival knife was crafted so that it could be used effectively as a thrown weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounty hunter Boba Fett used a survival knife."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
