After Lando Calrissian recovered one of his trinkets, Toren coerced the smuggler into stealing the Emperor Palpatine's personal yacht Imperialis in order to pay off the rest of his debt. By the time of the New Republic, Toren and his Ximpi were imprisoned at Megalox prison on the planet Megalox Beta. In an unsuccessful bid to escape the prison, Toren agreed to help the First Order Agent Terex kill the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron and his Black Squadron and to storm Grakkus the Hutt's fortress. This plot failed, and Terex abandoned Toren and his fellow gangsters to die under the weight of Megalox Beta's heavy atmosphere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point Papa Toren arranged for an array of gifts to be given to Grakkus the Hutt.

Toren then got the smuggler Lando Calrissian to recover the trinket from Ssaria as a means of repaying his debt. However, Toren reneged on his deal and told Calrissian that only ten percent of his debt had been eliminated. To repay the rest of the debt, Toren hired Calrissian to steal the Imperialis, Emperor Palpatine's pleasure craft. Toren told Calrissian that all he wanted was the craft and that Calrissian could keep the craft's contents.

Using stealth suits provided by Toren, they infiltrated the Sienar Fleet Systems Orbital Shipyard CC-24 and stole the yacht. After being pursued by a squadron of Imperial Star Destroyers, Lando and his crew discovered the ship's true identity and its Sith treasures.. Aleksin and Pavol were corrupted by a Sith mask aboard the ship and turned on the other crew.
