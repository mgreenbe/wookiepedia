In the aftermath of Admiral Natasi Daala's unification of the Imperial Remnant, the Dominion was left abandoned at Deep 3, one of Harrsk's shipyards, with the Star Dreadnought Megador. In 12 ABY, during his survey of Imperial armories in the Deep Core, Imperial officer Gilad Pellaeon stumbled upon Deep 3 and procured both Star Dreadnoughts for the Imperial Remnant's war against the New Republic.

In 41 ABY, at the height of the Second Galactic Civil War, the Dominion was designated as the flagship of the Remnant's invasion fleet that attacked the Roche asteroid field.
