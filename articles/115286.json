They were among the first units on the planet, and spearheaded the attack into Umbaran territory. After the legion completed the landing phase of the invasion, they were forced to repel attacks from Umbaran militia, including a well-placed millicreep droid, with the combined efforts claiming the lives of numerous clone troopers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ambush"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the 501st gained a foothold on the planet, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, who had been leading the legion until that point, was relieved and ordered to return to the Republic capital of Coruscant. The 501st's leader was subsequently replaced by Jedi General Pong Krell, a Besalisk known for his high success rate in battle, but at an astonishingly high casualty rate. Shortly after taking command, Krell ordered the platoon, to march down the main road in an attempt to reach the Umbaran capital city as fast as possible, a decision that was looked upon as near suicide due to the likelihood of traps and ambushes from the Umbaran militia, which was highly active in the area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" protested the order, he resignedly led the platoon into battle. Before the platoon were able to make contact with enemy forces, they lost two soldiers to land mines placed by the insurgency.

Although Rex suggested that the legion should send recon units out to provide intelligence regarding terrain and the enemy defenses, Krell ordered that the entire legion into a frontal attack. This command was met with some resistance from the already beleaguered clone troopers, especially from Advanced Recon Commando trooper CT-5555, nicknamed \"Fives.\" His dissent was backed by other members of the 501st, but Captain Rex curtly told his friend and comrade that, as soldiers, expected to follow orders\u2014even when they were bordering on suicide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 501st, led by members of the platoon, marched into tentatively into the Confederacy-occupied territory. As expected, the 501st\u2014including Rex's platoon\u2014was attacked by Umbaran Impeding Assault Tanks, which emerged from underground ambush locations to attack the troopers. Significant casualties were sustained by the legion before troopers eventually lured the tanks into a narrow kill zone, enabling troopers armed with RPS-6 rocket launchers and thermal detonators. The clones continued moving forward, executing Umbaran survivors as they moved. However, their victory was short-lived, as Umbaran reinforcements arrived, this time equipped with spider cannons, which were impervious to blaster or rocket fire. The 501st was pushed back once again and was forced to leave behind dead and injured troopers, much to the chagrin of the platoon medic, CT-6116 \"Kix.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the 501st was in no position to repel the Umbaran attack, Krell ordered the clones to continue the assault, disregarding the horrendous losses being sustained. In a desperate attempt to destroy the tanks, Rex authorized troopers Hardcase and Fives, both members under his platoon under his direct command, to infiltrate the airbase\u2014a mission that they had been specifically ordered not to attempt. Their mission was successful, and they were able to commandeer two Umbaran starfighters, which they subsequently utilized to strafe the Umbaran tanks, destroying them and enabling the main 501st force to finally capture the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex's platoon first appeared, albeit unnamed, in the seventh episode of Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season Four, titled \"Darkness on Umbara,\" which was released on October 28 2011.
