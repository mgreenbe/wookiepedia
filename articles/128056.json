A noted lightsaber virtuoso\u2014described even as \"a legend\"\u2014Antana was stationed at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant where she served as a lightsaber instructor. At the request of Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, Antana (who had also recently just become a Knight) began training Kenobi's Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, in specialized lightsaber combat. Circa 27 BBY, Antana took on Darra Thel-Tanis as her Padawan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On their first mission together, Antana and Thel-Tanis accompanied Jedi Master Ry-Gaul and his Padawan Tru Veld, Master Siri Tachi and her Padawan Ferus Olin, as well as Kenobi and Skywalker to the planet of Radnor to help with the evacuation of that world. The evacuation was due to a deadly toxin that had spread throughout the planet because of a weapons chemical leak. Antana and the other Jedi later discovered that the toxic leak was connected with the local Avoni raiders. The evidence ultimately led to Galen, a traitorous Radnoran, who was taken into custody for his crimes. The Avoni, however, escaped prosecution. During the mission, Antana was injured by a Multi-Troop Transport, but soon recovered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 24 BBY, Antana and Thel-Tanis continued to undertake assignments together, including an escort mission to Nuralee.
