The rest of the Jedi Council was concerned about Yoda's health and sanity.

However, she detected that a part of his brain was more active than normal, but deduced that it was probably due to Yoda's advanced age. Far from being reassured, Master Mundi warned Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi that the powerful bond between Yoda and Count Dooku\u2014who had been trained by the Grand Master\u2014could have allowed the Sith Lord to get into Yoda's mind and manipulate him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nema subsequently suggested to perform a deprivation ritual, so Yoda could find the answers he was looking for. It was a risky procedure that consisted in putting Yoda into a tank and progressively depriving him of oxygen. This way he would get close to death and enter a deep meditative state. During the ritual, Yoda heard Jinn's voice once more; it told him to go to the planet of Dagobah in order to complete what Jinn could not.
