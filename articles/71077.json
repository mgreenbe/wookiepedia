After concluding that there were no Jedi to be found, Rayce came back to the worlds where he had encountered these beings and began to train them in the ways of the Force, even though he was only partially trained himself.

Eventually, after giving up on locating other Jedi, Rayce refocused his determination on forming a new order, even though he himself was only partially trained.
