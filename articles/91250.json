Generals Han Solo and Lando Calrissian helped the Godoans to cure the disease, but Calrissian had fallen ill himself, and the Godoans refused to allow him to enter the sacred House of the Goddess, which contained a healing machine that would heal him. The mission resulted in a standoff between the Alliance fleet and the Godoans when Solo threatened to assault the Godoan capital, forcing the Godoans to allow treatment of Calrissian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
