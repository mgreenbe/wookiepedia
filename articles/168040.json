One of the Force techniques that Zelashiel was proficient in was the ability to drain an individual's essence, a delicate procedure that was exceedingly difficult to use in combat.

In his third series of endnotes about the book, Wallace mentioned that the character's name was created to sound similar to a theophoric Hebrew name. Wallace also noted that Zelashiel was named such so that the reader could get a sense that the character had experienced a fall from grace. The author further speculated that the character of Zelashiel either preceded the Sith King Adas or was simply a mythical legend."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
