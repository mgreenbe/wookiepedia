These weapons were often found in the hands of Rebel troops, namely those in the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original BlasTech E-11 blaster rifle was powerful and light, and nigh innumerable due to its use by the Imperial forces. However its inaccuracy and overheating were listed among the item's drawbacks. Modified by skilled BlasTech and SoroSuub armorers who defected to the Rebel Alliance, the BlasTech E-11b's main changes were the addition of expensive cooling units, making these weapons less likely to overheat at higher fire rates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The basic E-11 and modified E-11b were 438mm long with the folding stock folded, though the E-11b was usually seen extended. Unmodified, the E-11 weighed 2.6 kilograms. The power cell housing opened on the left side of the action housing, above the trigger, giving it a low profile. The original E-11's plasma gas cartridges allowed for over 500 shots, while the powercells lasted for about 100 shots, depending on setting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
