The reptavians had some level of intelligence, possibly even being semi-sentient.

Two stubby, clawed legs laid under the creature's two pairs of thin wings, with one pair situated above a much smaller pair. An azurdactyl's neck and tail were each about the same length as its body, and its twisted jaw was nearly as large as the rest of its head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The reptavians could regularly be seen flying above the canopies of Jagomir's forests.
