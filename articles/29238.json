Starships from all over the Cularin system, such as the transport Daring flocked to take part. Some were damaged by the dangerous asteroids while others ended up fighting each other over claims to newly-discovered asteroids. The Heroes of Cularin participated and they discovered an asteroid containing a survivor of the Sibilaari species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
