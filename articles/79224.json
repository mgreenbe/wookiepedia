If their droid proved successful, Industrial Automaton planned to introduce a Human-based protocol droid within two years. The LOM unit was humanoid in form, but the head, with its large, compound eyes, was structured to look familiar to such insectoid races as the Brizzits, Verpines, Gand, Yam'rii, Vuvrians, and Xi'Dec."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aside from the insectile face, the LOM protocol droid was very similar to the 3PO-series\u2014indeed, Industrial Automaton made crafty deals with companies such as SyntheTech, to use many components initially used by Cybot Galactica. Thus, the LOM-series possessed an AA-1 VerboBrain and a TranLang III communications module programmed with millions of languages; it even had a similar body frame and plating design. Such blatant use of its trademark hardware caused Cybot Galactica to file a number of lawsuits against its rival company. Though their LOM units sold well in limited release, Industrial Automaton's future plans to monopolize the protocol droid market were dashed. The exploits of the notorious bounty hunter 4-LOM did little to elevate the series' status in the eyes of the public."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
