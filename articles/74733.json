It was a small, brown, humanoid-shaped figurine. She gave it to Kazuda Xiono as a good luck charm after the pilot had apparently been cursed by the pirate Leoz, primarily as a way to help him deal with the psychological effects of him believing that he was affected by a curse. The talisman had the desired effect, with Xiono able to overcome his fear of the alleged curse, even though he had dropped the charm on a hangar floor. Afterwards, Xiono tossed the talisman in Leoz's stew and told the Nikto it was cursed, causing him to fling it away in a panic. Xiono shortly returned the object to Grey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaz's talisman first appeared in the Star Wars Resistance episode \"Kaz's Curse\".
