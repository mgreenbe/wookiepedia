It was instigated by the Gungans' Boss Lyonie's minister, Rish Loo, who influenced the Boss to seek an alliance with the Separatists. General Anakin Skywalker, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and fellow Gungan Representative Jar Jar Binks arrived to advise against the arrangements, After an attempted assassination, Lyonie was injured and Representative Binks represented the Gungan Grand Army in preparing for an attack on the Naboo with the Separatist General Grievous. He ultimately refused the arranged offer while the Gungan militia, lead by General Roos Tarpals, disabled the droid forces. Grievous was then captured by the Gungans. Count Dooku later captured Anakin Skywalker, and the two generals were subsequently freed in a prisoner exchange."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
