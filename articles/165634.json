As Fett's occasional partner, she followed him to Cato Neimoidia, shortly after Fett received a mission from Darth Vader to apprehend a renegade clone of the late Galen Marek."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Nar Shaddaa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point in time during the rise of the Galactic Empire, Xasha met a fellow bounty hunter known as Boba Fett. The two mercenaries developed an occasional partnership, and thus worked alongside each other during certain assignments. One year before the Battle of Yavin, Xasha was living with Fett in an apartment on Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While showing off a modified BlasTech Scorpion-7, a blaster that took months to repair, she hinted her interest in selling it to Fett. However, Fett merely pointed out that he was in no position to buy anything, given the virtually-bankrupt state of their economic status. Despite Fett's displeasure with their financial woes, Xasha remained optimistic and believed that their fortunes would soon take a turn for the better. Ironically, at that very moment, Fett received an incoming transmission, which he answered in another room while Xasha remained in the bedroom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While helping herself to Korriban wine, Boba Fett returned to the room began putting on his Mandalorian armor. Xasha sarcastically expressed disappointment at the prospect of Fett's departure, but Fett offered to let her work with him on his new job. Although Fett initially kept the details of his mission to himself, Xasha agreed and boarded Slave I as the pair headed to Cato Neimoidia."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cato Neimoidia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving at Cato Neimoidia, Boba Fett revealed that their assignment was to apprehend a powerful Force-sensitive target known as \"Starkiller,\" though he kept the identity of their employer a secret. Just as Xasha asked how powerful Starkiller was in the Force, the two bounty hunters gazed in awe at the city of Tarko-se, or rather what was left of it. Knowing that the destruction of the city was most likely Starkiller's handiwork, Fett and Xasha prepared to search the ruins of Tarko-se to confirm if their target was either dead or alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the two bounty hunters searched the city, it became apparent that they arrived too late to intercept Starkiller. Other than the massive tons of wreckage that composed much of what was left of Tarko-se, the only bodies that could be found were those of dead Imperial stormtroopers, which were littered all over the city. With so many dead troopers everywhere, Xasha became eager to salvage certain parts of Stormtrooper armor, believing that they would be extremely valuable on the black market. Fett forced Xasha to leave the fallen stormtroopers alone, refusing to be distracted from pursuing his mission. As the two continued their search, they eventually discovered the body of a massive creature."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Gorog"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After cautiously approaching what appeared to be the monster's fallen corpse, Xasha became filled with a great deal of doubt. The only thing that struck her with awe other than the size of the creature was the idea that Starkiller was the one who inflicted many wounds all over it before ultimately slaying the beast. When Xasha expressed her curiosity as to why Starkiller traveled to Cato Neimoidia, Fett revealed that the target was searching for a woman, which both surprised and amused Xasha. At that moment, however, the Gorog suddenly awoke and began attacking the mercenaries in a vicious rage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xasha and Fett narrowly avoided the crushing impact of its fists and attempted to keep their distance from the rampaging monster. While Xasha continued to avoid its attacks, Boba Fett quickly analyzed the creature for any vulnerabilities and discovered that it had a secondary heart, thus allowing it survive in spite of losing the first heart against Starkiller. Fett then launched his jetpack's missile at the creature and tore a hole through its torso. In a desperate act to kill the weakened creature, Fett used his jetpack to shoot straight through its backup heart, thus killing the monster."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Going Separate Ways"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Exhausted and in shock, Xasha collapsed to the ground and removed her helmet. Now fully convinced that she was too far out of her own league while on this particular mission, Xasha chose to cut her losses and walk away with her life, which Boba Fett had anticipated. She tried to persuade Fett to drop the job and leave with her, but Fett refused. Despite his refusal, Xasha expressed her fondness for their relationship and her hope that the mission would not cost Fett his life. As Xasha walked away, Boba Fett watched her leave until she was no longer in sight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boba Fett later participated in the Assault on Kamino where he assisted the Imperial forces in defending his homeworld of Kamino, particularly the Timira City Cloning Facility. As the battle escalated with Rebel forces storming the city, Boba Fett encountered a cloning technician and demanded that he remain in the facility to protect his father's legacies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the technician revealed that the clones were actually created from Boba Fett rather than his \"father,\" Jango Fett, Boba demanded to know how this was done without his knowledge. Unaware of Fett's relationship with Xasha, the technician explained that Darth Vader hired a female bounty hunter to secretly collect genetic samples from Boba Fett, as well as an imprint of Fett's brain patterns for the memory flashes used to train the clones. Fett was speechless when he discovered Xasha's duplicity and killed the cloning technician. He then proceeded to burn all of his clones while they were still being developed inside of their cloning tanks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xasha was skilled enough as a bounty hunter to develop a partnership with Boba Fett to the point where he shared his assignments with her. She possessed a sense of sarcasm, especially when it came to her flirtatious  relationship with Fett. She was also optimistic about their overall situation together, even when in times of financial despair. Like any other bounty hunter, Xasha was always concerned with the acquisition of wealth. In addition to earning credits through her career as a mercenary, Xasha was also willing to make a profit by selling items on the black market."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As reflected by her customized armor, including her desire for items that were difficult to acquire, Xasha had an interest in outdated materials and equipment that could not be sold legally in the economic market. This is reflected by the fact that her armor was composed of parts from Mandalorian and clone trooper armor, both of which had become extremely rare by the year 1 BBY. She was also not afraid to sell stormtrooper armor through illegal channels if it meant making a good profit, despite the fact that Imperial law prohibited the use of Stormtrooper equipment outside of the Imperial Military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to her partnership with Boba Fett, Xasha developed a personal relationship with him as well. Although her personality somewhat conflicted with Fett's serious demeanor, Xasha apparently possessed feelings for the clone bounty hunter. She was also not afraid of knowing when to quit a mission if the target was exceedingly superior to her. In lieu of death, Xasha chose to live rather than risk her life for the money or the sake of fulfilling a contract. She also displayed genuine concern for Boba Fett's safety, especially when she feared that his assignment to track down Starkiller could lead to Fett's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xasha's suit was similar to Boba Fett's armor, but was far more customized in comparison. Her armor was composed of various pieces belonging to at least two different sets of armor. While most of her suit seemed to be a modified version of Mandalorian armor, Xasha wore a clone trooper helmet. All of her armor was further customized by a color scheme which made the suit more distinguishable for the different sets of armor that composed it. In addition to her armor, Xasha weapons included a blaster rifle and a modified BlasTech Scorpion-7."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the first pictures of Xasha's appearance in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II comic, she wears a Phase I clone trooper helmet. However, on several further blocks of the comic, this helmet is apparently Phase II."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
