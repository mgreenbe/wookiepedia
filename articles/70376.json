While stationed at Echo Base on the snowy world of Hoth, Pugilio was asked by General Carlist Rieekan to join Rogue Group as Tenk Lenso's gunner, as post-traumatic stress prevented Lenso from gunning himself. The two fought in the Battle of Hoth as Rogue Eleven, but their snowspeeder was shot down by the Empire's Blizzard Force of AT-AT walkers. Both were among the first pilots to be killed in action."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jek Pugilio has a generic white helmet with blue rebel logos, but instead of a orange visor he has a black visor like pilots with the same helmet at the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
