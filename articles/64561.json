The planet was very icy and also had abundant natural resources. The planet also contained a ski resort on Mount Quavaar. The stohl creature, a popular guard pet, was native to Ichtor 8. The species was first discovered by Imperial scouts. Hunters were soon enamored of the inquisitive creatures, and the creatures were exported at a high price. Holovid star Shantee Ree made attack stohls fashionable.

Ree then started a Save the Stohl campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Madam Prisaal and her husband lived on this planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was the site of a battle of the Western Reaches Operation during the Imperial Reconquest of the Rim in 17 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
