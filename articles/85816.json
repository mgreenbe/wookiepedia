The massive ship was longer than four Venator-class Star Destroyers and sported massive ion cannons, capable of disabling enemy ships, mounted on both sides of its hull. The ship was first spotted by Republic forces around 22 BBY by Jedi General Ares Nune and Clone Commander Kite, who were on an inspection in the Phu system.

It was 4,845 meters long and possessed two twin ion cannons. Once fired, the wave from the cannons would expand over great distances and disable any spacecraft upon impact. After the ion cannon had disabled an enemy warship, approximately 500 turbolasers mounted on the ship's enormous hull could fire upon the disabled vessel. The vessel's power plant operated by recapturing waste heat and propulsion by-products. The design required a gigantic hull and was required to vent its stored energy on a regular basis, which was adopted to the ion cannons. A panel of experts debated the warship's size on the HoloNet News, as many predicted how large the ship was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The massive ship was designed with an internal rail jet system, which served as a hovertrain that transported ammunition, supplies, and sometimes troops throughout the ship. Its cars looked similar to the Multi-Troop Transport. Its computer systems were built with parts from KynachTech Industries. Equipped with sixteen massive sublight engines, the Malevolence also had a powerful hyperdrive, and at one point, its commander, the Confederate General Grievous, was told that the Malevolence was fast enough to outrun Republic forces. The ship carried two tractor-beam batteries that could pull any freighter or small vessel aboard one of the Malevolence's docking bays. Complementing the ship, Vulture-class droid fighters were on board to eradicate enemy fighters. At least one Droch-class boarding ship, nicknamed a \"pod hunter,\" was aboard the Malevolence, and was often deployed with rocket battle droids to seek and destroy jettisoned enemy escape pods.

When the Malevolence was launched, the operatives were captured. Count Dooku named the Malevolence meaning \"wishing evil to others.\" It served as General Grievous' flagship prior to his use of the Invisible Hand and destroyed dozens of Republic task forces, including the Galactic Republic Fourth Fleet.

Nune and Kite tried to evacuate their flagship, though the ship was doomed as the intense fire from the Malevolence progressed. After the Jedi Order received word of the new superweapon, Jedi Master Plo Koon volunteered to take several Venator-class cruisers to find and destroy the \"mystery weapon,\" as the Malevolence had been dubbed.

As the battle continued, the intense fire from the Malevolence's numerous turbolaser cannons soon engulfed the vulnerable Republic Star Destroyers. After Koon and several clones jettisoned their fleet in escape pods, Dooku ordered the battle droids to deploy the \"pod hunters\" to track down and eliminate the survivors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the last known report from Koon, Skywalker and Tano emerged from hyperspace in Skywalker's commandeered freighter, the Twilight, to look for Koon. Both Jedi noticed the large debris field the battle had produced. The pod hunters had destroyed all but Koon's pod, but Koon and his clone troopers destroyed those battle droids. Skywalker and Tano rescued Koon and the surviving clones, after which the Twilight detected the approaching Malevolence, and Koon ordered Skywalker to shut down all of the freighter's systems. However, the group left a 2-1B surgical droid active, and the Malevolence detected the Twilight. Koon, Skywalker, and Tano reactivated their ship and fled the area. Grievous ordered the ion cannon to be fired, but failed to stop the Jedi before they entered hyperspace. Thus the Republic learned of the warship and its ion cannons, and despite most of Koon's forces being eradicated, Dooku considered the battle a defeat. The Sith Lord was most displeased with Grievous' failure to prevent the Republic from learning of the warship.

After the Malevolence destroyed the small fleet, one of the frigates evaded the fire and began to escape. Grievous ordered the ship's ion cannons to be fired at the fleeing frigate.

Grievous noted that the Malevolence's hyperdrive was not fast and the warship's navicomputer was forced to recalculate its coordinates in order to go around the Kaliida Nebula. In an attempt to stop him, Skywalker and Tano retrieved brand-new BTL-B Y-wing starfighters, nimble bombers manufactured by Koensayr Manufacturing. Their squadron soon left and entered the Kaliida Nebula as a shortcut to arrive at the medcenter before the Malevolence, while High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and his fleet went around the nebula. The massive ship arrived near the medcenter and began to fire on the departing medical frigates. Upon emerging from the nebula, Skywalker led the Republic squadron to engage the Malevolence. Vulture droids were dispatched from the Malevolence and attacked the Republic group. As they engaged Skywalker's bombers, Grievous ordered the battle droids to fire the ion cannon at the approaching group. The ion wave deactivated the Vulture droids and three of Skywalker's bombers. However, the Republic squadron managed to damage the two heavy ion cannons, causing them to overload and explode and damaging the ship's hyperdrive in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Republic disabled the Malevolence, Count Dooku contacted Grievous and informed him that his master had sent a senator to the warship's location.

However, Amidala wasn't fully aware of the situation, and she and her droid were captured by the Malevolence's tractor beam, but evaded capture after destroying their ship inside the warship's hangar. Firefighting battle droids that were stationed aboard rushed to the scene of the destroyed ship and began to extinguish the flames. Skywalker and Kenobi planned a rescue and left on the Twilight to board the Malevolence through an emergency airlock. Grievous and a squad of B2 super battle droids and B1-Series battle droids soon left the bridge while Amidala contacted Skywalker via a transmission box inside the Malevolence. The senator waited until Grievous and his entourage passed by her before entering the internal rail jet room. Noticing that there were intruders, Grievous ordered the battle droids to protect the internal systems of the massive warship and to fix the hyperdrive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the internal rail jet room, battle droids began to attack Amidala and C-3PO. Skywalker and Kenobi met up with Amidala inside the room, and Skywalker rescued Amidala on a separate rail cart while Kenobi went to rescue her droid, C-3PO.

Unbeknownst to Grievous, Skywalker and Amidala entered the bridge and destroyed all stationed battle droids there. As Amidala hid the destroyed battle droids inside a storage room, Skywalker tampered with the warship's navicomputer before the two left. Grievous followed Kenobi and engaged the Jedi in a lightsaber duel, but Kenobi escaped again and met up with Skywalker, Amidala, C-3PO and R2 in the Twilight. Seeing that the battle had been lost, Grievous left the Malevolence in his personal starfighter, the Soulless One. Meanwhile, the droid crew aboard the Malevolence, believing the hyperdrive to be fixed, prepared to jump to Sector Four in Confederate space. However, the droids, who were destroyed by Skywalker and Amidala, did not contact the squad of B1 battle droids that were preparing to jump to hyperspace. The battle droids realized that the massive warship wasn't responding to the coordinates they entered and contacted Grievous. The general frantically ordered the droids to reset the navicomputer, but they failed to do so, resulting in the destruction of the ship.
