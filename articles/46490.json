The turret was equipped with its own internal power generator, allowing it to keep operating after the destruction of an installation's main power supply. The FPC 6.7 was designed to be easily transportable between locations and could be set up and broken down at a moment's notice. Typically, it required four crew members to operate: gunner, sensor operator and two power regulation technicians, but they have been known to operate with as few as two of them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Alliance made use of a large number of FPC 6.7 batteries, particularly early in the Galactic Civil War. The design was perfectly suited the Alliance's need for weapons that could be installed quickly at secret base locations and be removed even faster. They were most often employed, with reliable and devastating effects, to destroy flights of TIE/sa bombers attempting bombing runs on Alliance bases."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
