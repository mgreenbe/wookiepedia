When attempting to find the supposed treasure aboard the wreck of the Obrexta III, Toltek and his band used their sailer to reach the vessel, utilizing the violent sandstorms. However, the sandstorm was frozen when the crew of Sidon Ithano used a kinetic disruptor, which prevented Toltek's sailer from operating. Once the sandstorm returned with enough intensity, the band of pirates were able to move, but the usage of the kinetic disruptor caused the grains of sand in the sandstorm to explode, destroying the wind-powered sailer and the Devaronian pirates along with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
