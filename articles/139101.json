It fired a small 5mm transponder node dart up to four meters by using compressed air. The dart had a battery life of 40 hours and a range of 1.2 kilometers. The transmitter in the dart broadcast its location every 5 minutes and allowed the tagger to get the dart's range and direction. The signal was extremely hard to detect and trace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
