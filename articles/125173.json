The language consisted of growling and howls, and thus was difficult for anyone not a Wookiee to speak or learn and was also rough on their throat. In particular, it was hard for human throats to make the warbling whines and growls that made up the Shyriiwook language. Nevertheless, it was possible for a human to master the language after taking on the effort of learning it. It had over one-hundred-and-fifty words for wood, and many words for bloodshed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Human Jedi Knight Nib Assek learned how to speak Shyriiwook specifically so she could take the Wookiee Burryaga Agaburry as her Padawan. Sabine Wren was capable of speaking a smattering of Shyriiwook, but lost her voice after annoying Garazeb Orrelios for a day, serenading him in Shyriiwook. Hondo Ohnaka was able to speak some Shyriiwook, capable of quoting many Wookiee proverbs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han Solo was capable of understanding it, as he understood what Chewbacca was saying. When he first met Chewbacca, the pair became friends when they helped each other escape the Imperial Army, after Solo showed Chewbacca he was on his side, by speaking to him in Shyriiwook. Major Harter Kalonia, who served as a physician in the Resistance, was fluent in Shyriiwook. Rey was able to learn Shyriiwook due to her interaction with offworlders on Jakku. Beaumont Kin was another human with the Resistance who knew the language and translated for others, though his skills were somewhat out of practice as of the blockade of Kashyyyk and he struggled to understand other Wookiee dialects."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Examples"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the 2018 Star Wars Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story, screenwriters Lawrence and Jon Kasdan wrote Chewbacca's dialogue translated to English in the script, so Han Solo actor Alden Ehrenreich could understand what was being said. The roars of Chewbacca's Shyriiwook were originally created by sound designed Ben Burtt using recorded bear sounds. For Solo: A Star Wars Story, additional recordings were made of a grizzly bear and a seal, among other animals, and, with some audio manipulation, were used to expand Chewbacca's vocal range."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
