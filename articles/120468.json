The blaster pistol model was named after the planet Mandalore's former Duchess, Satine Kryze. Princess Leia Organa, a prominent member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, used a Satine's Lament as her preferred weapon of choice during the Galactic Civil War. When her ship was boarded over Tatooine, Organa defended herself from Imperial stormtroopers, killing the squad leader with a well-placed shot before being stunned. She later used one during the Battle of Theed, and to stun Poe Dameron aboard the Raddus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
