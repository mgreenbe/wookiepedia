The Sith Emperor, upon learning of the artifact's existence, established Yavin 4 as his final sanctuary, with the intention of using the artifact to restore himself should he ever be driven to the brink of death. During the Galactic War, the Order of Revan invaded Yavin 4 and wiped out the Imperial Guardsmen protecting the artifact, and Revan attempted to use the artifact to bring the currently-spectral Emperor back to a physical form in order to kill him. A coalition of Imperial and Republic forces was formed in response to this plot. The Temple was then stormed, and the artifact destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
