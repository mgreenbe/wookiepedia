It was celebrated in honor of Yun-Yammka, the Slayer, and Yun-Harla, the Trickster. Rather whimsical for the normally serious Yuuzhan Vong, the holiday was marked by a dropping of rules among the Yuuzhan Vong. For example, crechlings would play tricks on their elders, without any fear of reprisal, while adult Yuuzhan Vong would often trade secrets with each other, even among Domain rivals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
