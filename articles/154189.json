He led the Armored Assault Tanks stationed on planet Ryloth against the Galactic Republic All Terrain Tactical Enforcers, which were commanded by Jedi General Mace Windu. When the walkers were advancing through a road above a canyon, the droid tried to trap them on the road by ordering his tanks to shoot and cripple both the front and the rear AT-TEs. Although the droid's AATs managed to cripple the first walker, General Windu cleared the road by Force pushing the crippled AT-TE out of the way.

When the Confederacy's member organization Techno Union invaded planet Ryloth with its droid army, this droid was deployed as a commanding officer of a group of Armored Assault Tanks and battle droids on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Republic attempt to liberate the planet's capital city of Lessu, the command droid commanded his tanks against a column of All Terrain Tactical Enforcers of the Grand Army of the Republic. When the Republic walkers were moving forward in a winding road above a canyon, the AATs attacked them from the other side of it. The command droid was in a Separatist command center with his B1-Series battle droid adjutant, where they oversaw the battle. After his AATs managed to cripple the first AT-TE, which blocked the way from the rest of the walkers, the droid ordered his tanks to also cripple the rear units of the AT-TEs, hoping to trap the column on the road. However, Jedi Master Mace Windu, the leading Jedi General of the Republic forces, was able to Force push the crippled AT-TE out of the road, and led the clone troopers of the Lightning Squadron against the AATs with the All Terrain Recon Transports. Noticing the Jedi's counter-attack, the command droid ordered his tanks to destroy the squadron, but the walkers proved to be too fast to be shot. The droid considered surrender and asked the B1 if it would be better, but the Jedi General had already reached the Separatist command center, and Windu destroyed both droids with the laser weaponry of his AT-RT. The droid's tanks were defeated shortly after as well, and the Republic forces would eventually liberate Ryloth from the Separatist occupation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A battle droid with a masculine personality, this OOM-series commander droid was in charge of a group of AATs. When his aide, who was equipped with an electrobinoculars, reported about the actions of the Republic forces, the command droid wanted to see the events himself before giving any orders, and borrowed the electrobinoculars twice during the battle. His tactic was to trap the Republic walkers into the road above the deep canyon by disabling both the first and the last AT-TE, preventing the rest of the walkers for advancing and leaving them to be destroyed by his tanks. However, he did not count the Force powers of Jedi Master Windu, who managed to clear the road. When Windu led the Lightning Squadron against the droid's AATs, the droid immediately identified him as a Jedi, and ordered his tanks to eliminate the attackers. When the walkers evaded the tanks fire and approached the two droids, his adjutant asked should they escape, but the command droid thought that a surrender would be a better option, though he failed to achieve it when he was gunned down with his aide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This droid first and only appeared in the Liberty on Ryloth, the second to last episode of the first season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series.
