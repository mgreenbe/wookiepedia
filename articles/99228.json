He used the lightsaber in a duel with General Grievous, where he lost it and eventually reclaimed it, when it was given back to him by Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody.\" He would also use this lightsaber to duel his fallen apprentice Darth Vader on Mustafar, and would continue to wield the weapon during his 19-year exile on Tatooine up until his death at the hands of Vader during their rematch on the Death Star. Obi-Wan's second apprentice, Luke Skywalker, would later use this weapon's design as a basis for the construction of his own lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
