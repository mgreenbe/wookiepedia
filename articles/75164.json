Keluda fired upon Simon's airspeeder from the seat of his speeder bike, though the Senator's Jedi protectors, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, managed to evade the Dug's shots. A chase ensued, progressing around the cars of a hauler tram. Kenobi leaped from his speeder and onto the tram just as Keluda rounded the hauler, and sliced his speeder bike in two with his lightsaber. The pieces fell towards the lower levels of Galactic City, and Keluda himself was killed moments later by a reflected shot from Kenobi's blade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
