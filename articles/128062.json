Zeelesi took up a career in arms dealing and by 32 BBY had destroyed a number of important facilities belonging to the Republic Security Force. For these crimes a bounty was placed on his head by Republic Security forces offering 1000 credits for his capture alive and 500 credits dead. When the bounty was placed he was known to be associated with several other arms dealers as well as a number of other criminals including smugglers and the Muttani, Meeko Ghintee. The Mandalorian Bounty hunter Jango Fett ran into Zeelesi on Outland Station, in the changing rooms for the stations pit fighting facilities whilst the hunter was there searching for Ghintee. Zeelsei attacked Fett with a blaster pistol with aid from three Gamorreans. Having been informed of Zeelesi's bounty by the Toydarian owner of the station Rozatta, Jango claimed the bounty on Zeelesi, capturing him alive for 1,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the video game Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, Sobel is the third or fourth of five possible secondary bounties that a player can secure in the pit fighters arena section of the first chapter.
