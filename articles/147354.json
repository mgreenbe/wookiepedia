However, the Jedi Master found another way into Neg's house and killed the captain's thugs before locating Tomo, who was locked inside a cage. A large beast-like creature owned by Neg broke free from its own cage and attacked Jinn, who slew the monster in battle. Jinn subsequently released Tomo from his cage.
