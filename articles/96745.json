When Luke began instructing new recruits to the Rebellion in warfare, recruits such as Kiro, Barney and the Rik Duel gang, they assumed that Luke would be teaching them to wield the Force but were disappointed when Luke refused to school them in Force techniques.

Some of the unusual sources included a shard of the Kaiburr crystal used in Luke Skywalker's saber, Gallinorean rainbow gems from a Hapan tiara in Tenel Ka's saber, Corusca gems from the gas giant Yavin used in those of Gantoris and Jacen Solo, and a synthetically manufactured crystal used in Jaina Solo's saber\u2014making use of a process once considered to be a Sith technique."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Furthermore, Jedi were encouraged to make their handles more personal, reflecting both their personalities and their upbringing. Examples of this included Cilghal's, which was silvery and smooth, with subtle indentations common among Mon Calamari technology, Tionne's, that used a spiral mist-horn, and that of Tenel Ka, which was fashioned from a rancor tooth. An odd example of this diversity was Corran Horn's first saber, constructed in haste from the throttle of a speeder bike."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Lightsaber training"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Great Jedi Purge, many of the old lightsaber forms used by the old Jedi Order were lost and Luke had received little in the way of formal training. However, with the foundation of the Jedi academy on Yavin 4 and the first intake of students, the path to rediscovering these began. Kam Solusar taught the first students the basic principals of fencing, possibly elements of Shii-Cho, upon which all lightsaber combat is based. More specifically, he taught them the three rings of defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along with Kam's own knowledge, there may have been additional teachings from the Jensaarai, their founders being Jedi Knights and Padawans who would likely still have knowledge on the original lightsaber forms used by the Jedi of old. Add to this the knowledge gained by Kyle Katarn, who had been instructed in fencing while he studied at the academy on Carida and was later taught lightsaber combat by the spirits of Qu Rahn and Tal, and by 14 ABY the order had developed its own styles of combat, complete with their own Katas and maneuvers. Divided into Medium style, Fast style and Strong style, the forms of combat which were finally developed and refined seem to be an amalgamation of the old and the new, further bridging the old Jedi Order with the new. By 14 ABY, the Academy also introduced some training sabers, although students such as Rosh Penin derided their use. By 35 ABY, students who had constructed their first Lightsabers were usually just known as apprentices. The original Jedi lightsaber forms were eventually rediscovered, knowledge on them recorded by Cin Drallig being present in the Great Holocron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The new Jedi Order also restored the title of Jedi Battlemaster, which was bestowed on Kyle Katarn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Jedi installations across the galaxy"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Jedi Order affiliated ships"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To function adequately across the galaxy, the Jedi Order needed a number of starships to deliver its Knights into position. These ships came from a number of sources: some the New Republic supplied, such as XJ X-wings, or StealthX starfighters. Others were donated or acquired from private sources. Celador Sash was one such freighter, gifted by a trader once saved by Obi-Wan Kenobi. Finally, other ships were privately owned but were closely tied with the workings of the Jedi Order, such as Millennium Falcon and Errant Venture. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, a number of used ships were acquired by the Praxeum to anonymously deliver the Jedi, as many of their starships had become well known throughout the galaxy. Lady Starstorm was one such ship. After many years, the StealthX fighter would be replaced by their new successors: the X-83 TwinTail starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Squadrons"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the many wars the Jedi became involved in they mobilized several starfighter squadrons.
