A floodlight was much more powerful than a glowrod and could be used to brightly illuminate an area. They could be part of the external lighting system on a starship, or even be placed on droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Millennium Falcon was equipped with floodlights, as was Ulban Arms' S-EP1 security droid. Head-mounted floodlights were used by rocket battle droids while they were searching for survivors in the Abregado system, around 21 BBY. Imperial Garrisons also used floodlights to search out intruders or escapees. One notable garrison that used such equipment was the Vryssa Garrison on Vryssa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
