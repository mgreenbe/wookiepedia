The walker\u2014the latest by Rothana Heavy Engineering\u2014was displayed at the Republic Fair on the planet Valo. When Nihil marauders attacked the fair, a small group that included Chancellor Lina Soh, Jedi Master Stellan Gios, Regasa Elarec Yovet, and several other survivors boarded the walker to evade the war-cloud of gas that the Nihil dispersed across the fairground. Soh managed to pilot the walker, surprising both Gios and herself. The walker was eventually destroyed by a Nihil death charge explosive, leaving Soh severely injured and several other passengers with lesser injuries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
