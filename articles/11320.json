The droids were stored in deactivated, folded position, much like in the MTT, but it is unknown exactly how many droids the dispensers contained. The clone commandos of Delta Squad encountered many of these units during their various operations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In game, the droid dispensers will continue deploying droids until the dispenser itself is destroyed.
