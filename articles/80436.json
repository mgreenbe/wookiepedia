It generated a blade that resembled lava. The crystal itself was less focused and concentrated than normal crystals, therefore lava itself was generated from the extreme heat of the dense, heavy blade, creating bits of flame and lava that sometimes splashed and dripped out from the blade itself. This crystal was rumored to be very powerful."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars Galaxies, the crystal is created using the Chu-Gon Dar cube, a warmly glowing engine component, a warmly glowing skull, and a warmly glowing artifact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
