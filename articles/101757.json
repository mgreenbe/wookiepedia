Sometime prior to 22 BBY, Weequay raiders working for Kirske harassed the inhabitants of Velenki, a settlement on Rattatak. The Jedi Knight Ky Narec and his Padawan, former slave Asajj Ventress, went to assist the villagers. Kirske threatened to torch the village unless its inhabitants handed the two Jedi over to him.

Angered by the death of her Master, Ventress retaliated against their attackers, slaughtering the raiders and the Rattataki who had conspired to kill Narec, including Zol Kramer and Rynn'k-lee. However, Kirske led Ventress into a trap when she attempted to kill him, using himself as bait. Ventress was captured and forced to fight in Kirske's arena. During one of Ventress' fights, the Sith Lord Dooku visited the arena in search of an assassin, watching Ventress from Kirske's viewing gallery.
