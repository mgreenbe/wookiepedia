Organa, the senator of Alderaan, was an outspoken member of the Senate's Loyalist Committee that pushed to maintain the ideals of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He became an architect of the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire and believed that a full-scale Galactic Civil War was inevitable if the Empire was to be toppled and replaced by a New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Organa often worked closely with Senators Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo and Mon Mothma of Chandrila in an attempt to de-escalate the war with the Confederacy of Independent Systems and bring about a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to the three year-long conflict. He was an opponent of the Republic military enhancement bill that increased the production of clone troopers for the Grand Army of the Republic, as well as the architect of the Alderaan Refugee Conference to deal with the refugees displaced by the war with the Separatist Alliance. At times he became caught in the action of the war, including when his relief effort on Christophsis fell under Separatist siege shortly before the Battle of Christophsis. He also ensured that relief supplies could be delivered to the citizens of Ryloth during the Separatist occupation of the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the transformation of the Republic into the Empire, Organa continued to serve in the Imperial Senate but quietly began organizing a rebel movement to combat the Empire. He and his wife, Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan, secretly adopted Leia Organa, who came into their care after her mother, Senator Amidala, died and her husband, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, fell to the dark side of the Force. Princess Leia followed in her father's footsteps and succeeded him in the Senate while quietly supporting the Rebel Alliance. Organa tasked her with finding Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, his old friend and ally, in exile on Tatooine and bringing him into the fight. Bail then returned home to Alderaan to inform his people that war was coming, a warning that would come too late. Shortly thereafter, Organa and the queen were killed when the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon, destroyed Alderaan.

Organa was also the Viceroy of his homeworld and the husband of Breha Organa, Queen of Alderaan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As soon as he entered the intergalactic political arena, he established strong ties with like-minded senators, including Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo and Mon Mothma of Chandrila. He also became close friends with Finis Valorum, former Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. Due to his honesty and his commitment to justice, Organa gained the respect of his senatorial peers and came to be esteemed as a politician. In spite of Organa's best efforts, the galactic government grew increasingly plagued by corruption, ultimately leading malcontents to take extreme action: led by the former Jedi Count Dooku, a loose affiliation of outlying star systems formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems and declared itself seceded from the Galactic Republic. With the rise of further separatism following the rise of the Confederacy, Organa joined the Senate's Loyalist Committee, the members of which supported the Republic and its leader, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. In the framework of the committee, Organa came to work closely with Padm\u00e9 Amidala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In time, the Separatist Crisis escalated into the full-scale conflict known as the Clone Wars.

In this context, he and his relief effort became trapped on Christophsis' surface by General Whorm Loathsom's forces and a Separatist blockade led by the infamous Admiral Trench. When Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi led an assault against Trench's fleet in an attempt to break through and aid Organa, the Admiral responded with a withering attack, forcing the Jedi to retreat behind a nearby moon. Trench staged several devastating attack runs against Organa's on-planet camp at the Minister of Sustenance's compound in the eastern exurbs and draw Skywalker and Kenobi out from behind the moon, but the Harch admiral's blockade were finally broken by a IPV-2C Stealth Corvette flown by Skywalker and Admiral Wullf Yularen.

However, King Katuunko agreed to allow them to use the ships they brought to load the supplies to aid the Twi'leks as long as the Trade Federation did not learn of the mercy mission. Organa then had Binks distract Lott Dod's party at a state dinner while he loaded the supplies aboard the ships. Following that mission, Organa, Binks, and Katuunko were confronted by Dod, who claimed that Organa was responsible.

Following the meeting, Organa and the other senators were then taken hostage by Cad Bane and his bounty hunters following Bane's murder of Philo. When Bane was searching the senator for communicators, Amidala told him that they must not search her because she had a lightsaber. Organa then wondered why she had one, but was more concerned about giving it back to the Jedi who own it. After Skywalker was captured by Sing, Bail and the other senators attended to him.

Organa and his wife, Queen Breha Organa, had always wanted a baby girl, and readily raised Leia as an Alderaanian princess. Organa, along with other dissident members of the newly-refashioned Imperial Senate (notably Mon Mothma) took steps to form the Alliance to Restore the Republic, which sought to restore democracy to the Galaxy.

Organa was surprised to learn that a survivor of Order 66 had been found, but became worried for the Jedi's safety, knowing that that Empire would want to hunt down and kill them. Later, while on Coruscant, Organa heard of additional incidents in the Outer Rim which may had also been the work of the Jedi he wished to locate. This Jedi had began running his or her own mercy missions, making sure food was delivered to those in need, stopping a Black Sun pirate, etc. Organa enlisted the help of Chardri Tage and his copilot Tamsin in order to track this elusive Jedi, although he did not tell Tage and Tamsin that the person they were looking for was, in fact, a Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tage and Tamsin, along with R2-D2, whom Organa had borrowed from Captain Antilles, eventually found the Jedi: Ahsoka Tano, the former Padawan of Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars.

R2 told Tano that Bail Organa was trying to contact her. Tano escaped from Tage's ship, deciding to meet Organa on her own terms.

During the mission, the rebels rescued Saw, befriended the Geonosian Klik-Klak, and discovered that the Empire had perpetrated genocide against the Geonosians.

The Alliance leaders then discussed news of the recent activation of Protocol 13 on Lothal, which entailed the evacuation of all Imperial personnel on the planet.
