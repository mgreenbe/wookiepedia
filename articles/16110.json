Though they were sworn enemies, Ren and Rey were a dyad in the Force, and therefore connected to each other through a unique Force-bond. In the last days of the First Order/Resistance War, Darth Sidious offered the Final Order fleet to Ren in return for killing Rey, his granddaughter and the last Jedi.

Along the way, Solo was contacted by Snoke without Skywalker's knowledge. Snoke, having sensed anxiety in Solo, inquired after the boy's state of mind.

To honor his sister's wishes, Luke Skywalker had likewise avoided to provide Solo an honest account of Vader's redemption. Just as Organa expected, upon becoming aware of the truth across the HoloNet, Solo was shocked; the revelation felt like a betrayal for him and crushed the image he had of Anakin Skywalker by realizing that his parents and uncle never shared the turth with him despite knowing it for decades, leaving him to discover the Skywalker family's most carefully guarded secret along with the rest of the galaxy. Solo also believed that his family, by concealing his ancestry from him, justified the dark impulses that he suppressed throughout his young life.

Snoke approved, believing that the new name represented Solo's true nature and would become known to the entire galaxy one day.

Abrams wanted Episode VII, which came to be named The Force Awakens, to tap into parental fears of a child gone wrong through Kylo Ren.
