Despite this, his computer-generated model was cloned and inserted into the background of several scenes to create a small army of PKs. In addition, several Star Wars Legends sources referred to PK-series worker droids as PK-4s. His puppet went on to inspire the design of the SP-4 analysis droid, which was originally identified as a PK-4 analysis droid in an early draft of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. However, the SP-4's Databank entry mistakenly claimed that the puppet was originally developed for Attack of the Clones, making no mention of PK-4."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
