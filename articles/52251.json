Galek trees lived for hundreds of years, and grew to tall heights over the centuries. The leaves that grew on the galek tree's branches were known for their silver coloration, appearing in contrast to the yellow amber ferns that were a common sight growing among the galek forests on Mandalore."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Yuuzhan Vong attacked Mandalore during their invasion of the galaxy, the galek tree groves near Mandalore's capital city, Keldabe, were among the few areas of the planet the Vong did not target for destruction. In the year 40 ABY, Mand'alor Boba Fett retrieved the remains of his deceased father, Jango, from the red sand deserts of Geonosis and brought them to Mandalore. There, in one of the undisturbed galek tree groves not far from the Kelita River, Fett buried his father's remains next to those of his daughter's, Ailyn Vel. He later visited the galek-encircled graves a number of times, both alone and in the company of his granddaughter, Mirta Gev."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galek trees were first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novel, Sacrifice, written by author Karen Traviss and published May 29, 2007.
