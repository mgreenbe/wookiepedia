During the liberation of Kashyyyk, Korgale and Orlan complied with Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck's orders to orbitally bombard the planet after the Wookiees rose up in revolt against Imperial rule. Later, he commanded the Dominion when a rebel team led by Han Solo and Chewbacca boarded the ship in an attempt to knock out the Dominion and its sister ships Vitiator and Neutralizer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Solo and his team unleashing a rampaging horde of webweaver spiders, Admiral Korgale and his stormtroopers managed to capture the rebel boarders. Korgale placed the rebel boarders in shackles and then confronted Solo personally.

One of his comm officers then told him that a YT-1300 light freighter had jumped out of hyperspace. This ship turned out to be Solo's ship Millennium Falcon, which was being piloted by his wife Princess Leia Organa. Korgale ordered his Destroyer to launch a contingent of TIE fighters. When Leia ordered him to stand down in the name of the New Republic, Korgale laughed and dismissed the idea that her freighter could take on three Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leia was accompanied by a dozen X-wing starfighters from Captain Wedge Antilles' Phantom Squadron and Admiral Ackbar's cruiser Home One.

Chewbacca hit Korgale and knocked him to the ground. While Korgale fled the bridge, Han and his comrades hijacked the Dominion and used its turbolasers and laser cannons to destroy the Vitiator and to fire upon the Neutralizer.
