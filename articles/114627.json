During the Rebellion's assault on Kile II, Wedge Antilles's Y-wing starfighter had been disabled by Imperial forces. Antilles was smuggled into an evacuation shuttle and shipped to the prisons of Kessel. Rogue Squadron commander Luke Skywalker led a raid on the prisons using modified X-wing starfighters, equipped with ion cannons.

During an assault on the Imperial spaceport in the canyons of Kile II, Wedge Antilles, of the elite Alliance starfighter unit Rogue Squadron, was shot down by Imperial forces, and was taken as a prisoner of war. Antilles was scheduled to be transferred to the prisons on the spice planet Kessel. Rogue Squadron, under the command of Luke Skywalker, refused to let this happen, and a rescue operation was initiated to safely extract Antilles from the hovertrain transferring him and other prisoners to the main prison facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The rescue"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rescue of Wedge Antilles"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using modified X-wing starfighters equipped with ion cannons, which shuts down the electric systems of whatever it impacts, Rogue Squadron deployed to disable the hovertrain carrying Wedge Antilles and other prisoners.

The prison camp Antilles was to be taken to, situated in a series of canyons, had three main facilities protected by a main DSS-02 shield generator, turbolasers, and a missile turret. The battle plan called for Rogue Squadron to knock out the main power generator, allowing Madine to deploy his commandos via a landing craft into the prison facilities and free the prisoners. Skywalker and the Rogues protected the transport while it traveled to each of the three facilities and disembarked the Rebel commandos to free the prisoners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While liberating the second facility, Rogue Squadron, after making sure any threats to the escape transport were neutralized, proceeded to destroy a bunker nearby, retrieving advanced seeker missiles in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rescue mission succeeded, and the Rogues and the transport returned to the fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rescue on Kessel appears in two consecutive missions in the 1998 video game Star Wars: Rogue Squadron.
