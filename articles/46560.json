The two closest orbital positions around Faarlsun were occupied by the searing-hot rock planet Jun and the asteroid belt known as the Zossi Belt. Further out, the star was circled by two terrestrial worlds, the poisonous Weken with its two moons and the habitable Pochi with three natural satellites of its own. The outer orbital positions in the Faarlsun system were occupied by the gas giant\u2013type planets Koss and Calipp, which had eight and twelve moons, respectively."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pochi was a dry planet that was home to the semi-intelligent Tulvaree avians.
