She was instructed to infiltrate the Rebel Alliance, but upon doing so, Imperial agents learned that she was selling both Rebel and Imperial information to the Hutts. When her treachery was revealed after the Battle of Yavin, Erran Sif realized that her life was at risk and fled from Corellia to the Twin World of Talus. There, she holed herself up in a secluded bunker, surrounding herself only with her most trusted associates. They consisted of a ruthless mercenary crew, including a number of Trandoshans and her two brothers, Hirsch and Doak. However, circa 1 ABY, the Empire finally discovered the location of Erran Sif's secret hideout and exposed her identity so that she could be hunted down by bounty hunters or other denizens. The Bothan Spynet also shared this information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Erran Sif is one of many Non-Player Characters (NPC's) in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies.
