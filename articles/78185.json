Krix's stocky build was created out of a need for diverse body types among the Trandoshans in order to differentiate them from the previously seen Trandoshan character Bossk. Conceptual art depicting Krix showed the character with yellow eyes, which in the episodes were changed to orange. Krix's name was chosen because, according to series head Dave Filoni, it sounded lizard-like."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
