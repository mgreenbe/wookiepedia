The warship came under the command of Commodore Thrawn, a Chiss officer who arrived with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Eli Vanto. Karyn Faro had been promoted to the Star Destroyer's first officer by the time they arrived. Thrawn would go onto become an admiral, and the Chimaera, Thrawn, and the other officers became part of the Ninety-Sixth Task Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Thrawn was promoted to the rank of Grand Admiral for the Imperial victory at Batonn, he was given command of the Seventh Fleet, and the Chimaera's officers also served in the armada, though Vanto was dispatched by Thrawn to join the Chiss Ascendancy. Thrawn and his officers fought against the early Rebel Alliance in the Lothal campaign and engaged in a conflict against the Grysk Hegemony. Ultimately, however, the Seventh Fleet was defeated by Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger, who had fellow rebel Mart Mattin summon a pod of Purrgil during the Liberation of Lothal. These creatures defeated the fleet in orbit and proceeded to take Bridger, Thrawn, and all others aboard the Chimaera away into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
