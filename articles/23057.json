It was one of the many Republic ships present at the Conquest of Raxus Prime. A Bothan Jedi named Glynn-Beti rescued a young Boba Fett from the planet and brought him to the ship. Boba, having boarded the ship under the guise of an orphan named Teff, befriended the Excargan Garr and explored the ship with him for much of their stay. The Candaserri arrived on Bespin a short while later to reunite the orphans with their families. At that time, it was commanded by Glynn-Beti and her Padawan, Ulu Ulix, who oversaw the Orphan Hall."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Candaserri survived to see use in the Imperial Navy during the early years of the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
