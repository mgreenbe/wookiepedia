Hailing from the Lianorm Swamp on her homeworld of Naboo, Jowil was sent by her parents to study under famous musician Beezar Pert in the city of Otoh Gunga. Pert was the leader of the Great Municipal Band at the time, and when he chose to retire, the other band members elected Jowil to be his successor, in spite of her youth. The young Gungan took to the task enthusiastically and was able to propel the band to new fame in 32 BBY, when she composed the \"Symponik Nabooalla,\" which was played in Naboo's capital of Theed during the victory celebrations after the Battle of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Augara Jowil, or \"Augie\" as she was known, had been raised in Naboo's Lianorm Swamp region. She demonstrated significant talent as a musikagung at an early age, and was hailed as a prodigy. Jowil was sent by her parents to Otoh Gunga, where she studied for many years under Great Municipal Band leader Beezar Pert, composer of the famed \"Symponika Crunchen-Grand,\" which chronicled the original formation of the Gungan Grand Army. Jowil was among the first to hear the Symponika Crunchen-Grand. After finishing Jowil's instruction, Pert retired, and the members of the Band unanimously voted in his young pupil as his successor, despite her youth and inexperience."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In her new role, Jowil never believed that she would be given the opportunity to chronicle anything as significant as the formation of the Gungan Grand Army. In 32 BBY, Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation, forcing Boss Rugor Nass to evacuate Otoh Gunga. Jowil joined Nass and the Reps at the Sacred Place some time after the evacuation, and was there to witness Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, leader of the Human population on Naboo, present herself before Nass in a bid to forge an alliance against the Federation. Nass agreed, and prepared to send the Gungan Grand Army to fight the invaders. Jowil was stunned by the humility and respect of Amidala and her Human entourage, and she realized that what she had just seen would be a watershed moment in Naboo's history."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With a fitting subject now at hand, Jowil set about composing, in her head, a piece that would chronicle what she had just seen. In a matter of days, she had composed the \"Symponik Nabooalla,\" an epic for all of Naboo's denizens chronicling the Gungans' and Humans' collaborative efforts at restoring their freedom. The first movement of the piece debuted during a large parade in Theed following the Battle of Naboo, in which Humans and Gungans alike had been able to overcome the armies of the Federation. Among those present were Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and members of the Jedi Council, in addition to Queen Amidala and Boss Nass. The exposure that the piece received was unprecedented, and so Jowil's place in history was cemented, as one of the Great Municipal Band's most significant leaders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the rebelling Confederacy of Independent Systems, Jowil, along with several other prominent Naboo musicians, coaxed Beezar Pert out of retirement for a special concert in the Palace Plaza of Theed to honor the orphans of both Republic and Separatist forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An individual of considerable talent, Augara Jowil was thrust into the important role of Great Municipal Band leader at an early age. Despite her inexperience, she acquitted herself well in the role, and was able to push the band to new fame.
