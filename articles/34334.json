A mutated tangler tree rested at the center of the grove, and attacked any creatures that entered its range by whipping at them with thorn-covered vines or simply by launching the thorns as a projectile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, a Dark Side Adept by the name of Savor Kibbs set up camp near the grove, and fed on its power.
