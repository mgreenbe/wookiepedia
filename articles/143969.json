Along the way, Nom Anor comes across a Shamed One named Vuurok I'pan who tells Nom Anor about a group of rising Shamed Ones and workers who intend to establish a new Vong religion that will look up to the Jedi as saviors, and Nom Anor is taken to the group.

Fortunately, Pellaeon is saved by Tekli who gets him out of the coma in a bacta tank, but Pellaeon will have to remain in the tank for quite some time before he can fully recover from the injuries of the attack.

A group of Fian guards come for Tahiri and she confronts them with her lightsaber, but before any real violence can break out, she faints again. Meanwhile, after hearing about this, Jaina goes to N'zoth, home of the Yevetha, to investigate as to why they are not planning an attack on the Fia. But when she arrives, she finds that it has been destroyed by the Vong, and a surviving Yevethan pilot, who sends a message to her about how the Vong are the greater species than the Yevetha, self-destructs his own ship, sending Jaina back to Galantos.

The plan works, and Danni sends in a group of YVH mouse droids to poison the two Vong stationed at the console of the slaveship. After a while, the poison works on the Vong, and Saba cuts a hole at the slaveship that frees her, Danni and the surviving captives with the hardening blorash jelly protecting them from the vacuum of space.

Pellaeon fully recovers from the bacta tank and declares that the Imperial Remnant officially join the Galactic Alliance. At first, the Moff Council extremely disagree with this notion, but after Pellaeon convinces them that it will help repel another future Vong invasion, they all agree. Moff Kurlen Flennic still doesn't agree with the official truce to be declared, and even pulls a blaster on Pellaeon to emphasize his point when he loses support from the rest of the Council. After Flennic is repelled by stormtroopers, Pellaeon gives him the choice of incarceration for his treason or to be pardoned and agree on the alliance between the Galactic Alliance and the Empire. Flennic chooses the latter and he is pardoned by Pellaeon for his treason, but Pellaeon emphasizes that this event will never be forgotten. With that, Luke, Mara, Jacen, Danni and Saba depart the Empire with help from the Imperial Remnant's very own Widowmaker, commanded by Captain Arien Yage, and xenobiologist Soron Hegerty tags along to study Zonama Sekot.
