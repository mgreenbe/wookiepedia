Traditionally, Twi'lek clan leaders were sent here to die if one of their fellow clan leaders had died, either from natural causes or in some cases, assassination. This tradition was instrumental in the changing of hands within the planetary government. In extreme cases, criminals were also exiled to the Bright Lands as a form of capital punishment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to tradition, Inun was a blind youth famous for crossing the Bright Lands.
