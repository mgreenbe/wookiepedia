During the war, he spent time on the island Mannett Point, where he oversaw the excavation of a data holocron by hostages on one of the island's beaches. He wore the standard brown Separatist uniform while on the beach and black and white face paint. He also used a backpack and a blaster rifle. He had black hair and brown eyes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, while Remak watched over the excavation site, he was attacked and killed by a individual aligned with the Galactic Republic, who were backing the Central Authority in the war.
