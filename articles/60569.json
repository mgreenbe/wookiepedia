However, when the base was abandoned, the pilot ventured to the moon Yavin 4 and joined Blue Squadron. He provided a report to General Jan Dodonna on the status of the abandoned outpost. There, Tobber quickly became one of the most popular U-wing pilots within the navy. In the year 0 BBY, he took part in the Battle of Scarif under the callsign of Blue Eight, but did not get through the planetary shield over Scarif with his U-wing starfighter and therefore supported Green Squadron above the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Heff Tobber was portrayed by Rogue One: A Star Wars Story First Assistant Director Toby Hefferman, who originally donned a costume for still photography.
