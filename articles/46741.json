Falk and the gang soon turned to more serious crimes, like protection rackets, running numbers and spice, and fencing stolen goods. Eventually Falk and Doda left the Shawpee gang and joined one of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's satellite operations, before travelling the Hutt's palace and seeking their fortunes their. While Doda found a niche as the Gamorrean's favorite bard and a regular at the sabacc tables, Falk found work as one of Bib Fortuna's runners.
