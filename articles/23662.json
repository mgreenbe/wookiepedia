As such, this planet was the perfect training ground for combat in difficult terrain. It was an exporter of food, and was ruled by the Council of Merchants, which later shared power with a military administration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Old Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally known as Ord Carida, the planet was colonized by the Galactic Republic as a Ordnance/Regional Depot some time circa 12,000 BBY. During the Pius Dea Civil War, which ended Pius Dea domination over the Galactic Republic, the Republic's Rocket-Jumper Elite Advance Unit played an important role in the Jedi victory over the Pius Dea garrison there. During the time of the Cold War, a proxy conflict between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic, some foragers discovered a crude tunnel burrowing under Carida's largest mountain range, believing it to be the entrance to a fabled ancient city. Eventually, someone was sent to check the foragers' findings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carida was the site of a major military training facility, the Academy of Carida. The training facilities were offered to the Galactic Republic for training an army created by the Military Creation Act before the Clone Wars. This selfsame facility was converted willingly by the population to an Imperial training center and was home to the Empire's most important stormtrooper program, along with several hundred B3 ultra battle droids. The planet remained loyal to the Republic during the Clone Wars and was an adamant supporter of the Galactic Empire until the bitter end."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the first year of war, the planet was the site of a victory for the Confederacy of Independent Systems over the Republic. The Republic's loss at Carida, coupled with other recent defeats, led Jedi Grand Master Yoda to believe that the Republic needed another major victory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later in the war's course, Carida was once again under Republic control. The Republic operated a space station, known as the Valor, within orbit of Carida and it was the site of a Republic strategy conference around 20 BBY. The Separatists, under a super tactical droid, unsuccessfully tried to destroy the station during the conference using a derelict bomb-laden Jedi cruiser, the Renown. Near the end of the war, Republic forces seized a Techno Union factory on Tar Morden and acquired many crab droids, which were then sent to Carida."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Period"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet also had numerous rancors on it that had been transplanted from other worlds.

In 8 BBY, Mako Spince attempted to remove the logo using antimatter.

When Carida was invited to Coruscant to meet with Mon Mothma, Ambassador Furgan attended and managed to infect Mothma by splashing a drink containing the nano-destroyer on her during a party, after which he denounced the New Republic and stated that Carida had no intention of joining them."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destruction of Carida"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was destroyed in 11 ABY by Jedi Kyp Durron, under the influence of the spirit of Sith Lord Exar Kun, using the Sun Crusher, a superweapon that fired torpedoes into a star, causing it to go supernova. Beforehand, Durron requested information on his brother, Zeth, who had been forced into the stormtrooper program. The Caridans falsely told him Zeth was killed in a training maneuver. In a rage, Durron fired a resonance torpedo at the system's sun, and announced they had two hours to evacuate before their world was destroyed. Before its destruction, Lieutenant Dauren contacted Kyp and alerted him that Zeth was in fact, still alive. As the sun came closer to going supernova, many Imperials, including Furgan, evacuated from the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kyp raced to the surface to find Zeth, who had been called up to the control room to prove to Kyp that he was still alive, as the Caridans incorrectly believed that Kyp could call of the resonance torpedos and would do so upon learning the truth about his brother. As the sun was close to exploding, Kyp blasted a hole in the roof of the control building using the Sun Crusher and landed in it. Zeth attempted to board the ship but Dauren hit him from behind, causing him to fall. As Dauren attempted to board the ship instead, Kyp sealed the door, preventing him from entering. Zeth shot and killed Dauren with his blaster but was unable to regain enough strength to board the ship, due to Dauren's blow to his head. The sun collapsed and exploded in two massive shockwaves. As Kyp watched, Zeth's body disintegrated in the first wave. Kyp escaped as the second wave cracked the planet in half."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The PC game Star Wars: Rebellion mistakenly places Carida in the Fakir sector of the Core Worlds. The Fakir Sector is actually located in the Inner Rim Territories.\nThe Clone Wars: Wild Space stated that early on in the Clone Wars, Carida was conquered by the Separatists. However, the Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season Five episode \"Point of No Return\" shows Carida heavily cordoned by Republic warships, thus back under the Republic banner. Until a source clears up this discrepancy, this article reconciles information from all source material by assuming that Carida fell back under Republic control sometime between these events."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
