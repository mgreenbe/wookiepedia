In 5 BBY, a new wing for the Hall of Heroes was being constructed by Imperial Commander Pter Nyklas who was using Wookiee slaves to complete the work. Nyklas repeatedly whipped and beat his Wookiee workforce, so much so that one Wookiee eventually rose up in anger against him. Nyklas drew his blaster but was prevented from killing Chewbacca by then- Lieutenant Han Solo. The two fled Coruscant and took up smuggling careers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
