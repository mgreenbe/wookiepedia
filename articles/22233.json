CT-1477 was patrolling the reactor core of the Star Destroyer, when he encountered young Boba Fett. Noticing that Fett was alone, he contacted another clone trooper via comlink to retrieve Fett from the core room. While doing so, Fett asked CT-1477 what type of blaster he was carrying, and the clone allowed Fett to hold onto it. This proved to be a mistake, as Fett stunned him with it, before destroying the main reactor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A dedicated soldier, CT-1477 cared for the safety of his brothers, attempting to call in a fellow trooper to escort Fett. He also let Fett hold his DC-15A, telling him to keep the safety on. He additionally tried to reason with Fett, only attacking him when it was clear that young Fett would pull the trigger. CT-1477 didn't mean to cause any intentional harm to Boba Fett, but Fett later stunned the trooper, leaving him knocked out while he destroyed the reactor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
