It was the most common obstacle used on a swoopchasing course. Repulsor-Ins were simple barriers, with a height of no more than meters. The Fence had an embedded repulsor field generator that rapidly drew approaching swoops towards it. Swoops heading to the Repulsor-In accelerated from two hundred and fifty kilometers an hour up to speeds of four hundred kilometers an hour."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
