Standing inside one of the Temple's meditation chambers, it was constructed from kyber crystals retrieved from the lightsabers of Jedi who had fallen in battle. It was thick at the base, but extremely narrow at the top to symbolize the perils the fallen Jedi had faced. Scaling and crossing the Kyber Arch was an advanced meditation technique, only attempted by those Jedi who felt called to do so by the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Master Jora Malli once posed a question to her Padawan Reath Silas, asking why no Jedi could cross the Kyber Arch alone. Malli felt that Silas would not understand the answer to her question if he continued to take it literally, but told him that when he understood the answer, he would know why they were taking an assignment on the Galactic Frontier. When Silas went to study the arch, he witnessed a sole Jedi Knight cross it with no apparent difficulty. Silas was unable to find much time to meditate on Malli's question before he was called away from the Jedi Temple to meet her on the Starlight Beacon space station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
