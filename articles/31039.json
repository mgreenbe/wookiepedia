However, the \"dirty work\" they were sent out to do wasn't always as clear-cut as expected: covert ops troopers were occasionally sent to eliminate other clones who had chosen to desert from the Republic and live their own, independent, lives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the few known operations of this type was on Gaftikar when CT-6200/8901 and CT-0368/7766 were deployed to eliminate ARC A-30, an ARC trooper who had deserted his post. This two-man team was KIA by RC-1136, who was mistaken for A-30 when undercover and attacked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Covert Ops Clones served in squads with up to three men.

However, according to Pablo Hidalgo, \"A winning entry was selected, but it became apparent that projects in the works tread too closely to the lore being established in the CO troopers, that the call was made to pull it.
