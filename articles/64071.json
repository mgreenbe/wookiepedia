Kluleyeke is keen to view U'rum's collection of enslaved droids. Besides Zeta, another prisoner is a small white, silver and blue astromech droid, which had managed to slice through its restraining bolts. Lord Kluleyeke warns the captain that R2 series droids are known for aftermarket modifications and have hidden appendages.

Lady Eekee notices that his plates are loose and a bit misshapen. The droid claims to be fluent in six million forms of communication and an excellent musician.
