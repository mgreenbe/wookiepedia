During the three years it took to construct the Temple, the High Council tasked Lore Keeper Gnost-Dural with the daunting task of compiling a series of records for the Archives that would detail the history of the Great Galactic War, the conflict between the Order and its counterpart, the Sith Empire. Master Dural included nineteen records in his report to the Council, all of which were incorporated into the new Archives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A large domed chamber located on the second story of the Jedi Temple's southeast cupola, the Jedi Archives consisted of twelve three tiered stacks that soared to the ceiling of the rotunda.
