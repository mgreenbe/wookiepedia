After the Ewoks Wicket Wystri Warrick, Teebo, Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, and Latara traveled to the mountain to retrieve the Crystal Cloak stolen from Bright Tree Village years earlier, the Gracca used the cloak to create a forest of giant crystals. When Warrick brandished a stick at the Gracca and demanded the return of the cloak, the Gracca simply turned the stick into crystal and tossed it aside. The Gracca then flew at the Ewoks, attempting to turn them into crystal, but Kintaka used her lasso to remove the cloak, which fell into the lava below the mountain. The Gracca then flew at Wicket, but accidentally flew into one of the crystals in his forest. The crystals collapsed on top of him, incapacitating him. The Ewoks then flew back to Bright Tree Village on their skin gliders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
