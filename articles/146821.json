It was the source of the civil war that raged for years on the planet, mostly because of the difficulty and costliness of mining it. It had properties that were used in the production of bacta. Granta Omega planned to use this, as well as the alazhi of his property on Thyferra, to dominate the galactic bacta market. He used the fighting on Haariden to prevent Republic scientists from gathering all the data on the titanite deposits, however, his plans were disrupted by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
