The launcher was rifle sized, and contained 200 meters of molecularly reinforced line, as well an automatic winch capable of pulling 200 kilograms at 20 meters per second."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alternatively, a wrist mounted version operating off of hand commands existed, containing a spool of 100 meters of line, and a miniaturized winch capable of lifting 150 kilograms 10 meters per second. Both rifle and wrist versions were powered through power cells, with the hook itself recharging when fully withdrawn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
