In 11 BBY, it was in operation between the Inner Rim planet Gorse and its moon Cynda. It collided with the command bridge of the Imperial Star Destroyer Ultimatum after coming out of hyperspace above the planet Gorse. The ship recovered with serious damage; a nonhuman aboard estimated that repairs would take up to two months. Realizing that it would only take three weeks to replace the freighter, Count Denetrius Vidian ordered the destruction of the Cynda Dreaming. The Ultimatum's captain, Rae Sloane, concurred, and the Star Destroyer opened fire on the freighter, killing all those on board."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
