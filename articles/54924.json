Covering a large area, the GlobeScan could detect any object entering its sensor range and give basic contact information about it. However, it could not give the detailed information available from other sensor systems, and its scans were blocked by obstructions such as mountainous terrain. For this reason, the GlobeScan was often used in conjunction with other sensor systems, such as the Tana Ire GroundSweeper-3 and Melihat UniScan Sensor System, especially in defense of Alliance to Restore the Republic bases."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
