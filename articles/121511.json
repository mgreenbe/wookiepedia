Some time before the Rebel Alliance discovered the existence of the second Death Star, the Alliance assigned the Azzameen family to gather supplies for the Vergesso Shipyard in the Vergesso Asteroids. Aeron Azzameen and Ace Azzameen gathered active Azzameen transport vessels to raid a Viraxo Industries Industrial Complex, VXO-33274, of its plentiful supplies. SecForce sent three of their fighters to assist the Otana in defending the transport ships from Viraxo and Black Sun security forces. The raid was a success, and the Rebels got their supplies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
