Like most of his Jedi brethren, Huulik was killed by his own clone troopers when the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, secretly a malevolent Dark Lord of the Sith named Darth Sidious, decreed the extermination of all Jedi. Despite being mortally injured during the ambush, Huulik managed to return to his starship and set a course for his homeworld of Rodia before passing away.

Huulik was discovered to be Force-sensitive and came to serve as a Knight in the Jedi Order, whose members were the protectors of peace and justice in the galaxy. He had at least one sibling, as well as a niece named Taneetch Soonta. However, the Jedi were not allowed to maintain family ties, and as a consequence, Huulik only visited his homeworld while on official Jedi business, conversing with his niece once or twice when she was a child.

A skilled pilot, Huulik became a general in the Grand Army of the Republic during the devastating three-year long conflict. The Rodian participated in the Battle of Sedratis, where he flew alongside his fellow Jedi Anakin Skywalker. At some point during the battle, the two Jedi were swarmed by droid starfighters and Huulik's deflector shields were depleted. However, Skywalker flew his ship in between Huulik and the next blast from the droids, saving the Rodian's life and giving him time to recharge his shields. Ultimately, the Jedi and Republic won the battle at Sedratis. Following their triumph, Huulik and Skywalker fought together on several other occasions.

Severely wounded, Huulik still managed to board his starship and recorded a brief message about his predicament. He also ordered his astromech droid to bring the ship back to Rodia.
