The X-wings featured 4 fusial thrust engines and were equipped with a hyperdrive. The engines could reach speeds up to 1,300 KPH and 120 MGLT. The craft was flown by 1 pilot with an onboard astromech droid for assistance. Additional systems included deflector shields and sensors. The craft featured a distinctive nose to hold advanced Carbanti sensors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For armament, they carried four KX14 laser cannons on the S-foils which deployed in the classic \"X\"-shape. Additonal weapons included Krupx MG7-B proton torpedo launchers. The old magnetic flash suppressors were removed as unnecessary, although some pilots added custom ones.The engines were improved, with greater fusial thrust engines installed. Improved flight systems also gave more maneuverability. The cockpit was placed near the rear, with a snub nose. Targeting systems included Fabritech ANr 1.3 tracking computer with IN-630-B \"Sightline\" holographic imaging system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some craft were colored gray with blue trim, and had the words \"Republic Navy\" written on their hulls in Aurebesh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The T-85s were flown by the New Republic Defense Fleet in the decades after the Battle of Endor. The impetus of their design came from Admiral Gial Ackbar, who realized that the T-70s were aging. He proposed that Incom-Freitek design the next generation. They were deployed to defend space lanes from pirates. Commander Poe Dameron flew T-85 X-wings with the rest of Rapier Squadron while serving the New Republic. At one point, the Rapiers were assigned to Brooksdion space station. They received an alert, as unknown parties had stolen the head of Mathieson's protocol droid. They scrambled in their T-85s and gave chase to the starship. As they reached the asteroid field of Lost Souls, Dameron ordered his wingmen to remain behind while he pursued the ship. After escaping the field, the starship was able to outsmart Dameron and escape into hyperspace. On another mission, Rapier Squadron ambushed a pirate frigate in the Mirrin sector. Dameron's fighter was disabled with an ion pulse, and towed aboard the frigate. His droid BB-8 was able to slip away, alerting the rest of the squadron to their location, and they arrived to confront the frigate. Dameron was then able to subdue the crew thanks to the distraction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his actions at the Skirmish in OR-Kappa-2722 and the Suraz engagement, Dameron was subsequently recruited into the Resistance, becoming the leader of Black Squadron. He switched to the use of a T-70, Black One."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on a mission from New Republic Command, Kazuda Xiono's team employed T-85s. They were sent to rendezvous with the Resistance to pass along intelligence. Major Elrik Vonreg of the First Order engaged them. Xiono ordered his wingmen to escape, but his craft was damaged. Commander Dameron's arrival at the site saved Xiono, allowing them to trap and damage Vonreg's TIE with his sole remaining cannon, forcing him to retreat. Xiono's craft was then towed aboard a CR90 corvette."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most of the New Republic's T-85 X-wing fleet was atomized when the First Order destroyed the Hosnian system in 34 ABY. Shortly afterward, Commander Dameron joked to General Leia Organa that he had ordered a shipment of the T-85s in the leadup to the Battle of Crait as the Resistance fled the First Order counter-attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the devastating losses at Crait, the Resistance was down to only a small amount of men and material. Meanwhile the First Order had begun large-scale scrapping of captured New Republic ships.

Their full design was revealed in \"The Recruit,\" the premiere of the Star Wars Resistance animated television series that aired on October 7, 2018."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The illustrations featured in Before the Awakening incorrectly depict the T-85 X-wings as T-70s, which were set to prominently appear in the then-upcoming film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. According to the Lucasfilm Story Group's Matt Martin, this is due to that the Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens publishing program had aimed to invoke the feeling of the film, and also the T-85 X-wings had not been designed at that point. This is also the case for Poe and the Missing Ship, a 2017 partial storybook adaptation of the aforementioned novel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary  declared that all T-85s were destroyed, this was overwritten by later sources such as the novel Resistance Reborn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
