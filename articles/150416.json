It was one of the many struggles of the Melida/Daan Civil War on the planet of Melida/Daan and centered over control of the city of Zehava. In the battle, the Melida tried to recapture the city of Zehava that was captured by the Daan during one of the previous battles. During the battle, Captain Quintama was killed. It is possible that the Daan won that battle, because Pinani, the widow of Quintama, later participated in a raid on the city of Bin to avenge the Battle of Zehava."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
