It was the first Star Destroyer to be destroyed in a direct assault by forces of the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Intrepid was tasked with guarding the Imperial detention center at Mytus VII. After some Rebel pilots, including Samuel Raider and Toalagar, escaped aboard the BFF-1 bulk freighter Genue, the Intrepid was sent to oversee their recapture near Kashyyyk. However, a Rebel rescue mission conducted by the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle Drago was able to retrieve the escapees while Keyan Farlander and Cardacs in R-22 Spearheads held off starfighters launched from the Intrepid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Still near Kashyyyk, the Intrepid was present when the Rebels mounted a rescue of Wookiee slaves being transferred by the freighter Toral to work on the Death Star. The Rebels overcame the Assault Gunboats defending the freighter and boarded it to rescue the Wookiees. Although the Intrepid launched fighters to stop them, they were held off by Raider and Farlander until the rescue was complete."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, some communications satellites were stolen from the Imperial base on Orron III and were being taken off-planet by the freighter Phoenix. The Intrepid responded but, by the time it arrived, the freighter had been captured by Rebel forces and had gone to hyperspace. The Intrepid launched fighters but Farlander, flying the single Rebel Y-wing in the area, fought them off and launched a proton torpedo at the Intrepid in spite before leaving."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next week the Intrepid attempted to destroy the Phoenix while it awaited the arrival of the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Maximus. The Imperial attack was interrupted by Keyan Farlander in an R-22 Spearhead who held off the Imperial fighters until the Maximus arrived. Shortly after the Maximus's arrival, the Intrepid fled leading the Rebels to conclude that it was suffering from a shortage of pilots or starfighters."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destruction of the Intrepid"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Intrepid's hyperdrive was later damaged in an accidental collision with an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate, leaving the ship stranded in the Circarpous system. The Intrepid was the last 'witness' of the transmission of the Death Star plans to Rebel hands and the Alliance saw an opportunity. Keyan Farlander flew an X-wing, escorted by two R-22 Spearheads, in a raid against freighters from Kiam group which were delivering parts to repair the hyperdrive. Despite the Intrepid launching TIEs against the attacking Rebels, the freighters with the hyperdrive parts were destroyed before they were able to make the delivery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Intrepid still stranded and low on fighters, the Empire sent three CR90 corvettes from Viper group and several Assault Gunboats to reinforce it until repairs could be made. The Rebels decided to destroy the reinforcements before they could get close to the Intrepid. Farlander led a group of Y-wings, escorted by Ernek Marskan in an X-wing, in the mission. Despite sending TIE/sa bombers to assist the incoming ships, the Intrepid could do little but watch as its reinforcements were destroyed by the Rebels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Intrepid was now laid defenseless, apart from the last few remaining TIE pilots. The Alliance decided that the time for a major attack had come. Two X-wings from Red Squadron, flown by Keyan Farlander and Sunnar Jan-lo, were tasked with shooting Intrepid's ISD-72x shield generator domes ahead of a heavy torpedo bombardment from Blue Squadron's Y-wings. Two R-22s from Gold Squadron would engage the TIE defenses and protect the other Rebel craft. Samuel Raider and Ernek Marskan were among the Rebel pilots who participated in the battle. Though the Rebels lost some of their fighters, the bombardment proved too much and the Intrepid was eventually destroyed, becoming the first Star Destroyer to be blown by a Rebel frontal assault. A patrol of Assault Gunboats arrived too late to save the Intrepid and the Rebels escaped into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
