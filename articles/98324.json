Some species, such as Bith, Duros, Kallidahins, Neimoidians, and Quermians lacked noses, though Bith were still able to smell using special organs beneath the skin flaps on their faces, as could Quermians using olfactory glands in their hands. Some beings, like Chieftain Gruppe, also pierced their noses and inserted jewelry in the hole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
