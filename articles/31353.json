They evacuated the base alongside Freighter Group Dobll, which was destroyed while attempting to flee the system. During their escape attempt they came under attack by squadrons of TIE/sa bombers launched by the Imperial EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Red Wind. However, Keyan Farlander managed to repel the Imperials until the corvettes were able to make the jump to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
