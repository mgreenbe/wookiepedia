As Eppon continued to mature quickly, the Alliance soldiers began to vanish one by one. His true nature was only revealed after Zak and Tash encountered Borborygmus Gog, whom they had believed to be dead. Eppon was the final stage of Project Starscream and the culmination of the Project's research. Eppon required food to continue growing. He had actually consumed the Alliance soldiers, absorbing them into his body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eppon was a prototype of Gog's Army of Terror, a group of biologically-created weapons that would never die, could change form at will, could read the minds of its victims and use their deepest fears against them, grew stronger with each feeding, and were impervious to the Force; this last ability was never completed, fortunately. They would follow any order their creator gave them. As Eppon grew, a purple splotch appeared on his forehead and spread to cover his entire body with a scale-like armor. Over time, the fairly Human-like Eppon transformed into a hideous monster. Eppon nearly consumed the Arrandas' uncle, Hoole, before Tash used the Force to help him free himself from Gog's control. Eppon turned on Gog after realizing his fate, but Gog activated the fail-safe mechanism in each of his warriors. A small explosive implanted in Eppon's brain destroyed much of his body."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a pseudo-cliffhanger, the epilogue of Galaxy of Fear: Army of Terror describes the remains of Eppon's body moving.
