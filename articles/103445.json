Parja was endlessly patient with Fi's loss of memory and coordination and was fiercely protective of him even after he regained some mobility and speech. Fi and Parja were married in a traditional Mandalorian wedding ceremony 998 days after the battle of Geonosis with Parja wearing her workshop overalls and Fi wearing Mandalorian armor. The wedding - which took less than a minute - occurred right before Fi, now mostly recovered, left on a mission to Coruscant with ARC trooper deserters Sull, Spar and former Jedi General Bardan Jusik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Clan Skirata deserted from the Grand Army of the Republic after Order 66, she lived there with them in Kyrimorut."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Parja wore armor of a deep scarlet color.
