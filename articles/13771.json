Her mission failed, and she fled Duum's men, arriving into the hands of the former Jedi Shon-Ju and his students. Secura and Shon-Ju agreed to join forces to stop Duum. Duum, for his part, was playing both sides of the Clone Wars against each other, and planted false evidence to draw a Republic Navy and Confederate Navy fleet to his system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The ambush"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Duum seeded the space around the moon of Cavamina Minor with six hundred thousand space mines, and the Republic Venator Star Destroyers, ARC-170 starfighters, and CR-20 troop carriers reverted from hyperspace right into the mine field. The Separatist fleet\ns Munificent-class star frigates, battleships, and droid starfighters also experienced the same problem. Seeing an opposing fleet instead of the merchant convoy Duum had promised them, both fleet commanders ordered their crews to open fire on the other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Secura and Shon-Ju infiltrated Attuma Duum's headquarters and managed to disable the deflector shields protecting the station from the asteroid field.
