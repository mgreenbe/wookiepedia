Seeing no reason why this Rebel should survive, she tasked a group of Imperials to board the Corvette and eliminate the Rebel General for her. However, before the Imperials could be granted passage to the Corvette, she had to first acquire Rebel documents with important information. After searching various locations, including the abandoned Rebel base on Dantooine, a crashed Star Tours liner on Dathomir, and the Afarathu Cave on Corellia, the Imperials finally found the documents Sabol sought. The Imperials were then given a ticket to hand to an Imperial TIE pilot at the Emperor's Retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From here, the Imperials were flown on a Lambda-class shuttle to the Corvette.
