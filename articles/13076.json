Introduced into a cybernetic implant, such as the 221 cyber-interface, the program trap could kill an individual in fifteen seconds. The virus created an overload spiral in the neural interface band and wiped an individual's neural pathways. The only way to counter the virus was to detach the neural interface band in less than fifteen seconds. Bartokk program-traps had been used successfully in a coup assassination on Turkana, and the assassination of Lyle Lippstroot, a cyborg bookkeeper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
