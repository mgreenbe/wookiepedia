In 1 ABY, Dominic Raynor gambled away the city in a game of sabacc against Lando Calrissian, who became the new Baron Administrator. Raynor hired the bounty hunter Bossk, who went to Cloud City and set up a trap for Calrissian. Bossk sabotaged some vital equipment, and, impersonating the chief engineer, he reported that a primary repulsorlift pod was about to break down; this failure would drop the floating city into the gas giant. Calrissian escaped through a nearby hangar, so the ambush was ultimately unsuccessful."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The chief engineer was mentioned in Sore Loser's Revenge, an online scenario written by Eric Cagle for Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Miniatures collectible tabletop strategy game in October 8, 2004."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
