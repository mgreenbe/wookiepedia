During the following two centuries, the population grew from five billion to 500 billion, living in a total of 178 inhabited systems, although only 47 of these were officially recognized. Deysum III was the first planet settled and became a very polluted and industrialized world and the sector's capital. Other big population centers developed on Lexrul and Longwind, while a pirate gang, known as the Dark Warbirds took over the Uogo'cor system and enslaved its native population.
