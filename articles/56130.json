At the time of the First Battle of Geonosis, the Galactic Republic activated tens of thousands of clone troopers to fight the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In addition to human clones, all grown from the bounty hunter Jango Fett's genetic template, the Grand Army consisted of various military vehicles for ground support, including AV-7 Anti-vehicle Artillery Cannons, BARC speeders, and All Terrain Tactical Enforcers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the final years of the Republic, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas contacted the government of Kamino to commission the creation of a clone army, convinced that the galaxy would be consumed by war. As thousands of star systems joined the Separatist movement, the Galactic Senate invested wartime powers in Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. As a result, the Grand Army of the Republic was formally established, comprising thousands of clone soldiers with millions more being developed in Kaminoan facilities by the start of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights, having served as peacekeepers for a thousand years, became Jedi Generals when the Senate called on the Jedi Order to lead the Grand Army against the enemies of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For three years, the Grand Army fought on all fronts across a war-torn galaxy, from the campaigns in the Outer Rim Territories to a Separatist attack on the Republic capital of Coruscant. Through the machinations of Palpatine, revealed to the Jedi as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the clones would ultimately turn against their Jedi leaders, slaughtering them throughout the galaxy and in the Jedi Temple as directed by Order 66. After Sidious declared himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire, the Grand Army of the Republic was absorbed by the New Order and reorganized into the Imperial Army, allowing the remaining clone troopers to serve as the first generation of stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Structure"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clone troopers served as infantry units in the Grand Army of the Republic. In addition to the rank-and-file soldier, the Grand Army consisted of numerous specialists, including environment-based units like clone cold assault troops and clone SCUBA troopers. Other variants units like clone ordnance specialists and clone trooper pilots were specially trained for specific functions, such as bomb diffusion and flight, respectively. ARC troopers and clone commandos were considered elite units in the Grand Army due to their exceptional skills and specialized training. Occasionally, due to accelerated aging, the Republic's clone troopers were reinforced with non-clone conscript squads."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grand Army of the Republic possessed various military vehicles to support its ground forces. The principal battle tank of the Grand Army was the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer. The AT-TE's six legs provided the walker with increased stability, but reduced the vehicle's overall speed. As mobility was a key factor in the Grand Army's effectiveness, the military was outfitted with BARC speeders in order to provide the clones with increased operational range, speed, mobility, and firepower that were otherwise unavailable to foot soldiers."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Unit structure"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ranks"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, color was used to denote the rank of Grand Army clone officers. This system was intended as a benefit for non-clones on the battlefield, as well as clones whose helmet displays malfunctioned. It fell out of use, however, as the Jedi encouraged the clones to express their individuality. As a result, the clone army gradually adopted a new system in which they customized their armor with unique color schemes and markings.

Despite his removal from the ranks of the Jedi High Council, whose other members rejected his ideas, Sifo-Dyas contacted the planet Kamino. The Kaminoans, a species that specialized in the science of cloning, were under the impression that Sifo-Dyas represented the interests of the council. In truth, their communication was kept secret. Unaware of this deception, the Kaminoan cloners accepted the Jedi's commission to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sifo-Dyas did not live to witness the completion of his army. An unwitting pawn of the Sith, Sifo-Dyas was murdered by the Pyke Syndicate at the behest of Darth Tyranus\u2014once known as Jedi Master Dooku, the fallen Jedi turned to the dark side of the Force and became apprenticed to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. After the death of Sifo-Dyas, the Sith secretly took over the project and selected the human bounty hunter Jango Fett to serve as the genetic template of the clone army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to growth acceleration and behavioral modification, an inorganic bio-chip was installed into the brain of every clone trooper at the early stage of their development. The official reason behind the implant was to ensure that the clones would be more docile than their aggressive genetic donor. The true reason\u2014as Prime Minister Lama Su and Nala Se understood it\u2014was to ensure that the clones would terminate renegade Jedi in accordance with Protocol 66. Unknown even to the Kaminoans, the bio-chips were manufactured for the sole purpose of forcing the clones to annihilate the entire Jedi Order so that the Sith could ultimately reclaim control over the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Formation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of the clone troopers' accelerated growth process, the first two hundred thousand soldiers were completed within a decade\u2014approximately ten years after the Battle of Naboo and twenty-two years before the Battle of Yavin. By then the galaxy stood on the brink of war, as predicted by Sifo-Dyas, due to a group of secessionist star systems and powerful corporations. Seeking independence from the Galactic Republic, they combined their resources to form the Confederacy of Independent Systems, an act which the Republic refused to recognize."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vowing to preserve the unity of the thousand-year Republic, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine attempted to negotiate the Separatists' return to the Republic with the aid of the Loyalist Committee and the Jedi Council. Around the same time, the Galactic Senate was divided in their response to the Separatist Crisis. Some senators advocated for the passage of the Military Creation Act, which would enable the Republic to organize a military force to defend the Republic. Other senators such as Padm\u00e9 Amidala opposed the bill under the belief that it would provoke a full-scale war between the Republic and the Separatists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The matter was ultimately settled when the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered both the Kamino-produced clone army and a secret army of battle droids that the Separatists constructed on the planet Geonosis. Convinced that the senators would never authorize the creation of a military on their own before the Separatists attacked the Republic, Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks called on the Senate to empower the Supreme Chancellor with the authority to end the crisis of the Separatist movement.

Placed under the leadership of Grand Master Yoda, the Grand Army of the Republic made its debut in the First Battle of Geonosis, storming the Separatist stronghold and engaging the droid army with the element of surprise on their side. Clone troopers were commanded by the Jedi and fought side by side as they repelled the enemy from the battlefield, ultimately forcing the Confederate forces into full retreat from the planet. With Geonosis secured, the Grand Army claimed victory in the first battle of the Clone Wars\u2014so-named for the clones who composed the Republic's armed forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the conflict, the Grand Army of the Republic was deployed across the galaxy in order to put an end to the rebellion of the Separatists. The Jedi Knights assumed direct command over the clone troopers, becoming Jedi Generals of the Grand Army. As the Clone Wars progressed, more clone troopers sacrificed their lives out of loyalty to the Jedi and the Supreme Chancellor. While the clones had been engineered to serve as soldiers in the Grand Army, they were also encouraged by the Jedi to develop their own distinct identities, consequently resulting in a wave of greater individuality and creative-thinking that spread through the clone ranks. As such, special unit markings and color patterns became increasingly common within the Grand Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grand Army of the Republic fought on all fronts for three years. As the end of the war drew near, clone troopers continued to see action from Coruscant to Kashyyyk and Utapau. Following the deaths of Darth Tyranus in the Battle of Coruscant, and General Grievous in the Battle of Utapau, the Separatists were all but defeated. However, by then the Jedi Council discovered the Supreme Chancellor's true identity\u2014Sheev Palpatine and Darth Sidious were one and the same; the leader of the Galactic Senate was the enigmatic Sith Lord who secretly controlled both sides in the war. Several masters on the council moved swiftly to arrest the Chancellor before he could destroy the Jedi Order and the Republic, but their efforts ultimately ended in failure. Using this incident to frame the Jedi Order for treason, Sidious declared that all Jedi were now enemies of the state."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was then that the Sith unleashed their secret weapon\u2014the Grand Army of the Republic. Sidious broadcast Order 66 to the clone troopers who were spread throughout the galaxy. The clones were embedded with inhibitor chips, technology embedded into their mind so that contingency orders could be established. Due to their hidden Inhibitor chips, implanted at the orders of Lord Tyranus, the clones complied without question, turning their weapons on the Jedi and executing them across numerous worlds, as well as inside the Jedi Temple. Darth Vader personally oversaw the Jedi's eradication, and, with the military under the Chancellor's control, and the Jedi all but destroyed, Sidious proclaimed himself Emperor of the first Galactic Empire. Ultimately, the Grand Army of the Republic was an asset that enabled Sidious to establish a Sith dictatorship over the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the formation of the Empire marked the end of the Old Republic, the Grand Army of the Republic became the basis of the Imperial Military\u2014the armed forces of the Emperor's new government. Accordingly, the Republic clone troopers transitioned into Imperial stormtroopers. With vast portions of the galaxy unconquered, the Empire embarked on a massive militarization program to eliminate the remaining Separatist holdouts, enforce the Emperor's authority, and expand the Empire's growing dominion. With the end of the Clone Wars, however, the Empire questioned the continued usefulness of the clones. The production of clone troopers was a \"cost prohibitive\" enterprise, according to Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin who believed that order could be maintained by a less expensive force of conscripted soldiers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time the clones' skills deteriorated with the accelerated speed of their aging process, leading the Empire to prefer human recruits and conscripts over cloned soldiers. By and large, clones were removed from combat duty and instead given the task of managing various Imperial projects. By this time many clones felt bitter and horrified at their actions during Order 66, even though it was out of their control. Clone Captain Rex, also known by his birth number CT-7567, went on to join the Phoenix Cell of the early rebel movement during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a mission to retrieve munitions from a crashed Separatist supply ship on the planet of Agamar, however, Rex and his allies, two of which were the Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus and his Padawan, Ezra Bridger, found a surviving Separatist holdout commanded by a ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid named General Kalani. Taking another member of their team, Garazeb Orrelios, captive, Kalani forced the Clone Captain and Jedi to fight a final battle of the Clone Wars to finally prove which faction was superior. Rex found himself determined to win the contest against his old enemies, but Bridger stopped the Clone Captain from killing Kalani when they reached the command center, having realized the clones, Jedi, and battle droids had all lost the war. The Padawan questioned who truly had won the conflict, and Orrelios then pointed out that the Empire had and that an Imperial force was arriving on Agamar. Though Rex was initially reluctant to join with the battle droids, Bridger convinced Kalani to fight the Empire alongside them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex did agree to join with the Separatists. Thus, the rebels and droids planned to delay the Empire's advance, giving them a chance to escape aboard Sheathipede-class transport shuttles. Once the rebels and droids stationed themselves in the hangar, Rex remarked that he was serving one last day in the Grand Army, and, after Kalani noted that he had never attempted such a desperate plan, Rex joked that it was the reason the Republic Military had always won. Kalani rebutted this, noting that there had been Republic loses during the conflict, before their combined forces engaged the Imperial walkers and stormtroopers. To take out one of the All Terrain Armored Transports, Bridger and Jarrus deflected blaster bolts into proton bombs, giving the rebels and droids their chance to flee. Though one of the battle droids' shuttles was taken out, the rebel's Sheathipede shuttle and the one containing Kalani and several B1 battle droids escaped the planet. Once off-world, both factions spoke via a hologram, and Rex and Kalani both agreed they had now all won the Clone Wars. Satisfied that the conflict was over, Kalani and his droids parted ways with the rebels, believing they would likely lose the war against the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Few clones continued to serve in the stormtrooper ranks after the Battle of Yavin; ISB Commander Alecia Beck believed Sergeant TX-828 to be one of the last Kamino-produced clones who were still in service to the Imperial Military.
