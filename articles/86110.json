This video game's story was written sometime around 2004 but, before the game was scheduled for production, Lucasfilm hit a difficult period in its history which culminated in the game's cancellation. This would go unpublicized for four years, until a reference book entitled Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts by Rob Smith was released. The book officially announced the game was both conceived and scratched. As the game was cancelled, Mandalore City is not considered to be a part of any official continuity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
