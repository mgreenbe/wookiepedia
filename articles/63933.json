Each chip was calibrated for a specific species, allowing the weapon to fire at a frequency that affected the species' central nervous system, causing fatigue and sleep. Hypersonic frequency chips were available for Humans, Sullustans, Rodians, Wookiees, and many other species. The chips cost 100 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
