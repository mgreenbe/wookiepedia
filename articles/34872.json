He estimates that there is a 97% probability that the signal originated there and that there is no evidence of slicing. While Lord Vader assembles his new lightsaber, Lord Vader requests a list of all individuals with access codes to Imperial systems at Level 1A1 and above. The droid identifies seven individuals: Corin Ferro, Wilhuff Tarkin, Jer Croteau, Cassio Tagge, Joon Strephi, Tomas Azoras, and Zorta Bingan. Vader thanks the droid before igniting his new lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ninth Sister brings Vader's starship out of hyperspace above Coruscant.

Realizing they are in imminent danger, Vader takes control of his starship. With Vader at the helm, they are able to dodge the missiles.

Upon landing, Vader emerges with the Ninth Sister and his floating droid, and exclaims that he has had enough."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Homecoming"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the ruined former Jedi Temple, the Emperor tells Vader that while he cannot regard his battle with Jocasta Nu a victory, he accepts that it is far from a defeat since he has managed to obtain her hoard of Jedi and Sith tools including a blue mask. Getting straight to business, Lord Vader informs the Emperor that he was the subject of an assassination attempt while on a mission with the Ninth Sister to Cabarria. He tells Vader that the contract originated from the highest levels of Imperial government."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader takes an interest in Lord Vader's lightsaber, which he regards as an improvement. The Emperor reassures Lord Vader that he did not issue the kill order since he would not require such indirect methods. When Vader asks if it was a test, the Emperor replies that he teaches rather than tests. Lord Vader tells the Emperor about the second attempt made on his life while returning to Coruscant.

A red-clad conspirator wearing a horned mask asks his co-conspirator who is dressed in blue and wearing a brown hood, about the identity of their target. His colleague doesn't know. The horned conspirator grumbles that setting up the mercenary contract in the Emperor's office failed to drive a wedge between Lord Vader and the Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hooded conspirator confirms this is the case, saying that Vader and the Emperor appear to have reach an accommodation.

He wonders whether Vader is a servant or a bodyguard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The horned conspirator thinks that Vader is more than a servant or bodyguard since the Emperor gave him control of the Inquisitorius program. He adds that Lord Vader has to go and believes that the Emperor will be easier to manage once Vader is gone.

As punishment, he has summoned five Imperial officers at random to be executed by snapping their necks with the Force. The assembled officers watch in horror and awe at the summary executions of their colleagues. After killing the officers, Lord Vader walks off the stage.
