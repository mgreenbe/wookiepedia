It was a docile herd animal similar to a bantha. They were covered in a hard shell-like skin that made the creatures appear like many of the large boulders that covered the planet's landscape; this camouflage aided them in hiding from predators. Their primary source of food was the grass that they shared their home with. They were hardy and impervious to blaster fire. Often, they were used as beasts of burden."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
