The debris field extended to the edge of the nearby Ringali Nebula. During the Galactic Civil War, this graveyard included remnants of capital ships, such as Imperial-class Star Destroyers, as part of the New Republic's Project Starhawk. It provided a first line of defense for the New Republic capital on nearby Chandrila."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Galactic Empire's assault on the New Republic's secret base at the Nadiri Dockyards, Titan Squadron attacked the Nadiri fleet who were fleeing the Nadiri Dockyards and using the debris field for cover as they limped to Chandrila, as the hyperdrives on both the Temperance and their new prototype Starhawk were damaged. After sustaining heavy losses, General Hera Syndulla re-routed the fleet through the Ringali Nebula toward Galitan, where they were cut-off from New Republic reinforcements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
