Kenobi discusses these events with two clone troopers of the 501st Legion as Skywalker uses the Force to put up decorations for Life Day. One such decoration gets out of his control and lands on Kenobi's head. Kenobi is displeased, but Skywalker gifts him with a new red sweater, which Kenobi puts on over his Jedi robes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Kenobi and the troopers continue to discuss the hologram, Skywalker brings another gift to Kenobi, this one being a blue double-bladed lightsaber. Excited, Kenobi turns it on, but the bottom blade mistakenly slices the hologram table in half. Kenobi becomes frustrated with Skywalker, who walks away dejectedly. Skywalker then brings another gift\u2013a Marksman-H training remote, which flies around, firing at the two Jedi as well as the clones. It continues to wreak havoc until Skywalker jumps on top of it with the gift box."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi is once again frustrated, but then Skywalker receives an idea whilst looking at the hologram of Grievous. While Kenobi paces around the room, Skywalker brings yet another gift, this one being the biggest one yet. He tears open the box to reveal that it is the cyborg General Grievous, who has a red bow on top of him. Grievous shakes off the bow and ignites his four lightsabers. Skywalker tosses the double-bladed lightsaber to Kenobi, who begins to duel with Grievous. Skywalker uses the Force to push Grievous away, who then sees a pair of shiny All Terrain Reconnaissance Transports. He jumps in one and rides away, laughing all the while. Skywalker and Kenobi are left standing alone in a room that is now very much destroyed. Kenobi then gifts Skywalker with a present of his own\u2013the very same sweater Skywalker had given him. The pair laugh together, enjoying the holiday."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone troopers seen in the short resemble the clone jetpack troopers from the 2020 LEGO Star Wars: The Clone Wars set titled 501st Clone Troopers.
