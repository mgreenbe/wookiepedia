The Mistryl representative Paloma D'asima met with the Imperial leaders, but the exposure of the plot led to the rapid ending of the alliance. Meanwhile, Jorj Car'das revealed to Shada D'ukal the true nature of the Eleven Elders' actions, perhaps heralding the start of a new beginning for the Mistryl."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
