He was to serve as backup for then-Agent Ysanne Isard who had been sent to Darkknell in 0 BBY to recover stolen data files relating to the first Death Star. During the mission, he shot and nearly killed Moranda Savich, due to the use of a Jedi mind trick to blur his vision by Hal Horn. After Isard summed that Horn knew who they truly were, she tried to have Trabler kill Horn, an attempt that resulted in Trabler's death with his own weapon at Horn's hands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
