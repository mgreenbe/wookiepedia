While in the Undervaults of Gwongdeen, Hondo Ohnaka encountered a blue tray laden with a number of these. He helped himself to a few and while doing so attracted the attention of a Kyuzo individual. Knowing the ferocious nature of the Kyuzo, Ohnaka smiled warmly and offered the individual a jogan tart, but he turned away without response. He was then nearly spotted by Mahjo Reeloo, who he was trying to avoid, and as a distraction spilled the jogan tarts and lined up with the Kyuzo, holding the tray to disguise himself a manner similar to the war helmets favored by the Kyuzo. The distraction seemed to work and Ohnaka offered the last Kyuzo in the group a tart after he noticed him, only to find that the tray was empty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
