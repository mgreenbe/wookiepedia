The terrorist group Justice Action Network bombed the Pica Rim Pipeline, a large underwater transportation system that lined the floors of the planet's oceans, in protest of the execution of its leader: Earnst Kamiel. A series of bombs ruptured and flooded a 4,000 kilometers section of the structure. Some 4,000 passengers were trapped in a monorail traveling through the Pipeline. Rescue workers were sent to save them but they were difficult to reach and the monorail was not designed to withstand the pressure of tons of water, making the passengers' situation critical."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
