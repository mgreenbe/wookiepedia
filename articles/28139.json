When the Republic reformed into the Galactic Empire, she began mentoring young Imperial propagandists for the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order. Her work dominated the early years of the Empire's expansion into the Outer Rim Territories, where her work included recruitment posters like Rise and If the Headgear Fits. When producing the piece Join she built upon the use of clone troopers in Clone Wars propaganda, replacing them with an Imperial stormtrooper to try and entice Imperial citizens to sign up. Her final known piece was Imperial Campaign Poster 34.371.C, which deviated from the standard strong, brutalist constructivism of most of her earlier work and was thought to be a direct response to the graffiti art of the Rebel Mandalorian Sabine Wren. Her attempt at copying the competition was not received well by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who had her arrested on trumped-up charges of treason, after which she vanished from all records."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coba Dunivee was first mentioned in Pablo Hidalgo's Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, a reference book released on October 25, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
