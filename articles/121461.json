The helmet incorporated a macrobinocular viewplate with an integrated sensor array, and breathing apparatus linked to a portable environment unit with inbuilt power cell pack and propulsion unit. Propulsion boots incorporated snap-down flippers, giving the soldier increased movement underwater. The armor was partially resistant to physical and energy attacks, since the armor was designed to withstand crushing ocean depths. The stormtrooper wore a standard utility belt, and was armed with a blaster speargun (a modified E-11 that doubles as a speargun) and concussion grenades."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
