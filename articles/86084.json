Donated to the community by the MandalMotors company, the hall served as a meeting place for Mandalorian clan chieftains to discuss matters of importance, either amongst themselves or with the Mand'alor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 40 ABY, current Mand'alor Boba Fett held a meeting in the hall with several chieftains, veteran mercenaries, and heads of companies including MandalMotors' own Jir Yomaget. The clan leaders and Fett discussed the direction Mandalore would take in the growing galactic war, in which Fett declared that Mandalore would remain neutral, but there would be no ban on individuals taking up mercenary work for either side. Also, at the behest of the Mandalorian known as Graad, Fett would issue an order for two million Mandalorians throughout the galaxy to return to Mandalore in order to help the ongoing restoration of the planet in the wake of the devastation incurred during the Yuuzhan Vong War. He would also declare Goran Beviin as acting Mand'alor during the meeting, for the brief time he would be away on a hunt for Jaing Skirata and a way to cure his terminal illness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
