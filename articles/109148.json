The Quad turbolaser cannon, which fired its barrels sequentially, was placed on a balcony overlooking a garden south of the Theed Hangar in the city of Theed. The turbolaser cannon had four barrels and a sloping front. On either side were power conduits. During the battle to retake the planet, the cannon's range was long enough to prevent the Naboo Security Force pilots from taking off to attack the Droid Control Ship, Vuutun Palaa, in orbit. The cannon was destroyed by the Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi when he used his lightsaber to slice through the two power conduits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The quad-barreled \"turbolaser cannon\" appears in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Obi-Wan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
