He arrived at a crash site of a Republic Gunship on a speeder after a brief skirmish between Clone Force 99 and a squad of B1-series battle droids. A BX-series droid commando approached him as the tactical droid projected an image of Admiral Trench. The commando addresed the hologram, reporting that the clones had used unorthodox strategies to defeat the droids. Later on, the tactical droid reported to Trench from an ambushed Separatist Outpost, informing the Admiral that he was unable to think of the logic of the attack that had occurred. The tactical droid later reported to Trench after the clones were chased out of the Cyber Center that they had made a connection with the planet Skako Minor while there, which alarmed Trench."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
