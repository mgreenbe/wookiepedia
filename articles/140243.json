Valance asks to finish his drink and points to several other Bounty Hunters' Guild members already standing around him. Xonr questions why Valance would ever let himself be trapped so easily, but Valance replies that he lured the hunters in and kills him with a charge in his cybernetic hand, since the rules of their code \"don't apply to the dead.\" Valance kills the other hunters in the bar before buying another drink."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Valance returns to his ship, the Broken Wing, he stops the Tarsunt following him.

Gwi introduces Valance to the team: Honnah, a Gamorrean tracker; Urrr'k, a sniper; Chio Fain, a \"possibly insane\" slicer; Arr-Nine-Nineteen, a droid who claimed to have hunted Jedi; and Dengar, whom Valance already knew.
