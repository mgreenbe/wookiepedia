He had red eyes, green skin, no hair and wore a brown head-dress and tan, decorative clothing. In 1 BBY, he was at the arena when the blind Jedi General Rahm Kota, who had been captured on a failed raid on that planet, was being forced to fight in the arena. When Starkiller, a clone of Galen Marek, reached Cato Neimoidia in a TIE Advanced x1 to free Kota, this aide informed Tarko, misidentifying the pilot of the ship as Darth Vader. He was told to assemble a squadron of stormtroopers to greet the ship's pilot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Neimoidian aide first appeared in Sean Williams' novel The Force Unleashed II, published on October 5, 2010.
