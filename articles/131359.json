A few lines of dialogue that were cut from the final film are present in the comic version, such as Dofine's panicked \"Blind me, we're done for!\" and Darth Sidious' first line to Dofine. Darth Maul also has more dialogue towards the conclusion of the story. Apart from these few exceptions, the comic is entirely true to the film."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Issues"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
