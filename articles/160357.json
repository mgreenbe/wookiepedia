It had a scanning range of ten meters and could scan a single target. It would gather data on heart rate, pupil dialation and temperature. It could cross-reference this information with an internal database and provide the wearer with data on the target's emotional state. It could only be programmed with one species at a time. It transmitted the results to the wearer through a system of simple pulses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
