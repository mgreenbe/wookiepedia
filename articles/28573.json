Each pod was 3 meters long and equipped with a fusion power generator. It could hold only one person but also carry 50 kilograms of cargo. It could hover 3 meters off the ground and move 120 kmh. It cost 1,500 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While originally only the Columi\u2014who created the pods\u2014could use them, technological advances resulted in versions for Humans, Hutts, Duros, Sullustans and Bith.
