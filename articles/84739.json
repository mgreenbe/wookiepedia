When he learned that Tula had prepared a meal for their guests, he protested, telling her that she didn't have to do his job. After eating, Organa asked whether the rooms they would be staying in had computer terminals, and Emkay-One offered to prepare one.

Markona met with the shuttle, who had been taken to the moon by the Galactic Empire's SCAR Squadron, having learned the rebels' location from torturing Sana Starros.
