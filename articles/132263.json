The project's official release was in 2021 although the first official branded material for the project was already released prior in December of 2020, in the form of a short story.

They stayed for a few days, spending most of their time discussing the project, but they also got to see a 4K screening of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.

In an announcement trailer, Project Luminous's name was revealed as being Star Wars: The High Republic. James Waugh, Lucasfilm's VP for Franchise Content and Strategy, explained that, with the end of the Skywalker saga looming with the release of Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the publishing branch of the company brought in some of the authors who had worked on previous tie-in materials and allowed them the creative freedom to fill-in the gaps with Star Wars stories beyond the reach of the films and the Skywalkers. Pablo Hidalgo, of the Lucasfilm Story Group who was involved in the Project Luminous writers' room, described the early process as giving the writers a blank slate and allowing them to choose what they wanted to write about and when. Eventually, the idea came from one of Obi-Wan Kenobi's earliest lines about the Jedi in A New Hope, about the Jedi being \"the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.\" Michael Siglain also explained that the story truly began to come together with the question \"What scares the Jedi?\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The project involved a variety of Lucasfilm members including Jason D.
