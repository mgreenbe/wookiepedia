When Wraith pilot Hohass Ekwesh strafed the spaceport with his X-wing starfighter, it caused an emergency blackout throughout the spaceport. What the Wraiths didn't count on were the two TIE Fighters, piloted by Sun Leader and his wingman, that launched and proceeded to pursue Ekwesh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Simultaneously, the group of Garik Loran and Atril Tabanne managed to capture Bunker Aleph-One, the spaceport's command bunker. Pretending to be the controller killed by Tabanne, Loran issued the recall command for the TIE Fighters just when Sun Leader's wingman was about to vape Ekwesh's fighter. Upon landing their crafts alongside the other TIE's that didn't launch, Loran's deception was caught and the information was relayed immediately to Sun Leader and his wingman. They tried to relaunch their fighters but were quickly shot down by the other two TIE's; piloted by Wedge Antilles and Falynn Sandskimmer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
