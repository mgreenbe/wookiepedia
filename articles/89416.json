Metamorphosis was intended to test young Dalnans in the skills required for the job they intended to pursue. After undergoing Metamorphosis, young Dalnans would no longer be considered children. Honesty Weft, the son of Ambassador Weft, wanted to join the Dalnan military as a medic, so his Metamorphosis would focus on skills such as hand-to-hand combat. He was upset about being brought along on a diplomatic journey to the Starlight Beacon space station in part because he was missing Metamorphosis, and would thus still be considered a child upon returning home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
