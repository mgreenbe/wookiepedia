The Jedi would remain there for the next eight centuries, until the Caamasi convinced them to act against the Republic. Although the Order itself remained on Ossus, some Jedi acted on their own against the Pius Dea, and some misguided Jedi even joined the Pius Dea. These Jedi settled on Garn, and went on to form the Order of the Terrible Glare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
