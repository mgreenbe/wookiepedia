One model of disruptor was the T-7 ion disruptor rifle, which were used by the Empire during the fall of the planet Lasan on its native Lasat population. The Aqualish weapon designer Amda Wabo later tried to sell a large supply of the weapons to Imperial Minister Maketh Tua, but was prevented from doing so by the crew of the starship known as the Ghost. Other model of disruptor included the T-8 disruptor, which was produced by the Empire, the Amban phase-pulse blaster, and the DX-2 disruptor blaster pistol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Capabilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "T-7 ion disruptor rifles were capable of disabling an All Terrain Defense Pod with a single shot, and were capable of short-circuiting an entire ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When fired upon a biological target, the victim was disintegrated atom by atom, resulting in a slow, painful death.
