Its poor inhabitants worked for the Elrood Quarry Corporation. The bodrite mines operated at full capacity during the summer. During the five local winter months, the mines were forced to shut down. Individuals could not carry weapons on Bodrin, small towns were closely knit and crime was rare. During the Clone Wars, Bodrin lay within Separatist space. The Shining Comet was headed to this planet with a group of miners when it was attacked by Consolidations Unlimited."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
