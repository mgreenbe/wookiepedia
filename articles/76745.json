Hapless and helpful, Klaud was brought into the Resistance, who he assisted with their mechanical needs. Klaud accompanied Poe Dameron, Finn, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 on a mission to the Sinta Glacier Colony. Believed to originally be a parts pickup, the mission's true purpose was hidden by the informant Boolio, who had First Order intelligence to deliver to the Resistance. The Millennium Falcon came under attack from TIE/sf fighters and TIE whisper fighters shortly after the handover, and Klaud was overwhelmed by the chase. Piloting the Falcon, Dameron eventually managed to escape the First Order, returning with the intelligence to the Resistance base on Ajan Kloss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war between the First Order and the Resistance, Klaud worked as a mechanic. He was eventually brought into the Resistance thanks to a case of mistaken identity. In 35 ABY, the Resistance was contacted by Boolio, a mine overseer at the Sinta Glacier Colony who had acquired information from an anonymous high-ranking First Order officer. As Boolio did not want to risk revealing the intelligence, Boolio claimed that he could provide a regulator required for the Resistance's CR90 corvette Tantive IV."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Resistance sent several operatives on the Millennium Falcon to meet with Boolio. As the mission was believed to be a parts pickup, Klaud accompanied Poe Dameron, Finn, Chewbacca, and the astromech droid R2-D2 aboard the Falcon. Dameron had requested Rey's help instead but was overruled by General Leia in favor of Klaud. None of the other members of the crew could understand Klaud, but since he displayed talent for mechanicals, Poe assigned him to continue repairing the ship. While the Falcon was on its way to the Sinta Glacier, Klaud made some repairs to the freighter. The Falcon arrived at the colony, where Boolio transferred the First Order intelligence to R2-D2. Before the Resistance operatives could depart, however, a number of First Order Special Forces TIE fighters and TIE whisper fighters approached the colony, chasing the Falcon through the icy corridors of the Sinta Glacier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Falcon navigated the corridors, Klaud was surprised by the chase and was knocked aside by the sharp turns the ship made. Cornered by TIE fighters, Dameron chose to lightspeed skip away from the Sinta Glacier, placing the Falcon into a number of dangerous locations, including the Megafauna Chasm of the Typhonic Nebula, the Mirror-Spires of Ivexia, and the Crystal Chaos of Cardovyte.
