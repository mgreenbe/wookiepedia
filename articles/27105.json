They resided there four millennia and maintained a vigil over the Keshiri and the Lost Tribe of Sith. In 2974 BBY, the city was visited by a Lost Tribe expedition which consisted of several Alanciari Keshiri and the two Sith Parlan Spinner and Takara Hilts. Spinner stole Dreypa's oubliette and awakened the ancient Sith Lord, who launched an uprising against the Tribe in Keshtah Minor. Meanwhile, the Doomed leader Kaliska and Takara Hilts managed to return to the City of the Doomed where they brought the entire Doomed community on a herd of uvaks to Keshtah to stop Dreypa. The entire Dooomed community were killed during the Battle of Sessal Spire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Dreypa was defeated at the Siege of Tahv.
