The duo flew a gold Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor from Jocasta Nu's school to the Coruscant Underworld for Nu to infiltrate the former Jedi Temple to retrieve a list of Force-sensitive children across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beetoo was left to await Jocasta Nu's return, of which was promised by the Chief Librarian to be soon, alongside the Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor. However, a group of Coruscant underworld police officers approached the area; as per a prior agreement with Nu, the droid notified the Jedi librarian of the intrusion before detonating the starship with the intention of protecting the Jedi's quest. This was not to be, however, as the remnants of Beetoo and the Delta 7B were recovered by the Imperial Security Bureau after a Jedi Order emblem originally a part of the starfighter was found by Imperial forces. Once brought to the ISB Central Office on Coruscant, Darth Vader was notified of the occurrence, and was invited to inspect the wreckage. After a short conflict with an unidentified Imperial Security Bureau major, of which briefly brought back the general forms of the Jedi starfighter and Beetoo through Vader's use of telekinesis, the Sith Lord triggered a search for a lone Jedi on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
