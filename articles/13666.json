Launching from the Integrity, the Jedi and Captain Davijaan\u2014leading Clone Flight Squad Seven\u2014rushed out to confront the Separatists. Kenobi and Skywalker fought their way past a swarm of over five hundred droid starfighters to the Invisible Hand, where Skywalker made a risky attack against the Separatist flagship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grievous himself witnessed Anakin's audacious assault, and though the little starfighter was no threat to his vessel, he was obligated to protect the lives of the Separatist Council members, and end the battle. The Invisible Hand opened fire on a refugee convoy attempting to flee the besieged planet, causing the deaths of approximately ten thousand innocents. This caught the Republic forces by surprise, and it allowed Grievous' fleet to escape into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the heavy losses, the Battle of Belderone was deemed a victory for the Republic, and representatives of the planet expressed their gratitude to the Senate.
