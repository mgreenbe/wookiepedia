After sneaking in and killing several clone troopers, the droids hard-wired the \"all-clear\" signal. The Republic survivors of the attack, Hevy, Echo, and Fives managed to escape to the outside of the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" and Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody\" arrived for a standard inspection, a droid disguised as a clone approached them in an effort to cancel the inspection. When Hevy alerted the clone officers with a droid attack flare, Rex shot and destroyed the disguised commando droid. They were subsequently ambushed and driven off the platform, with the Separatist droids believing that they were pulverized. Afterwards, 09, Unit 07, and 08, guarded the entrance to the base when Rex tricked them into opening the doors for Unit 26, a droid that was previously destroyed. When the doors opened, 09 and the other droids were destroyed, and the clones recaptured the base. A fleet of Separatist warships arrived overhead and deployed reinforcements, however."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "09 first appeared in \"Rookies,\" a 2008 episode of the first season of the TV-series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. 09 was identified in the episode guide released at that time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Soures"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
