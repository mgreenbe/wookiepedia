Odion was the eldest son of Xelian, a powerful female Sith Lord who ruled a realm of space within the Grumani sector. Odion's unpleasant childhood experiences at the hands of his mother and younger brother amplified his dark side powers and drove him to embrace a nihilistic philosophy which embraced death and nothingness as true peace. Odion rose through the ranks of the Sith, becoming a commander who led the invasion of Aquilaris Minor in 1042 BBY. With the collapse of the Chagras Hegemony in 1040 BBY, the Grumani sector descended into internecine civil warfare as feuding Sith Lords struggled for dominance. Odion subsequently gathered a cult of like-minded followers and established his own princedom which became known as the Odionate, one of the many Sith states which emerged from the ruins of the Chagras Hegemony."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odion's nihilistic ambitions earned him the animosity of his estranged younger brother Daiman, who saw himself as the Creator of the Universe, and the Jedi Order, which had been locked into a protracted conflict against Sith forces for nearly a millennium since the Fourth Great Schism in 2000 BBY. Odion was also constantly locked into a battle for galactic dominance against Daiman and other rival Sith Lords. At some point, he discovered the existence of the Helm of Ieldis, an ancient Sith artifact capable of driving sentient beings into a homicidal frenzy. Odion commissioned a task force known as Project Pandemonium to locate the artifact but they disappeared in 1039 BBY. Odion's actions also made him a target of the novice Jedi Knight Kerra Holt, who wanted to avenge the devastation of her homeworld at his hands. In 1032 BBY, Odion narrowly survived an ambush on the planet Chelloa which left him with grievous wounds. However, his life was saved by medical technology and he vowed to hunt down and destroy Kerra, who had wounded him during the climax of the Chelloan affair."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeking to retaliate against his younger brother, Odion sent the Bothan spy operative Narsk Ka'hane on a mission to Daiman's capital of Darkknell.

However, Narsk was intercepted by Jedi Knight Kerra, who overpowered him and destroyed both the datapad containing the data and the facility itself. Daiman retaliated by releasing the Bothan spy while feeding him with false intelligence about a business deal on Gazzari with the Quermian Sith Lord Ayanos Bactra relating to the sale of an arxeum, a mobile war university. In reality, Daiman planned to yet again lure Odion into a trap on Gazzari, where his forces lurked behind the planet's volcanic ash clouds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As expected, Odion took the bait and invaded Gazzari with both sides sustaining heavy losses. In the middle of the battle, their grandmother and family matriarch Vilia Calimondra contacted Narsk and ordered the two brothers to cease fighting and join forces against Bactra, who had outlived his usefulness to the dynasty. After wiping out Bactra's fleet, the two Sith brothers along with Lioko and Malakite conquered and divided up the Bactranate among themselves. Following this short-lived cooperation, tensions between the brothers quickly resurfaced during a family bequest where Odion was bequeathed the former Odionate capital of Jutrand while his younger brother obtained the Industrial Heuristics company. While Vilia managed to appease Odion by giving him two legions of her Trandoshan slave warriors as quid pro quo, Odion and Daiman remained bitter enemies and sought to thwart each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An opportunity to move against his younger brother surfaced again when an outsider\u2014the Hutt crimelord Zodoh\u2014threatened the Grumani sector.

Ultimately, Zodoh made no serious strategic gains and was subsequently executed by Daiman, following a failed attempt to conquer Darkknell. In retaliation for Odion's role in indirectly aiding Zodoh's campaign, Daiman would connive with Kerra to defeat Odion once and for all. Kerra infiltrated the Odionate disguised as a prospective Novitiate adept named \"Mercy.\" Meanwhile, Odion was determined to end the stalemate in the Grumani sector, and restarted Project Pandemonium.

At the peak of his power, Odion would harness the power of the Helm and use it to drive other sentient beings into a maddened homicidal frenzy. Following a successful test demonstration on Skarpos, Odion intended to deploy the Helm on the entire Grumani sector, and then the galaxy, by tapping into energies of the child captives of his planet-sized cloister on Vanahame as part of his plan to exterminate all life so he could be the sole sentient being in the galaxy. However, Odion's bid for galactic genocide was thwarted by his Jedi foe Kerra, who had succeeded in turning his second-in-command General Beld Yulan against him. During the ensuing climatic showdown, Odion was killed after the Helm overloaded from a surge of positive emotions when the captive children were freed.

His estranged relations with his younger brother Daiman stemmed from his childhood experiences when his mother Xelian openly favored his younger brother while regarding Odion as repulsive and ugly. This sibling rivalry was further compounded by his grandmother Vilia promising her empire to the heir that conquered the most territory. Vilia's actions led to a series of internecine conflicts known as the First and Second Charge Matricas. Since the day of Daiman's birth, Odion had experienced painful headaches which only increased his hatred of Daiman.

As Odion's dark side powers increased, he also found joy in learning how to make others run to destruction by channeling the misery around them.

During the assault, his forces also captured Aron and Mercia Holt, the parents of future Jedi Knight Kerra Holt. Through Mercia, Odion learned about the existence of the Helm of Ieldis, an ancient Sith artifact created by the Sith Lord Ieldis, who had lived prior to the Great Hyperspace War. The Helm was a dark side object capable of driving sentient beings into a homicidal frenzy. Odion initiated a task force called Project Pandemonium to locate and retrieve this artifact.

Odion also implemented a policy of capturing and imprisoning all the children within his realm within cloisters where they would be brainwashed into becoming pliable workers and warriors. Since his nihilistic politics rapidly drained the ranks of his armies, Odion had to use Force-sensitive recruiters known as Claimers to recruit more followers.

When Odion inquired about Daiman's movements, Jelcho informed him of Gorlan Palladane, who was acting as a spy for Odion, that supplied intelligence on the existence of Daiman's baradium operations. From a recorded transmission, Palladane claimed that all of Daiman's mining operations were permanently offline in an attempt to draw Sith attention away from Chelloa.

As he prepared to strike Holt down with his lightsaber, she played her final card by ordering the reprogrammed Gad-3 to open all containment fields, thus opening much of the space station to zero-gravity space. This triggered an explosion that wrecked large areas of The Spike, destroying many labor droids and killing many workers.

In an ensuing cat-and-mouse race in space, Holt's shuttle engaged Odion's gunship. Anticipating that Holt was going to ram her shuttle into his ship, he ordered his crew to open fire. However, the duel was interrupted by an incoming transmission from Lord Daiman. In a live broadcast from his Chelloan headquarters, a furious Daiman revealed to Odion that he had seized and tortured his informant, Gorlan Palladane.

To the relief of Jelcho, Odion chose to spare his crew due to the intelligence on Daiman's mining operations he had discovered from Holt. Rather than using his kinetic corruptors to destroy the surface of Chelloa, he ordered his elite Lightning Guard to be loaded into landing ships to capture Daiman's factories near the baradium mines.

At Jubalene, Odion and his Novitiates including \"Mercy\" were present with Odion during a combat duel pitting three Duros bankers against a rancor. The Duros had been duped into adopting Odion's nihilistic teachings and believed that they could embrace death by tackling a fully-grown rancor. With Odion exhorting them \"to end the pain,\" the three bankers entered into a berserker rage and attacked the rancor with their spears. Ultimately, their efforts proved futile and they were eaten by the beast in the presence of a satisfied Odion who commented that even Lord Bactra's bankers could be used for his own purposes when properly motivated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odion also added that he savored the deaths of individuals who had embraced death willingly, since it strengthened his connection with the dark side.

Odion explained that he could channel despair into a lust for destruction. Using an example, the Sith Lord attributed the Duros' berserker rage to the anguish and despair emanating from the millions of workers in Jubalene's military forge. Wayman expressed interest in Odion's \"rediscovery\" and asked if anyone could wield it.

Wayman's team including Kerra were assigned the task of continuing the research where the trail ended, beginning with the material available in his data center at Jubalene. At that point, Odion sensed a familiar presence in the room but could not discern who it was. However, Kerra escaped further notice with the arrival of his trusted protege General Beld Yulan who had arrived back from Vanahame rearmed and replenished for the invasion of Sarrassia. While Odion and Yulan departed to watch several of Bactra's former attorneys fighting a gundark at the arena, Wayman confided to Mercy about his discomfort that Odion favored Yulan and had thus kept him alive. He also expressed that he sensed a great emptiness in the force emanating through Odion's spirit. Wayman subsequently departed for the arena, leaving Kerra along with the computer.

Following the Invasion of Sarrassia, Odion received no further news from his team of Novitiates who were still hunting for the Helm of Ieldis. He decided to travel to the frontline itself, after learning from Wayman that they had gone to Skarpos. His shuttle landed at the top of the Morbollon Mesa where his forces had set up a garrison below. Upon arrival, Odion's forces were caught up in a three-way battle involving his cousin Malakite, who had sought to recapture the planet from Odion, and his estranged younger brother Daiman, who wanted the Helm for himself.

Despite his victory, Odion still expressed frustration that the Helm was a tight fit for his head and he did not known how to activate it. When Kerra attempted to goad him by telling him to fit a trash compactor on his head, the Novitiate leader Doyan offered to kill Kerra to atone for her failure to detect a Jedi infiltrator within their ranks. Odion replied that it would have been worth killing the entire squad of Novitiates had he not already known from the start that Kerra had infiltrated the Odionate.

Thus, the invasion of her homeworld had actually been a cover to capture the researchers for Project Pandemonium. Shortly later, Yulan and his search team arrived to report their findings.

Instead of fighting them, Odion used the Helm to compel the two enemy warriors and their steeds to turn on themselves and kill each other. Addressing a captive audience in the form of Kerra, Odion commented that the Helm of Ieldis had forcibly brainwashed them into accepting his own nihilistic rationale that the only way to end their own pain was through bloodshed and death.

Daiman himself narrowly survived an assassination attempt by his Kubaz double agent Glenk, who had earlier infiltrated Odion's Novitiates to monitor on Kerra and had revealed details about the Helm of Ieldis and Project Pandemonium to his Master, who also had ambitions of galactic dominance. However, Daiman was able to fight off Glenk and struck him with Force lightning, causing him to topple to his death beneath the Morbollon Mesa.

When Yulan expressed concerns about sacrificing his entire force on Skarpos, Odion merely rebuffed the General's concerns by telling him that his men's deaths were inevitable, and that the Helm merely hastened the process. A triumphant Odion then set on course for Vanahame, intending to harness the anguish and misery of the captive orphans within the closter there to power the Helm on a galactic level.

As a Sith, Odion was unable to understand why other individuals would willingly sacrifice their lives for people they did not know. For him life was meaningless and so was death. While Odion realized that the Holts had merely feigned devotion to his cause during Project Pandemonium, he still saw it as an opportunity to torment Kerra. He ordered Yulan to show the recording to her. However, rather than demoralizing her, the holorecording had the opposite effect. It merely galvanized Kerra to continue her fight against the Sith.
