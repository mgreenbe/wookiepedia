Despite their differences, she and her sister had a friendly relationship between them. When Bellan became the queen of Rendel, she imprisoned Zalla, afraid that she would use her powers against her. While she was a prisoner, a seed landed in her cell, carried by a gust of wind. Zalla used her powers on the seed, causing it to grow into a dense forest of thorn-covered vines.
