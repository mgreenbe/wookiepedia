The moon was a gray and barren satellite. Though the thin air required a breath mask and goggles, it did not require a pressure suit. Strong winds made movement difficult. Crevasses and canyons were common. Kane's hut, an old supply depot, was located on the moon, near his derelict spacecraft. When a Sith Knight discovered their hiding place, and Deak was killed, Kane and Annikin were forced to flee to Aquilae."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This moon orbited Ogana in the later first draft.
