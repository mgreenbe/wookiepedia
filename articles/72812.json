They would usually accomplish this through a combination of stubbornness, speed, and K'lial's smooth and pacifying voice.

While the guards were distracted, K'lial removed the codekeys for Moor's restraints from the pocket of the head security guard. When the guards protested K'lial became very indignant while he secretly unlocked Moor's restraints. When the guards then tried to arrest them for interferring with their prisoner, Diskio used a hidden remote to cause their landspeeder to crash through the lobby entrance and all three Rebel operatives were able to make their escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "K'lial was a member of the Xi'Dec species and was more sociable of the two due to being more humanoid in appearance. When attempting to free a Rebel agent it was very stubborn and insistent on getting its way, quickly dominating any conversation and ignoring questions and comments from others. It would march in, take command of the situation and escape before anyone else had a moment to think about what had just happened.
