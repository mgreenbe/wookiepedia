Kello flew a swoop to the rendezvous point where they were collecting the cargo, but no-one was there to meet the couriers and Kello became nervous. They were then attacked by a group of enforcers who were working for the Hutt Riboga. The enforcers detonated some thermal mines and Kello swerved his swoop to avoid the blast from one. However, he was killed moments later by a volley of blaster fire, which shattered the body armor he was wearing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
