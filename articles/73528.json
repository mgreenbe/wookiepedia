They breathed carbon dioxide and exhaled oxygen. Kalduu reproduced by fission. As they lacked vocal cords, Kalduu communicated telepathically. They could form a group mind if two or more Kalduu were within 60 meters of one another. This could be extended to their hosts, which were most often Ropagu, with whom they had a long-standing friendship.\nKalduu ate airborne bacteria as well as germs and viruses from their hosts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kalduu and the Ropagu had a symbiotic relationship.
