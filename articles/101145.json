In 22 BBY, the planet, home to a population of four million, became one of many worlds in the Mid Rim and Colonies regions to be affected by stone mites, genetically-engineered aggressive arthropods that fed on building materials. Unlike the other affected worlds, which reported only minor damage from the arthropods, Ord Tiddell was devastated. The mites ate through the foundation of Lagabee, Ord Tiddell's capital city, leaving the area in ruins and forcing the planet's population to flee off-world. The widespread destruction caused by the mites cost Ord Tiddell billions of credits, and many believed it was too late for any assistance from either the Republic or the Jedi Order to be effective."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Ord Tiddell was an Ordnance/Regional Depot in the Ord Tiddell system, a star system located in the Tennuutta sector of the Mid Rim.
