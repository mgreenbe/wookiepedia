By recruiting only the best scouts and explorers, Fernandin developed it into one of the finest independent scouting companies in the galaxy, with a reputation for excellence. They were often hired to discover new planets with raw materials or settlement potential by corporations. During the last years of the Republic, he scouted the planet Jedd Six. Fernandin was awarded several lucrative contracts within the borders of the Corporate Sector Authority, which kept his company in work for almost a decade before the Authority developed and deployed their own scouting teams."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fernandin finally retired from field work to take an active role in the business side of the company, but found that, during its reign, the Galactic Empire put a heavy restriction on new exploration and no longer wanted to develop new civilian settlement opportunities. Over the course of around five years, Fernandin lost his best employees, who left his service for more lucrative work in the corporate or government sectors, education positions, or even freighter hauling. When permits for new exploration came through from the Empire for the Yavin system, Fernandin led the expedition himself in an effort to keep his company alive. Officially, the scouting was in preparation for colonization by Wetyin's Colony, but the Empire was using the company to ferret out the system's secrets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Fernandin was a stout, middle-aged man with a thick, peppered beard.
