As a consequence, it would not share its orbital region with any other bodies of significant size, except for moons or those collected later under its gravitational influence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two types of planets existed in the galaxy: gas giants and terrestrial rocky worlds. Moons orbiting gas giants and other rocky worlds were usually not considered planets, even though they could be larger or more populated than other planets. However, Zonama Sekot was considered to be both at different time periods due to its unique mobile nature."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Depending on the tilt of its axis, a planet might have had varied seasons with changing temperatures and weather, affecting its habitability. Planets were extremely varied in terms of environmental conditions and landscape, ranging from completely oceanic, such as Manaan, Dac, and Kamino, to thick arboreal rainforests, such as Kashyyyk and Felucia. Some planets, such as Hoth, were completely frozen, while other planets, such as Nelvaan, were experiencing an ice age. Some planets, like Geonosis, Korriban, and Tatooine, were completely barren and desolate, covered in little more than rock and sand; others, such as Coruscant and Taris, became an ecumenopolis, in which the entire planetary surface was covered by one gigantic city. Many planets, like Dantooine, Naboo, Alderaan, and Corellia, contained a mix of landscapes, with various continents, oceans, and mountains."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most life-bearing planets had primarily nitrogen- and oxygen-based Type I atmospheres, though some, such as Dorin, Gand, and Skako, had unique atmospheres to which their native life forms had adapted. Gas giants, planets made up of primarily gaseous layers, were rarely inhabited, though they were sometimes used for resource collection (such as the Tibanna gas operations on Bespin)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some planets had a large collection of space debris orbiting them, referred to as \"rings.\" These rings ranged from being thin to being expansive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sentience"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sentience among planets, while rare, was not unheard of.
