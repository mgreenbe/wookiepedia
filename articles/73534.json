His only job was to occasionally intervene in the completely automated processes of the assembly line. Seventeen years after he had gotten this job, he was the unfortunate victim of assassin droid IG-88A, who had come to the planet with the intent of reprogramming the security networks. Part of this programming included elimination of all organic life forms. Twelve worker droids literally pulled Kalebb Orn to pieces before he could take his leave. He was apparently very overweight, which meant that he was unable to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
