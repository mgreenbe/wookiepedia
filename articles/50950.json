His freighter was attacked by three gunboats when Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo of the Chiss Ascendancy arrived. Fsir asked for Thrawn\u2019s help dealing with Vagaari pirates, which Thrawn suspected was a trap. Thrawn proceeded to play along with the trap, in order to learn about the enemy behind it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In reality, Fsir was remotely piloting the Watith gunboats from the Saltbarrel, aiming in such a way to cause minimal damage against his ships. Thrawn arrested and interrogated Fsir, who claimed he had been hired be an unknown alien to engage Thrawn's forces in battle and either destroy or at least delay them. Thrawn commandeered fourteen remotely piloted gunboats from Fsir's Saltbarrel, as well as Fsir's freighter itself. He would later employ the captured gunboats and freighter to try to prevent a civil war among the Chiss Ascendancy from unfolding above a mining world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
