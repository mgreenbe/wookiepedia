A large thermal oscillator was on the Starkiller Base superweapon. This prevented the planet from destabilizing. Starkiller Base used the power of a star to collect dark energy, which then was used to destroy distant star systems. In order to store this energy, the thermal oscillator generated an oscillating containment field which allowed the installation to expend considerably less power than normal at containing the vast amounts of dark energy it required to run."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One large thermal oscillator was located in Precinct 47 of Starkiller Base, where an attack was led by the Resistance to disable and destroy it before the weapon could fire on D'Qar. The attack was successful, preventing the firing of the superweapon and causing the planet to implode as the containment field failed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
