As punishment, he took one of every ten children away from their parents. But in exacting that retribution, Begubb made sure to choose only the smartest and the prettiest of children, taking the girl Pala Kwi'teksa from her mother, who wailed in sorrow as Pala was wrenched from her arms. Then, as with so many others, the Toydarian baron criminally sold the child into slavery on Tatooine, delivering her to the crimelord Gardulla the Hutt, her first master. In 37 BBY, Gardulla sold Pala to Madame Vansitt, to be trained in the fine arts of espionage, political blackmail and assassination, at Vansitt's Mos Espa 'Charm Academy'."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
