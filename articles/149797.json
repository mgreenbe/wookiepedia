The Jedi haven fallen. Alderaan has been destroyed. But these Scouts, Leaders, Troopers, and Force Users still have hope for a brighter future.

Even as it continues to develop the cycle's support for decks that feature two or more affiliations, Trust in the Force follows the march of General Veers and his Walkers across the frozen surface of Hoth. It lends support to those massive war machines with a new Scum objective set that protects and enhances your Vehicles. And it peers into the hidden corners of Hoth and Tatooine, where Jawas, Rebel Troopers, and Jedi Masters all work in secret to rally new forces against Imperial tyranny."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is not a standalone game experience.
