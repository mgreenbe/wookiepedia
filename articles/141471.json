During his tenure as ambassador in 18 BBY, the King of Mon Cala, Lee-Char, undertook a new secret advisor, and Lee-Char became involved in precarious economic discussions with Telvar in Dac City to rearrange their trade proposal. During one of these negotiations, Telvar informed Lee-Char that the entire situation boiled down to whether or not Mon Cala wished to remain as part of the Empire. Lee-Char objected, pointing out that the trade proposal would allow the Empire to take Mon Cala's resources away until they were in poverty. Telvar insisted that the trade proposal allowed the Empire to protect Mon Cala, but was rebutted by Lee-Char by expressing that there were no enemies of the Empire and that the galaxy was at peace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the exchange, Telvar informed Lee-Char that he respected his position and that he would brief Lee-Char's concerns to his superiors, and in the meantime it could be considered that there could be an annual cap on kelpite strand beam shipments to the Empire, but continued by saying that Lee-Char's inflexibility would do no good, and stated that they were all on the same side. The Mon Calamari Raddus countered, stating that the battleship in orbit showed otherwise, though Lee-Char quickly suppressed Raddus' outburst. After the heated exchange, Telvar stated that he would take his leave, and that he looked forward to resuming discussions, insisting that they were on the same side and hoped that it would remain so. Telvar soon contacted the Sovereign to inform them that he would be returning to the vessel shortly, and that his negotiations were \"unproductive, but on-going.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fruitless deliberations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Telvar returned to his Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, Lee-Char and Raddus observed, and conversed, stating that negotiations did not go well. Raddus continued, describing Telvar as a \"pompous dryskin fool,\" communicating that he held all the cards, and exclaimed that Mon Cala should secede from the Empire, expressing that they receive no benefits from the Empire while it sought to take everything from Mon Cala. Lee-Char countered as they observed Telvar reaching the landing platform with his trooper escort, saying that he didn't believe that they were at the point of secession. As Raddus continued, they observed a black Zeta-class shuttle landing on another nearby landing platform. As the Inquisitorius, Darth Vader, and a group of elite Purge Troopers were greeted by Lee-Char's Chief of Security Gial Ackbar, Telvar boarded his shuttle. As Vader stated that they were hunting an enemy of the Empire and Ackbar responded by saying that there were no such enemies on Mon Cala and that the king was in peaceful trade negotiations, Telvar's shuttle departed but violently exploded midflight.

Tarkin asked whether it was an attack, a sabotage, or a malfunction. The lieutenant stated that the cause was unclear, and they were still in the process of gathering data. Tarkin ordered the lieutenant to inform Major Rantu to deploy landing craft on his authorization, and that Colonel Bergon and Commander Jordo were to commence their phases of the operation.

Tarkin countered by stating that an Imperial envoy was assassinated, and that either he was killed by orders from Lee-Char or the population was not in control, which would merit a military response. Lee-Char rebutted, exclaiming that Mon Cala was not involved with the death of Telvar and that his death would not serve a purpose. Tarkin stated that if Lee-Char were correct, then he should order his forces to stand down and allow an Imperial investigation to look into the matter. Lee-Char reiterated, stating that they were not investigating, rather invading, and that continued attacks would be met with an aggressive response. When Tarkin asked if it was a threat, Lee-Char stated that it was rather a warning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the invasion Lee-Char took refuge in the Royal Command Bunker as the war escalated. Vader soon arrived at the bunker and dispatched its five guards before disarming Lee-Char. Vader then took Lee-Char to a window, where they watched as Tarkin began bombarding the northern hemisphere of Mon Cala. Lee-Char's Jedi advisor, Ferren Barr, arrived at the bunker and confronted Vader. During the duel, Barr revealed he was the one who assassinated Ambassador Telvar, igniting the war on Mon Cala. Upon hearing the revelation, Lee-Char quickly ordered a planet-wide ceasefire and contacted Tarkin, informing him that he was deceived and was ready to surrender. Tarkin accepted, but continued the planetary bombardment for some time until Lee-Char was arrested and Barr was killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Telvar was a human male with light skin, brown hair, including a mustache, and blue eyes.

During the negotiations, Telvar also acknowledged and respected the position of King Lee-Char, and was willing to pass on Lee-Char's concerns to his superiors.
