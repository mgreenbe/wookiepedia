While the two were heading to the top of the tower, the lift was unexpectedly shut down. Using his comlink, Obi-Wan told R2-D2 to fix the problem, but Anakin instead impatiently cut a hole in the roof of the lift. Meanwhile, R2-D2 managed to reactivate it, first sending it down and forcing Anakin to hang onto a ledge, but then correcting its direction to up at the urgent request of Kenobi. Two security battle droids held Anakin at gunpoint, but the Jedi leaped onto 31174 as it ascended by, and the droids were destroyed.
