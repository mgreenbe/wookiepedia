Discovered to be Force-sensitive soon after her birth, Meloria was inducted into the Jedi Order to be trained in the ways of the Force. Meloria passed through her training half-heartedly; always resenting the fact that her destiny was supposedly predetermined. During her upbringing within the Order, she came to like the physical aspects of the Force above all else, and her quick reflexes and fighting prowess only grew as she immersed herself in martial studies. After a time, she was selected as a Padawan by a Jedi Master, who was greatly impressed with her extraordinary abilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the path of a Jedi Guardian, Meloria gained the rank of Jedi Knight. Shortly after her graduation, however, her trust in her reflexes betrayed her. While attempting to arrest a bounty hunter, Meloria accidentally killed an innocent bystander. She became distraught and found herself unable to deal with the anguish; she severed all ties with the Jedi Order and vowed to never use the Force again. Meloria fled to the nearby planet of Drall, where she made her home within a cave on a small island in the Boiling Sea. She lived on the island alone for quite a while, farming the land to survive and becoming forgotten by the rest of the galaxy. Her isolation only served to deepen her sense of loss, and soon she settled upon a drastic decision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now thirty years old, Meloria used the last of her savings to purchase a cryogenic hibernation capsule. Safe inside her cave, she then froze herself within the unit.
