Because of this, visual scanning of targets and hostile fighters was reduced to almost nothing, forcing pilots involved in a voidfight to rely on other forms of instrumentation for the most part. Caet Shrovl, an albino Shistavanen Wolfwoman, was known to be highly-skilled in voidfights due to the nature of her condition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
