The guards were heavily armored including a distinct helmet that covered the majority of the head. The guards were equipped with blaster weapons, but their heavy armor made using the weapons difficult. During the overthrow of the royal court in the Battle of Solay, the royal guard proved ineffective in preventing the rebels led by Raggold and the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker from capturing the King."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, Skywalker found the attacks of the guard to be incredibly feeble, and he was easily able to knock the soldiers off of their feet. Their heavy armor put them off-balance, allowing the rebels to easily outmaneuver them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
