Black market pet shops often sold juvenile stratts. Crime lords were known to use them as guard animals. Some unwary buyers purchased them without knowing they would eventually grow to nearly two meters snout to tail and prowl about at night. Their dark fur made them difficult to spot in the shadows. Over the years, enough stratts escaped from captivity on the planet Coruscant that a self-sustaining population was formed in the lower sublevels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
