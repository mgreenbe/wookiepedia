A group of senators including Bail Organa and Padm\u00e9 Amidala agreed to oppose the bill when Cad Bane's gang of bounty hunters took control of the Senate Office Building, demanding Ziro the Hutt's release from prison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bill would allow the Supreme Chancellor the unprecedented ability and broad powers to spy on Republic citizens who were suspected as being Separatists.
