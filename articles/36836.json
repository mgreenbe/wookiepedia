The star Demophon was known to be unstable, and the Demophon Stellar Monitor Station was established to monitor it. The observatory was sabotaged, so the impending supernova was not discovered until a few weeks before its occurrence, far too late to evacuate the entire population. When the star exploded it destroyed all habitation in the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
