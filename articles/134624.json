The comic was originally to be published as part of the Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens publishing program in December 2015, but was delayed multiple times. Despite this, certain variant covers of the comic still display the Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens banner. The comic, written by James Robinson with art by Tony Harris, tells the story of how C-3PO received a red-colored arm, as seen in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. The comic was later collected in the hardcover compilation of the miniseries Star Wars: Shattered Empire on September 13, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Publisher's summary"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A crash-landing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The comic opens with a starship crashing on the planet Taul. Emerging from the burning wreckage, C-3PO tells the other five droid passengers to keep moving and asks if anyone has seen Captain Hoff and his crew. He laments that the ship's reserve tanks did not eject on re-entry and fears they will blow up.

C-3PO says that no one made him the leader and that he was only stating an opinion. With Captain Hoff dead, C-3PO says it is up to them droids. VL-44 beeps, but C-3PO scolds him for his rudeness and says that he has more field experience than his rudimentary circuits can even imagine. VL-44 beeps back and C-3PO replies that he is not suggesting that he knows more than him.

The first droid is PZ-99, a military-grade class four sentry droid, who had seen action during the Battle of Jakku. PZ-99 beeps in response.

C-3PO says that it is ill advised to include Omri in the team due to his status as a First Order prisoner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, C-3PO admits that the transporter's faulty guidance parallels delivered them into a highly unfortunate strait. He tells Omri that they have only a short amount of time before Admiral Ackbar is interrogated and summarily executed by the First Order. He stresses that it is vital to get Omri to the Resistance base with the location of where Ackbar is being held. Omri admits he has not heard of Ackbar, the famous Rebellion hero.

C-3PO explains that security droids like PZ-99 are programmed to fight, but also have a secondary directive to protect non-combatants around them.

When C-3PO asks if he has nothing else to say about PZ-99's sacrifice, Omri replies that they are enemies since their programming has put them on opposite sides. He adds that PZ-99 loss is his gain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Continuing their journey, C-3PO chats with Omri, noticing that he is bothered by the fact that their memories are in the hands of their makers.

Omri admits hating this planet, a sentiment shared by C-3PO who remarks that it is a dreadful planet since the six of them have been reduced to just three.

During the promotional period of both The Phantom Pain and The Force Awakens, fans noted the similarity in the arms, and it subsequently became a minor meme featuring crossovers between the two series. The similarity also caught the attention of Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima, who shared several of the memes on Twitter. Kojima is also a real-life friend of J.J.
