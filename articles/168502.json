He served as Captain of the Guard, however later, the Black Sun became a member of Maul's Shadow Collective after Savage Opress, Maul's brother, killed the leaders of Black Sun for refusing to join Maul's cause. Due to this, Moj became the subsequent leader of the Black Sun, and as a member of the Shadow Collective, Moj fought during the Death Watch coup on Mandalore to help further the Shadow Collective's goals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a leader of Black Sun, Ziton attempted to force the Pyke Syndicate's leader Marg Krim to merge their two syndicates. When Krim refused, Ziton kidnapped Krim's family in an effort to force Krim to reconsider his decision.

Moj met with the intruders with a battalion of Black Sun foot soldiers, and Maul requested an audience with the leaders of Black Sun. Moj believed that the meeting would end with the deaths of the interlopers, but allowed them to enter. Maul, Savage, and the leader of Death Watch, Pre Vizsla, entered the chambers of Xomit Grunseit and the other leaders, but they refused to join Maul's Shadow Collective. Due to this, Maul had Savage throw his double-bladed lightsaber across the table, killing every one of the leaders sat there. This move left Moj the highest ranking member of Black Sun, and due to the display he had witnessed he decided to join Maul, which officially brought the Black Sun into the Shadow Collective."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul would then receive the support of the Pyke Syndicate and the Hutt Clan, and with these assets backing him the Sith put his plan into motion. Moj was present for a briefing given by Maul, which outlined their plan. Moj, his Black Sun foot soldiers, Savage, and the Pykes would attack the Mandalorian capital of Sundari, and this would be used to make the current ruler of Mandalore, Duchess Satine Kryze, look weak. Satine's pacifist government would fail to hold back the attack, but then Death Watch would arrive and \"stop\" the criminals. This move would put Pre Vizsla into power, and remove Satine, allowing Death Watch to rule the planet, the long standing goal of that organization. With this Maul planned to expand in the shadows with support from Vizsla."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moj and the rest of the attackers arrived on Mandalore, and caused their disruptions across the city from the docks all the way to locations like Peace Park.

This move put Maul in charge of Death Watch, and with this they transitioned to be the Mandalorian super commandos. Maul's plan was ultimately put on hold however, due to his old master: Darth Sidious. Sidious killed Savage, and captured Maul.

After Kurg had left, he confronted Ventress, recognizing her as one of the intruders who had rescued the children.

The hunters and Tezzka then took the opportunity to escape the palace in Ventress' ship Banshee. Ziton ordered his remaining guards to pursue them but the intruders managed to escape with their hostages back to the Pyke stronghold of Oba Diah.

The prison was run by Dooku's government, the Confederacy of Independent Systems, but two of Maul's Mandalorian commandos, Rook Kast and Gar Saxon were ordered by Almec able to break in and rescue Maul. This was done, and Maul was returned to Mandalorians on Zanbar, but they were quickly found by the CIS.

Seeing that Maul was not going to deploy his fleet to aid them and believing that the entire collective had become a liability, Ziton broke the Black Sun's ties with the Shadow Collective. At the same time, Fife broke the Pyke's ties with the collective as well. The two deactivated their holograms, officially disbanding the collective.
