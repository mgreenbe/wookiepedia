Fett turned the tables on Bossk after killing many of the hunters and sending their corpses in a shuttle to Bossk's ship. The assistant, believing the shuttle to contain Solo's frozen body, was killed when the shuttle exploded upon reaching Bossk's ship, foiling the Trandoshan's plans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
