Rumor suggested that it killed all of its design team as soon as it obtained awareness, and then destroyed its own schematics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For a time, HN-TR1 \"worked\" by hunting rebels. HN-TR1's features included armor, a light repeating blaster and a sonic blaster in its left arm, broad-band antenna, flamethrower and long-range and movement sensors. Rebel commander Derembus Sitnalta considered him a threat greater than IG-88. Around 4 BBY, HN-TR1 was hired by loanshark Ploovo Two-For-One. Ploovo then assigned HN-TR1 to collect money from debtors in Ploovo's Protocol Team. Fellow Protocol Team member Lotas, a cyborg, admired his droid partner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Glite-Ven hostilities, HN-TR1 noticed the sadistic droid EV-4D9 and expressed his interest in it, an interest shared by Lotas. Following their advice, Ploovo purchased EV-4D9, who became a new member of the Protocol Team. Lotas respected EV-4D9's darkly analytical functions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
