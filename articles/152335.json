He was present at a riot in front of the Corellian Embassy on the Galactic Alliance capital planet of Coruscant. As Corellians began fighting with CSF cops and Coruscanti, who were protesting over the poisoning of the water supply by Corellians, the police fired dispersal gas into the rioting. During this, Jedi Ben Skywalker, who had been observing the situation, got caught in the dispersal gas and the rush of the crowd. Seeing Ben almost trampled, the officer pulled him out of the chaos to safety. At that point Barit Saiy, a Corellian youth, shot at the officer with a blaster. However, Ben deflected the bolt with his lightsaber, saving the officer's life and preventing an escalation of violence that would have resulted from the killing of a police officer. Ben, lying, told the officer it had been a rock. With gratitude, the officer offered to take Ben home but was declined."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The individual appears in Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines written by Karen Traviss and published on August 29, 2006."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
