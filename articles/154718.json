The smugglers ran supplies for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, an activity that brought them to the attention of the Galactic Empire after an Imperial raid on the Ulkantha asteroids produced evidence of the clandestine activity. Darth Vader's personal squadron of TIE starfighters, Death Squadron, then led a second raid on the shadowport to break up the Sakiyan organization."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
