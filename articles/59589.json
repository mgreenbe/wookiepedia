He was already leaning over the control panel as Slave I's onboard computer executed the command; with a hiss, the hatchway door closed behind him. With a few quick jabs at the controls, he silenced the alarm siganls once again. Even from this distance, where the visible details of his enemy's ship were little more distinct than the stars behind it, he could recognize the vessel. It's Xizor. The outline of the Falleen prince's flagship were unmistakable - and intimidating. The ship was known to be one of the deadliest and most thoroughly armored in the galaxy. If Slave I had gotten into a full-pitched battle with it, there wouldn't have even been this much of Boba Fett's ship hanging together.\nThe mystery of why the Vendetta hadn't moved in for the kill was easy enough to determine. He's holding back, decided Fett. Just waiting to see if there's any sign of life. Prince Xizor was known to be something of a trophy collector; it would be entirely consistent with him to want the hard physical evidence - the corpses - of those he had set out to kill, rather than just blowing them into disconnected atoms drifting in space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is a gallery of the different cover variations of Hard Merchandise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
