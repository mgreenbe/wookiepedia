CryoBan broke down quickly, releasing the heat back into the environment. It was capable of destroying electronics, Droids and vehicles which were not adapted for cold temperatures; if a person was exposed to CryoBan the affected area would experience numbing cold and, unless treated with Bacta immediately, risk severe nerve damage and loss of limb. These properties also made it an excellent fire suppressant. Weapons technology using CryoBan used elements adapted from the carbon-freezing process to freeze targets. Weapons made using this technology included CryoBan rifles, CryoBan grenades and CryoBan cells."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
