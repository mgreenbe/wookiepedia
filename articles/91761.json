However, the clones had rebelled and killed all of the scientists at the facility. While exploring the facility, Korr encountered Alpha, a clone who bore resemblance to Jedi Master Kam Solusar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alpha attempted to kill Korr and feed him to \"Mother,\" a Spaarti cloning cylinder. Korr, however, dueled and defeated Alpha, killing him. In the duel, Korr lost three of the fingers on his right hand as well as the green-bladed lightsaber he created upon becoming a Jedi Knight. Jaden concluded the duel with the purple-bladed lightsaber he had crafted as a boy, before formal training. During the conclusion of their duel, Alpha's lightsaber shorted out, which left the clone open to Jaden's deathblow. After the deadly confrontation, Jaden considered discarding Alpha's unstable, red-bladed lightsaber, but instead he chose to keep it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moments after Jaden had left the cloning facility, he was ambushed by the Anzat Kell Douro.

Douro overwhelmed the weary Korr and managed to achieve his epiphany just as a recovered Faal arrived.
