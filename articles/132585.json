On Coruscant, Theron Shan\u2014an agent of the Republic Strategic Information Service\u2014interrupts a meeting between Black Sun and a Twi'lek smuggler named Teff'ith, whom Shan subdues after defeating the Black Sun thugs. Shan is called in by the SIS Director, who sends Shan on a mission to locate and retrieve Ngani Zho because he had reappeared near Imperial space after a decade of absence. Zho had raised Shan as a child after his mother, Satele Shan, gave him up to continue serving as a Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time, Darth Mekhis\u2014now scarred from her encounter with Satele Shan a decade prior\u2014tests the warship Javelin Dreadnought and sends her Sith Knights to capture Zho. Theron Shan brings a captive Teff'ith along for the ride as he tracks down Zho on the planet Taris, but their reunion is disrupted by the arrival of Mekhis' Sith Knights. The two flee back to Shan's ship, and Teff'ith begrudgingly aids them in their escape to save herself from the Sith Knights; as they depart Taris, Shan questions Zho about his absence, and Zho has a mental breakdown as he tries to force Shan to take them to the Vesla system\u2014one of the seven systems ceded to the Empire during the Treaty of Coruscant. Shan tranquilizes the crazed Jedi Master, and he then sets out for the shadowport of Port Nowhere to acquire the navigational data necessary to get to the Vesla system.

The trio then heads to the Vesla system, where Shan sets them down on one of the outlying planets and they spend the next few days constructing a spy ray to survey the inner planets and see what the Empire is doing in the system. With the spy ray, Shan discovers that the inner planets have been destroyed by various weapons technologies, and Zho's memories return completely as Shan identifies the Sun Razer: a massive space station around the system's sun that is siphoning the star's materials and energies to produce massive superweapons.
