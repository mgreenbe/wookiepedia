Her sister, Norra, was a pilot for the Alliance to Restore the Republic; during Norra's absence, Esmelle and her wife Shirene watched over Norra's son, Temmin. Esmelle had pale skin, and, like her sister, silver hair.

Esmelle was a rebellious adolescent who led a gang of hooligans in the Akivan city of Myrra when Norra was born. She had a same-sex relationship with another human woman named Shirene. The couple lived at a house on Orchard Hill."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Temmin was twelve years old, Esmelle and Shirene became his guardian after her younger sister Norra when to search for her husband Brentin Lore Wexley, who had been imprisoned by the Galactic Empire. Temmin proved to be a clever but strong-willed and rebellious adolescent for Esmelle and her wife to handle. By the time that he was fourteen, Temmin had moved back to his family home which he turned into a junk shop. Despite moving out, Temmin still kept in touch with Esmelle and Shirene.

After learning that Temmin had moved out, she met up with Temmin only to be separated after mother and son were pursued by stormtroopers. Norra quickly discovered that Temmin had not returned. When Esmelle remarked that Temmin would be fine, Norra criticized her older sister for allowing him to run a junk shop and get involved with criminals. Esmelle responded in a tongue and cheek fashion by telling her younger sister that she had raised him to be smart and independent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Norra then scolded Esmelle for not being a good parent to her son. Esmelle responded by criticizing Norra for leaving her son behind to join the Rebel Alliance. Esmelle also attributed Temmin's association with criminals to her brother-in-law Brentin's arrest at the hands of the Imperial authorities. Norra sprung to her husband's defense and pointed out that he had relayed messages for the Rebellion and helped bring about the New Republic. Esmelle countered by remarking that Norra had won the war but lost her son."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before a fight could break out, Shirene diffused the situation by offering Esmelle and Norra tea.

When Norra remarked that droids could not be friends with sentient beings, Esmelle pointed out that Mister Bones had protected Temmin from a gang of bullies. Norra was not happy to be reminded of her failure to be a proper mother. When Esmelle criticized Norra for her involvement in the Rebellion, Norra countered that war was coming to Akiva and that no amount wishing would change that fact.
