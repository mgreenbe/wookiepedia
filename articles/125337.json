Sienar Fleet Systems used this installation to design, build, and test TIE prototypes. Security at this location was tight, and a wing of TIE/LN starfighters based out of Curamelle guarded the airspace above it. Residents of the area occasionally saw odd-looking starfighters flying from this installation. Students of the nearby Dammon University who were foolish enough to describe these strange sightings on the galaxywide newsnet disappeared soon after making their reports."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
