However, the messages were confusing and contradictory. Jedi Master Yoda also sensed danger was coming through the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outside the Jedi Temple, the Yinchorri were in position and ready for attack. All of this was being watched from a nearby skyscraper by Darth Sidious' apprentice Darth Maul. He informed his master that the Yinchorri had begun their attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, outside the Temple, the Jedi Jude Rozess was on guard duty when she was suddenly attacked by a Yinchorri donning a flutter-pack. Jude fought him, though her lightsaber was disabled by his powerful cortosis shield. Having immobilized her, he told his comrades to attack before the Jedi were aware of their presence while he attempted to kill Jude. He gripped her with his massive hands and strangled her. However, Jude also killed him by reactivating her lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back in the Temple, the Yinchorri task force found that all the sleeping quarters were empty. The troops then entered a chamber where they were met by several armed Jedi, including Yoda. In the end, almost all the Yinchorri were killed while only two Jedi died: Jude Rozess and Tieren Nie-Tan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoda interrogated the last remaining Yinchorri and asked him the location of the Yinchorri high command. The soldier responded to the Jedi Master by telling him that he did not know since he was only an ordinary soldier. Yoda then turned to converse with Soon Bayts, a Jedi Knight who brought word from Adi Gallia and Eeth Koth that their high command was not on Yitheeth and that they were heading to Yibikkoror to help Plo Koon and Micah Giiett. Meanwhile on Yinchorr, Mace Windu's team was safe and they did not engage the Yinchorri in combat at the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These distractions gave the Yinchorri in the temple enough time to grab his weapon and attempt to shoot the Jedi. Yoda threw him against a wall, presumably killing him. The Jedi then came to the conclusion that the Yinchorri were misguided rather than bloodthirsty and that the attack may have been the work of an unknown party, rather than the Yinchorri themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
