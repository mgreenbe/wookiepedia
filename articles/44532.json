Still a young man in 2 BBY, Engret joined up with Rekkon after his sister, a legal scholar who was vocal in her disagreements with the Corporate Sector Authority, vanished. Their investigation into the Corporate Sector's rash of disappearances led them to the Authority Data Center on Orron III, which Engret, Rekkon and three comrades spent over a month slowly infiltrating. However, on the day the team was supposed to finish their mission and leave the planet, Engret too disappeared: one of his fellows, Atuarre, stopped by his billet and found it empty, and intuited that it was under Authority surveillance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Engret was first mentioned in Han Solo at Stars' End, written by Brian Daley and released in 1978.
