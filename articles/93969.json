Due to the limited number of handlers, Murell's rotation prevented the handler from having time to both visit the mess hall and get enough sleep. As a result, Murell and the other handlers were supported by food runs from other personnel. One day, in 3 ABY, the runner Chase Wilsorr delivered food and caf to Murell and fellow handlers Baesoon and Jordan Smythe during their shifts at the tauntaun pens. Murell took a share of the delivery gratefully."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Murell appeared in the short story \"A Good Kiss,\" written by C.B.
