There in the abandoned city, Rebel forces managed to escape the shuttle and hide in a skyscraper, though they were eventually found by Task Force 99. After engaging Rebel forces and bringing the building down, Task Force 99 continued to engage the Rebels among the wreckage, and following a brief speeder chase, were forced into the sewers to avoid a Rebel-controlled modified Armored Assault Tank Mk I. Using explosives, Task Force 99 destroyed the road, causing the tank to fall into the sewer, where Admiral Verette was then captured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the skirmish on the Ghost Moon, General Crix Madine forwarded an official document to General Pitt Onoran about the 501st's Task Force 99. In the communique, General Madine stated that he believed that the extermination of Rebel troopers were conducted by Imperial SCAR troopers, and attached a document detailing elite stormtrooper squads, and further information regarding the SCAR program and how Task Force 99 was attached to an elite legion who answered to the highest levels of Imperial High Command. The documents additionally recorded an analysis of the Primtara incident perpetrated by Task Force 99, as well as documents of its members.

After entering the Harbinger, Task Force 99 sabotaged several systems, and jettisoned the bodies of a rebel maintenance crew after defeating them. Task Force 99 then split into three groups, with a three members neutralizing the bridge, another group of three, including Sergeant Kreel, securing the hallways to maintenance, and a lone member securing the engine room, where the Rebel droids R2-D2 and C-3PO were located. However, rebel forces fought back Task Force 99 at all locations, with Sergeant Kreel engaging Luke Skywalker in a lightsaber duel, while Princess Leia Organa and Captain Han Solo maintained control of the helm and Chewbacca aided the rebel droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within the hour, the Harbinger arrived on Tureen VII and attacked the Imperial blockade, which was caught by surprise. During the duel with Skywalker, Kreel remarked that Task Force 99 would have destroyed the Harbinger if ordered to do so, but Darth Vader had other plans for the special forces group. With the battle intensifying, Vader arrived in his TIE Advanced x1. At that time, Task Force 99's members began losing control of the situation aboard the Star Destroyer, and were each summarily defeated. Kreel was then incapacitated by Skywalker while dueling and additionally reporting to Vader. With the Rebels destroying Imperial forces in orbit and on the surface, Task Force 99 proceeded to destroy the Harbinger as the Rebels escaped.

When Vader's starfleet, the Imperial force known as Death Squadron, first arrived, they came out of hyperspace too close to Hoth to surprise the rebels. Afterwards, Vader sent General Maximilian Veers to lead the 501st All Terrain Armored Transport group Blizzard Force for a ground assault. Veers led the AT-ATs to destroy the rebel power generator, and the walkers decimated their lines of infantry. As he approached the generator, Veers ordered his troops to debark for ground assault. The generator was soon destroyed, and Vader and the 501st cold weather assault stormtroopers made their way into Echo Base. The remaining rebel personnel rushed to evacuate and abandoned Echo Base, officially making the battle an Imperial tactical victory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hours before the Battle of Endor, Darth Vader informed the Emperor that his son Luke Skywalker had descended to the surface of Endor. Forbidding him from openly seeking out Skywalker, the Emperor instead sent Vader to the Imperial base in charge of guarding the Death Star's shield generator, where his master predicted that his son would seek him out. Vader grew increasingly impatient as he waited at the base, and openly considered the idea of ordering the 501st Legion to lay waste to the forest in order to find his son. The 501st Legion then subsequently participated in the Battle of Endor, although the legion died there along with Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, and the second Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"501st Legion\" is also the name of a fan costuming organization formed in 1997 by Albin Johnson and Tom Crews.
