He also befriended a simple-minded alien from Tammuz-an. The pragmatic Gundarian was upset with Tosh for purchasing a protocol and an astromech droid rather than the mining droid he had requested. Regardless, he put the droids to work and frequently abused R2-D2 by kicking him (which did more damage to Gundarian's toe and foot than it did to R2)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day, Gundarian was working in the mines when a section of the shaft caved in.

He rarely tolerated his nephew Jann's sense of adventure and was prone to bouts of anxiety whenever things didn't turn out as expected. However, Gundarian was grateful to those around him and occasionally revealed that he did indeed have a soft heart where his nephew was concerned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dan Hennessey performed the voice of Uncle Gundy.
