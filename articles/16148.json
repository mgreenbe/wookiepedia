He was employed by the Dug crime lord Sebolto as a smuggler, transporting illegal drugs known as death sticks. While working in the Gazzari system, Fust was captured by members of the Republic Security Force in a sting operation against Sebolto's drug cartel. Faced with a long term of imprisonment, the Mordageen made a deal with the agency, telling them all he knew of Sebolto's drug cartel in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. He was then interred into a maximum security prison on the asteroid Oovo IV, a facility known as Desolation Alley, and was assigned prisoner number 004563-013."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once Sebolto discovered that Fust had sold him out, he posted a 50,000-credit bounty for anyone who brought Fust to him alive. In 32 BBY, this offer was taken up independently by two bounty hunters, Zam Wesell and Jango Fett. Wesell, a shapeshifting Clawdite, stowed away aboard a supply vessel and infiltrated the prison. She arrived at Fust's cell first, and when he refused to accompany her, the Clawdite used a gas grenade to subdue him. She also initiated a prison riot to cover her escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after Wesell left, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett arrived at the cell, having traversed the prison's ventilation shafts. Fett followed after the escaping pair, eventually catching up with them just as they reached his starship, which Wesell hoped to hijack to escape the prison. Faced with numerous prison guards, the two professionals opted to join forces to escape the prison, splitting the bounty on Fust's head. Although Fett's ship was destroyed before they could escape in it, the pair managed to hijack a Firespray-class patrol ship and leave Oovo. The bounty hunters then took Fust to Malastare, Sebolto's homeworld where Fett allowed Wesell to hand Fust over to Sebolto at his palace, using the occasion to sneak into the Palace for his own purposes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bendix Fust smuggled death sticks, an illegal drug composed of treated Ixetal cilona extract that offers euphoria in exchange for a shortened life; consequently, upon being captured by Republic forces, he was to be imprisoned for a significant period of time. In this situation, Fust was prepared to sell out his employer in exchange for a reduced prison sentence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After selling out his boss, Fust was very afraid of what Sebolto would do to him in reparation.

In the game, Fust was voiced by Wally Wingert, who also voiced another character, Jervis Gloom. Later that year, Fust was mentioned in The New Essential Guide to Characters, as well as in the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter: Prima's Official Strategy Guide, which first mentioned his species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fust was also given an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, which implied that Wesell hunted Fust before he was imprisoned in Oovo IV.
