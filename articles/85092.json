The ship was owned by the Snivvian Goontirk and at some point during galactic history, Goontirk purchased the mummified remains of Vardovin IV, the \"Lost King of Duro\" from a Ryn merchant, to display aboard the Madman's Fortune. However, unknown to Goontirk, the mummy contained more than a dozen skekfish eggs and while the Madman's Fortune was passing through the Engebo system, the mummy's plasteel coffin cracked open and the skekfish eggs hatched. The creatures attacked Goontirk and in an attempt to escape from them, he ran into one of the ship's escape pods. The skekfish pursued the Snivvian in and they devoured him before he could launch the pod, and thirty seconds later the Madman's automated safety systems launched the escape pod into the atmosphere of the planet Engebo V."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
