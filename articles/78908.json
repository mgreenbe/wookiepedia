Although Kyuzos could learn to understand Galactic Basic Standard, the most prevalent language in the galaxy, without difficulty, and most picked up the skill at a young age, they found it difficult to speak and grammatically confusing. As a result, they favored their own language and relied upon electric translators or interpreter droids to smooth their interactions with outsiders. Embo, a male Kyuzo who operated as a bounty hunter during the Clone Wars and Galactic Civil War, spoke the Kyuzo language."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kyuzo language was developed for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series by supervising director Dave Filoni and is comprised primarily of intentionally mispronounced French words from children's books about The Smurfs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
