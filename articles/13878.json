Shortly after the formation of the Imperial Remnant, Head of State Gilad Pellaeon won a string of victories along the Entralla Route. The New Republic responded by sending the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Lusankya, and the two sides clashed at Darkon. Commanded by General Wedge Antilles and supported by Tycho Celchu's Rogue Squadron, the Lusankya defeated Pellaeon's own Executor-class Star Dreadnought, the Reaper, and Turr Phennir's 181st Imperial Fighter Group. The Imperials retreated, and further showdowns awaited."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
