Corran Horn, a Force-sensitive pilot in Rogue Squadron, woke up sensing something was wrong. After leaving his room, he encountered and killed one Stormtrooper, while fellow Rogue Ooryl Qrygg killed another. Qrygg and Horn considered raising an alarm, to alert others to the infiltration, but decided against it, as any alarm would send pilots running unarmed towards stormtroopers which were waiting in the hangar. Instead of raising an alarm, they began heading for the flight center, stopping to wake fellow Rogues Gavin Darklighter and Riv Shiel. After a brief firefight, in which Darklighter was wounded, Horn encountered Nawara Ven, a fellow Rogue, and ordered him to stay and help the injured Darklighter. Horn sprinted to the hangar and arrived to find a firefight already in progress. He located a cluster of stormtroopers, and threw a grenade into the group, before charging in and eliminating several more troopers, though he was injured in the process. The bombs that had been planted by the stormtroopers were found and disarmed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the battle, Admiral Ackbar arrived to oversee the evacuation of the base and to also encourage the remaining Rogues, who were very affected by the death of Forge.
