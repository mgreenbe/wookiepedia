Tsyk became a heavily polluted planet. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, in which the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong invaded and sought to conquer the galaxy from 25 ABY to 29 ABY, the Yuuzhan Vong attacked Tsyk between 26 ABY and 27 ABY. By 27 ABY, Tsyk was held by the invaders. At some point after the Yuuzhan Vong's defeat at the end of 29 ABY, the planet reverted to being part of Hutt Space. It remained so in 137 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Tsyklen in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least one female Tsyklen left her homeworld.

Her manual dexterity and exceptional vision made her well suited to the career and allowed her to manipulate two holo-scribers at once."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tsyklen first appeared in The Hutt Gambit, a novel released in 1997 as the second installment of The Han Solo Trilogy, written by A.
