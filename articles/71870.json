When \"freed\" from imprisonment by Sadow, she was separated from her brother Gav Daragon by Sadow so that the Sith Lord could begin training Gav in the art of Sith magic. Desperate for some communication from her brother, Jori received a Sith amulet from Sadow that presented a message from Gav in a holographic-like visual. Upon her return to the Republic, Jori kept the amulet for herself, even in the wake of the Great Hyperspace War and the massive efforts of the Jedi Order to eradicate all traces of the Sith species. However, at some point prior to 3963 BBY, it was retrieved by Celeste Morne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
