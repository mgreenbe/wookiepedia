Varad established a number of secret bases throughout the Tamarin sector of space in the galaxy's Outer Rim, eventually going rogue and attacking planets controlled by both governments. Members of Clan Varad developed an aggressive and violent reputation among the Mandalorian community, owed to decades of raiding and plundering from their hidden compounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clan Varad was led by Chieftain Mavrix Varad, a male warrior considered bloodthirsty by his peers. Forcing his kinsmen to face demanding combat trials, those who failed to meet Varad's standards were used for sparring or even hunting practice for the clan's younger members. However, those that succeeded in the Varad clan were often rewarded with a substantial influx of credits and weaponry from the clan's latest pillage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the years of the Cold War, Mavrix Varad clashed on a personal level with the Mandalorians' reigning Mand'alor, Mandalore the Vindicated, who thought of Mavrix as little more than \"a rancor foaming at the mouth.\" Clan Varad members became unwelcome at the Mandalorian-held stronghold of Geonosis, and it wasn't long after that Varad openly turned on the Mand'alor. Seeking combat, Clan Varad willingly struck at both Republic and Sith targets alike, even stealing the Republic warship Allusis and using it to attack and plunder vulnerable planets within the Outer Rim. In response, both the Republic and the Empire sent strike teams to board and seize the ship. Mavrix Varad and several members of Clan Varad were slain during the ensuing hostilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3626 BBY, members of Clan Varad joined up with Heta Kol's organization known as the Hidden Chain against Mandalore the Avenger's faction.
