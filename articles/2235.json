Showing an intense desire in studying the techniques of dual lightsaber combat, A.J.'s passion sparked many questions amongst the Jedi Council stationed at the academy. When it came time for her to undergo the Jedi Trials, the Council questioned the motivations that drove her to study this form of combat. Citing her desire to hone her skills so that she could protect others and that she was not wielding dual blades to inspire fear, the Council was appeased and allowed her to continue on and eventually become a Jedi Knight. A.J. was later mentioned within the Jedi training manual Padawan's Resource Guide, which noted her unusual choice of lightsaber specialism."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
