It was commissioned by the Theed Palace Space Vessel Engineering Corps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Spaceframe"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An example of the marriage between art and design, the craft was designed to embody the glory of Naboo royalty which represented the noble spirit of the citizens of Naboo. It was, in fact, reserved only for use by the Naboo sovereign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naboo engineers claimed that the Royal Starship was actually composed of two major components: the spaceframe and all the other components. This spaceframe, created by the skilled engineers of the Theed Palace Space Vessel Engineering Corps under the guidance of Staven Kremmo, was a single long, supple hull. The frame was covered in chromium, formerly used to shield starships from radiation and some forms of laser attacks, but later used simply in a time-honored tradition. Only the Queen's own vessel could be entirely chromium-covered, but royal starfighters, such as the Naboo N-1, had chromium on the front of their engines. Non-royal Naboo ships were forbidden to display chromium."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Queen Amidala's term in office, the Royal Starship was piloted by Ric Oli\u00e9 and a well-trained crew of technicians, engineers, navigators and diplomatic aides. The ship was furnished to accommodate the Queen's entourage, including handmaidens and bodyguards. The vehicle also had large climate-controlled wardrobes that provided Amidala with clothes for all occasions."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Propulsion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rest of the ship's components were provided by the Nubian Design Collective, including the impressive T-14 hyperdrive generator. The T-14 was compact and accessible, unlike most other hyperdrives, and was powerful enough to take the ship from Naboo to Tatooine in a single jump even when damaged. It could also be raised from a compartment in the floor to allow easy checking, repairs and even complete replacement. The T-14 hyperdrive had a 327 core that gave the royal starship an impressive hyperdrive class of 1.8. The ship's Headon-5 sublight engines, which had been modified by the Naboo to be environmentally friendly, could exceed the speed of most starfighters."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Defenses"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Royal Starship had no weapons since it was designed as a peaceful ambassadorial ship. Its powerful deflector shields could withstand large amounts of damage, including bombardment by turbolaser emplacements. Intricate sensors built into the craft reported damage instantly, allowing the crew to locate trouble spots immediately. When the starship was damaged, up to 8 astromech droids could be automatically deployed. These droids would even venture onto the surface of the ship's outer hull during flight, braving the vacuum of space and enemy fire to make emergency repairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Royal Starship was normally accompanied by a small wing of N-1 starfighters. This elite squadron, known as Bravo Squadron, was handpicked from the most dedicated and talented pilots in the Royal Naboo Security Forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "King Ars Veruna first gave the Theed Palace Space Vessel Engineering Corps the contract to design a ship that was built around the famous components of Nubia. Three engineers from Naboo, including Staven Kremmos, traveled to Nubia, where they explained their design. With the expertise of the Nubians behind them, the delegation returned to Naboo and began construction on the ship, which would take four years to complete. Veruna would only use the ship three times during his reign, before he was slain and his administration was plunged into corruption."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Queen Amidala took office, she inherited the use of the ship. On Naboo, it was a tradition for the monarch to name their personal starship. Six months after getting elected, Amidala had not yet chosen an official name for her ship. During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, the Royal Starship was instrumental in allowing the Queen to escape her planet's blockade. While attempting to run past the Trade Federation battleship, the J-327's shield generator was hit, which activated deployment of the droid repair crew contingency. G8-R3, R2-B1, and R2-R9 were seen to exit via lift to the ship's hull exterior, followed close behind by R2-N3 and R2-D2. As Artoo reached the hull, and took his place beside the other astromechs engaged in repairs, the remaining droids were rapidly blown from their positions by blaster fire. This left Artoo alone to quickly make the fix, bypassing the main power drive, in order to bring the deflector shields back to maximum strength. In doing so, he saved himself, the ship, and the lives of all those onboard; the \"extremely well-put-together little droid\" was later commended for his actions by the Queen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hyperdrive also sustained damaged in the exodus from Naboo, and the crew diverted to the Outer Rim planet Tatooine. The Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn was able to secure an additional T-14 generator. One night on Tatooine, a band of Tusken Raiders invaded the vessel and absconded with the Queen. Jinn's apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi was able to rescue the Queen. Amidala was then able to inform the Republic of her world's plight, and used the craft to return to Naboo to fight off the Trade Federation invaders. The craft landed in the swamps and the crew went to visit the Gungans to discuss an alliance. The craft was later used to transport Kenobi and his new apprentice Anakin Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Amidala retired her position, the Royal Starship was decommissioned and another craft was handcrafted for her successor, Queen Jamillia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 ABY, Raze and King Arturo of Orocco used a golden J-type 327 Nubian to rescue the latter's daughter, Princess Mi, who had been kidnapped by a band of criminals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 25 ABY, it was described as \"quite the collector's item\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The design of this starship was inspired by the chrome hood ornaments of 1950s automobiles.
