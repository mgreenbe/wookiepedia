Its design was configurable into a multitude of settings, allowing it to transport a wide variety of Xizor cargo containers in considerable numbers. This was the premier JSI model freighter, and drew respectable attention in a market already dominated by other manufacturers, such as Phylon Freight, Damorian Manufacturing Corporation, and Corellian Engineering Corporation. Unarmed and only lightly armored, the Type K was best deployed as part of a convoy, as its maximum speed was easily outclassed by even the most primitive starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kyle Katarn was forced to fight his way through a Type K while trying to get aboard the Sulon Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
