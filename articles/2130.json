By the time of the Battle of Yavin, the Black Sun formed an alliance with the Detritus Satellites, a group of sentient Vulture-class droid scavengers active in the Dantooine system. Around 1 ABY, a spacer found an information storage device in the remains of a destroyed starfighter in the Dantooine system. It contained a private message from Bloodlight. In this message, Bloodlight voiced a strong disapproval of an alliance agreement between Black Sun and the Detritus Satellites. Bloodlight regretted that the agreement included a non-aggression pact, but hoped that it would be possible to destroy a few droid starfighters \"under the radar\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A'kiian \"Maleficus\" Bloodlight is the author of a message found on a rare information storage deviced named \"A Log\" that can be looted from starfighters in the Dantooine system in Star Wars Galaxies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
