These droids were designed to surprise and overwhelm their enemies in devastating and deadly shock assaults. Despite being easy to manufacture, Krath war droids had limited cognitive matrices and were programmed only to seek and destroy the greatest threat on the battlefield. Krath war droids were thus often deployed in large numbers in order to overwhelm the enemy. Systemically identifying the greatest threat in range, the droids would swarm until the target was eliminated before moving on to the next most dangerous target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were armed with a melee combat short sword for hacking at close range and a Pulse-wave bow for long-range engagements. The attenuated induction spines on this weapon generated a pulse-wave charge and in a pinch could also be used as spear-like skewering/thrusting tools."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Jedi/Galactic Republic defeat at the Battle of Koros Major in 3997 BBY, the Jedi held a a great assembly of ten thousand Jedi Masters and Jedi Knights on the planet Deneba. The Krath saw this as an opportunity to test this new battle droid and to attack their enemies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their agents sabotaged the programming of the servant droids that would be at the convocation. The Krath then loaded a Tetan Corsair with a hundred modified life pods, which each carried a single war droid. Halfway into the Jedi assembly, the sabotaged servant droids suddenly attacked their Jedi owners, causing much confusion and chaos. Meanwhile in orbit, the Tetan Corsair launched its life pods and an army of war droids emerged from the impact craters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the element of surprise on their side, the war droids charged at the assembled Jedi at frightening speeds and fired their pulse-wave firing assemblies. Soon, many Jedi fell to these mindless automatons. Jedi Master Arca Jeth fought back against them by using a Force technique he had discovered during the Great Droid Revolution to short-circuit them. However, he eventually fell to a plasma barrage. Though the Jedi had survived the assault, the death toll was appalling. Soon the Galactic Republic and the Jedi succeeded in defeating the Krath along with their Sith and Mandalorian allies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Krath war droid later resurfaced in galactic history as the reference for the droid frame that would hold the biological remains of Qymaen jai Sheelal, allowing him to become the feared General Grievous.
