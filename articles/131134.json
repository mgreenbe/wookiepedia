Crawling out of the hole they fell into, the two head towards the spaceport to rendezvous with the Nosaurian families. When they get there, they find no traces of the others. Sneaking around, they come into contact with a friendly ship's captain. He invites them onboard and introduces them to his crew. When the battle-hardened survivors tell their story, they agree to help them. But first they have to deal with the problem of the Imperial patrols. They hatch a plan to steal an Imperial starfighter and force every ship at the Spaceport to escape at once.
