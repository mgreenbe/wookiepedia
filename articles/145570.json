During a guardsman's induction into the organization, they received a set of interlocking Thisspiasian puzzle rings, which resembled a nest of snakes that were twisted and intertwined. The puzzle was impossible to solve for those who were not attuned with the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Thisspiasian Royal Guard also made use of Ouro Blades, which were long-curved blades that arched out in a half-circle from the user's fists. Despite its efficiency, changing attitudes brought the blade outside of popularity, and many associated it with the Royal Guard as elements of a bygone era. 250 years prior to the Imperial Era, the Thisspiasian Royal Guard's famous weapon was the ystervark spear. During the Galactic Empire's reign, the Blood Court was abolished and Thisspias descended into rebellion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
