However, the mission was foiled, because when Sitra's shuttle jumped into Dathomir space, it was ambushed by Slave I of the bounty hunter Boba Fett, who intended to claim bounty in Sitra's head. Fett ambushed the shuttle from behind an asteroid, then, with a precise shot from a heavy blaster cannon, neutralized the shuttle's hyperdrive and commenced boarding actions. When the airlock was forced open, Sitra ignited her lightsaber and prepared to defend herself, but Fett fired a rocket from his wrist launcher, which knocked the lightsaber out of her hands. Bruised and battered, Sitra had no choice but to surrender herself to the bounty hunter; Fett locked energy binders on her hands and prepared to deliver her to Imperial authorities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
