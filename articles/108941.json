It was dominated by its enormous spaceport, located on the Qaestar Ridge two kilometers above the city proper. Twenty-meter wide stone promenades called the Qaestar Steps led up from the city to the ridge; the steps were ancient and worn and somewhat treacherous. The spaceport was run by gangs that preyed on offworlders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
