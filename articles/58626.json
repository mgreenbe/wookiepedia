HLC-14 cannons featured high accuracy, long range, and significant damage, but possessed a slow rate of fire and significant power consumption. SoroSuub's Sullust manufacturing facilities were captured by the Empire during the Great Galactic War, making HLC-14s particularly rare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
