Korriban in general and the Valley of the Dark Lords specifically were nexuses of the dark side of the Force due to the long-term presence of the Sith Lords, Nam Chorios was a nexus of the Force due to the omnipresence of the Tsils, a form of life; Vjun was a nexus of the dark side due to the horrible events of its past, the Dark Side Cave on Dagobah and a spot in orbit over Endor were tainted by the death of dark side users, Byss was a nexus of the dark side of the Force because it housed Palpatine's clones and his various Sith alchemy experiments and the Force energies sucking the lives on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There may have been a nexus in Lumiya's habitat asteroid, where Alema Rar was able to draw energy from it to power her Force specters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The natural mountain on which the foundation of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant rested was a nexus. This became tainted by the dark side with the defeat of Lord Nyax at the site of the ruined Temple during the Yuuzhan Vong War.

This effect allowed even a being who wasn't Force-sensitive to use the weapon to a great degree. Further, objects (such as a holocron) imbued with a particular aspect of the Force\u2014be it light or dark\u2014could actually become so saturated as to make their very presence intolerable to those of opposite alignment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 29 BBY, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker encountered a nexus of powerful dark side energies in an underwater geyser crater on the planet Kodai, where the ancient Sith Holocron of King Adas was hidden. The strong underwater nexus was perceived even with the evil artifact having been stolen from its burial place.
