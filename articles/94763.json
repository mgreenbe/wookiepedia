The Gungans were putting up a stern defense. STAPS were being destroyed everywhere. Then, Maul jumped on one of the remaining STAPS and flew toward Boss Ganne and his fellow Ankura general, slaughtering Gungans that stood in his way with his lightsaber. He beheaded Ganne's co-general and disarmed the Boss, resulting in his capture. Using a mind trick on Ganne, Maul was then led to the city of Rellias and used Ganne as a hostage to get the Gungan soldiers to open the gates. The Trade Federation was given intelligence that there were more underwater cities. Although most of the Trade Federation Droid Army could not function underwater, specialized droidekas were produced to back Maul in his raid of the Rellias channel and its adjoining communities including the great Gungan city, Otoh Gunga."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Forces of B1-Series battle droids led by OOM-9 occupied and cleared the swamps above Lake Paonga, leading down to Otoh Gunga. However, word of the invasion allowed just enough time for Otoh Gunga to be warned of the upcoming attack and evacuated. Maul once more interrogated Ganne for answers as to where Otoh Gunga would be, but an impulse urged the Boss to resist. As a result, the Sith Lord killed him. News of the returning of Queen Amidala to Naboo, from outworld duties, stalled the swamp assault. After hearing this news, Maul left OOM-9 in charge of the raid and raced back to Theed to instruct Viceroy Nute Gunray to prepare the capital for the upcoming attack. OOM-9 led the assault forces in Maul's absence. Small Gungan communities were eradicated, but Otoh Gunga was found abandoned. OOM-9 aborted the final objectives of the swamp invasion, leading his forces back to Theed and later to the Grassy Plains."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of the events of the attempted attack, Queen Amidala and her forces, Jar Jar Binks, Obi Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Anakin Skywalker were unable to locate and find the Gungans at Otoh Gunga when they returned from Coruscant to forge an alliance with the Gungans, and thus were slightly delayed before heading for the Gungans' Sacred Place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Naboo Swamp Battle was first mentioned in 1999 with the release of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and its tie-ins.
