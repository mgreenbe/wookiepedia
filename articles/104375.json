In about 33 BBY, Vale was sent by his father to the Cularin system, where his father intended for him to enroll at the Almas Academy and train to become a Jedi. However, Vale instead entered a relationship with Selima DeWitt and along with the Cerean Higgie Sethven, they established the shop Natural on Cularin. About a year after his arrival in the system, Natural became the site of a battle between two security teams, sent by the rival companies Culpharm and Genasys. While Sethven and DeWitt sheltered upstairs in the shop, Vale waited on the ground floor with a stick, in an attempt to defend them. However, all three were eventually rescued by the Heroes of Cularin. A few weeks later, Vale and DeWitt became engaged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
