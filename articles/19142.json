They were armed with a panel of lasers for anti-ship duty in the front of the vessel, and they had a similar crescent-shaped appearance to the Tribubble bongo, and were piloted by two individuals in separate cockpits. Bongo Lasers were driven by one propeller and constructed at shipyards by the Bongomeken Collective for a cost of 100 units of carbon and 25 units of nova crystals. The Bongo Lasers could be upgraded to the stronger Bongo Fast Lasers. They were first used around the year 3000 BBY during the War of the Gungan tribes in the Raid on Spearhead. Over three-thousand years later, they saw action against the Trade Federation during the occupation of Naboo in 32 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bongo Lasers appear in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack.
