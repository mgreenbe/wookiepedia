The cruiser arrived late to the battle. The traitors, led by renegade Grand Admiral Demetrius Zaarin, escaped Grand Admiral Thrawn because they went into hyperspace before their hyperdrives could be disabled. However, the Corvus did not fail its mission. It accompanied Thrawn and his personal flagship, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Grey Wolf, on their mission to destroy Zaarin after pursuing him to deep space. Zaarin was holed up inside his flagship, the Star Destroyer Glory, and the Corvus disabled its hyperdrives so that Thrawn's forces could eliminate the traitor forces. Thrawn's forces, led by Tan Maarek Stele, fought off waves of Zaarin's elite TIE Defenders in order to protect the Corvus, but the ship suffered severe damage despite Thrawn's efforts. Fortunately, Stele and his wingmen succeeded in destroying the Glory and killing Admiral Zaarin before the Corvus could be destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
