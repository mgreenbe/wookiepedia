A Baron, he chose to join the navy of the Galactic Republic, and, unlike his ancestors, took a combat-related role instead of buying a safe position. Vedij led a distinguished career in the navy, and once, when he was a bosun, suffered heavy wounds at the hands of alien commerce raiders. Vedij managed to deter the assault by himself, and this event caused him to be promoted to the rank of captain. Vedij later became an admiral, and while he was still in the navy, had two sons, Dhas and Elon Vedij, with his wife."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Baron Admiral retired to Coruscant, and Vedij brought his sons up to believe in a strong military, something that was also believed by the Galactic Empire, the Republic's successor state. Dhas later joined the Imperial Navy, and was followed some years later by Elon. When Imperial Emperor Palpatine began to retool the military, Vedij became a vocal opponent of this movement. In 0 BBY, shortly after Dhas was transferred to the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Far Orbit, Vedij and his wife were killed on Coruscant in a traffic accident, following a Robo-Hack misinterpreting routing instructions which caused it to go in the opposite direction. After Dhas, who inquired into the nature of the crash, was warned away by the Imperial Security Bureau, he believed that his father had been killed by the enemies he had made by opposing the retooling of the military. Dhas later led a mutiny on the Far Orbit because of the deaths of both his father and brother, who died fighting pirates shortly after Vedij."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A man who believed in a strong military, Vedij chose to enter the line of combat in the navy instead of buying a safe position.

O'Brien.
