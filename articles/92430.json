While his young son, Prince Lee-Char, was supposed to take the mantle, the Quarren, led by Nossor Ri, refused to accept him as their leader due to the prince's young age and inexperience. As tensions grew, Count Dooku sent commander Riff Tamson to ensure that the groups would not succeed in a compromise, while the Galactic Republic sent Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala. When Nossor Ri delivered his ultimatum, the Quarren left Coral City and officially allied with the Separatists, who deployed a large force of AQ-series battle droids to combat the Mon Calamari militia. A civil war began, with the Separatists being led by Tamson against Prince Lee-Char and his general, Gial Ackbar. After several large confrontations, including the deployment of Kit Fisto, clone SCUBA troopers, and even the Gungan Grand Army, Lee-Char's forces were successful in uniting the people of Mon Cala.
