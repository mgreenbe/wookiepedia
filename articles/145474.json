Kossak gathered his fleet at Vontor and Xim sent his troops to the surface in massive landing barges. He did not expect to find the millions of Klatooinians, Nikto, Weequays and Vodrans waiting for them on the surface. Despite their technological advantages over the Hutts, Xim's forces were no match for Kossak the Hutt's new allies. While Xim was sending his warships against Kossak's forces, the Vodrans and their new companions destroyed most of Xim's war-robots and then wrecked Xim's orbital platforms by bombing them. Xim's fleet was destroyed in orbit except for a few ships that escaped with the last war robots. Xim was officially killed in the conflict, but in truth he was captured and died as a slave in the palace of Kossak on Varl. However, his treasure ship, the Queen of Ranroon, escaped to the planet of Dellalt, where it would remain hidden for millennia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the battle, the Treaty of Vontor was signed by the Hutts, Klatooinians, Vodrans, and Nikto.
