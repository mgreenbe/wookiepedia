The number of personnel assigned to a team varied from as few as three to as many as sixteen. Unit members usually included at least one communications expert, a heavy weapons specialist, and a scout. They were usually deployed to soften hard targets in preparation for incoming assault forces, as well as performing standard Intelligence work. Members of Imperial Intelligence teams were usually drawn from commando backgrounds, and were similar in scope to Alliance Special Operations teams. They traveled with the bare minimum of equipment and acquired needed supplies from Imperial stores or stole them from enemy installations. When not assigned to a particular task, Imperial Intelligence teams ran their own operations, usually with large enemy casualties."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Intelligence team members also underwent specialized training, as well as having their skills enhanced through the use of mnemiotic drugs.
