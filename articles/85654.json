She worked with Kuru during the Rion Swoop race, targeting the smuggler Han Solo, who Kuru hoped to hand over to the Galactic Empire in return for the bounty placed on him. When Makta hit her swoop into Solo's in an attempt to sabotage him, Solo reached over and damaged her stabilizer, causing her to crash instead. She reported her failure to Kuru's associate Takvax, who turned to the sniper Glunge to take Solo out of the race. Luke Skywalker, who had visited Rion with Solo on a Rebel Alliance mission, helped Solo win the event, preventing Kuru from succeeding."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
