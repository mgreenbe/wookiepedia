Watto tells Anakin that Jawas at Mochat Steep have found the thrusters from the pod of Regga the Hammerhead, a famous racer that was undefeated until Sebulba cut him off. Watto wants the thrusters, planning to have Anakin use them in the next pod race. He sends Anakin to trade with the Jawas. As Anakin is searching through junk to trade he finds a Vaporator Cylinder of a very old model. A funny feeling tells Anakin to take it and he packs it with the rest of the Junk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Anakin goes to the Jawas, he stops at home to pick up C-3PO to use as an interpreter. C-3PO is only half finished, as is the pod racer Anakin has hidden with the droid.

One Jawa points at Anakin's water Jerikans and says he wants them. Anakin realizes the Jawas want water and discovers that their water vaporator has broken. Quickly Anakin grabs the Vaparator Cylinder and offers to trade it and repair it for the remains of Regga's pod. The Jawas lead him inside their Sandcrawler and take him to the broken vaporator. After a moment Anakin has it fixed and the Jawas are overjoyed. As promised they give him the remains of Regga's pod, which includes an entire engine. Anakin is stunned and decides to keep the engine for himself to use for building his secret pod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That evening, Watto is astounded that Anakin acquired the thrusters with the vaporator cylinder.

Anakin is ready to go in Watto's pod, though he is parked next to Sebulba, who recognizes Regga's old thrusters. He warns Anakin he has a \"surprise\" for him when they reach Bimmira Canyon. Anakin tries to ignore the Dug and reaches out with his mind as the timer counts down. When the light turns green the racers are off. Anakin reaches the canyon first, foiling Sebulba's trick. Anakin begins to wonder if this is the race from his dream, where he rides to victory and meets an angel. Suddenly Sebulba passes him, followed by Rimkar's bubble pod. When they reach Metta Canyon Anakin senses danger and jerks the controls. Sebulba activates his afterburners and destroys Rimkar's pod. Anakin avoids the blast, but loses control and crashes. Sebulba wins yet again and Anakin is severely discouraged, beginning to doubt his dreams."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Watto is angered and makes Anakin work on the battered pod until dark.

One of the pilots sees Anakin and recognizes him as a participant in the pod race. He commends Anakin on his ability to fly a pod, and tells him that he must trust his dreams, or else they would never come true."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that night Anakin wondered if the pilot was the wise man from his dream.
