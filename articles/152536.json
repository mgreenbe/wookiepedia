The droid berated the show's host, B6-24, claiming that she was an abomination for believing she could speak her mind, as droids were only made to follow orders. B6-24 cut off the call before the EV-series droid could finish and apologized to her listeners for the call. The droid spoke in an evil, monotonous, grating, and mechanical voice. The droid was manufactured by MerenData, like all EV-series droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The EV-series droid was created for the themed land Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, which opened to guests at Disneyland Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios Park in 2019.
