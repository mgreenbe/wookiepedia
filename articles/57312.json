Due to the fact that his ships were protected from behind by the asteroids, Grievous ordered all power in the frigates be diverted to the forward shields, leaving the rear of all of the frigates without shields. Anakin Skywalker led the starfighter unit Gold Squadron against the frigates, though the squadron retreated after losing two V-19 Torrent starfighters while Anakin continued his run on the enemy frigates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Confederate fleet advanced through the asteroid belt, AT-TEs positioned on the asteroids fired on the unshielded sterns on the frigates.
