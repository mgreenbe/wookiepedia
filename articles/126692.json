The fight resulted when members of the Black Sun criminal syndicate infiltrated the Senate Tower on Coruscant and kidnapped the Republic scientist Doctor Eli Tarnis. Tarnis, in actuality a Sith Lord, had hired the criminals to stage his kidnapping, and slipped away to the Justicar territory while the kidnappers drew the attention of Coruscant Security at the nearby spaceport. In an attempt to rescue the scientist, the former apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din and the astromech droid T7-O1 joined Jedi Padawan Kira Carsen in fighting and defeating the criminals. In the process, the trio learned Tarnis had been taken to Black Sun territory, and they promptly launched a rescue mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the Jedi Council sent four Jedi\u2014Masters Bela Kiwiiks and Orgus Din; Kiwiiks's Padawan, Kira Carsen; and Din's former apprentice\u2014to investigate a dark presence that the Council sensed on the Republic capital planet of Coruscant. There, the four learned that the design files for the Planet Prison superweapon had been stolen by Vistis Garn, a thief working for the Migrant Merchants' Guild criminal organization. While Kiwiiks, Din, and General Var Suthra met with Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus in orbit on the Chancellor's personal cruiser, the Founder, Din's former apprentice\u2014now a Jedi Knight\u2014and Carsen worked to recover the files with the help of Agent Galen of the Republic Strategic Information Service and Doctor Eli Tarnis, the creator of the Planet Prison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galen sent the Knight and the astromech droid T7-O1 to the Guild-controlled Old Galactic Market to recover the design files, while Carsen and Galen worked with the Coruscant Security Force to distract the gangsters. Teeseven and the Jedi were successful in recovering the files but learned in the process that Garn had actually been hired by the Black Sun criminal syndicate. However, while the Knight was in the Market, a team of Black Sun criminals infiltrated the Senate Tower and kidnapped Doctor Tarnis. Tarnis\u2014who was actually a Sith Lord\u2014had hired Black Sun to stage the kidnapping as a diversion, so that he could slip away to a secret facility in the Justicar territory while the kidnappers distracted Republic security."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carsen and a team of Coruscant Security personnel pursued the kidnappers to the nearby Coruscant Spaceport, while the Knight returned to the Senate Tower to deliver the files to Galen. While the agent explained the situation to the Jedi, Galen received a holocall from Carsen. She and the CSF had pinned down the kidnappers in Docking Bay 84, but they were unable to make anymore progress against the criminals. The Knight and Teeseven raced to the spaceport to assist Carsen, finding that the Padawan and the CSF had set up a barricade in the hangar's entrance and were locked in a stalemate with the kidnappers. Speaking with Carsen, the Knight learned that they were threatening to kill Tarnis and that their leader, the Human Zeer, had shot at the Padawan when she tried to negotiate, but Carsen was not sure that Tarnis was even present in the hangar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knight placed Tarnis's safety as a priority, and Carsen offered to use a stealth field generator that she had borrowed from Galen to sneak by the criminals. The Jedi agreed and stormed the hangar while Carsen activated the field and slipped inside. Together, the Knight and Teeseven defeated almost a dozen Black Sun members in the docking bay, and then attempted to access the control room. Opening the door, the Knight was almost ambushed by two gang members on the other side, but the cloaked Carsen knocked them out before they could attack. However, Zeer saw the field flicker and shot in her direction with a blaster. The bolt dissipated over the field, shorting it out and knocking Carsen unconscious. The Knight and Teeseven rushed in to protect her, charging Zeer and the other three criminals in the room and quickly defeating the gang members who were no match for the Knight's martial prowess."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Injured, Zeer fell to his knees and cursed the Jedi, and a recovered Carsen joined the Knight and Teeseven in interrogating the criminal. Zeer laughed at the trio, revealing that he and his men had been decoys, but Carsen pretended to read Zeer's mind in an attempt to make the criminal panic. Her ploy worked, tricking Zeer into telling the Jedi that the head of Black Sun, Salarr, was holding Tarnis in his headquarters. Laughing, Carsen revealed that she was unable to read minds, and the Jedi handed Zeer over to the CSF before the Knight and Teeseven returned to Galen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The skirmish in Docking Bay 84 was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. The episode appears in the Jedi Knight-class story mission \"Kidnapped!\" on Coruscant, where the player is instructed to rescue Doctor Tarnis from the kidnappers in the spaceport. However, the player learns in the next mission, \"Rescue,\" that Tarnis was, in fact, a Sith Lord, and that he had fled to the Justicars' Sector while the kidnappers served as a distraction. When Kira Carsen offers to use a stealth field generator to help the Knight, the player is presented with two options. The player can refuse Carsen's help, which results in loss of affection with both Carsen and T7-O1, or the player can accept, and Carsen will help interrogate Zeer without injuring the criminal. Also, accepting Carsen's help will reduce the number of enemies whom the player must face. The mission, like the rest of the Coruscant arc for the Jedi Knight class, was written by Hall Hood, and the writer especially enjoyed the dynamic of Zeer's interrogation by Carsen and the Knight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
