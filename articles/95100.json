The Intruder was the second ship of the Bakuran Fleet to be destroyed in the Corellian crisis, with the first being the Bakura-class destroyer Watchkeeper. It was destroyed during the Battle of Centerpoint Station after being damaged by three camouflaged robot ramships. Even though it was critically damaged, the ship could have been captured and refitted, but Gaeriel Captison and Admiral Hortel Ossilege activated the self-destruct and happened to take out half of the Saccorian fleet-and themselves in addition to everyone else on the ship. They did this so that it would not be captured."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
