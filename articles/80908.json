Some planets, such as the Mid Rim world Naboo, had mandatory service laws which required all citizens to serve in the Program for a certain number of years. The organization therefore oversaw Naboo's mandatory public service curricula, holding their headquarters on the planet in Theed University."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Founded sometime during the Galactic Republic's reign, the Legislative Youth Program spread across the Republic to include countless worlds. The members of the Program met annually for a month-long retreat on Chandrila, in and around the planet's capital, Hanna City. There, the young delegates entered into mock Senate trials in order for the participants to gain first-hand experience working with galactic issues. In 22 BBY, one such trial was held in which the Military Creation Act was voted on. It passed by a margin of 52% to 48%. During the retreat, the members also used to tour Chandrila's vast agricultural projects, wilderness areas, coral reefs, and garden parks (including Gladean Park)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As described in HoloNet News, the Legislative Youth Program resembles Model United Nations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
