The messages were in an ancient language that contained words of Sith, Gree and Rakata languages and described instructions on improving the communication arrays that Veijel used. The machines were now able to increase the lifespan of an individual \"twice transmuted and reborn to the Mother\". The latest Dark Councillor of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge Darth Nox fit that description and Veijel began seeking an audience, refusing to speak of it to anyone else."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, many others did the same, resulting in Veijel having to wait from Nox's ascension until 3637 BBY, when Nox arrived on Rishi. Veijel finally arranged a meeting through Moff Valion Pyron and presented the Dark Lord his findings. When Nox interacted with the machine build from alien design, the machine provided cellular rejuvenation, increasing the Dark Lord's lifespan by one solar cycle. Veijel was overjoyed to hear of the results and asked his master for additional resources: scientists to replicate the machines, battalions to pacify Rishi and fleets to explore the Rishi Maze. Since each of those would contribute to prolonging the Dark Lord's life, Nox agreed to grant Veijel anything that he required."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Veijel appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan during the Sith Inquisitor class quest on Rishi.
