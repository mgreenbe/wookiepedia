They lose him, and Obi-Wan moves out into the open to look for him, when the sniper fires and hits him dead on. He falls to the street below, crashing into a pile of crates, as Ahsoka runs to him. Anakin tries to chase the sniper, who escapes on a speeder, and when he returns to Obi-Wan and Ahsoka, he has to learn that his old master and friend is dead.

However, Obi-Wan is not dead. It turns out that it was all a plan made by Obi-Wan, Yoda and Mace Windu, who decided to fake Obi-Wan's death so he could pretend to become a member of a looming Separatist plot to kidnap Palpatine. Kenobi then undergoes a facial transformation via nanotechnology to disguise himself as Hardeen, captures his would-be assassin as he prepares to collect his reward from his employer (again Kenobi), and completes his disguise with a voice emulator droid and a voice sample from Hardeen. Anakin and Ahsoka, who have not been made aware of the plan in order to assure its success, track down Hardeen's location and arrest the disguised Obi-Wan, ferrying him to the Republic jail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once inside the prison, Obi-Wan proceeds to make contact with another inmate, Moralo Eval, who is suspected to be a key figure in the plot against the Chancellor.

In addition, Obi-Wan learns that both of them plan to break out of prison very soon. He manages to relay as much to Yoda and Windu through a concealed comm device, but nevertheless is forced to carry on with his plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In due time, Bane stages a breakout by having Boba Fett start a fight with Obi-Wan, triggering a general riot which Eval and Bane use as a cover for their escape.
