Earlier, Tai-Lin had been assassinated by the Amaxine warriors' leader Arliz Hadrassian under the orders of the Centrist Senator Lady Carise Sindian, who was a secret First Order agent. The memorial service was attended by Tai-Lin's Populist colleagues including Senators Leia Organa and Varish Vicly. While most believed that Hadrassian had been the sole mastermind behind Rinnrivin Di's cartel and the Napkin Bombing, Leia disagreed and suspected that Hadrassian was a proxy of a larger entity. Varish reprimanded Leia for raising the matter at the memorial service."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
