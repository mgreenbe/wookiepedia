They were slow to rebel as most on Verkuyl viewed the Empire as liberators, as the conditions they faced before the Empire nationalized Verkuyl, were much worse. Eventually some Verkuylians were won over by members of the New Republic and began to openly rebel against the Imperial regime on Verkuyl. They worked with a group of New Republic Intelligence operatives to liberate Verkuyl and were nearly thwarted by Daven Quarle, who was actually aligned with the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
