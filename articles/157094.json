The planet had a single dead red moon. The moon held a civilization which had been extinct millennia before 1 ABY, when it was settled by the rogue Imperial Commander Rezi Soresh. Soresh's machinations led to a battle forming in the system. The planet, along with everything else within a few billion kilometers were turned into radiation and dust when the sun became supernova as a result of Soresh's resonance torpedoes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This planet appears in Alex Wheeler's 2010 book Rebel Force: Uprising; it was identified early on as being the third planet but later was said to be the sixth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
