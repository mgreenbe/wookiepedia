For centuries, it was engulfed in a civil war between the Melida and the Daan factions which could not even agree on a name for the planet. The Melida called it Melida and the Daan called it Daan so the Galactic Senate used Melida and Daan separated by a slash. Eventually, a group called the Young, led by various children of the Melida and Daan, rose up and ended the civil war in 44 BBY. Obi-Wan Kenobi temporarily left the Jedi Order to aid the Young in their quest, helping to end the war. Parts of the planet were scarred from the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With a fast starship, it took three days to travel from Melida/Daan to the galactic capital of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
