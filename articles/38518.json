It was used to create, refine, and test volatile bioweapons and other substances. The Distillery was the main hub of Coyerti's production, making it a strategic location for attack. During the Coyerti campaign, the Alliance to Restore the Republic's 61st Mobile Infantry, also known as Twilight Company, did just that, attacking and destroying the Distillery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Distillery was the heart of Imperial toxin and chemical production on Coyerti. It created, tested, and finally exported these products across the galaxy for various uses. The Distillery consisted of three white bunkers with narrow passageways in between. These bunkers formed a triangle, shielding the valuable products inside from direct assault. Three squads of stormtroopers closely patrolled the bunkers. The bunkers were covered in vines and other native vegetation, hiding them from satellite scans. There were smokestacks, likely used in the chemical refining process, which gave out a fine mist in Coyerti's humid air."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, the Alliance to Restore the Republic's 61st Mobile Infantry launched a campaign on Coyerti. The Distillery was among the targets in this campaign and a squad, led by First Sergeant Hazram Namir, was sent to destroy it. As a light transport entered the facility, one of the squad, a soldier named Brand, infiltrated the compound and placed a microdetonator on one of the chemical barrels. The explosion from it succeeded in drawing off many of the stormtroopers guarding the area. When Namir's squad entered, there was just one trooper on duty, who was quickly killed. The squad then quickly cleared the bunkers and set detonators inside. Just half an hour after they left, the detonators set off and the facility was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Distillery appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
