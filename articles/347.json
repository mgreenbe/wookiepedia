In the assault, 121 1 attempted to flee the area, but flew right into the path of the Imperial Star Destroyers and came under heavy fire from the enemy. Despite a fierce resistance from Rebel pilots and Ace Azzameen on the Otana (Who was trying to rescue his sister Aeron from the shipyard), most if not all of 121 1 was destroyed in the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
