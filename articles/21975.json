He encountered Senator Bail Organa during the attack, and used the threat of force to keep the Alderaanian politician at bay.

Bred on the extragalactic world of Kamino, he was created to serve in an army of clone soldiers that had been developed in secret to become the armed forces of the Galactic Republic. Within ten years of the clone army's inception, the Republic went to war with the secessionist movement known as the Confederacy of Independent Systems. As a result, Appo became a soldier in the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic, serving in a number of critical battles across a galaxy divided by the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Service under Krell"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, Appo served as a sergeant in the 501st Legion by the time of the Republic invasion of Umbara. At first he fought the Separatist-aligned Umbarans under the leadership of Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight and general of the Grand Army. However, Skywalker was recalled to the Republic capital of Coruscant, leaving Appo and the legion under the command of another Jedi officer, General Pong Krell, for the duration of the campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a failed attempt to invade the capital city of Umbara, Krell and the 501st were dispatched on a new assignment to secure a heavily fortified Umbaran airbase that was critical to the Republic's strategy. At the General's command, Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" led a vanguard assault on the base's defense perimeter while Appo and the majority of the 501st remained at Krell's side as he observed the fighting from a distance. After the Umbarans' defenses were sabotaged by two clone infiltrators, the ARC trooper CT-5555 \"Fives\" and the trooper known as \"Hardcase,\" Krell gave the order for a full-scale attack, allowing Appo to deploy the rest of the legion to occupy the airbase."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the battle for the airbase, Krell had Fives and CT-5597 \"Jesse\" placed under military arrest for acts of insubordination. Although they were originally scheduled to be court-martialed, the General used his authority to sentence them both to summary execution. Appo escorted the rogue clones to the site of their execution, although the firing squad ultimately refused to carry out the order. Shortly afterward, it was discovered that Krell had been secretly supporting the Separatist cause after falling to the dark side of the Force. In response to the fallen Jedi's acts of treason, Appo and the 501st Legion mutinied against Krell with the support of the 212th Attack Battalion. Despite sustaining a number of casualties, they successfully apprehended the former Jedi. Krell was ultimately executed by the trooper \"Dogma,\" who was originally the former Jedi's most loyal follower until Krell admitted his betrayal."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Coruscant and Order 66"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Umbara, Appo was promoted to be a Clone Commander, but Rex\u2014despite only being a captain\u2014held more authority, retaining his position as leader of the 501st as a whole. In 19 BBY, during the waning days of the Clone Wars, the Republic was confronted with a simultaneous Separatist attack on Coruscant and a crisis on Mandalore. General Skywalker made the decision to divide the 501st to respond to both threats, promoting Captain Rex to serve as the commander of a division, the 332nd Division.

While Rex was still away from Coruscant and carried out the order aboard the Tribunal, Appo held authority over the 501st on the issuing of the Order. Under the command of General Skywalker\u2014now the the newly-anointed Sith Lord Darth Vader\u2014Appo and the 501st marched on the Jedi Temple. The clones proceeded to slaughter their former allies, including padawans and younglings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on the Jedi headquarters created a conflagration visible in the night sky of Coruscant's Federal District, drawing the Alderaanian senator Bail Organa to the Temple. Appo, along with a contingent of clones, barred the senator from entering the facility. Repeating the idea enforced by his control chip, he claimed that the Jedi had mounted a \"rebellion\" which the 501st was suppressing. When Organa ignored the clone's attempt to block his path, Appo threatened the politician at the point of a blaster. However, their encounter with Organa distracted the clones from the approaching Padawan Zett Jukassa, who managed to kill and wound several soldiers including striking down Appo himself.

As a result of his programming, in the form of a behavioral modification biochip in his brain, Appo was forced to comply with Order 66."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of Jango Fett, Appo was physically identical to his human male template in height and appearance.
