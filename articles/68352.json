Circa 1 ABY, one of her contacts, the Bothan smuggler Moril, was hired to deliver odd items to a group that he couldn't name. Moril refused to give her any details, displayed a very strange behavior, and even looked terrified. Ja'inn was worried about the Bothan and therefore reported this discussion to Lieutenant Joth of the Corellian Security Force. Joth thus sent a spacer to interrogate Moril. This led to the discovery of an illegal lab by the CorSec, a lab specialized in bio-engineering creatures through dangerous genetic experiments."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ja'inn was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
