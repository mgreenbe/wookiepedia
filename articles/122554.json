In doing so, however, she caused the Ghost and its crew to be tracked and boarded by the Imperials. Representative Tural, at first reluctant to trust the group traitors to the Empire, reconsiders her position when the Imperials who have come to her aid declare their intentions of executing the rebels without a trial. Tural distracts the Imperials, long enough for the rebels to overcome their captors. Upon her departure, the representative suggests that she has begun to see the Empire in a different light."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
