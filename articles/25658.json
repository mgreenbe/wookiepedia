Having initially arranged to meet Shep Contopault in another city, Mobok arrived in Theed. Unaware that he was in the wrong city, Mobok blamed Contopault for missing all of their arranged meetings, but was ultimately caught during the Trade Federation's invasion of the planet. Mobok attempted to escape Theed by speeder, but crashed it into a pond while attempting to evade a STAP pursuit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Attempting to escape, panicked and hysterical, Mobok met up with Jedi Padawan Sia-Lan Wezz and her companions Rorworr, Deel Surool, Arani Korden, Galak, and Dan\u00e9; all of whom were displaced passengers from the Crescent.

Mobok followed the group, attempting to return to the Crescent and the promise of off-world travel. Along the way, Mobok was ambushed and mauled by a Veermok, which the rest of the crew drove off.

Habble offered the refugees shelter, which Mobak gladly accepted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
