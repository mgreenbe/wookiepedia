They had contact with the galaxy by the time of the Galactic Civil War. In the year 0 BBY, a group of Ma'alkerrite ape-men visited the cantina Al The Alchemist's, a locale on the planet Toprawa frequented by mercenaries, gun-runners, and bounty hunters from across the galaxy, the infamous Boba Fett among them. That day, Havet Storm, a young Human boy whose grandfather had been a Jedi Knight, entered the cantina. The patrons soon discovered that Storm was carrying a lightsaber, so the Ma'alkerrite ape-men and other bar-goers clustered around the boy, staring at him aggressively. Fett, who was carrying a grudge against the boy from another encounter, ordered the assorted patrons of the cantina to kill Storm, but the boy escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Paul Cockburn created the Ma'alkerrite ape-men for his pick-a-path adventure Jedi Dawn, published by Boxtree Ltd in 1993.

The scene described there matches a scene contained in the actual adventure, including the same quotation from Boba Fett.
