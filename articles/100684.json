Initially, the project ran on schedule, and the Empire was able to increase its production of madilon. However, some of the native Nyriaanan clans protested about the way in which their planet was being exploited, so the Empire had them killed or enslaved. The project eventually brought ecological disaster to a quarter of Nyriaan's land mass, and was ended in 2 ABY, as a result of the actions of a Rebel Alliance-sponsored insurgency."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
