The weapon was an old Arkanian design, but had been modified to incorporate modular technology used by the Galactic Republic at the time. The blaster was capable of being upgraded with a scope, beam splitter, hair trigger, and an improved energy cell. Onasi owned the blaster during the Attack on the Endar Spire, during which he met the former Sith Lord Revan, with the identity of a Republic soldier. Onasi would use his personal blaster in his right hand, paired with a common blaster pistol in his left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The blaster first appeared as an equip-able item in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.
