The holocron contained the information about the Fount of Rajivari and remained on Tython for millennia until 3643 BBY, when it was discovered by Nalen Raloch, a Twi'lek colonist. Raloch learned from the holocron and eventually fell to the Dark side, deciding to destroy the Jedi Order. However, a Jedi stopped Raloch and recovered the Rajivari's holocron, delivering it to the Jedi Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rajivari's holocron appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Consular class mission on Tython."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
