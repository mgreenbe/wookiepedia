As with many EV-model droids, a programming defect caused EV-A4-D to have a sadistic personality. Prior to his work with Grievous, EV-A4-D served as a supervisor in a hospital on the world of Tauber, but he was relieved from duty after ordering the medical droids under his command to operate on patients without administering painkillers. He was later purchased by the InterGalactic Banking Clan and absorbed into the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "EV-A4-D was eventually assigned to work as the personal doctor of Grievous. Stationed in Grievous's castle on the third moon of Vassek, EV-A4-D became the facility's caretaker, managing the general's residence and working to repair any damage he sustained to his cyborg body over the course of the war. In 22 BBY, Confederate Head of State Count Dooku lured Republic forces to Grievous's castle in order to assess the general's abilities as the Supreme Commander of the Separatist Droid Army. During the confrontation with the Republic, Grievous was heavily damaged and was repaired by EV-A4-D to be able to confront the intruders once more. EV-A4-D later separated Nahdar Vebb and Kit Fisto, the two Jedi who were leading the Republic forces, allowing Grievous to defeat Vebb. However, as EV-A4-D monitored the castle's security cameras from the control room, he was decapitated and destroyed by Fisto."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid's body was later recovered by Grievous and reassembled.

Like most of the EV-series, A4-D, or Ay-Four-Dee, was affected by a programming defect during production that caused him to have a sadistic and malicious personality. Regardless of the defect, MerenData sold the EV-series droids, and EV-A4-D became a supervisor to the droids serving as the staff in a hospital on the planet Tauber. EV-A4-D's work in the hospital yielded dramatically higher productivity from the droids; however, the supervisor droid's methods disturbed the Human doctors. After serving in the hospital for a time, EV-A4-D ordered the droids to operate on the patients without the use of painkillers.

EV-A4-D, modified with medical and repair attachments, was assigned to work in the castle of cyborg Confederate General Grievous, Supreme Commander of the Separatist Droid Army, on the third moon of the planet Vassek. There, EV-A4-D served as a repair droid and doctor to Grievous. Aside from his duties as Grievous's personal physician, EV-A4-D also acted as the caretaker of the Vassek facility, overseeing its day-to-day maintenance, managing the general's IG-100 MagnaGuard bodyguards, and feeding Gor, Grievous's pet roggwart. The general was fond of Gor, but believed his abilities as the castle guardian could be improved. As such, Grievous enlisted the aid of EV-A4-D in attaching cybernetic limbs, exoskeletal plates, and armor to the roggwart. Over the course of the war, EV-A4-D grew used to his master returning from the battlefront in need of repair, and at one point he was aware of the reasons behind Grievous's transformation from a proud Kalee warrior into a cyborg subordinate of Confederate Head of State Count Dooku.

Gunray's escape presented Dooku with an opportunity to reassess Grievous's abilities to lead the Droid Army, which had been called into doubt after a recent string of defeats. While Grievous was away from his castle, Dooku planted the homing beacon of Gunray's frigate within the general's lair, and also remotely deactivated Grievous's IG-100 MagnaGuards, leaving EV-A4-D to believe that Grievous himself had deactivated them."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Intruders"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the placement of the tracking beacon, High Jedi General Kit Fisto and Jedi Knight Nahdar Vebb arrived on the third moon of Vassek with a small force of Republic clone troopers, having tracked down the Republic frigate in the hopes of recapturing Gunray.

The group resolved to take Grievous into custody upon his arrival at his castle. When he returned to his lair, Grievous was ambushed by the Republic forces.

However, Grievous was pulled away from watching Gor's efforts by EV-A4-D, who was ready to take Grievous in for repairs.

In addition to his position as Grievous's doctor, the droid became an advisor to the cyborg, and accompanied him during his time away from the Vassek castle. EV-A4-D was present during Grievous's attack on the Kel Dor homeworld of Dorin in the Expansion Region, during which the cyborg general attempted to exterminate the native population. In the latter stage of Grievous's initial assault, EV-A4-D informed the general of an incoming transmission from Asajj Ventress, a Confederate commander and Dark Acolyte apprentice of Count Dooku's. Although Grievous was unwilling to accept the communication, EV-A4-D convinced him to listen to Ventress, who was relaying a message from Dooku himself. Ventress warned the general of a Republic fleet that had departed Coruscant and was headed to reinforce the natives of Dorin and explained that the fleet was under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, who could easily turn the tide of battle.

Although A4-D worked diligently to ensure quality repairs, the droid enjoyed the opportunity to inflict pain upon the Kaleesh during his reconstructive surgeries. EV-A4-D was curious of the reasons behind Grievous's physical transformation and took care in ensuring his work on the mechanical body would not go to waste, insisting that Grievous take time to rest after his repairs.

Several arms that were attached to his torso and back had medical instruments affixed to the ends, while one of EV-A4-D's primary upper limbs was affixed with a \"carousel arm\" that allowed for rotation at the wrist between a surgical laser and a precision gripper.
