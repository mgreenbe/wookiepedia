Its north polar region, a spot of pearl white was surrounded by an entire hemisphere of tropical jungles. Its southern hemisphere was covered with impenetrable silvery clouds. Along the equator there were several rivers, lakes, and small seas. The edge of the southern hemisphere was also covered by elegant wisps of wind which frequently broke free to form spinning storms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zonama Sekot's first settlers were black-haired humanoid Ferroan colonists and red-skinned Langhesi colonists, and the living world was ruled by Magisters.

Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, traveled there to find fellow Jedi Vergere and to purchase one of the planet's living ships. Anakin bonded with a record twelve seed-partners, Obi-Wan bonded with an additional three. While Zonama Sekot was under attack from the Yuuzhan Vong (32 BBY\u201330 BBY), it was able to defeat them. Later Wilhuff Tarkin, then a Republic political leader and security force commander, declared war on the living world and attacked it in 29 BBY. Zonama Sekot unveiled its hyperdrive system, which had been built by the Langhesi, and escaped into the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the following years, stories of the \"rogue planet\" that had once made living ships circulated among many in the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many years later during the Yuuzhan Vong War, Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade Skywalker, Jacen Solo, R2-D2, and several other Jedi traveled to Zonama Sekot, which harbored the long forgotten secrets of the galaxy's invaders. Recognizing a glimmer of Anakin Skywalker in Luke and Jacen, Sekot allowed them to land and tested them. Sekot offered to destroy the Yuuzhan Vong entirely, but both Luke and Jacen refused. Nevertheless, Sekot decided to help them, in another way. Later, Nom Anor, disguised as Yu'shaa, the leader of the underground Jeedai heretics, tried without success to destroy the living world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zonama Sekot traveled to Yuuzhan Vong-held Coruscant, which had been renamed Yuuzhan'tar, and forged a peace between the Yuuzhan Vong and the Galactic Alliance.
