The blades of the second emitter were produced by a specialized power modulator that utilized a splitter to produce two very short blades. The purpose of these blades was to shunt power away from the main blade and to block and catch an opponent's blade. Some variants of the crossguard had only one secondary emitter, at varying angles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Variations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Forked lightsaber"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The forked lightsaber was a variant with only one smaller blade.

Later, a version with lightsaber blade quillons was added to SWTOR in 2016, and the Endless Vigil RPG sourcebook, after the design had already appeared in the canon film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. Given that The Old Republic and the Fantasy Flight Games role-playing game are the only Legends lines that continue beyond the Disney acquisition of LucasFilm, this marks one of the few cases of elements of the post-2014 canon being incorporated into the Legends continuity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
