After the Imperial victory at the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, Admiral Holtz was assigned to track down and destroy the Defiance Task Force, a Rebel Alliance fleet assigned to escort the survivors from Hoth to safe airspace. Holtz hoped to do this by deploying viper probe droids to scan outer space for the fleet's location, and Probe Group Oracle was one of the probe groups assigned to this task."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Corrupter Task Force deployed their probes, they were attacked by a pair of A-wings from the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Defiance whose assignment was to eliminate these probes.
