He kept a firm grip on the release trigger of the Resistance bomber Cobalt Hammer, ready to release the bombers payload onto First Order targets. He was killed during the evacuation of D'Qar. Paige Tico later called Jerd to check if he was okay, but received no response. A short while after, Tico came across a deceased Nix in her attempt to drop the bomber's payload. After Jerd's death, his helmet was recovered and worn by his friend Enanan Supa whilst she was piloted a B-Wing Fighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nix had a good head for numbers and was usually calm and unaffected when his bomber was under attack.
