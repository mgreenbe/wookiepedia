Regimental HQs also had a large repair workshop and some were equipped with nanomanufacturing capabilities that allowed them to take very basic components and produce spare parts. The workshops were included in regimental headquarters because the size and strength of the regiment, being formidable enough to ensuring the capture and long-term occupation of a planetary territorial region, required extensive resupply and support"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Usually the regimental HQ was stationed in orbit aboard a vessel, although if orbital command was disrupted it could quickly be dropped onto the planet's surface.

This was not out of some need but by Imperial commanders using the HQ to tempt rebels into attacking it and leading them into a trap. Depending on the size of the armor battalion (heavy or light), the strength of a repulsorlift regiment was 2,641 or 2,735 troops, around 1,305 support personnel, 53 or 93 tanks, 400 repulsorlift vehicles and 120 speeder bikes.

During the formation of the Imperial Army, artillery had been given the least priority of the combat arms, with the common thinking that artillery would play no significant role on modern battlefields. The Rebellion, however, proved them wrong and attempts were made to quickly revitalize this force. Officially an artillery regiment would be attached to a battlegroup and operate as a single unit. However due to some complaints by junior officers on occasion smaller artillery units were assigned at the regimental or battalion level, such as an artillery battery being attached to a line battalion, although this was not reflected in the OB. When operating together there were 2,425 troopers, 1,095 support personnel, 144 medium/heavy or 288 light tubes, 53 tanks and 199 repulsorcraft in the regiment, and it could be augmented with a repulsorlift battalion and three more artillery battalions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Armor Regiment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Armor regiments had the most firepower of all regiments but lacked the numbers in infantry for any garrison duty.
