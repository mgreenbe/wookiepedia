Wedge Antilles arrived with Vanguard Squadron and took out a squad of TIE interceptors attacking them. Vanguard then attacked the damaged Star Destroyer head on. Vanguard Five found a breaching point and escorted a group of U-wings to board the destroyer. A Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier then jumped into the atmosphere and deployed squadrons of TIE fighters as reinforcements. Vanguard warded off the fighters and was able to destroy the carrier, only for three more to jump into the battle. However, the boarding crew was able to gain control over the Star Destroyer and opened fire onto the carriers, destroying them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, Vanguard squadron returned to the Temperance and Wedge went off on another mission.
