The Bith was not identified by name or by gender. Two Bith associated with the New Jedi Order have since been created. First, in 2000, James Luceno created Ulaha Kore, a female Bith Jedi, for his novel The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse. Second, in 2005, Troy Denning created a male Bith, who worked as a Flight Controller at the Jedi Academy on Ossus, for his novel Dark Nest I: The Joiner King; in this case, it is unclear from the novel whether that Bith is a Jedi or part of a civilian staff on Ossus. It is possible that the Bith Jedi from Planet of Twilight is identical to either of these later individuals, but no canon source has made this connection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
