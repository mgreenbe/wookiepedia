An explosion knocks the AT-TE on its side, sending the top gunner flying before he can fire a shot. Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Rex emerge from the walker under Separatist fire. Obi-Wan, Ahsoka, and Rex confront the droids that attacked the AT-TE while Anakin attacks the MagnaGuards on a landing platform. A MagnaGuard starfighter takes off and fires on Skywalker. Kenobi and Tano rush to help him. Asajj Ventress then shows up and reveals to the Jedi that the Separatists had been developing a weapon on the planet, a small device she identifies as \"The Death Brick\". Ventress hurls the Brick at the three Jedi and escapes on the back on the MagnaGuard starfighter. The Brick is blocked, however, when Rex jumps in front of it, which simply bounces off his head. Commander Cody arrives at that moment in a Republic Gunship. The group leaves in the gunship with Cody reporting of the defeat of the droids Obi-Wan left him to deal with. The last scene shows two battle droids lamenting their loss to the clones in their game of cards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"THE END.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
