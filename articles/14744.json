The pirate's forces had captured a small Imperial Star Destroyer as it was sitting in a repair dock, and were intent on using it to subdue the lightly defended system. The Demolisher would emerge from hyperspace, unleash its complement of captured TIE fighters and bombard Tammuz-an from orbit. The plan would have worked, had it not been for the fact that the fuel shipments were decoys and sabotage would come to ruin the Demolisher internally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Demolisher exited hyperspace, it engaged the battle-ready Tammuz-an fleet. Inside the ship, the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO were being held captive and put to work. However, R2's quick thinking led him to sabotage the weapons system, by loading an inverted proton torpedo into the launch bay. The resulting explosions crippled Demolisher, and foiled Kybo's plans. He was soon captured by Mon Julpa's forces, along with his crew, thus ending the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
