Prior to joining the camp, he was found by Mandalore the Preserver while working as muscle for Hutts on Nar Shaddaa. Though he sold and bought items to and from Meetra Surik, he had an extreme dislike toward the Jedi, partly because Surik was a Jedi and an outsider and partially because he had lost to Surik in the Battle Circle.
