Her newly arrived extra-galactic forces helped bolster the forces of Prefect Da'Gara of the Praetorite Vong. Her forces were used for the assault on Dubrillion, where they were defeated by Lando Calrissian and his allies. Her forces were also used for the defense of Helska. Ma'Shraid was killed when the Jedi used shieldships to reflect the energy waves of the yammosk stationed at Helska IV back to the planet, melting, then freezing, and finally shattering the planet, killing everyone on the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
