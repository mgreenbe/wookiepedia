Kundrils grew to be at least twenty meters and often much larger. They had long, slender, multi-segmented bodies, bulging out to hardened wedges at the tail end. These wedges could be used to bash their prey into submission. Their bodies were lined with row upon row of thin, translucent wings, which were used for maneuvering in the air, but the actual method of flight was a series of internal gas bladders inside their exoskeletons, which were filled with lighter-than-air gases. Kundrils did not have eyes and hunted by means of echolocation. Kundrils typically lived and hunted by the shore and at sea, swooping down from the air to catch fish or sea mammals. Kundrils mated and laid their eggs on land, hidden in sand nests. Seagoing kundrils were typically blue or green. Most land-based kundrils became extinct, either supplanted by non-native creatures or exterminated. In the mountains and canyons, a few bright red Imperial kundrils still existed, often near volcanoes. Kundrils were formidable, but rarely attacked Humans or Human-sized creatures unless provoked. They were, however, capable of attacking and devouring humanoid sentients and could in fact even defend themselves against airspeeders if necessary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
