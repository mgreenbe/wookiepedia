During the time of the Galactic Republic, Red Star, along with Pulsar Supertanker, Quasar Cargo, and Ororo Transportation were choking commerce by shutting out Outer Rim Territories-based competitors and refusing to share navigational data. The Trade Federation, which began its existence as a Republic-chartered organization charged with dispute mediation, helped to curb these abuses of power. They were one of the voting sponsors of the Corporate Sector Authority, investing in the venture in the years after the formation of the Corporate Sector. They owned the freighter designated Transport A-175, which was hijacked by the Alliance to Restore the Republic privateer Far Orbit. The loss of a cargo of power cells and power system components cost the company about 35 million credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
