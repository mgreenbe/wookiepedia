Following the death of Empress Vaylin and formation of the Eternal Alliance in 3630 BBY, the White Maw took over the Firefrost Lavaworks on Hoth. They used it to stockpile military equipment, using slave labor to make new ships and weapons, with Droub becoming the cruel overseer of the factory. The Alliance eventually saw his rise as a threat and dispatched a strike team to Firefost to liberate the slaves and put an end to the production. Forgemaster Droub attempted to stop the intruders with his Autonomous Walker JS-MW1, but was eventually overwhelmed and killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Forgemaster Droub appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne as the final boss of the \"Firefrost\" Uprising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
