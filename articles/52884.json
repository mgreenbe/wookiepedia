Around 3 BBY,[source?] the Garbis operated from Thune City, capital of the Wild Space planet of Thune, under the leadership of Lord Donith Garbis. They used to appropriate any unattended cargo found on the planet, leaving their symbol behind them. At one point, Lord Donith's son Tomith Garbis fought Sabine Wren and Garazeb Orrelios over containers of weapons and ship parts, but could not prevent them from getting away with the cargo. Those events started a vendetta between the Garbis and the rebel Spectre cell, to which Wren and Orrelios belonged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
