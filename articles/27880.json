Lancer troopers gained notoriety under the leadership of Obi-Wan Kenobi at the Battle of Muunilinst, where they faced off against Durge and his speeder bike-mounted IG lancer combat droids. Both contingents then proceeded to destroy one another until only Kenobi, a few clone lancers and Durge were left. Lancer troopers were also used to overwhelm the droid front lines. Their bikes sometimes had heat-seeking missiles equipped. They were one of the few clone troopers to have a melee weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
