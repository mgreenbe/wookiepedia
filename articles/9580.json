Lieutenant Valeria devised a plan to destroy the battle station by dropping a proton bomb into the base's thermal exhaust port. Despite some unexpected delays, the rebels managed to destroy Strike Station Aurek with the help of Rowan Freemaker and the B1-series battle droid Roger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Freemakers joined the Rebel Alliance, they found work as mechanics servicing the Alliance Fleet's starfighters. Later, Lieutenant Valeria devised an operation to destroy the Imperial base Strike Station Aurek. Her plan involved dropping a proton bomb into the base's thermal exhaust port. This tactic had first been used by Luke Skywalker during the Battle of Yavin to destroy the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rebels experienced an unexpected delay when the B1-series battle droid Roger, who had been temporarily blinded by burning sweet-sand cookies, bumped into a stack of containers that Rowan had been standing on. The containers collapsed in a domino wave over Blue Squadron's starfighters, damaging them. While Rowan's older siblings Zander and Kordi Freemaker distracted Lieutenant Valeria and her squadron, Rowan and Roger rebuilt the starfighters with the former using the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite repairing the starfighters, Roger built himself into the astromech socket of Valeria's Y-wing.

During the battle, Roger panicked and Rowan feigned enthusiasm in order to avoid arousing Valeria's suspicions. Valeria's Y-wing was pursued by two TIEs but Rowan managed to use the Y-wing's rear cannons to shoot them down. One collided with a pinnacle. As the Y-wing approached the thermal exhaust port, Roger fretted that he had not fixed the launch tube. Rowan instead used the Force to detach the bomb, which rolled into the exhaust port. Strike Station Aurek blew up, destroying the Imperial forces. Rowan likened the outcome to the destruction of the Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to Home One, Rowan used his lightsaber to cut himself and Roger free of the Y-wing. Zander and Kordi praised Rowan with Kordi telling her brother that the Force was with him.
