Selected as a Padawan by Jedi Master Ekim Ryelli, Etima constructed a blue-bladed lightsaber and continued to train with his master. Stationed at the Coruscant Jedi Temple around the time of the vote on the Military Creation Act in the Galactic Senate, Padawan Etima was one of two hundred Jedi to respond to Master Mace Windu's call to arms and joined the strike team dispatched to Geonosis to rescue fellow Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from execution by the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Landing on the planet, Etima and his peers stormed the Petranaki arena where they engaged in battle with the battle droids of the Separatist Droid Army.

There is a discrepancy between how he appears in the film and in the Hasbro box pack and Daily Calendar.
