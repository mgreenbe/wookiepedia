A company of Clone SCUBA troopers led by the Jedi General Kit Fisto and Clone Commander \"Monnk\" traveled to the planet Mon Cala after Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and the Jedi General Anakin Skywalker failed to mediate tensions between the Mon Calamari and Quarren, and after the pro-Separatist Quarren Isolation League attacked the Mon Calamari capital. Clone SCUBA troopers aided the Mon Calamari Guard in the city's defense during the initial battle.

Later, several of these troopers along with many Mon Calamari, Quarren, and Gungans attended the execution of Prince Lee-Char. Before Tamson could execute the Mon Cal prince, the Quarren chieftain Nossor Ri experienced a change in heart and successfully convinced his people to turn against Commander Tamson and the Separatist occupiers. The clone troopers along with the Quarren, Mon Calamari, Gungans, and Jedi then joined forces to expel the Separatist from Mon Cala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Kier Domadi participated in Clone Wars era battle reenactments as a scuba trooper when aquatic battles came up."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
