In 4999 BBY, Zavakon departed the planet Korriban with the rest of the surviving Sith in order to escape the Galactic Republic after the Old Sith Empire's defeat in the Great Hyperspace War, and it was not until 4980 BBY that the Sith exodus came to an end at Dromund Kaas. There, the Sith Emperor established a new Empire, and Zavakon was chosen as one of the twelve Dark Lords of the Sith who formed the Empire's ruling Dark Council. Taking on the recovery and study of ancient knowledge as his Spheres of Influence, Zavakon came to realize that the Empire was suffering because of his fellow Sith's unwillingness to share knowledge. As a result, he dispatched a team of archaeologists and military officers to investigate ruins that other Sith had already surveyed. The significant discoveries made by Zavakon's team led the Dark Council to authorize the formation of the Imperial Reclamation Service, a military organization devoted to preserving knowledge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Zavakon was first introduced in the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia, in the section on the Imperial Reclamation Service."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
