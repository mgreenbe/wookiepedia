Jedi Master Mace Windu, joining the mission to Fondor, handily defeated a GNK attack with his lightsaber, neatly severing the blaster that had emerged from beneath a lid in the droid's upper frame."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the Battle of Endor, rumors began to spread regarding a \"Cult of the Power Droids.\" Apparently, a pair of GNK Power Droids would come to one's door and request funding for a fringe religious group.

Gonk ko kyenga see,\" a highly controversial statement that was not allowed to be legally translated (see Baobab Security Directive 51-C)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The GNK power droid derives its name from the \"gonk\" sound it makes in Episode IV.

They can be interacted with, such as being Force pushed, shot, or destroyed. They explode when shot. However, they are invincible when they appear in the Dex's Diner hub area. Gonk droids are included mainly for the player's amusement, as they are universally ignored by enemies. Gonk droids are also a Separatist character in The Clone Wars version. A \"Super Gonk\" upgrade can be purchased with in-game currency, permitting the player's gonk droid to run and jump, though not attack. Several gonk droids can be found wandering around the Mos Eisley Cantina."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
