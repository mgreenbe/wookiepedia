During the Clone Wars against the Separatist Alliance, the Republic Navy maintained twenty major fleets, six of which were located in the Core Worlds and acted as defense and reserve. One designated reserve fleet would have been compromised if the Separatists defeated the Republic at their critical starship production planet of Anaxes during the Battle of Anaxes, according to Jedi General Mace Windu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Republic transitioned into the Galactic Empire, the Imperial Navy continued to use reserve fleets. One reserve fleet within the Imperial Navy was the 15th Deep Core Reserve Fleet, which was a numbered fleet of the navy and was headquartered in the Empress Teta system. The 15th acted as a security checkpoint to the Deep Core, and regularly conducted anti-piracy and smuggling patrols."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
