The most notable modification was a pair of aft-firing concussion missile launchers, which provided a nasty surprise for any pursuing ship. The Rimrunner played an important role in the Battle of Nar Shaddaa, but was later destroyed during a botched Kessel Run. While racing against Han Solo's Millennium Falcon, Salla skirted too close to one of the Maw's black holes while attempting a micro-jump. Han came to Salla's rescue and both barely escaped with their lives, the Rimrunner however couldn't be saved."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
