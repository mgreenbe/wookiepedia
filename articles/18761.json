It was largely unexplored during the time of the Imperial Era and couldn't be found on any maps. Its surface was covered in mesas and wetlands. The planet was home to a great Vault built by the ancient Zeffo civilization. Bogano was important to the Zeffo due the presence of the Binog, a large creature important to Zeffo art and culture. Another reason for the Vault's location was theorized by Eno Cordova to be because of the light electromagnetic winds, although in much smaller conditions than Zeffo. At least one Zeffo Colony was located on Bogano likely as a pilgrimage site. The Vault hid away a holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children in the galaxy, which was placed there by Jedi Master Eno Cordova."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bogano layed in the Outer Rim sector of the galaxy. It was a generally uninhabited world, and its nature was in turn relatively untouched. The world was primarily comprised of flat, grassy plains, broken up by massive ravines and sinkholes made of limestone and clay. There were also water-filled caves beneath the thin surface layer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ancient history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Long before the Imperial Era, the Zeffo built a Vault.

He was followed by the Second Sister who stole the holocron and escaped.

Immediately upon her arrival, she found her friend and fellow rebel Luke Skywalker. Leia asked why he was there and not checking out other planets. Luke said the Force took him there, and the two analyzed the planet together. The two found a small animal that led them to the Bogano Vault. Luke felt the Force was strong in the place, and although Leia thought the world might be a good base, Luke disagreed. Luke was right, because soon after, the two followed the small animal to a group of stormtroopers who were dealing with several animals of the same species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bogano is a location that was created for the game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, developed by Respawn Entertainment. During development, the surface of Bogano was always imagined as a vast marsh. Respawn Entertainment faced the challenge of integrating wall running and platforming into a flat landscape. To solve this, Respawn Entertainment developed a layered geology for the planet consisting of constantly fracturing cratered limestone and clay, which in turn helped them introduce the visual themes of exploration and the continuous decay of time. Concept art for Bogano was done by Liam MacDonald and Gabe Yeganyan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
