After her parents were killed by Imperial forces when she was fourteen years old, Charn and her younger brother, Ayx, moved to live with a family friend on the Outer Rim planet Tatooine. When she was old enough, she joined the Rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Due to her talents as a singer, dancer and actor, the Rebels set her up as a performer on the Corellian circuit under the name Alai Jance, using her tours to smuggle cargo and information between Rebel cells. During this time, Charn entered into a relationship with Hityamun Kris, a Vigo in the Black Sun crime syndicate. The two were engaged to be married, but Charn broke off their relationship after discovering that Kris had been smuggling illegal goods aboard her starship. She provided information on Black Sun's activities to the Imperial Security Bureau, leading to the collapse of the syndicate's operations along the Corellian Trade Spine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After starting afresh with the new identity of Javul Charn, her career soon took off and Charn became famous throughout the galaxy.

After receiving a series of threatening messages, Charn hired the smuggler Dash Rendar and his crew, Eaden Vrill and LE-BO2D9, to provide security for the tour. Despite this, the tour was plagued by numerous attacks and acts of sabotage. After an attempt on her life during her first stop on Rodia, Charn abandoned her ship and most of her crew on Tatooine and continued the tour aboard the freighter Millennium Falcon, under the command of the freelance pilot Han Solo.

During the early years of the Galactic Empire, Charn's father, a veteran of the Republic Navy, and mother worked as musicians and toured throughout the Mid and Outer Rim. The tours served as a cover for their involvement with the fledgling resistance movement in opposition to Imperial rule, allowing them to smuggle information between cells on different planets. Despite keeping a low profile, Charn's father was one of many former Republic Military personnel classified as a potential insurgent by the Empire. When Charn was fourteen years old, Imperial forces raided a venue where her parents were performing on the Bothan homeworld Bothawui.

Charn's looks and burgeoning singing talent gained her attention from several men on her adopted homeworld, including a group of Imperial stormtroopers, a Zabrak spacer who hoped to marry her and a man who proposed buying Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in Mos Eisley and installing Charn as the house chanteuse."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Rebels and the Vigo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Charn was old enough, she decided to follow her parents by joining the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Working with Commander Yanus Melikan of the Corellian Guard, Charn started performing on the Corellian circuit using the identity Alai Jance, the daughter of a Nar Shaddaa pirate, with an act that included singing, dancing and dramatic scenes based on cultural legends. Like her parents before her, however, her singing career was a front for her Rebel activities, moving cargo and information for the resistance. She remained a small-time performer until, during a performance at the Quarek'k club on the galactic capital of Coruscant, a song cycle about Human immigrants on Mandalore brought her to the attention of Hityamun Kris, a Mandalorian who had turned his back on his clan to join the Black Sun crime syndicate and had subsequently risen to the rank of Vigo. Although she quickly became aware of Kris's illegal activities, Charn nevertheless began a relationship with him and the pair were eventually engaged to marry. With Kris's financial backing, Charn's career soon took a turn for the better and her relationship offered some protection from the Imperial authorities, as well as providing the Alliance with information on Black Sun's activities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one of her tours, Charn's ship ran into trouble and dropped out of hyperspace suddenly, damaging one of the equipment containers aboard the ship in the process. An attempt to fix the container revealed a body inside, which Charn turned the body over to the authorities on Coruscant. The official story was that the dead man was a fan who had stowed away and died of asphyxiation, but the Rebels learned that he was a diplomat who was wanted by the Empire. The incident led them to discover that Kris had been using Charn's tours to move items including narcotics, weapons, biological agents and sentient beings around the galaxy without attracting the attention of the Empire or rival Vigos. Since Kris's actions were endangering her work with the Rebellion, Charn decided to end their relationship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Holostar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After parting company with Kris, she started using the stage name Javul Charn.

Charn's career soon eclipsed that of Alai Jance's and her elaborate performances, which combined singing, dancing and acting with holographically projected landscapes, helped her become famous throughout the galaxy. The extensive equipment required for her concerts was split between two ships: the freighter Deep Core and her luxury private yacht, the Nova's Heart, a modified SoroSuub PLY-3500 named after her first holo-album to sell over ten billion copies. Charn's entourage and crew traveled with her aboard the Nova's Heart, from where they produced and managed her concerts, holocasts and personal appearances. Among the crew were several Rebels, including Melikan in the role of cargo master, the Nova's Heart's captain, Serdor Marrak, and Charn's friend, Farlion, who acted as her road manager. Not all members of the crew were aware of Charn's Rebel activities, but the Rebels took care to check all crew members for Imperial or Black Sun connections."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kris reacted angrily to Charn's departure, threatening and pleading with her to return to him. When Charn refused, Kris made a point of cutting off all contact with her. However, the Rebels discovered that Kris was still using the Nova's Heart to smuggle contraband. Contraband was often found and removed before taking off, but there were several occasions when contraband was not found until after departure. Among the cargo smuggled aboard by Kris's agents where more sentients, including victims of turf wars between Kris and his fellow Vigos, criminals fleeing the authorities and political abductees. Although some survived the journey, all suffered food, water and oxygen deprivation and a total of three beings were found dead aboard the ship. When the Rebels discovered an important Black Sun cargo aboard the Nova's Heart, Charn saw the opportunity to stop the crime syndicate's interference and convince the Empire that she was a loyal citizen at the same time. She turned over the cargo to the Imperial Security Bureau and provided them with much information about Black Sun's activities, including the names of ships and their captains, timetables, cargoes, methods of operation and recognition codes. The information led to the arrests and conviction of several senior members of Black Sun operating around the Corellian Trade Spine, including a couple of Vigos. At the same time as crippling Black Sun's activities and forcing the syndicate's leader, Prince Xizor, to redesign his organization's operations along the Corellian Spine, Charn's actions made room for the Alliance to increase its own activities in that region."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The stalker"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For a time, Charn's tours started to run smoothly without Black Sun interference. Around 1 BBY, Charn visited Cloud City on the planet Bespin, where she recruited the Bothan Tereez Dza'lar as a costumer. In 0 BBY, Charn was scheduled to embark on a tour from Rodia in the Outer Rim to Alderaan in the Core Worlds, via Christophsis, Falleen, Bannistar Station and Bacrana. The tour would also serve as cover for a mission for the Alliance. Charn was instructed to pick up a container holding a set of stolen Imperial military plans during her stop on Bannistar Station and deliver it to her Alliance liaison on Alderaan. However, following a concert on Coruscant shortly before the tour, Charn received some threatening messages among her fan mail. When she and her entourage were showered with black fire lilies as they boarded the Nova's Heart after a personal appearance, she realized that the messages had come from somebody who was capable of getting close to her and started to suspect that somebody in Black Sun was behind the threat. As a result, Farlion insisted that they hire security for the tour. Charn was reluctant, fearing that the presence of bodyguards might interfere with her Rebel activities, so Farlion suggested avoiding professional security firms and instead hiring somebody in her hometown of Mos Eisley."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Chalmun's Cantina in Mos Eisley, Charn and Farlion encountered the smuggler and freelance pilot Dash Rendar, who was seeking work to finance repairs to his YT-2400 light freighter, the Outrider, which had been damaged on a recent smuggling run. Explaining only that she required protection from a stalker, Charn hired Rendar as her bodyguard, along with his Nautolan co-pilot Eaden Vrill and his LE-series repair droid Leebo. With Charn's new security crew aboard, the Nova's Heart departed Tatooine for Rodia. Shortly after leaving, Charn was in her quarters with Farlion when the ship suddenly lost power, dropping out of hyperspace, and an alarm sounded to signal a hull breach. Finding the door locked, the pair took a hidden escape passage from Charn's quarters to the cargo hold. When they returned to Charn's quarters with Melikan, they found several crew members, including Rendar, Vrill and Leebo, searching for them. Rendar was concerned that the incident was the result of sabotage and Charn instructed the ship's executive officer, Bran Finnick, to run diagnostics. The Nova's Heart's systems showed no further signs of sabotage and the ship's Twi'lek engineer, Arruna Var, determined that the power cut had been triggered by a signal embedded within the approach protocols sent by the Rodian Space Authority. This made Rendar suspect that the stalker was someone more dangerous than an overzealous fan. When he spoke to Charn, she told Rendar that she suspected Black Sun as she was often mistaken for Alai Jance, the former lover of a Black Sun Vigo. With the upcoming Rodia concerts taking place at the Holosseum in Equator City, a center of Black Sun activity, Rendar suggested canceling the show. Unable to disrupt the tour without risking her mission, Charn refused."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rodia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nova's Heart docked at a private landing facility at Equator City's spaceport and Charn took a shuttle to the Holosseum, where she was greeted by a large group of fans, many of whom had camped out overnight to see her arrive. Concerned that Charn was too exposed, Rendar quickly ushered her inside the building. Charn's show, which included a section in which she portrayed a sprite, saw her \"fly\" on a support cable from four sets suspended above the stage. As Charn rehearsed, the door in the stage floor leading to the storage area below opened and concert seats came flying out and started to move into position. One bank of seats clipped Charn's support cable as it passed, dragging her towards another seating bank. Charn freed herself from the cable to avoid being crushed and activated her emergency antigrav unit to slow her descent. Moments later, however, her antigrav unit failed and she dropped in an uncontrolled fall. Vrill caught Charn at the last moment, saving her from being crushed by the closing stage door."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Var ascertained that a power surge from the city grid had overloaded Charn's antigrav unit and triggered the stage door to open, but only somebody in the building could have made it close again. Rendar was concerned that the saboteur may be among Charn's crew, but she still refused to cancel the concerts. The possibility of Black Sun involvement led Rendar to suspect Hityamun Kris, who was operating on Rodia. When he mentioned this to Charn, she confessed that she was Alai Jance and admitted that Kris was a likely suspect. Despite Rendar's concerns, Charn's first two concerts on Rodia were uneventful. On the night of the third and final concert, however, Kris arrived at the Holosseum with three bodyguards and proceeded straight to Charn in the backstage area. The Mandalorian told Charn that he still hoped to win her back and warned her not to be stubborn. Although shaken by the encounter, Charn regained control of her emotions and completed the concert without further incident."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the possibility of a saboteur within her crew, Charn decided to abandon the Nova's Heart and most of the crew and continue the tour aboard a different ship.

She headed to Every Delight, a club in Equator City's Port Town, where she hired an individual known to her only as Rancor's Wrath to attack her ship as it left the planet the following day. As she was leaving, Charn was confronted by Rendar and Vrill, who had tracked her down after discovering she was missing.

As the yacht cleared the Rodia system, Rancor's Wrath attacked as planned. An explosive charge timed to go off at the same time as the attack damaged the cargo bay airlock before Rancor's Wrath withdrew. Following the attack, Charn met with the senior crew. Playing up the idea that the saboteur was behind the latest attack, she announced her intention to continue the tour in a different ship and offered to pay for repairs to Rendar's Outrider if he agreed to act as her pilot. After arriving on Tatooine, however, Rendar's mechanic confirmed that the repairs could not be completed in time to get her to Christophsis for her next concert. Forced to locate another pilot at Chalmun's Cantina, Charn hired the Corellian smuggler and old-time rival of Rendar, Han Solo, who agreed to take her and a small crew in his YT-1300 light freighter, the Millennium Falcon. Rendar initially refused to work with Solo and threatened to quit. When Charn asked him to change his mind, Rendar demanded to know the truth about her stalker.

In addition to Solo, Rendar, Vrill and Leebo, the crew comprised Farlion, Melikan, his Sullustan assistant Nik, and several cargo droids, including Melikan's Otoga-222 maintenance droid Oto. Despite these precautions, however, it soon became clear that the saboteur had tampered with the Millennium Falcon when a sudden gravity failure in the ship's cargo hold almost resulted in Rendar being crushed by falling crates.

As the Millennium Falcon and Deep Core were loaded for departure following the final night on Christophsis, Hityamun Kris paid Charn a visit in her dressing room. The Vigo admitted that he had been attempting to frighten her into returning to him, but warned that Xizor wanted her dead and there was nothing he could do to protect her if she insisted on going to Falleen. When he tried to force the issue, however, Rendar, Vrill, Solo and Melikan arrived and disarmed him and his bodyguards. Back at the Millennium Falcon, Rendar also tried to convince Charn to cancel the visit to Falleen.

As they rode the turbolift back down, Rendar contacted Vrill and Solo, who arranged to pick them up in an empty hangar bay three levels below the Millennium Falcon's current level. The deception only bought them a few moments and Edge reached the new level moments after Charn and Rendar, opening fire as they ran towards where Solo, Vrill and Melikan were waiting by the hangar door. As their allies returned fire, Edge launched a Repulsor throwing razor after the fleeing Humans. As Rendar leaped out of the razor's path, Charn removed her robe and threw it at the razor, slowing it down enough for her to get a clear shot with her blaster.

D'Vox took Charn and her security to see the station's command center before leading them to a cantina in a communal habitat area, ensuring that Rendar and Vrill were seated at a different table while he enjoyed a private lunch with Charn. Realizing that D'Vox's obvious attraction to her might make him amenable to rearranging the station modules, Charn agreed to have dinner alone with the commander that evening.

Charn narrowly avoided a throwing razor by throwing her jacket into the air to confuse its tracking mechanism. Moments later, the stage lights cut out, plunging the staircase into darkness and leaving Charn exposed due to the light shining from her holo-emitter lenses. Rendar initially told Charn to close her eyes to cut out the light; as Edge approached, Rendar instructed her to open her eyes again and look right at the assassin.

Oto was due to send their location to both Xizor and the Empire when they next dropped out of hyperspace. Rendar suggested using this to their advantage. Deactivating the droid, they contacted Marrak to warn him about Finnick and arranged to meet the Nova's Heart in the Circarpous system. They then made another jump in the wrong direction, reactivating Oto temporarily in an effort to lead Black Sun and the Empire away from their intended destination.
