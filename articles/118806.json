Despite this, it was erroneously classified as a light freighter by the Galactic Empire, an error which, due to the nature of Imperial bureaucracy, was never rectified."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With a bulbous and well-armored command deck and a hull tapering from the prow, the SS-54 was described as having an insect-like profile. Its high, squared-off stern was comparable to that of the Republic Military LAAT/c heavy vehicle carrier. Two adjustable spars protruded towards the aft of the ship (one on each side), with each spar connecting to the SS-54's powerful Incom HA-980a H/O ion engines. Given its military role, the craft's standard armament consisted of four fire-linked ZX7 medium laser cannons mounted forward in the prow and a twin light laser turret mounted dorsally, aft of the engine spars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SS-54 was introduced to the military market shortly after Botajef Shipyards gained prominence with their AA-9 Freighter-Liner.
