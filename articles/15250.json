After Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker was taken prisoner aboard Dooku's ship above the planet Vanqor and was rescued by fellow Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, the two went to face the Sith Lord in his private quarters, but ultimately ended up chasing him to the planet's surface, where the two Jedi entered a nearby cave to search for their enemy. However, Dooku managed to escape but had encountered Hondo Ohnaka, who was currently looting the downed Sheathipede-class shuttle and his solar sailer. Ohnaka informed Dooku that if he needed transportation off of Vanqor, the nearest planet was Florrum, Hondo's base of operations, and Dooku accepted the pirate's offer for transportation, assuring him that he'd compensate his services. While en route to Florrum, Ohnaka was able to pickpocket the Sith Lord and steal his and Skywalker's lightsaber, and upon their arrival on Florrum, the pirate mistook Dooku for a Jedi, but Dooku corrected him, telling him that he was a Sith Lord. However, Ohnaka reminded him that he was still outnumbered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nonetheless, the Count later managed to escape the grasp of Ohnaka's gang with the help of his enemies, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, as well as the Naboo Representative Jar Jar Binks, and Ohnaka was warned by Kenobi that although there were no held grudges towards him or his gang, Dooku did not share the same sentiment as they and knew where Ohnaka lived, suggesting that a Separatist attack was likely to take place in the future."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
