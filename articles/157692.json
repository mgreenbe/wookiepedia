Despite being able to move at a slow pace, she would often stand still in the sunlight, contemplating the Force and her place in the universe. During the Second Imperium Crisis, the treelike Jedi was tasked with protecting the academy from potential invaders. She once stopped two Dark Jedi intruders from the Shadow Academy by crashing a dying Massassi tree trunk on them. However, this single feat had drained many months of her energy reserves, and it took a long time to recover from this intervention."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite her plant-like nature, this Jedi was capable of using a lightsaber.
