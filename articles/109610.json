Fortunately, two of the Jedi's finest are in the area -- Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi! They've only got 84 minutes to board the runaway cruise ship, restore control, and save the suspicious collection of filthy rich passengers from a cloudy grave! But it won't be easy -- the ship doesn't WANT to be repaired, and the systems themselves seem to repel their every effort!
