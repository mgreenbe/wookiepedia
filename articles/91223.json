In 14:3, ten months after the First Battle of Geonosis, which started the Clone Wars between the CIS and Republic, the Republic chose the commando unit Omega Squad to destroy the facility, despite having just issued them stealth Katarn-class commando armor; while being extra tough, the armor was colored black, making it inopportune for an arctic mission. Composed of four Republic clones, each the sole survivors of other, decimated squads, the unit was led by RC-1309. Omega Squad's mission was to destroy the Separatist facility, which was developing a new supermetal known as phrik. The mission was considered simple by the clones themselves: they planned to infiltrate the facility, lay charges in its processing plant and foundry, and then escape the plant before detonating the explosives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The four clones were dropped planetside in a gunship, in the lee of an outcrop overlooking the facility. After brief reconnaissance, Omega Squad commando RC-8015 used a PLX-1 portable missile launcher to attack the droids, while his companions, RC-3222 and RC-1136, worked their way up to higher ground to infiltrate the factory.
