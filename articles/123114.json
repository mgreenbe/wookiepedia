After Baktoid Armor Workshop and the Techno Union shuttered factories which manufactured B1-Series battle droids on five worlds across the galaxy, Wrede made claims that the Techno Union had relocated their business to the Outer Rim Territories. Wrede noted that the Techno Union had continued to buy up raw materials, yet had not created any product during the same time period. He lacked any proof of this claim, and his statement was refuted by several business analysts. A three-month investigation turned up no evidence, and Wrede's political career and reputation were shattered. In the aftermatch, Wrede committed suicide. In reality, Wrede was correct in his suspicions, and these hidden battle droids would soon emerge from planets such as Geonosis during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Ister Paddie succeeded Wrede in the Senate.

The package was addressed to both Senator Paddie and President Dibra Born. Though the government was shut down for several hours, bomb-squad droids and the Sermerian Bio-League managed to contain the threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Palpatine formed the Loyalist Committee, Senator Paddie was made a member of the ten-being group, helping to represent the interests of the Expansion Region."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
