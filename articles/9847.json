It was designed to be implanted into the user's head. It was surgically implanted near the user's larynx, with additional microsensors placed inside the mouth. The user subvocalized messages by subtly duplicating jaw, tongue, and vocal cord speech movements. This technique produces virtually no sound and minimal visible movement. Once the comlink translated these movements into electronic impulses, they turned into any standard comlink transmission by short-range transponders. These signals could be received by any comlink in three kilometers set to the right frequency. The basic At-cyb husher mike implant had externally visible transmitters and cost three thousand credits. For an extra two thousand, an upgraded mike with an encryption module could be placed entirely beneath the skin, making it only detectable with weapons and medical scanners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
