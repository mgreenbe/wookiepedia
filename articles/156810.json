Her escorts, flying N-1 starfighters, shot down the other mercenary starfighters at the site, allowing Amidala to escape. The mercenary leader appeared and shot down one of the pilots and damaged the starfighter of Rhys Dallows."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mercenary leader later appeared in his craft during the final battle of the Invasion of Naboo. He launched his craft's missiles and killed another Naboo pilot. The other members of Bravo Squadron engaged the mercenary. The leader launched missiles at Dallows. Dallows survived their explosions, but while the Vuutun Palaa's hangar bay shields were down when the Control Ship launched a C-9979 landing craft, the mercenary ducked into the port hangar. He was pursued inside by Dallows and they dueled inside the hangar. After their duel, the mercenary was forced to fall back deeper inside the Control Ship. Dallows continued his pursuit, and the mercenary flew through the power grid and into the innermost hangar. There, Dallows confronted him again. As they dueled, the mercenary complimented Dallows' skill, expressing regret about killing the talented Naboo pilot. Ultimately, Dallows proved to be the superior pilot, and the mercenary died when his craft exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mercenary leader's craft appears in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Starfighter.
