It consisted of power plates containing Defel micro-organisms that fed on ultraviolet radiation. The creatures absorbed heat sources and created electricity which was then stored in battery cells. In an environment with high levels of radiation, the HR-1200 could produce enough energy to power several small appliances such as datapads."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
