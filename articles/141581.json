The artifact was, with the accompanying ritual, capable of consuming all life on Yavin 4, and thus the Sith Emperor sought to use it as a failsafe in case his host body was slain. The mad Force-user Revan seized control of the artifact and tried to resurrect the Emperor in order to kill him, but the forces of the temporarily-allied Sith Empire and Galactic Republic stormed the temple and destroyed the artifact before the ritual was completed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
