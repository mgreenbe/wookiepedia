Circa 40 BBY, the Ithorian wielded a blue-bladed lightsaber, and was sent alongside Jedi Mace Windu, Luminara Unduli, and Maslo-Skaff to assist Eno Cordova and Cere Junda during a war on Ontotho. After helping Junda rescue Cordova from the contested temple, the Ithorian Jedi Master fell through the entrance's bridge into a chasm, as a result of a chain reaction instigated by the explosion of energy orbs. Cordova failed to rescue Odu, who fell to the depths of the unstable excavation site."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
