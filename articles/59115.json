In 20 BBY, Halsey used his lightsaber against the Sith warrior Savage Opress at Devaron, but the Zabrak Nightbrother grabbed his hand and squeezed it so hard causing Halsey to drop his blade, which fell to the ground. Even so, Halsey was proficient in hand-to-hand combat and was able to retain Opress for a moment, but that wasn't enough and the Jedi Master was killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
