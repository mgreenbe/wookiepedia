During the Outer Rim Sieges in the final year of the Clone Wars, the region was known as the Felucia theater to Republic forces, and was the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in the conflict as the Republic tried to overcome the Separatists' industrial base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the deactivation of the droid armies, the Clone Wars and the Outer Rim Sieges came to an end. The Foundry of the Confederacy, however, was the site of continued resistance by one of the last Separatist holdouts. The Sy Myrthian leader Toonbuck Toora managed to reactivate several droid armies, fleets and factory worlds in the region. The Sy Myrthian Insurrection was put down in several months of operations by the new Galactic Empire, culminating in Toora's death at the battle of Trasemene. The Foundry of the Confederacy thereafter ceased to exist."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable planets"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
