The elongated, rectangular hull was topped with the ship's command bridge, giving the pilot a commanding view through the segmented viewport. A deflector shield generator was situated below the bridge, and a forward ramp allowed access into the interior, as did a side ramp close to the aft manoeuvring fins. A rather grim painted mascot adorned the side of the forward hull, depicting a female Trandoshan standing betwixt the ship's name in aurebesh, with a battle-axe strapped to her back, a blaster in one hand and a Wookiee's severed head in the other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within, the vessel's lower decks were taken up by the engines, power core, and weapon systems. It was equipped with a quad laser cannon turret, an ion cannon, and a concussion missile launcher. The Hound's Tooth could reach speeds of up to 1,190 kph, and had a Class 1.5 hyperdrive. Bossk used his ordinary-looking freighter to store his huge collection of weapons, interrogation tools, and gruesome trophies from his years as a bounty hunter. He transformed the YV-666's cargo bays into high-security prisoner cells, and installed an advanced security system that ensured anyone attempting to break in would be blasted. One of the cargo holds, residing on the ship's upper level, was transformed into a launch bay for his personal Z-95-AF4 Headhunter, Nashtah Pup."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bossk used the Hound's Tooth as his personal starship, modifying the ordinary-looking vessel for his far-from-ordinary work as a bounty hunter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, members of Krayt's Claw, including Boba Fett, Dengar, C-21 Highsinger, Latts Razzi, and Asajj Ventress used Bossk's ship to travel to the planet Quarzite to accept a job."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Age of the Empire, Bossk flew the Hound's Tooth to the Outer Rim planet of Lothal to collect a bounty on the Dug criminal Gronson Takkaro.
