With three squadrons of X-wings versus one TIE, the odds seemed to be in the Rebel Alliance's favor. Drills now cancelled, the pilots of Blue Squadron took the lead and started their attack on the lonely ship, commencing the Battle of Vrogas Vas. Not realizing that it was Darth Vader in a TIE Advanced x1 with deflector shields and torpedoes, the entire squadron was destroyed without so much as a scratch to Vader's own ship. Shocked at the loss of Blue Squadron, Yellow Squadron decided to coordinate fire using torpedoes. All locked and fired, the torpedoes veered off course, then Vader destroyed Yellow Squadron. Luke Skywalker, who was flying as Red Five with the only remaining pilots of Red Squadron, sensed it was Vader. Not convinced another coordinated attack would work, flew his own X-wing into Vader's TIE and both crashed onto the planet below. Both pilots survived the crash and the battle continued on the planet below, with further losses to Gray Squadron, Amber Wing, and Cyan Squadron."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, Yellow Group participated in the Battle of Endor.
