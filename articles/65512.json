The vessels were a refinement of an old Geonosian masticator design and were employed to break down asteroids and smelt them into ore, which would then be pressed out by the masticators to form hull plates. In order to maximize the masticators' effectiveness, Lemelisk engineered the spheres so that they themselves could be easily dismantled and melted down for use in the station's construction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
