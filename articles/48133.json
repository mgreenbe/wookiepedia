Enraged by Chopper's antics, Ezra pursued Chopper through the Ghost. On the way, he encountered the Mandalorian weapons expert and part-time artist Sabine Wren's room to offer some \"inspiration\" for her artwork. Continuing his pursuit of Chopper, the two entered the Lasat warrior Garazeb Orrelios's bunk room. Before Ezra could leave, Chopper zapped Zeb with his electro-shock prod; sparking a fight between Ezra and Zeb. Chopper further aggravated the situation by sabotaging Zeb's bunk bed, which fell apart. Blaming the pranks on Ezra, Zeb pursued the boy through the Ghost. The pursuit ended up in the main cargo hold where the two rebels made a mess."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As punishment for creating the mess in the main cargo hold, the ship's captain Hera Syndulla punished them by sending them to buy a list of groceries. She also warned them not to return without at least one meiloorun fruit. While strolling through the streets of the Lothalian town of Kathol, Ezra encountered the farmer Morad Sumar, who ran a fruit stall and knew Ezra when he was younger. Morad gave Ezra a jogan fruit but was unable to sell him a meiloorun, since the plant species did not grow on Lothal. Shortly later, Morad was visited by the Imperial Supply Master Yogar Lyste, who tried to buy the Morad's family farm. However, Morad refused to sell his farm to the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Ezra joined up with Zeb, who had successfully obtained the list of groceries with the exception of the meiloorun fruit. Before giving up the search, they stumbled upon a crate of meilooruns. However, the Rodian trader Tsoklo had already sold them to the Empire and they were being loaded onto Imperial Troop Transports. Against Zeb's objections, Ezra attempted to steal a crate of meilooruns and attempted to use the Force to levitate them. However, Ezra was quickly spotted by Lyste and his stormtroopers. In the ensuing scuffle, Zeb hurled several crates at his Imperial pursuers. While climbing over a wall, the two rebels were separated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zeb eventually found himself trapped between two stormtroopers and Baron Valen Rudor's TIE starfighter. Following a struggle, Zeb managed to jump into Rudor's TIE fighter and hijack the craft; throwing Rudor out. After taking out some stormtroopers, Zeb flew the hijacked TIE fighter through the town. Meanwhile, Ezra was evading his Imperial pursuers by leaping across several buildings. He managed to catch up with Zeb's TIE fighter. Zeb agreed to take Ezra aboard after the youth said that they were both even. While fighting for control of the TIE fighter, Ezra accidentally fired on Tskolo's stall. Using his Force senses, Ezra also managed to avoid flying into a nearby hill by telling Zeb to make a sharp ascent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Kanan was playing a game of dejarik with Chopper, he and Hera received a call from Ezra and Zeb. After learning of their predicament, he ordered them to destroy the TIE fighter. Meanwhile, Supply Master Lyste seized Morad's farm and forcibly evicted him, his wife Marida Sumar, and their Aqualish helper. After razing the farm, they departed in three Imperial Troop Transports. While making their way back to the Ghost, Ezra and Zeb spotted smoke rising from the ruined Sumar farm. At Ezra's request, Zeb agreed to fly ahead to look for the Imperials and their captives. They soon catch up with the Imperial transports."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When contacted by Supply Master Lyste, Zeb pretends to be \"Commander Meiloorun\" but his bravado did not fool Lyste for long, who then ordered his transport's gun turret to shoot down the stolen TIE fighter. Meanwhile, Ezra landed on the middle transport and used the Force to free Morad, Marida, and their Aqualish porter. The farmers escaped by jumping into the surrounding grasslands. Using his Force-enhanced agility and energy slingshot, Ezra fought off several stormtroopers while Zeb strafes the Imperial transports. At the height of the fighting, Ezra shoves a wrench into the main gun turret, causing it to implode. After stealing a crate of meiloorun fruits, Ezra escaped with Zeb aboard their stolen TIE fighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After \"disposing\" of the TIE fighter, Zeb and Ezra returned to the Ghost with their goods and the crate of meilooruns. As a result of their recent adventure, the two rebels have established a better rapport with each other. Kanan and Hera were both pleased with Zeb and Ezra's work. Later, Sabine showed Zeb and Ezra a graffiti painting of them being tripped over by Chopper.
