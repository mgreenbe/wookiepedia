He and Tray opposed Grath, because of his ways of leading the youth gang. Actually, Flip wanted to keep the attention of his leader, in order to make Grath rely on his methods and way of acting. He blew up a public transport during rush hour, but this divided the Freelies. Then, feeling frustrated and guilty, he would cause one last explosion. It would pull down an empty building, and he would be inside. However, the building filled up because of an emergency meeting and the explosion caused many casualties. Tray and Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi tried to rescue him, but it was too late."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
