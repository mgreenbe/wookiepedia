Monchan made a living designing HoloNet interfaces, helping his firm, Monchantics, to earn him millions of credits. At some point, Monchan accompanied the luxury liner Salin Mariner on a cruise from Botajef to Lianna, and on one occasion during the voyage, he dined in the company of the Bivall real estate mangnate Usk Haffa, the Gotal liquor distributor Dix Tarfait, the Wroonians Fume and Pelf Pachoola, and the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka. The following day, Ohnaka arranged for the vessel to be struck by an explosion, in an effort by him to convince several of the passengers to follow him into an escape pod, so that he could kidnap them. However, Monchan refused to board the pod and claimed that he believed that it was safer to remain aboard the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
