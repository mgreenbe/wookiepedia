After the Battle of Yavin, Doowan was at a droid-fighting den on Anthan Prime. He was then involved in a skirmish between the Empire and a group of spectators at the fighting den. During the fight, he was tracked and taken in for questioning by Darth Vader and Inspector Thanoth about the location of arms dealer known as the Dragon. After some forceful negotiations, Doowan gave the two men the location of the Dragon before being taken before Morit and Aiolin Astarte to be used in their investigation into arms dealing. He was then promptly killed by Morit, who said it was a show of force for the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
