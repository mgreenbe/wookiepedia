Gentle and non-threatening, shaaks were slow movers. They had four legs, brown leathery skin, and their bodies were plump with blubber. Shaaks were unable to swim, due to their size, and so avoided the swamps of Naboo. If infected with the waterborne Blue Shadow Virus, shaaks would die instantly, while members of most other species had 48 hours to live before the virus became fatal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gungans farmed shaaks for their meat and hide.
