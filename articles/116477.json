Robonino fled to Rodia and made use of an abandoned Rodian base in the remote swamplands to disguise his underwater hideout. He had an elaborate defensive system in place to cover both attack by land and under water. Beneath the swampy surface he installed motion sensor-triggered blaster cannons and on the ground he reprogrammed B1-Series battle droids to explode when intruders were detected."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the behest of Senator Onaconda Farr, Jedi Master Kit Fisto led a team of clone SCUBA troopers to investigate reports of suspected Separatist activity near the abandoned base. When Robonino's defenses were activated, Robonino attempted to escape amidst the commotion. Fisto caught sight of him and was met with blaster fire and several thermal detonators thrown at him. Fisto used the Force to redirect the detonators into the hideout, destroying it in the ensuing explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
