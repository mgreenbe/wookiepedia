When the Pirates of Iridium began to plague the Atrivis sector, the Jedi High Council called upon Idan to assist in a diplomatic mission to negotiate with the pirates. Idan joined Master Kit Fisto aboard the Monitor III, but they were attacked by the pirates using a power gem near the planet of Vuchelle. Piloting a Delta-7 interceptor against the pirates, Idan contacted them, attempting to end the battle before the pirates escalated the assault. While the Jedi were successful in defeating the pirates, tragedy struck Aargau in Idan's absence. On Aargau, Senator Aks Moe of Malastare died in a fiery explosion that engulfed his transport. Deemed an assassination by Representative Ainlee Teem, the Gran blamed Idan for not being onworld at the time to prevent Moe's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
