The satellite, one of the original beacons, was placed on the Perlemian Trade Route. Sculpted on the beacon were the faces of a Columi, cacodemon, and a molator from Alderaan. It was destroyed, however, during the Second Alsakan Conflict. In 10,000 BBY, Vicendi included the beacon in his work Arturum Galactinum as one of the Twenty Wonders of the Galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
