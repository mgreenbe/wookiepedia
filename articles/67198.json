Imperial forces, led by Major Stafuv Rahz invaded the long secluded planet and attacked the local Shimholt. During the battle, Suprema Ampotem Za was captured by the Empire and taken off world. Although he was able to escape shortly afterward and return to his world, he was shunned for breaking their millennia long tradition of isolation. For allowing himself to be taken off the planet, Za was exiled from Kar'a'katok."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
