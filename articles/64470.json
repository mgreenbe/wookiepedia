Their bodies were humanoid with musculature similar to other such species. They stood about two meters tall, and each of their hands had five digits, while each foot came to a single, sharp point. Their eyes were black with white centers, and their noses were pointed and hooked. Each Ice Demon had a large mouth filled with sharp, icicle-like teeth, more on the bottom than on the top, and a white tongue. Their heads were crowned by two curved horns that pointed upward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their ice-like traits set them apart from other humanoids. Ice Demons were white and icy, glistening blue in certain lighting conditions. The effect was so pronounced that icicles seemed to grow from their bodies.

That brought him into contact with Logray, the Ewok shaman of Bright Tree Village. The two fought a magical duel, during which Logray banished the Ice Demon to imprisonment within Endor's Ice Mountain. Stagorr never gave up hope of leaving his prison, and he continued to spy on his old rival via a magical ice mirror. When he saw the young Ewok Wicket W. Warrick take Logray's staff, Stagorr seized the moment to bring the Ewok to him via a wind tunnel spell, hoping to lure Logray back to Ice Mountain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ice Demon could not touch Logray's staff, the instrument that had banished him, so he put a hex on Warrick that forced the Ewok to obey his commands. As expected, Logray appeared at Ice Mountain to rescue his younger tribemate. Stagorr cloistered himself in his lair and sent his proxy, Warrick, to duel his old enemy. Nevertheless, Logray managed to counter Stagorr's every spell. Frustrated, the sorcerer finally showed himself, threatening to kill Warrick if Logray did not relinquish the staff. Logray did so. The Ice Demon scoffed as Warrick attacked with a simple, fire-based magic trick, but the fire melted some of the Ice Mountain interior and caused liquid water to fall on Stagorr's body. As it refroze, he lost the ability to move."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stagorr the Ice Demon appears in Ewoks 6, an issue of the Marvel Ewoks comic book written by David Manak and illustrated by Warren Kremer.
