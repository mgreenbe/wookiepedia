In that year, the Daragon siblings were forced by their difficult financial situation to try to discover new hyperspace routes that would be useful for transportation out of the Koros system. To that end, the siblings executed a blind hyperspatial jump from Koros Major in their starship, the Starbreaker 12\u2014a jump that led them to the direct vicinity of the Starswarm Cluster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Believing that they had found a shortcut and that the Hyperspace Navigator's Guild would reward them substantially for safe navigation of the star cluster, the young explorers attempted to pass through the densely-packed stars. However, the intense radiation of the stars at the core of the cluster proved to be too much for the starship's systems. With notable effort, the duo managed to exit the Starswarm Cluster with their ship intact, but the Starbreaker 12 had suffered critical damage, and therefore, with the realization that no one would pay them for the new shortcut weighing heavily on them, the Daragon siblings had to return to Koros Major for urgent repairs, using a previously discovered and much longer route. Back on the planet, Gav told his Hutt repairman Aarrba that the stars of the cluster were too dense to safely navigate through."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first in-universe appearance of the Starswarm Cluster was in the first issue of The Golden Age of the Sith story arc of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi series of comic books.
