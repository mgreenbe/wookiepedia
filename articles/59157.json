It was stationed at Quesna Base for guard duty when Ace Azzameen, along with Dunari, came to rescue his brother Emon, who was imprisoned there at the time. They delivered a container of tibanna, which had been booby trapped, and it provided cover for Dunari as he boarded the station and rescued Emon.
