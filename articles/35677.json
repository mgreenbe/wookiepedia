Together with an Ithorian scientist, they found the Korendums. Thorn was the only one to understand the potential of those antique crystals, and fell to the dark side. He murdered his master before taking the Korendums with Yele and Suunfuus and used his new powers to convince the artificial intelligence of the Gorgorror to let them flee. Not long after their escape, Thorn tried to steal the crystals from his companions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In reaction, Yele brutally broke up with him, and the three went their separate ways. While Thorn joined the Empire as a Dark Jedi and soon became \"Lord Thorn,\" Yele went to Taypho and Suunfuus to Oriadann, taking their respective crystals far from him. However, the fallen Jedi never abandoned the hope of using the power of the Korendums for himself. He undertook the installation of a superlaser similar to that of the first Death Star on his own Super Star Destroyer, augmented by the overwhelming power of the reunited crystals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, Thorn located Yele through his spies.

He then led a terrestrial assault on the planet and besieged the massive fortress that served as a capital and as the only city of the planet. In the final battle of his campaign, Thorn led stormtroopers and Imperial Royal Guards through the defense and reached the central forge were the Korendum were kept."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, his plans were thwarted by the same group of Rebel agents he used to locate Yele and Suunfuus, and he wasn't able to use the crystals for his superweapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was an ambitious, rogue Jedi who let himself be corrupted by the dark side, attracted by the potential of the Korendums, crystals with great energy potential.
