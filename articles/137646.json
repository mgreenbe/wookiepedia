During the Clone Wars, these mines were deployed aboard a Separatist flagship captained by the tactical droid Aut-O, and were used to protect a vault which contained an encryption module. Circa 20\u201319 BBY, the swarm mines protecting the vault were neutralized by the astromech droid QT-KT with a magna-coil which placed the mines safely into the astromech's dome. QT-KT, working alongside the Republic Military squad D-Squad, headed by Colonel Meebur Gascon, retrieved the encryption module and later expelled the swarm mines from her dome to destroy a group of Separatist battle droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Swarm mines first appeared in \"Secret Weapons,\" the tenth episode of the fifth season of the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, which first aired on December 1, 2012."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
