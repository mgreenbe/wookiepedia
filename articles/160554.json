They were found to be relatives of the Womp rats of Tatooine. The Veshet had a keen sense of smell making them excellent trackers that would hunt prey across long distances. Another interesting fact was that they could easily be trained to attack on command or to do so on smelling a certain scent on their target. This made them popular assassination tools during the days of the Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
