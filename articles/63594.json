It increased their strength, dexterity, speed, and provided optimal protection. Tiny microrepulsors in the armor made it lighter and more maneuverable. It was equipped with a droid translator unit, a datapad, two wrist-mounted blasters, and an E-Web heavy repeating blaster mounted on the shoulder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
