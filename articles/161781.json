The armor was made from the living shell of the Vonduun crab."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Technical details"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vonduun crab's spear-like legs were extremely sharp, and could be used as weapons. One set, called \"grip legs\", would sometimes grab the corner of the wearer's mouth, giving them an evil, skull-like smile. Vonduun crab armor had crystalline properties, and was resistant to blasters, slugthrowers, and even lightsabers. Certain varieties were known to augment the wearers' strength, as was the case with the elderly former Warmaster Czulkang Lah and his aged vonduun crab armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Color could vary from armor to armor, black being the most common, but cerulean and red being also witnessed several times."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Advantages"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vonduun crab armor was extremely durable, as it could easily stop blaster hits, slugthrowers, and even lightsaber strikes. It was not that heavy, so most warriors could move quickly if needed. The spikes on the armor were also capable of being used as weapons of last resort, if they were used properly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Weaknesses"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The armor was not powerful enough to withstand starfighter fire, nor could it withstand the strength of Mandalorian crushgaunts, which would crack and break the armor with the continuous application of pressure. The creature's gills were found in the armpit of the armored suit, thus leaving a weak point. In some cases, the wearer's face was not covered by the armor. As the armor was a living creature, it was subject to a living creature's problems and was found to be dangerously allergic to the Bafforr tree pollen, discovered during the Battle of Garqi. The armor could also be destroyed by Force lightning."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Non-Yuuzhan Vong could wear the armor, though capturing it alive was rare, as subduing or killing the armor's wearer typically required first wounding or killing the armor itself. During the Battle of Borleias, Danni Quee and Wraith Squadron members Baljos Arnjak and Bhindi Drayson wore captured, living vonduun crab armor. Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade Skywalker, and other members of the group wore inanimate synthetic vonduun crab armor composed of plasteel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Modified versions of this armor were in use by the New Jedi Order by the time of 40 ABY in dueling practice, as it could deflect lightsaber hits.

During one such exercise, Luke Skywalker ordered Ben to remove the armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Krayt, Dark Lord of the One Sith, wore Vonduun crab armor after escaping Vergere in the Unknown Regions.
