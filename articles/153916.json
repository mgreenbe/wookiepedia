The cruiser was equipped with four large sublight engines and a smaller engine unit in the center. Its hull was characterized by two blunt wings on its port and starboard sides, and had its bridge situated in one of two towers on its dorsal surface. Additionally, it could be optionally outfitted with a longer tower on its ventral side at midship. Characteristically, of other Mon Calamari vessels, the cruiser's hull was bulbous and had differing modules that lined the surface of the ship. The cruiser also had a deflector shield generator, escape pods, and had at least two hangar bays that held starfighter squadrons."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Shu-Torun systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Similarly to the rest of the other types of Mon Calamari cruisers at Mako-Ta Space Docks, many of the cruiser's crucial systems were Shu-Torun systems, that were refitted into the cruisers for several months, including its hyperdrive and communications systems. The Shu-Torun blockers circumvented the hardware of all the cruisers and allowed for sabotage, although it was possible that some bypasses could be operational."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Additionally, like the other ships, the hangar doors could be sealed shut by Shu-Torun blockers, which stopped direct rebel control of the doors. Despite the Shu-Torun sabotage, the cruisers remained able to broadcast rebel signals and the fail-safes were operational. As such, the proximity sensors were able to detect when a rebel transponder was flown nearby, allowing the hangar doors to open as a response. The Shu-Torun systems contained an override code which could reboot the systems within the refitted Mon Calamari cruisers.

Months later, at least eight of these Mon Calamari cruisers were at the Rebel Alliance Mako-Ta Space Docks, where they and many other Mon Calamari starships had been refitted with Shu-Torun systems and had integrated with the Alliance Fleet.

At the celebration for the launch of the Alliance Fleet, several of the cruisers were docked at the Mako-Ta Space Docks, with others flying in the vicinity of the station. When General Jan Dodonna, commander of Sector Command, was ready, Princess Organa asked several battle groups of the Alliance Fleet to call in when ready. Commander Lajaie from Beta Group acknowledged from the bridge of his cruiser, while General Syndulla acknowledged from the bridge of her respective cruiser.

Afterwards, The Imperial fleet attacked various Mon Calamari vessels, and one cruiser of the class was near another model of Mon Calamari ship. By the time the Millennium Falcon arrived at Mako-Ta, Commander Lajaie's cruiser was then attacked by the Executor as the rebels attempted to break through the system failure.
