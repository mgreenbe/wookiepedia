In 5000 BBY, Gorrm launched a drone ship, the Zeta Five, to deliver much-needed supplies and provisions to a mining colony on Goluud Minor, in the Goluud system. The route to be taken was called the Goluud Corridor, and Gorrm, who was responsible for locking in the coordinates and preparing the ship for launch, raised concerns that the Goluud Corridor passed perilously close to the system's red supergiant star, Primus Goluud. Kahorr was quick to dismiss these concerns, trusting fully in the Navigators' Guild safety standards. However, after the ship was launched, Gorrm's fears were confirmed. By the time the Zeta Five reached the Goluud system, stellar activity in Primus Goluud had entered into a violent phase, and a massive solar flare obliterated the ship and its cargo. An enraged Kahorr had Gorrm hire assassins and send them after the two navigators who had plotted the route, Gav and Jori Daragon. The two were rescued by a pair of Jedi Knights, Odan-Urr and Memit Nadill, and the Daragons were subsequently able to escape the Koros system in their ship, the Starbreaker 12."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jori Daragon later returned, alone, in the Starbreaker 12, claiming that after their escape, she and her brother had happened upon the Sith Empire, which had been isolated from the galaxy since the Hundred-Year Darkness two-thousand years before. Daragon said that the Sith were preparing to attack the Galactic Republic and demanded a meeting with the leader of the unified Koros system, Teta, to alert her of the threat. However, her pleas fell on deaf ears, and she was arrested for numerous charges related to her escape. Gorrm and Kahorr arrived amongst the crowds surrounding the Starbreaker 12, and Kahorr told the police that were present that the Starbreaker 12 was legally his, as a payment for the destruction of Zeta Five. Kahorr had Gorrm gave the police the pertinent documents, which proved that by a Merchants' Guild decision, the Starbreaker 12 had indeed been granted to Kahorr. Kahorr and Gorrm decided to take the ship on a joyride to test its controls, but they were suddenly set upon by a Sith battle fleet; the Sith had followed the Starbreaker 12 back to the Republic.
