Bane needed a bargaining chip, so he and his crew of bounty hunters invaded the Senate Building, first killing the Senate Commandos outside. They then entered the building and proceeded to blast their way into a control room where they shot and killed everyone currently inside, including a Senate Commmado, a blue Senate protocol droid, a Senate astromech, a LEP servant droid, and a WED-15 Treadwell droid. They then took some senators hostage. Anakin Skywalker was seen by the sentinel droid, but since Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala had his lightsaber, he was forced to fight the droid with other means, such as tossing it with the Force and attacking it with whatever he could find. He smashed the droid's head off and left its mangled body on the floor, where it was found by Shahan Alama. Noticing the lack of lightsaber cuts, Alama went to tell Bane that the Jedi was unarmed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
