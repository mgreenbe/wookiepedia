Along the way, the group encountered waves of STAPs, Ground Armored Tanks, and Spider walkers before one of the transports succumbed to artillery fire from a distance, forcing them to stop momentarily."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Skywalker eliminated the Heavy Artillery Guns firing on their position with his AT-XT, the group resumed along the path, encountering additional droid craft. After eliminating a pair of laser turrets guarding the perimeter of the complex, as well as AATs approaching from the sides, the remaining transports successfully ferried the engineers, therefore breaching the wall and allowing Skywalker passage. Because of Bravo 3's efforts, Skywalker was successful in lowering the shield, completing the first phase of the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
