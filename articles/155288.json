She was a female with blue skin. She was present for an attack on the palace that formerly belonged to Jabba the Hutt which was currently under the ownership of her master, Bib Fortuna. After witnessing the assassin Fennec Shand shoot down numerous denizens and guards of the palace, she attempted to free herself by tugging on her chain which connected her to her master's dais. Shand then shot her chain with her blaster rifle and after being prompted by her, the unchained slave ran away to freedom. Shortly after, Fortuna was killed by Shand's ally, Boba Fett, who assumed Fortuna's throne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twi'lek slave appeared in \"Chapter 16: The Rescue\" of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Peyton Reed and released on December 18, 2020."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
