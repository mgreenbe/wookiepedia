He took over from the former owner when his predecessor fled the Demophon system's imminent supernova. Lucern preyed on panicking citizens who gambled in the hopes of winning enough credits to flee the planet. Lucern had some connections with the G'uotr Network, but at heart he was a loner. His connections were just enough to guarantee him passage with the Network off Demophon before the supernova. In return, he skimmed a portion of his profits for the Network, and allowed them to use Marqo's as a meeting place for their agents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
