Later, a venrap slithered aboard a Consular-class cruiser on Nallastia and, upon liftoff from the Skull Queen's fortress, attacked its captain and two co-pilots. The pilots were rendered unconscious, but unharmed, before Jedi Master Mace Windu and the Skull Queen, Quenelle, were able to disarm and kill the vicious creature. The Skull Queen dealt the snake the killing blow with her vibroblade, striking it between the eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
