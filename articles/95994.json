The weapon was fired using a trigger, and the amount of pain it caused could be changed using a dial on the device's side. On the planet Sevarcos, Zygerrian slavers used needlers to control and punish the slaves working in the planet's spice mines. During the Battle of Sevarcos, in which the New Republic attacked the Imperial-aligned mines on the planet, one slaver used a needler on the rebelling Wookiee slave Greybok, intending to kill him. The Wookiee was saved from death when his fellow slave Hatchet killed the slaver with a rock, freeing Greybok from the needlers effects."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Needlers first appeared in \"Death by Triflexia\", an Star Wars Legends adventure for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game written by Peter M.
