Heljus used the Force to cause an avalanche, allowing Elsor to escape and return to the base to heal; Master Heljus did not return however. Disoriented form the avalanche and with all communications blocked by the White Maw pirates, Elsor turned to the aid of a Republic hero passing through the area to disable the jammers. Master Heljus's transmission came through and she revealed that the cause of the dark attack was the Beast-Lord named Brutann from Onderon. The hero was able to stop Brutann and while Heljus was dead, Elsor assured the Jedi of his appreciation and that he would return to Tython when his wounds healed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
