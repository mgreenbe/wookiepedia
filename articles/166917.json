By Lothal Year 3272, he was reasonably elderly and eked out a living selling day-old jogan fruits in Lothal's Capital City. He occasionally interacted with the local street urchin Ezra Bridger, who sometimes stole from him, and on one occasion Yoffar falsely accused the boy of having taken a jogan when in fact he had not. While peddling his goods, Yoffar was approached by Imperial Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko and Taskmaster Myles Grint, who asked to see his identification and questioned him over the fact that his commerce had not been registered with the Empire. The check was in fact part of a planned demonstration of the Empire's ability to respond swiftly to problems, and when Yoffar criticized the Empire the pair prepared to arrest him for treason, quickly summoning a pair of stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Imperials could remove Yoffar however, they were distracted by an emergency call from their comlinks summoning them to the main square, which caused them to abandon the street merchant. The Gotal noticed Bridger issuing the emergency Imperial broadcast on a communicator he had taken from Aresko, and thanked him for saving him from arrest. He offered the boy a jogan, which Bridger accepted before grabbing a few more fruits and moving on."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoffar had white fur, gray skin, and orange eyes. He was perpetually grumpy, and commonly confused Ezra Bridger with other street orphans, which caused the boy to dislike him. When approached by Aresko and Grint, Yoffar was at first defiant, but soon became terrified when stormtroopers arrived to arrest him. He was thankful to Bridger for saving him, but still complained when the urchin took more fruit than he was offered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoffar was created for the 2014 Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion television movie, which acted as the premiere for the Star Wars Rebels television series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
