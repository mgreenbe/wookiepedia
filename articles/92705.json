A large core of blue giants and brown dwarfs produced high levels of radiation in the nebula. The radiation made Monsua almost unnavigable and impossible to scan, making it home to heavy pirate activity in the decade preceding the Clone Wars. Even during the early years of the New Republic, Monsua remained uncharted and its stars unnamed beyond the alphanumeric codes assigned millennia earlier by the Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
