She got injured in the process and was immediately taken to Talon Karrde's medical facility. As she healed, Mara Jade told Karrde about how resourceful the Togorian was and Karrde agreed to give her a position in the smuggling operation. H'sishi proved to be a loyal bodyguard and a valuable crewmember of the Wild Karrde, such as when she scared some of Rei'Kas's pirates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
