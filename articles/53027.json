Charismatic and independent, he strongly opposed the power being gradually built by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and invoked an ancient Corellian proviso in order to keep his homeworld out of the Clone Wars. When Palpatine reorganized the Republic into a Galactic Empire and declared himself Emperor in 19 BBY, Bel Iblis served in the Imperial Senate, but continued to publicly speak out against the man in spite of strains that it placed on his marriage with a pro-Imperial wife. When agents of the Empire murdered his wife and children, the Senator went into hiding and founded a militaristic resistance movement with which to fight the Imperial war machine. Although Bel Iblis was a skilled military leader, he saw the need to merge his rebellion with other resistance movements, and, after being rescued from the clutches of a bounty hunter by Galen Marek, invited the Alderaanian and Chandrilan Senators Bail Organa and Mon Mothma to Corellia, at a meeting where a Rebel Alliance was formally declared. The meeting was interrupted, by the Emperor's apprentice Darth Vader, whom Marek had secretly been working for. The rebel leaders were taken to the Empire's superweapon, the Death Star, but were freed by Marek in an act of rebellion against his master, and began operating the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Organa was killed in 0 BBY, tensions that had been escalating between Bel Iblis and Mothma came to a climax, and the Corellian left the Rebellion, forming his own private war against the Empire. Remaining mobile, the movement performed hit-and-run tactics against the Empire for years, and was eventually strengthened by six Dreadnaughts from the fabled Katana fleet. When the Empire was overthrown and the Rebellion became a New Republic, Bel Iblis remained in hiding, expecting a power-hungry Mothma to declare herself Empress. On assignment for the New Republic, Han Solo and Lando Calrissian discovered his base in 9 ABY, and convinced him to aid their government in its conflict with the resurgent Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn. Bel Iblis joined the New Republic's military as a General and proved vital in several battles; he made amends with Mothma, swallowing his trademark pride and becoming a permanent fixture in New Republic High Command, leading a retreat from Coruscant and doing battle with forces of a reborn Palpatine and later Admiral Daala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Caamas Document Crisis erupted in 19 ABY, Bel Iblis was in command of a small fleet and the elite starfighter unit Rogue Squadron, and used his forces to mediate growing conflicts between feuding New Republic member states. When he was too late to stop a Leresai fleet from destroying a Bothan space station, he grew furious, and was reassigned to the important task of obtaining a complete copy of the Caamas Document from an Imperial Ubiqtorate base at Yaga Minor. Securing the services of the smuggler Booster Terrik and his Star Destroyer, the Errant Venture, he attacked the base, but his forces were caught in tractor beams and trapped by Imperial reinforcements. They were saved, however, and the crisis averted, when information quickly arrived revealing two of the Imperial leaders to be frauds, concurrently with a copy of the Caamas Document being discovered on Nirauan. The galaxy was finally at peace, and Bel Iblis retired, only to return to the military when an extragalactic race of religious zealots known as the Yuuzhan Vong began conquering the galaxy. Bel Iblis played pivotal roles in key victories at Ebaq 9, Duro, Bilbringi, and Coruscant, and the invaders were eventually defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Senator"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The male Human Garm Bel Iblis was born on the planet Corellia during the waning days of the Galactic Republic. He was extremely patriotic, toward both Corellia and the Republic, and was said to embody the Corellian spirit of independence. Bel Iblis served in the military for a time, learning how to operate blasters and rudimentary weaponry. In 35 BBY, he was elected as Corellia's representative in the Galactic Senate, proving to be a popular and charismatic leader and making many allies in the Senate. Among them was Fang Zar, the Senator of Sern sector, who was a close friend to Bel Iblis and shared his views on a great many things. As a young and idealistic Senator, Bel Iblis was determined to preserve freedom throughout the galaxy. He married a woman named Arrianya, who bore two of his children. His Senatorial aide was Sena Leikvold Midanyl, whom Bel Iblis was very close to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bel Iblis was one of few voices to speak out against Palpatine, a charismatic Senator from Naboo who ultimately became Supreme Chancellor of the Republic in 32 BBY. When the threat of Count Dooku's secessionist Confederacy of Independent Systems caused Palpatine to enact the Emergency Powers Act in 24 BBY, eliminating Chancellor term times, Bel Iblis began to grow more concerned with the Chancellor. He saw the Naboo man as a force of destruction, and suspected that Palpatine would not relinquish his power unless it was wrestled from him. Bel Iblis raised his concerns with many of his peers in the Senate, and was initially successful until Palpatine bit back, doing his part to discredit Bel Iblis and lose him influence in the Senate. Two years after Palpatine had been granted Emergency Powers, many systems were seceding to the Confederacy, and the Supreme Chancellor scheduled a vote on the greatly debated Military Creation Act for two months' time. The Act would allow the formation of an Army of the Republic\u2014something which had not existed in nearly a thousand years\u2014to be used against the Confederacy should a war break out. Bel Iblis was a strong opponent of the Act; while many of his fellow Senators, such as Tendau Bendon, opposed based on purely ideological grounds, Bel Iblis was also more pragmatic about the situation. He asked HoloNet News reporters how exactly such a military would be funded, and stated that he would not allow the Corellian taxpayer to fund both the Republic army and the Corellian Security Force. Bel Iblis continued to be an outspoken critic of the impending vote for weeks in the Senate, as was the entirety of Corellia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Military Creation Act vote, Bel Iblis arranged private talks with Corellia's Diktat, Shyla Merricope, to discuss the vote and Corellia's role in the future of the Republic. Ultimately, they decided to enact a little-known proviso called Contemplanys Hermi, which translated into Basic as \"meditative solitude.\" The proviso allowed Corellia and its constituencies to unilaterally withdraw from all Senate activities for as long as they wished, and had not been used in over 450 years. Bel Iblis announced his and Merricope's decision in a meeting of the Senate, to the uproar of most of his fellow Senators. He was ushered out of the Grand Convocation Chamber by CorSec personnel amid cries of secession and disloyalty, and he refused to answer any questions posed by the media. He informed HoloNet News that Corellia was not seceding, but that it could not be part of a something which Bel Iblis and Merricope felt threatened the planet's independence. Bel Iblis returned to Corellia, but was criticized by many back on Coruscant, including Palpatine and Senator Orn Free Taa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corellia's actions sparked Palpatine to make a public address to Dooku, hoping to negotiate their differences peacefully, but Dooku spurned the offer. Ultimately, the Military Creation Act was passed, and a Grand Army of the Republic, consisting of clone troopers, was created after the Clone Wars began. Bel Iblis hoped to maintain Corellia's neutrality for the duration of the conflict but, just seven days after the Battle of Geonosis, Republic-allied Jedi clashed with Separatist forces on his homeworld. While Bel Iblis remained opposed to the war, the GAR, and Palpatine on the Senate floor, he did help the Republic during the conflict. He organized his own, personal militia, consisting of members of CorSec, and assembled a large fleet of Corellian cruisers. Bel Iblis helped repel Separatist advances on the Mid Rim throughout the war; he and his fleet often arrived in the nick of time to rescue outnumbered Jedi forces, or provided cover for Republic commandos on ground missions. Bel Iblis became a skilled military tactician during the war, although he received no decorations or official recognition for his aid. Later in the war, full-scale conflict came perilously close to the Corellian system's borders, with neighboring Duro falling to the CIS in 20 BBY. Bel Iblis was strongly criticized for not lending the support of Corellia's fleet during the Battle of Duro, though Corellia was not without its vocal allies, such as Fang Zar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although he was not attending regular sessions of the Senate during the war, Bel Iblis often met with other Senators, including Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and Fang Zar, who shared his views on Palpatine. Together, they began laying the groundwork for a political alliance publicly opposed to Palpatine's rule. In 19 BBY, with the threat of the Separatists almost vanquished, a group of Senators, titling themselves the Delegation of 2000, signed a petition asking Palpatine to step down; they also had serious qualms about Palpatine's new moffs, a type of regional governor which made the role of Senator almost obsolete. Bel Iblis was among those who signed the petition, though he was not in attendance when they presented it to Palpatine. However, Fang Zar was there to represent Bel Iblis' interests. Palpatine reacted angrily to the petition, calling those who had signed it traitors, though, ultimately, it did not matter: a short time later, he abolished the Republic and created the first Galactic Empire, with himself as Emperor, and began a great purge of the Jedi Order. Palpatine claimed that the Jedi had betrayed the Republic, though Bel Iblis refused to believe that it was the truth. The Senate was not dissolved, though it was in essence powerless; also, Corellia's \"meditative solitude\" was ended and Bel Iblis was once more compelled to attend Senate meetings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some months after the Declaration of a New Order, Palpatine summoned a group of Senators including Bel Iblis to his chambers to discuss with them the role of the Senate in his Empire. He told them that the Senate would continue to operate for the foreseeable future, but that his say was final: the Senators were simply his advisors. During the meeting, Mon Mothma and Bel Iblis squirmed in their seats, and did not hide their anger and dismay at the turn of events. Days later, Bel Iblis' friend Fang Zar was executed by the Empire. Palpatine's actions also strained Bel Iblis' personal life, as his wife was a firm supporter of the Empire and its modus operandi. Their marriage went downhill, and their children were often witness to heated arguments between the two. Despite this, Bel Iblis still greatly loved Arrianya and planned for the two of them to go on a second honeymoon in an effort to rekindle their marriage."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "On the run"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bel Iblis continued to serve as an Imperial Senator for many years, retaining his popularity on Corellia. In his capacity as Senator, he opposed many of Palpatine's new policies, fighting against the creation of the Imperial war machine, the subjugation of entire worlds and their populations, and the Imperialization of major galactic corporations, ultimately all in vain. Unable to contain his anger with the new, Imperial regime, Bel Iblis surreptitiously spoke out against Palpatine in his speeches, often evoking the names of the most vaunted of the ancient Jedi, to Palpatine's fury. Bel Iblis often visited schools on his homeworld; during one occasion shortly after the formation of the Empire, an eleven-year-old boy named Han Solo asked a number of probing questions of Bel Iblis, about the Empire's treatment of non-Humans and about corruption in the Senate. Caught off guard, Bel Iblis later asked the boy his name, and made an effort to monitor his progress as he matured. Bel Iblis, Organa, and Mon Mothma continued to meet in secret at Organa's Cantham House residence on Coruscant; eventually, they decided that legitimately opposing Palpatine would never succeed, and began to discuss rebellion. Mothma was far more outspoken in her criticism of Palpatine\u2014before long she was accused of treason, and had to flee Coruscant and go into hiding, though she continued to visit resistance movements on many worlds, spreading sedition. Bel Iblis was next on Palpatine's list."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Senator prepared a speech for an event at the Treitamma Political Center on the planet Anchoron, in which he would denounce the Empire and reveal Palpatine's dark motives. Bel Iblis was extremely nervous about the speech, as his pro-Imperial wife would be present. Just before he was scheduled to address the congregation, he received a message in his office from \"Aach,\" the alias of Alderaanian Senator Bail Organa's prime messenger and agent. The message told Bel Iblis to meet with Aach at the building's northeast exit immediately; worried, Bel Iblis complied and rendezvoused with Aach, who relayed a message from Organa: he had discovered information pertaining to the location of a top-secret Imperial project overseen by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, and needed Bel Iblis to send his most trusted aide to collect a datacard on the planet Darkknell. A courier would be at the Continuum Void tapcafe on Darkknell with the datadisk, and was demanding payment for the disk. Aach told Bel Iblis to give him whatever he demanded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their meeting was interrupted by a large explosion in the Treitamma Political Center, as agents of the Empire had planted explosives in Bel Iblis' office, intending to kill him. Aach wrestled Bel Iblis to the ground in order to avoid the blast, and the Corellian Senator was distraught at the loss of his wife and children. Aach eventually calmed him down and persuaded him to follow him to his ship, telling Bel Iblis that nothing could be done for Arrianya and the children. Aach gave Bel Iblis permission to use the Alderaanian's ship to flee, as he intended to stay on Anchoron to investigate the bombing.

The datadisk had been stolen earlier that day, lifted from the courier's pocket by a female thief, and the courier fled Darkknell soon after meeting with Bel Iblis. The Corellian Senator would not give up, and decided to pay a visit to Seb Arkos, a slicer whom Aach had told Bel Iblis about, hoping that he could forge Bel Iblis a false identity so that he could attempt to track down the thief. Upon arriving at Arkos's store, he noticed CorSec Inspector Hal Horn and Imperial Intelligence agent Ysanne Isard departing the establishment, and suspected they were searching for him. He was relieved when they left without noticing him but deduced that Isard's presence meant that Director of Imperial Intelligence Armand Isard was aware of the theft of the top-secret project's location and was hunting for it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Arkos furnished a new identity for Bel Iblis, he watched as Trabler, Isard's assistant, fired a blaster at a woman across the street, before the two Imperial Intelligence agents and Hal Horn departed in a landspeeder.

He carried her back to Arkos, telling the slicer that she needed medical attention. Eventually, the woman recovered, identifying herself as Moranda Savich and, realizing that Bel Iblis was a rebel against the Empire, took him to her safehouse apartment in the city. Eventually, she revealed that she had been the thief who stole the datadisk, although she no longer had it in her possession, and she agreed to lead Bel Iblis to it and help him recover it in exchange for 50,000 credits. Things were complicated somewhat, by the fact that unbeknownst to the Imperial agent, the package was in Isard's speeder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hoping to lure Isard and Horn to her and create a distraction that would ensure she and Bel Iblis could retrieve the datadisk from the speeder, Savich contacted Darkknell Defense Agency officers and tricked them into sending several security landspeeders to a location near her safehouse, knowing that Isard would suspect it was related to the rebel activity. When Isard and Horn neared the tapcafe where Savich and Bel Iblis were hiding, the two rebels realized that Horn was wearing a choke-collar\u2014it would kill him if she ordered it to or if she herself died. This compromised their plan, which entailed Bel Iblis firing on Isard while Savich sneaked into the landspeeder, as Bel Iblis did not want Horn, a good and honorable man in the Senator's eyes, coming to any harm. Savich was able to adapt the plan, though."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She contacted Horn via comlink, informing him and Isard that she had the datadisk and would hand it over for one million credits. She then recorded a message and transmitted it to Horn's comlink, ensuring that Horn and Isard would believe that they were speaking to Savich live. Savich submitted their location to Darkknell Defense, and then approached the two while the message played. Wearing a disguise, she pretended to be Allyse Conroy, an old friend of Horn's, and swiped Isard's ID card while talking to the duo. When Colonel Nyroska of Darkknell Defense arrived, Savich informed him that she was Isard and that the two others were rebels. Nyroska whisked them to the nearest cell, and Savich fled the planet after being paid by Bel Iblis, hoping to get away before her deception was discovered.

This was further cemented when Isard used his supposed death as part of an elaborate story to absolve herself of any blame for her failure on Darkknell, claiming that her father, Armand Isard, was a rebel and that he had ordered Bel Iblis' death in advance of Bel Iblis reading a pro-Imperial speech. The Empire scoured the galaxy for Bel Iblis, but was unable to locate him. It took a great deal of time for Bel Iblis to overcome the loss of his family; whereas before their deaths he had been considered something of a political maverick, after it he became withdrawn and sullen for many years.

Fearing Imperial repercussions, Tevv and SoBilles shyed away from a formal alliance.

His Gungan henchman Kleef captured Bel Iblis, but the Senator was quickly rescued by Galen Marek, the Secret apprentice of Darth Vader, the Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet. Unbeknownst to Bel Iblis, Marek was on assignment for Vader to rally together the Emperor's political enemies, so that they could be captured in one swift stroke. Bel Iblis was impressed by Marek's skills, and, seeing him as a strong ally in his struggle against the Empire, decided to call another meeting with Organa and Mothma. Summoning them to an ancient monastery in the mountains of Corellia, Bel Iblis argued for a consolidation of their three resistance forces into a single organization capable of striking at the Empire throughout the galaxy. Swayed by his words, the meeting's attendees\u2014Bel Iblis himself, Mothma, Organa, Marek, the former Jedi Rahm Kota, and Organa's daughter Leia (attending via the holodroid PROXY)\u2014drafted and signed the Corellian Treaty, which formally declared an Alliance to Restore the Republic. To their horror, the meeting was immediately interrupted by Darth Vader and a squad of Imperial stormtroopers, who stormed the meeting and captured the rebel leaders.

Bel Iblis and Mon Mothma's talents complemented each other\u2014he was a keen military strategist, she an inspirational public speaker\u2014and the Alliance grew and grew under their and Organa's leadership. Bel Iblis had distinct views on how the Rebellion should operate, which made he and Mon Mothma frequently at odds. Many times, he advocated a military attack while his two opposite numbers vetoed him. Bel Iblis feared that Mothma was becoming addicted to power, though Organa often acted the mediator, ensuring that relations between the two rebel leaders were decent. Organa was one of few beings who could make Mon Mothma change her mind, or, in Bel Iblis's eyes, see reason.

Bel Iblis stayed with the Rebellion for several months, losing many friends and finding his name on an Imperial arrest list. Some time later, Mothma gave the go-ahead for an Alliance attack on an Imperial garrison at Milvayne in the Gyrica system without seeking the approval of Bel Iblis or any of her other military advisors. Before the attack was enacted, Bel Iblis called Mothma out for her actions at an Alliance conference, requesting that she postpone and reconsider the attack. Mothma overruled him, but a livid Bel Iblis questioned her motives in ordering the attack, claiming it was simply part of a grab for power on her part. The two traded thinly-veiled insults, with Bel Iblis eventually stating that none of his troops would have a part in the attack. He felt that Mothma's Intelligence was flawed, as his own sources informed him it was in fact a heavily fortified Imperial Ubiqtorate base, which his men would be unable to deal with.

Eventually, they hit a goldmine when they discovered that an old gambler on the Pantolomin's famed luxury cruiser, the Coral Vanda, knew the location of the fabled Katana fleet, a group of Old Republic dreadnaughts that had disappeared years before the Clone Wars. The gambler's name was Hoffner, though he never revealed his identity to Bel Iblis. The former Senator's personnel were able to barter with Hoffner until he eventually agreed to retrieve some of the dreadnaughts for them, which he did without revealing their actual location.

While the attack was a resounding success, it opened the Empire's eyes to the threat posed by Bel Iblis' movement, and from then on they necessarily treaded carefully in an effort to ensure that the Empire could not track their movements and locate their base. Shortly after the mission to Tangrene, they established a new base, known as Peregrine's Nest. Bel Iblis later met Borsk Fey'lya, a Bothan member of the Alliance High Command who had designs on leading the Alliance.

Deciding that Imperial attacks would likely cease following the Emperor's death, he made Peregrine's Nest a permanent base on a planet within 150 light-years of New Cov, and began stockpiling resources and ships should he need to step in and stop Mothma. For over three years they waited for Mothma to install herself as a dictator; Bel Iblis' top lieutenants recognized that she never would, and deep down, so did he, even if he would never admit to it. In 8 ABY, Grand Admiral Thrawn returned from the Unknown Regions to spearhead an Imperial campaign against Mothma's New Republic; with both sides desperate for new ships, Bel Iblis knew that if Thrawn discovered Peregrine's Nest he would take its armaments and dreadnaughts and destroy it.

Bel Iblis told them very little aside from his connections to the Bothans, but promised to fill them in at a later time, when it suited him. In return, he asked them a number of questions about Mothma's role in the New Republic.

Bel Iblis founded and operated his first private rebellion based on direct confrontation with the Empire, and was pragmatic enough to realize the necessity of merging it with other rebel groups. When he felt that an intact copy of the Caamas Document would save the galaxy from a major civil war, he was willing to sacrifice his life and those of people serving under him in order to obtain it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A keen military strategist and an astute observer, Bel Iblis was skilled at thinking on his feet during space battles, and ordered his pilots to sleep in their cockpits in anticipation of a coming conflict on at least one occasion. In his capacity as a New Republic General, he was unafraid to speak his mind to the government's Chief of State. The Corellian was often wary of the ambition of others, believing that first Palpatine and later Mon Mothma were addicted to power. Although he was correct in the former case, his fears that Mothma would declare herself Empress of the galaxy were only let go of five years after the founding of the New Republic. He was too proud of a man to admit his mistake, and even after joining Mothma's New Republic, held onto his pride and refused to make amends with her or to admit his past failings. When Coruscant came under attack by Grand Admiral Thrawn, he was too proud to help defend the planet unless Mothma herself requested it of him (though that was mainly because Mothma was unwilling to trust Bel Iblis with the lives of the people under her command)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Garm Bel Iblis was created by author Timothy Zahn and first appeared in his 1992 hardcover novel Dark Force Rising. The character was conceived when Zahn was seeking a role for Han Solo in the book, and was then worked into the overarching plot of the trilogy that Dark Force Rising made up the middle chapter of. Zahn wrote Bel Iblis as contributing to the plot of the trilogy's final chapter, The Last Command, in what he saw as a solid fashion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later published works expanded upon the character and his role in the founding of the Rebellion, including various sourcebooks and the 2008 video game The Force Unleashed. In both The Force Unleashed and Empire at War: Forces of Corruption, Bel Iblis is voiced by Kristoffer Tabori.[source?] In the latter's Galactic Conquest and Skirmish modes, he can be found on any Rebel-controlled world, as well as on Tatooine and Sullust in the game's Campaign mode. Other inconsistencies surrounding the character involve the spelling of his last name; several sources assert \"bel Iblis\" while the 1994 novel Jedi Search spells it as \"Bel-Iblis\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
