At the academy, Ramis became romantically involved with another student, Miko Reglia. Sometime prior to 25 ABY, Ramis graduated and attained the rank of Jedi Knight. Although a few within the Order\u2014including Tionne Solusar\u2014believed that Ramis and Reglia had ended their relationship after graduating, the pair were able to meet up again several times.

A supporter of Kyp Durron's stance that the Force was a tool that should be used to defeat the Yuuzhan Vong, and that the Order should be taking a more aggressive stance in opposing the invasion, she was shocked at the New Republic's decision to not sanction Jedi missions within the invasion corridor.

With the news that the Yuuzhan Vong were taking slaves and implanting them with surge coral to do their bidding, she transferred her hatred to the invaders, and sought to destroy them by any means necessary. To this end, she hoped to find another forgotten superweapon hidden away somewhere. Ramis, however, was unaware that a computer program designed by Anakin Solo to track search requests was also running on the academy's databases. The goal was to see what information was accessed by Jedi after receiving assignments so that future mission plans would include all relevant data.

Ramis commanded a flight in the squadron, with three other pilots under her command. Emerging from hyperspace into the battle zone, the Dozen hooked up with the corvette carrying the scientists and their battered escort. Ramis led her pilots into combat with Yuuzhan Vong coralskippers, engaging a larger-than-normal enemy fighter that was intent on striking at the corvette. The coralskipper's dovin basal\u2014which generated artificial singularities similar to black holes as a form of defense\u2014resisted the standard tactic of stutter-firing low powered laser shots to overtax them, forcing Master Durron to seek another way of destroying it. Using the Force to take control of the hulk of a freighter destroyed by the Yuuzhan Vong, he sent it hurtling towards the coralskipper while other members of the Dozen made sure it held its course. Ramis, who had been reassigned to defend the corvette, watched as Durron's tactic cost the lives of three pilots under his command. Appalled that his actions had cost the lives of so many pilots, she deserted his command and led the last two remaining members of the Dozen towards the small Jedi fleet. Harried by coralskippers, her wingmen were killed as she secured the area around the corvette. In this she was aided by Quee, who activated a Yammosk-jammer, confusing the enemy fighters.

The belief was that Zonama Sekot held the key to defeating the invaders, and Skywalker had assembled a group of Jedi to discover the location of the planet. The mission was aided by the Imperial Remnant, who had provided support ships and personnel. Ramis advised sending a ship to contact Skywalker's group and ascertain their situation. Ramis was still on Mon Calamari when the Yuuzhan Vong moved against the planet. With Master Durron on an assignment to the planet Caluula, Ramis led the reformed Dozen into combat against the Yuuzhan Vong. The battle was a victory for the combined Allied forces defending the world, as the Yuuzhan Vong withdrew from the engagement although their fleet was nearing the planet of Mon Calamari itself.

The planet was a seed of the Yuuzhan Vong's original homeworld, Yuuzhan'tar. It was hoped that this revelation would be enough to end the conflict as Sekot, the living intelligence of the world, was willing to allow the Yuuzhan Vong to settle on the surface. Skywalker called all available Jedi to the planet, assuring them that it would be safe to travel to the Coruscant system despite the presence of a large Yuuzhan Vong fleet orbiting Coruscant itself. Ramis joined many of her fellow Jedi on the surface, where Skywalker explained the importance of Zonama Sekot to the Yuuzhan Vong. The world featured strongly in the Yuuzhan Vong religion, and its sudden reappearance was seen as an omen of defeat. Conversely, the Shamed Ones, the lowest caste of Yuuzhan Vong society, saw the planet as a holy, sacred place, that was the key to their redemption. Its arrival triggered a rebellion on Coruscant, which the Yuuzhan Vong now called \"Yuuzhan'tar\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zonama Sekot agreed to fashion living ships for the Jedi, and Ramis, along with several other Jedi such as Kyp Durron, Corran Horn, Kyle Katarn and Saba Sebatyne, underwent a special ceremony. Ramis and the other Jedi were led over a bridge and through a lamina-surfaced tunnel into a series of concealed courtyards. Required to adhere to a special diet, each candidate wore sashed robes and necklaces and listened to a series of litanies chanted by Magister Jabitha Hal, leader of the Ferroan and Langhesi communities that called Zonama Sekot home.

As the Jedi continued their inspection, Skywalker received word from Booster Terrik\u2014commander of the Errant Venture and Corran Horn's father-in-law\u2014that a Yuuzhan Vong battle group was en route to the planet. An Alliance force was already engaged with the Yuuzhan Vong at the outer planet of Muscave, and the ships had been detached from that formation to assault Zonama Sekot. Those like Ramis who had been bonded to living ships were to immediately take to the air and get acquainted with flying them in preparation to defend the planet. Before taking off, an impromptu ceremony was held where each Jedi ignited their lightsabers and held them aloft, gathered around Master Skywalker. As the Jedi angled the blades inward, Skywalker gave a quick speech to unite those gathered for the tasks they were to perform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The handful of Jedi-piloted vessels engaged Yuuzhan Vong coralskippers in the skies above Zonama Sekot. The presence of living vessels much like their own confused the Yuuzhan Vong a great deal, and the yammosks had difficulty in differentiating friend from foe due to the similar organic nature of the ships. Some of the Jedi had difficultly in controlling their craft; as living organisms, each craft had to get to \"know\" its pilot, effectively bonding with them. While some Jedi had no difficulty in letting go of their egos, others found it harder and their ships were not as responsive as they should have been, sometimes even refusing to fire on the enemy. In time, however, the bonding process smoothed out and the Jedi pilots defended the world in earnest. As the battle in the Coruscant system intensified, the focus of the engagement shifted toward the orbit of Zonama Sekot itself. Heavy fighting between the Alliance and Yuuzhan Vong threatened the world, and the presence of a ship infected with Alpha Red\u2014a bio-engineered disease created through a joint effort between the Chiss Ascendancy and the Galactic Alliance's Alpha Red agency that targeted Yuuzhan Vong organisms\u2014was en route to the planet. Sekot, however, wanted only to welcome the Yuuzhan Vong home. The living intelligence had used the Jedi piloted ships to defend the planet long enough to ready its other line of defense\u2014specially designed starfighters capable of grappling enemy vessels. Sekot grounded the Jedi fighters, then used the grapplers to bring Alliance and Yuuzhan Vong ships alike down to the surface. Ramis, along with the other Jedi pilots, were witness to the first act of a Yuuzhan Vong surrender on the surface after four coralskipper pilots were forcibly brought down.

As Zonama Sekot prepared to welcome its new residents, Master Skywalker called a conclave of all Jedi to lay out his vision for the future of the Jedi Order. Ramis attended the gathering where Skywalker urged each of them to look inside of themselves and see how best each of them could serve the Force, and ultimately themselves.
