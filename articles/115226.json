This had the effect of disabling droids and machines caught within the blast radius of the grenade by overloading their systems. The RPP grenade was one of the many weapons of ARC troopers. However, using the grenade also disrupted the sensors of the ARC trooper's armor, requiring a few minutes to re-calibrate for full function of the sensors. Because of this, it was not commonly employed by standard clone troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
