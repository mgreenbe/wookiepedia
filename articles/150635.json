This discovery led to the manufacturing of floating ranches, supported by repulsorlift generators, to take advantage of the fertile atmosphere. These floating ranches covered half the visible surface of the planet. Even in the habitable zone Tyed Kant's atmosphere contained a mix of many elements. The result was a breeding ground for bacteria and disease. Because of this environment suits were recommended at all times, despite the air being capable of sustaining humanoid life. The most visible native species were the Iagoin, semi-intelligent creatures that floated among the gaseous clouds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeking freedom, it seceded from the Galactic Republic shortly before the Clone Wars, only to be taken over by the Commerce Guild.
