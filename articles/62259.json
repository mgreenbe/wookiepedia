It was active during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist Alliance, and participated in the climactic Battle of Coruscant. There, Home Fleet Strike Group Five trapped the Separatist flagship Invisible Hand and demanded its surrender. The Providence-class Dreadnought, under the command of Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies General Grievous, claimed that they held Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine as a hostage onboard. Lieutenant Commander Lorth Needa, commanding officer of the unit, did not believe the claims and ordered that Grievous show proof of the claims within ten minutes. Eventually, Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi rescued the Supreme Chancellor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Home Fleet Strike Group Five consisted of three Carrack-class light cruisers under the command of Lieutenant Commander Needa, from his flagship the Integrity, and bolstered by the Indomitable and the Perseverance.
