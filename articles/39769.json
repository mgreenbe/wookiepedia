It had two barrels, configured so that the bolts would meet just after firing and fuse into a single, much more powerful bolt. The double blaster was conceptually similar to the composite-beam laser, but was significantly cruder. Though very powerful, it had a low rate of fire and was difficult to aim. Moruth Doole's enforcer Arb Skynxnex favored using a double blaster, considering its limitations an acceptable trade-off for such a powerful sidearm. However, the weapon proved useless against Kessel's energy spiders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
