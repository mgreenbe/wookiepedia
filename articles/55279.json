In 22 BBY, the Galactic Republic learned that Confederate General Grievous planned to invade the planet Bothawui, the homeworld of the Bothans, a species vital to Republic intelligence because of their adept information-collecting abilities. A fleet of three Venator-class Star Destroyers, under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, was sent to protect Bothawui. Although the Republic battle group led by Skywalker was outnumbered, the Jedi General decided to stay and defend Bothawui. In order to prevent a Confederate invasion of the planet, he placed several All Terrain Tactical Enforcers, led by Clone Captain CT-7567, on asteroids in the asteroid belt above the gas giant Bothawui Prime. The Confederate fleet, consisting of six Munificent-class star frigates, emerged from hyperspace, and Grievous ordered the ships to navigate through the asteroid belt, intending to use the asteroids as cover from Republic fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piloting V-19 Torrent starfighters, Gold Six, along with the rest of his squadron, departed from the Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute to stop the approaching fleet. Skywalker led the squadron from his own Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor. However, as Skywalker wanted the Confederate ships to approach closer, so that the walkers on the asteroids could start firing at them, he ordered Gold Six and his squadron to hold their positions. Grievous' ships opened fire, causing damage to one of the three Republic Star Destroyers. During the ensuing battle, a fellow pilot told Gold Six to watch his stabilizer. Skywalker eventually ordered Gold Squadron to proceed toward the frigates, but one of the V-19 Torrent starfighters was hit by laser fire and crashed into another starfighter. The Jedi General then ordered the rest of the squadron to retreat, while he proceeded toward the Confederate fleet.
