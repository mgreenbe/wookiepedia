Sy eventually took on a Padawan, Lula Talisola. During a Nihil attack on Trymant IV, Talisola and her friends met and befriended the Force-sensitive Mikkian Zeen Mrala, who was invited to come to the Starlight Beacon in the aftermath. One week after Mrala's arrival, Sy, along with Masters Yoda, Torban Buck, Avar Kriss and Estala Maru, came to see her to decide whether she would stay at the Beacon. During the Masters' discussion, in response to Maru noting that Mrala was too old to begin training, Sy countered that she had gotten along well with Talisola and the other Padawans, and Yoda noted that Sy had made a good point. The apprentices, including Talisola and Farzala Tarabal, pointed out that Mrala's opinion, as well as theirs, should be taken into account."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Padawans and younglings regaled the Masters with the tale of the events on Trymant IV, Sy watched along with the other Masters. Eventually, it was agreed that Mrala could stay at the Beacon for a time, as the status of Trymant IV was still unknown and she could help them locate the Nihil since she knew Krix Kamerat and Tromak, who had both been taken by the pirates. After Yoda revealed that he had given Mrala and Kamerat holoprojectors which allowed them to communicate, during the ensuing discussion, Sy noted that it was imperative the Jedi find out about the strange object Yoda had encountered on the pirates' Spider Cruiser. Mrala, however, was uncertain about whether she would help stop the Nihil."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sy later travelled to the Republic Outpost space station in the Bright Jewel system, along with Yoda, Buck, Talisola, Tarabal, Qort and Mrala. While Talisola kept Mrala company, the three Masters worked with the Republic personnel at the station to watch for Nihil activity. Eventually, the Masters headed out in their Jedi Vectors, accompanied by a force of Z-28 Skywings, after a credible report was received about the Nihil. Talisola was meditating with Mrala when she heard the news, and finding out from Tarabal what was going on, was disappointed to be left behind. However, Sy insisted over the comms that there was no good reason for Talisola and her friends to endanger themselves by going along. The ensuing battle was swift and decisive, with the Nihil forces easily being routed. However, Yoda was suspicious, believing that the victory had been too easy. Sy picked up a distress signal in their starfighter which the Masters quickly determined was coming from the junk moon Quantxi, and the Masters set off in that direction to investigate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kantam Sy was a human with tan skin and long black hair, worn in a topknot.
