He was assigned to Yavin 4 when the Yuuzhan Vong took the moon. While there, he ran into his brother, but did not seem to treat him with the usual contempt the high-caste Yuuzhan Vong held the Shamed Ones in. When Mezhan Kwaad refused to answer Vua's questions, and when Commander Tsaak Vootuh refused to intercede, Hul challenged Kwaad, asking if any doubted the gods favor of Vua. After Kwaad revealed that she had infected Vua with a virus and was killed, Hul told Vua that he was a warrior again and should kill Anakin Solo. Vua refused and stunned Hul with an amphistaff and went on to kill many Yuuzhan Vong warriors before being killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In some legends of the Jeedai heresy, Hul fought side by side with the redeemed Vua, while in others, it was he, not Mezhan Kwaad, who killed Vua."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
