At some point, she and her K-Wing managed to enter combat with a TIE fighter over a forested planet, where she managed to destroy the TIE pursuing her via the K-Wing's turrets shooting behind. During the failed blockade of Doornik-319, Doni pulled out of her bombing run when she heard the pleas of Yevethan prisoners that had been broadcast on an open channel. In the subsequent counterattack, Doni and a number of other exposed K-wing pilots were killed when their craft were shot down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
