He allowed Jas Emari, Norra and Temmin Wexley, Mister Bones, Han Solo, Jom Barell and Sinjir Rath Velus to land on Kashyyyk and free the Rebel and Wookiee prisoners from stasis, shutting down the facility in the process. Many of the prisoners were taken to Chandrila, the capital of the New Republic. Rax caused the freed prisoners from Ashmead's Lock to mysteriously and seemingly involuntarily shoot key New Republic leaders on Liberation Day. The attacks resulted in Mon Mothma and Kyrsta Agate being seriously injured whilst high ranking officials such as Crix Madine and Hostis Ij were rumored to be dead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
