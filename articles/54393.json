Giant squids had two eyes and ten tentacles. These manipulators sported numerous suction cups and flared out into sagittiform tips. The squids also featured a conical mantle with spots, and an arrow-shaped pair of fins at the end. Giant squids had eyes on either side of the head area. The squids were capable of being stunned into unconsciousness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While traversing the oceans of Mon Calamari in 5 ABY, Senate Planetary Intelligence Network agent Luke Skywalker's minisub was caught by a giant squid.
