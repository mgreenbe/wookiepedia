If the thrust dampers were disabled, the droid starfighters were forced to switch to walker mode to operate. One fighter attacked the Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi on board the Saak'ak. Its thrust dampers were disabled after the Jedi reflected its laser blasts back at it using their lightsabers. Further deflected blasts destroyed the starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrust dampers appears in the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I Jedi Power Battles and were identified in the game's strategy guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
