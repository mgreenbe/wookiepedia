Once the two factions had been reunited, this pirate, among others, attempted to kill the brothers in order to get a hold of their riches. However, the brothers managed to reach their ship, and were planning to pilot the ship off Florrum, when this pirate was ordered by Hondo Ohnaka to shoot the two Sith's ship down. The pirate hit the target, and the pirates ended up with much wealth and weaponry after scavenging the crash site."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few scenes prior to when this pirate shoots down the ship, the pirate's bandanna appears to be a lighter, almost white, shade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 \"Revival\" (First appearance)"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
