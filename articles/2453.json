It was used along with a Melihat \"Multi Imager\" dedicated energy receptor and a Tana Ire electro-photo receptor to comprise a T-65B X-wing starfighters sensor system. Alternatively, the ANs-5d could be combined with two additional Fabritech components, a PTSA #PA-9r long-range phased tachyon detection array and a PTAG #PG-7u short range primary threat analysis grid to produce the sensor system. This alternate configuration was a BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bombers main sensor system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
