Produced by Republic Sienar Systems, it was later manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems and its civilian subsidiary, Sienar Ships.

It had space to carry 150 metric tons of cargo in its 60 cubic meter hold. It was equipped with a Class 2 hyperdrive with a Class 15 backup hyperdrive, shields and a single laser cannon for defense. It featured a high-quality sensor array although it had a lower sensitivity than the military TIE/sr."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was one of the first ships to use the revolutionary Twin Ion Engine design, with a cockpit and sublight engines strongly foreshadowing later Sienar craft. Many of the basic technologies used were identical to those used in the TIE starfighter line. However, its large passenger and cargo compartment made it much larger than those later starfighter designs, stretching it out to a length of 24 meters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lone Scout-A was intended for use in exploring the wild regions of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike the TIE series, the Lone Scout-A was made available to, and widely used by, the civilian market.
