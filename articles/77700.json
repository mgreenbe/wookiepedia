Compared to his fellow judges, he was perhaps the one who was most aligned with the Republic, as he would often speak against the Sith diplomat, who constantly jumped from one conviction to another, and when he threatened the Rodian Gluupor, during the case of Sunry vs. the Ahto City Authority."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kota's view was justified when Revan brought a Sith datapad detailing their plan to take over Manaan, as evidence of Sith treachery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
