On one occasion, he set up a training exercise which involved the Imperial cadets flying speeder bikes through Reitgen Hoops in Galactic City. During that exercise, the cadets Ciena Ree and Thane Kyrell got their bikes entangled together but still managed to win the race. While he was annoyed with the cadets for finding a loophole, he reluctantly awarded them twenty five marks each; splitting the prize between them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
