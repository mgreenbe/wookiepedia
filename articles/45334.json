After Kenobi had delivered an infant Luke to his uncle Owen Lars on Tatooine, Yoda was dismayed to learn that Kenobi had neglected to evacuate the Temple's holocrons during their flight. He stresses that they need the holocrons to train Luke and instructs Senator Bail Prestor Organa and Kenobi to rendezvous with him on Kashyyyk.

With the Jedi gone, he warns the Senators that anyone who defies him will face the wrath of his apprentice Darth Vader. Vader trips since he is not used to his new legs.
