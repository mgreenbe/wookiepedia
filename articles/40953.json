He served as a security officer under the Kaleesh Sith Lord Saes Rrogon, aboard Rrogon's ship, the Sith dreadnaught Harbinger. In 5000 BBY, Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow sent Harbinger and another Sith dreadnaught, Omen, on a mission to find Lignan, a rare ore that was very powerful in the dark side of the Force, for use during the Sith Empire's upcoming invasion of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith eventually located a large deposit of Lignan on the largest moon of Phaegon III in the Phaegon system. As Harbinger and Omen harvested the ore, they were ambushed by a Jedi Infiltrator starfighter. While Harbinger sent ten Blade-class starfighters to assail the fighter, a Jedi Master, Relin Druur, infiltrated Harbinger in an attempt to sabotage the ship's hyperdrive, using the Force to hide himself from the perceptions of the beings he met."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just outside the ship's landing bay, Drophan noticed Druur before the Jedi Master was able to blind him to his appearance. Druur claimed that there was trouble in the landing bay, but the Massassi, suspicious of the Jedi Master's flexsuit\u2014a type of environmental suit\u2014inquired as to who his superior was. When Druur gave no answer, Drophan pushed him up against the wall and began to report the interloper's presence via comlink, but Druur cut him off by claiming that his superior was Memit Nadill. Drophan was unfamiliar with the name, and Druur informed him that Nadill was a Jedi Master on the planet Kirrek."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally realizing the threat that Druur presented, Drophan moved to attack, but Druur pushed him across the corridor and into a wall. Drophan attempted to lunge at Druur with his lanvarok weapon, but the Jedi severed Drophan's arm and then cut off the Massassi's head. Drophan's body was soon discovered and reported to Colonel Los Dor on Harbinger's bridge, who in turn reported the finding to Rrogon. Knowing that the lightsaber cuts on Drophan's body meant that there was a Jedi aboard, Rrogon decided to hunt the Jedi down and present him as a gift to Sadow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Drophan was muscular and spoke in a guttural voice.
