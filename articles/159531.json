When Kendoh Voss and the Kendoh Gang came to Black Spire Outpost, Varg reported one of their members, Remex Io, to the 709th Legion of stormtroopers of the First Order. Shortly after Io narrowly evaded the 709th and sent them on a fruitless search to Batuu's spaceport, Varg attacked him, grabbing him by the throat and strongly implied that he knew that he and Voss's crew were about to pull a heist against his boss. He shapeshifted into Io and knocked him out, impersonating him and meeting Voss at Oga's Cantina. As Voss met with Hondo Ohnaka to discuss his role in their heist, Varg waited with Wooro, who did not suspect that Io was being impersonated. Unaware of how they planned the heist, Varg asked Wooro why Voss was hiring a pilot, and when Wooro asked why he hadn't remembered their plan, Varg cryptically replied that it had been a long day. When Voss and Wooro stole the hilt, Wooro fled Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities and passed the hilt to Varg, believing him to be Io. Varg then doubled back to the Den of Antiquities, returning the hilt to Dok-Ondar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Varg first appeared in the theme park Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge through his voice, which was provided by Lucasfilm Story Group member Matt Martin.
