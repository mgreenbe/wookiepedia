They also had no lips, further exaggerating the appearance of an overbite. Their scaly skin ranged in color from blue to purple to black. Their hands retained an interstitial web between the fingers. Their fingers ended in narrow tips which resembled claws.

Despite their long lives, their childhood was quite short. They matured quickly, grew out of adolescence at 18, then enjoyed a healthy adulthood which lasted approximately four hundred years. At four hundred a Draethos was considered middle aged. It was not until age seven hundred that a Draethos was considered elderly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Draethos, warrior and intellectual alike, possessed telepathy, including the ability to communicate with any sentient being in a radius of approximately five hundred meters.

The Draethos was a warrior culture. Those living on the homeworld were expected to demonstrate their martial or hunting prowess. Life on Draethos was harsh, with arrogant aristocrats squabbling among one another for social standing and wealth. Warriors were perpetually in high demand as gladiators, mercenaries, hunters, and soldiers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pacifistic philosophies were despised on Draethos.

They were usually enthralled with learning as much as they could, even if they might never apply their detailed knowledge of a given subject. The stability of the Draethos culture caused exiled Draethos to have troubles while understanding the complex and relatively rapid changes in other societies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The most notable Draethos was Odan-Urr, a legendary Jedi Master who founded the Great Library of Ossus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
