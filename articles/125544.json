Many of them took on the form of geometric shapes, with the circle being the \"holiest\" of shapes. Thousands of the wisest members of the droid race created powerful fifty-kilometer spheroid bodies. Two influential members of this giant variety included The One and The Other, and the others were collectively called The Rest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This new culture of order and symmetry soon brought them into conflict with the chaotic, self-constructing droids known as the Abominor. The two droid species fought a galactic war, ignoring their galaxy's native organic species, until the organic Yuuzhan Vong fought back and forced both droid powers to flee their galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Silentium soon found another galaxy to call home, and settled in a place that Humans would come to call the Unknown Regions.
