When Tag and Bink were told to leave the throne room, they tried to find the elevator to escape from Death Star II, but the only elevator was on the other side of the tower they came from. Not wanting to look foolish, Tag and Bink watched the duel between Luke and Vader, as well as Palpatine's death from the redeemed Anakin. After Luke dragged Vader's body through the elevator, Tag and Bink were waiting for the elevator to return.
