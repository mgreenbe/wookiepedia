In an effort to access declassified documents on Dhara, she obtained a stolen Imperial decoder with the connivance of the Spectres, a rebel cell that operated on Lothal. Merei's data breach of the Imperial data network eventually drew the attention of the Imperial authorities who assigned her own mother Jessa, a renown data-security specialist, to investigate the breach. Merei's problems were further complicated when the Gray Syndicate's boss Yahenna Laxo utilized her services as a courier in return for supplying the snoopers. In an attempt to elude the Imperial investigators and to break free of her debt to the Gray Syndicate, Merei staged her own kidnapping and framed Laxo; leading to a deadly raid on syndicate's headquarters in Ake's Tavern which killed numerous individuals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guilt-ridden by her role in the deaths of many people, Merei endeavored to help an elderly fugitive named Holshef escape off-world.

Upon arriving at Beck's old orchard, they discovered that the Empire was using harvester droids to harvest the jogan fruits. These droids proved incompetent and ended up bruising the fruits. These only hardened Beck's feeling against the Empire, which would later have implications for Merei and Zare."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a match against the Thrashers, Beck took Merei and Zare took them on a night trip to his family orchards.

The insurgents disappeared as soon as Merei and her companions arrived. Zare quickly contacted the Imperial authorities who sent men to defuse the explosives and to apprehend the insurgents. Merei and Zare quickly deduced that Beck was somehow sympathetic or linked to the insurgents when he misled the authorities by telling them that the insurgents had gone north; when in fact they had actually gone south.

Using this information, Zare carefully guided his team to victory over the Kothal Roughnecks by a margin of six points; causing Fhurek to lose his bet.

To add insult to injury, the Imperial authorities had claimed that the farmers had instigated the shooting by attacking Imperial surveyors and destroying mining equipment.

During their brief meeting, Beck conceded that now was not the right time to launch a rebellion against the Empire. He warned his friends particularly Merei to be careful that they were not caught by the authorities. Since a real resistance had not yet emerged on Lothal, Beck convinced Zare to infiltrate the Academy for Young Imperials in order to find his sister and to work against the Empire from within.

In her spare time, she also developed a computer program on her datapad which allowed her to hack into the Lothal Academy for Young Imperials' computer database.

This crime syndicate was involved in various activities on Lothal. She met the syndicate's leader Yahenna Laxo who agreed to supply her with a snooper in exchange for Merei delivering a package to an associate in Capital City's marketplace. After leaving the Gray Syndicate, she bought three network drives, a book of flimsy receipts, and a second-hand T-shirt from Phelarion School before returning home.

After Zare befriended Dev, Merei helped the two cadets forge a fake procurement order for podracer spareparts. Later, at Zare's request, she made contact with Dev's rebel companions Garazeb Orrelios, Sabine Wren, and Chopper.

Later that night, she used her fake ISB account to download several classified Imperial intelligence, law enforcement, and military reports and documents into her datapad.

However, the interrogator did not recognize he since Jix had failed to switch her V-SIS photo.

After she told him about her predicament with Holshef, Old Jho agreed to arrange his escape off-world and told her to bring her friend back in six days time. He told her that he had friends with off-world transportation. Merei then met up with Holshef and told him her plans.

After the Imperials had left, Merei logged into the Imperial data network and discovered that the Empire had issued arrest warrants for several individuals including Jix and Hestia Tarleton, the girl whose image she had swapped on her repeater service account.

She then raced to Holshef's warehouse hideaway and evacuated the poet, who reluctantly agreed to leave with his latest poems. Together, they departed Capital City on Merei's jumpseeder and reached the highway leading through the grasslands to the east of the city. On the way, they were pursued by a bounty hunter riding on a swoop. They managed to lose the bounty hunter after Holshef's bag of poems opened.

At the Pit Shop's bar, Merei told her parents that she was responsible for the data breach at the Transportation Ministry and that she had also created a fake ISB account. In an effort to appease her mother, Merei revealed that she had also downloaded a lot of highly classified documents from the Imperial network.

While Old Jho made arrangements with the rebel Garazeb Orrelios for their departure, Merei and Jessa traveled on their family speeder back to Capital City. Upon arriving there, they informed the Leonises and their nanny droid Auntie Nags. Leo, a staunch Imperial loyalist, initially refused to believe the reports. However, Tepha stood by Merei and Jessa. When Leo attempted to contact the authorities to \"straighten\" things out, Merei stunned him with her blaster. Together with Auntie Nags, they fled on the Spanjaf family speeder to the Westhills. However, they were stopped by an Imperial roadblock manned by two drivers on speeder bikes.

However, they were then cornered by an Imperial officer named Lieutenant Chiron and four stormtrooper reinforcements. Chiron had been Zare's mentor and was a principled man but was still loyal to the Empire. Zare attempted to reason with Chiron but the lieutenant was unmoved by his arguments. Before a fight could break out, Dhara used the Force to crush Chiron and his men under chunks of rocks and metal. Following Chiron's death, Merei witnessed Zare closing the fallen officer's eyes.
