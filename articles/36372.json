The village, guided by Lurmen pacifist Tee Watt Kaa, wanted to remain neutral in the war.

The general planned to attack the Lurmen village with the Separatists' new weapon, the Defoliator, a weapon capable of eliminating organic matter while leaving machinery intact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi and the two clones helped protect the Lurmen by stealing two deflector shield generators from Durd's base on the planet.

However, while escaping on an Consular-class cruiser, the shuttle malfunctioned and activated its hyperdrive, causing it to jump to hyperspace. As the shuttle traveled through hyperspace, Commander CC-5052 warned Secura that their shuttle was heading towards a star, which was near the planet of Maridun.

As the Jedi and clones remained in the village, they learned that Kaa believed that war was an unnecessary act and preferred to remain neutral. Kaa advised the Jedi to leave their colony, however, Tano pleaded for them to help Skywalker, who was deeply hurt. Allowing his adopted son, Wag Too, to leave with the Tano and CC-5052, Secura remained with the Lurmen.

Unbeknownst to them, the Jedi and the two clones hid from Durd with the guidance of Kaa's son Wag Too. After the droids found nothing, Durd and his droids left the area and departed for the established Separatist base on Maridun.
