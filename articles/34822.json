Envisioned by Emperor Palpatine, who bought the necessary materials for its construction, it was built and named by the Sith Lord Darth Maul, who named it after the Darth concept of the Sith. Both Palpatine and Maul used The Force to build the station, though Palpatine just did some work before letting Maul to finish the rest. This proved wrong for Palpatine, as Maul set aside the manual to build the new Death Star at his whim, modeling it to resemble his face, with his mouth being where the superlaser was placed. However, the weapon never saw use in the Galactic Civil War as it was accidentally destroyed by Darth Vader while trying to escape into hyperspace from his fangirls."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
