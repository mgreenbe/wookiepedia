Stec was one of the 100 Alpha-class Advanced Reconnaissance Commandos created from the genome of his clone template and bounty hunter Jango Fett. In addition to the flash training, in which all soldiers received a basic lesson on the development of their military abilities, Fett subjected Stec and the Advanced Reconnaissance Commandos to separate training into ideal special mission groups, capable of operating solely behind enemy lines due to their unique abilities. Because of their lack of obedience, the ARC generation after Jango Fett's departure from Kamino was transferred to stasis and only reactivated two months after the beginning of the Clone Wars during the Battle of Kamino. Stec was integrated as a sergeant in the command operations of the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Hypori"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Muunilinst, ARC captain Fordo was given the task of carrying out an emergency rescue operation on the planet Hypori to evacuate a group of Jedi who were under attack by forces led by General Grievous, the Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies.

When the gunship reached the inside of the destroyed assault ship, Stec and the rest of the Advanced Reconnaissance Commandos gathered behind Fordo. While two of the ARC Troopers were searching for the signs of life that Fordo had discovered in the ruins, Fordo ordered the other clone troopers to fan out. In the location where he had localized two other life signs, the soldiers witnessed a lightsaber duel between Grievous and the last standing Jedi, Ki-Adi-Mundi. When Grievous attempted to finish off the Jedi Master, he noticed the approaching clones, who immediately opened fire on him. Grievous was initially forced to flee further into the wreck in order to escape the ongoing firing of the clones, but eventually attacked the clones, cutting down four of them with his lightsabers. Fordo then called in the gunship for fire support. While Grievous retreated from the gunship's bombardment, Fordo ordered a retreat to ensure the survival of the three rescued Jedi; Shaak Ti, Aayla Secura, and Ki-Adi-Mundi. In the process, Stec sat down at the edge of the passenger cabin in order to be able to hold back Grievous after the Jedi were loaded onto the gunship.
