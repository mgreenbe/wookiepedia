He was programmed with a self preservation mechanism to protect the information he collected as a spy. N1-ZX was stationed on the planet Kaddak and reported to the protocol droid C-3PO, who served as General Leia Organa's spymaster. Prior to the Mission to Kaddak, N1-ZX managed to send a transmission to the Resistance base on D'Qar that it had acquired a large trove of information about the First Order including the location of Supreme Leader Snoke.

Nunzix expressed little gratitude to his rescuers and chided them for taking too long. Despite C-3PO's orders, N1-ZX also refused to release his information on Snoke until they had left Kaddak. C-3PO explained that N1-ZX's self-preservation programming was deeply embedded into his processors. When Dameron proposed giving Nunzix a \"robo-lobotomy\", N1-ZX dared him to while C-3PO explained that doing so would result in a complete memory wipe.

The starfighters S-foils were modified to house droids. While traveling through hyperspace, Dameron got C-3PO to reactivate Nunzix. Dameron confronted N1-ZX and expressed his suspicion that Terex had provided him with disinformation to lead the Resistance into a trap. When N1-ZX asked what made him say that, Terex's ship Carrion Spike and a fleet of Uglies emerged from hyperspace.
