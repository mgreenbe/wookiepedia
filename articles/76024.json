The abduction was carried out as part of Rogoe's plan to keep the Gungan tribes at war with each other, which would allow him to enslave members of the smaller tribes and profit from the discord. Hoxie was held captive in a stronghold north of his city while the leaderless inhabitants of Otoh Raban continued participating in the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the kidnapping, Boss Gallo, a Gungan who was uniting the tribes against Rogoe, arrived at Otoh Raban seeking an alliance. A resident of the city informed him of Hoxie's abduction, promising that the Gungans of Otoh Raban would join Gallo's cause upon the rescue of their boss. Gallo then attacked the stronghold with his army, freeing Hoxie and gaining the allegiance of him and his tribe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boss Hoxie's kidnapping was first indirectly mentioned in the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
