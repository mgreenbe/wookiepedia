It boasted a magazine of four shots, and had a minimum range of a hundred meters, and a maximum range of four thousand meters. However, the weapon had a single severe drawback; recoil. The EMRG-50 boasted such a high recoil that it was all but unusable by sentients without a strength factor nearly double that of a standard human. The Arachnoid Ptak-Sok owned a EMRG-50 during the early years of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
