The bar was popular with the miners and construction crews. Malnock made sure to build his bar on the city's upper levels so that when construction was complete, Lucky's Tavern was located in the middle of the sector where administrators were slated to begin working. As Floating Home transitioned into Cloud City, the clientele shifted from workers to more upscale patrons. Malnock eventually sold the bar to a group of investors and retired as a rich man."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
