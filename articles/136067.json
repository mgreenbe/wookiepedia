Throughout its time, the program was centered on training human conscripts from early childhood.

Representing a new generation of stormtroopers, First Order troopers could trace their origins even further back to the clone troopers who fought for the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. When the Empire fell, suffering catastrophic defeats at Endor and Jakku, the New Republic crafted a peace treaty that ended the Galactic Civil War, yet also reduced the Empire to a rump state through the enforcement of strict disarmament treaties and punishing war reparations. By then, several leading figures in the Empire were dead, including Emperor Palpatine, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, and Counselor Gallius Rax. Under the leadership of Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, the Empire was forced to disband the Stormtrooper Corps as part of the terms outlined in the Galactic Concordance, which forbade the recruitment and training of stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rise of the First Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Empire officially capitulated to the Republic, a group of Imperial officers, nobles and technologists refused to accept the outcome of the war.

By hiding in the unexplored regions of galactic space, the First Order was able to conduct a massive military buildup\u2014forging new armies and fleets in secret\u2014in violation of the Galactic Concordance. The presence of stormtroopers in the First Order's ranks was a well known fact to the New Republic, but the First Order convinced both the government and much of the galaxy that their soldiers were only for defense. Only the Resistance suspected the stormtroopers' true purpose. Drawing inspiration from the ideals of Brendol Hux, a former Republic officer and Imperial commandant who found the Empire's stormtroopers lacking, the First Order created Project Resurrection: the conscription and training of human children who, under the First Order's guidance, became soldiers in the new Stormtrooper Corps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result, a new generation of stormtroopers was born through the training and indoctrination of child conscripts. Unlike soldiers of the Empire, First Order stormtroopers began their training at birth, much like the Republic clone troopers or Jedi Knights who preceded them. The new stormtroopers were taken from their families and raised to be absolutely loyal to the First Order. By 34 ABY, approximately thirty years after the Empire's defeat at Endor, the stormtrooper legions were under the command of Captain Phasma as well as other notable leaders such as General Armitage Hux and Kylo Ren. Above all, their allegiance was with Supreme Leader Snoke, ruler of the First Order. Although all troopers were to display absolute loyalty and fight for the First Order, a Worker Of The Month award could be given to stormtroopers who particularly proved themselves; FN-0208 was one stormtrooper who won the award."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Treason in the ranks"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War, the First Order was opposed by the Resistance\u2014a private military group founded and led by the Rebel hero Leia Organa, the Resistance fought to prevent the First Order from restoring Imperial rule to the galaxy.

Still, intelligence analysts were convinced that there were many more special troopers yet to be discovered. Two Resistance agents, Iden Versio and Shriv Suurgav, discovered Project Resurrection. Versio accused the program of being exploitative, abducting children and brainwashing them to serve the First Order. Her former comrade, Gideon Hask, had a different view. To Hask, the First Order not only rescued children, but also gave them purpose as an army of unprecedented military might."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the First Order's goals, which included the destruction of the New Republic and the Resistance, they supported Kylo Ren's quest to destroy the last Jedi, Luke Skywalker.

After executing the village leader, Lor San Tekka for refusing to cooperate, Ren directed Phasma and the stormtroopers to exterminate the village's entire population. With the exception of FN-2187, every trooper complied with Ren's order, firing into the crowd until the last villager was dead.

Meanwhile, the hunt for Skywalker led Kylo Ren and an armed force of stormtroopers to the planet Takodana where the dark warrior attempted to capture BB-8, a Resistance astromech droid that contained part of the information regarding the last Jedi's location. The stormtroopers assaulted a castle belonging to Maz Kanata during their search for the BB unit, then pursued BB-8 and Rey into the forest where several troopers were killed before Ren apprehended the scavenger.

As Solo and Chewbacca planted the explosives, Ren and a squad of stormtroopers arrived at the oscillator to find them. The stormtroopers aimed their blasters at Solo when he confronted Ren out in the open, hoping to convince his son to abandon the First Order and return home. Ren was shot by Chewbacca after the First Order warlord struck down his father, causing the stormtroopers to open fire on the Wookiee warrior. Despite their efforts, the troopers failed to stop Chewbacca from detonating the explosives, killing the remaining soldiers and damaging the oscillator.

Hoping to disrupt the First Order's ability to track the Resistance fleet's movements through hyperspace, Finn and Rose Tico infiltrated the Supremacy\u2014the flagship of Supreme Leader Snoke\u2014but were ultimately captured by Phasma and her stormtroopers. After bringing the prisoners to a hangar containing a large gathering of stormtroopers, Phasma sentenced Finn and Tico both to summary execution.

Seizing control of the First Order as the new Supreme Leader, his first act in power was to deploy the First Order's forces, including an army of snowtroopers, to the planet Crait where he intended to annihilate the remaining members of the Resistance. During the Battle of Crait, the First Order overwhelmed the Resistance's defenses and stormed the outpost where they hid, although a small group of survivors managed to escape aboard the Millennium Falcon due to Rey's intervention.

Ren outpaced his stormtrooper escorts, cutting a swathe of destruction through the Alazmec cultists to acquire a Sith wayfinder that once belonged to his grandfather. With it, Ren found both the former Emperor as well as untapped military assets on the dark world of Exegol in the Unknown Regions.

As a result, members of the new generation of stormtroopers were trained from birth to become elite soldiers with a single purpose in life\u2014to serve the First Order. This form of training drew inspiration from the ideals of Commandant Brendol Hux, who was inspired by the combat prowess and dedication of the Jedi Knights and Republic clone troopers, both of which were instructed from youth to become efficient combatants. According to Phasma, the ideology of the First Order stormtroopers did not allow for any emotional elements such as sympathy since they were to specifically act as an extension of the Supreme Leader's will, and by extension that of the First Order, alone, and that the troopers were just as strong as they were weak. Likewise, Finn admitted that First Order stormtroopers were considered by their superiors to be expendable; those that were inept in battle were expected to die and not be saved by their fellow allies. During the fall of the Empire, Counselor Gallius Rax conscripted roughly two dozen orphans from his home planet of Jakku and gave them to Hux, who turned them into a force of child soldiers and assassins loyal to Rax. Prior to his death, Rax placed Hux's illegitimate son, Armitage in command of the child soldiers. As an adult, Armitage incorporated his father's ideas into the training program for the First Order stormtroopers.

The First Order processed their conscripts at induction camps where the trainees were separated into groups or \"batches.\" Prior to becoming fully-trained stormtroopers, FN-2187 and trooper 926 were members of Batch Eight. As children, stormtroopers were initially trained under the oversight of Captain Cardinal, a former child soldier who instructed his cadets in hand-to-hand and melee combat, marksmanship, and battle simulations on the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Absolution. When deemed ready, Cardinal's trainees were transferred to the Finalizer where they would complete their training under the watch of Captain Phasma. As the commander of the stormtrooper legions, Phasma endeavored to mold the stormtroopers into the finest soldiers in the galaxy and maintained a constant vigil against any signs of weakness or disobedience. To this end, behavioral and personality conditioning was critical in the training of First Order stormtroopers. In an effort to control their psychological development, the First Order provided its trainees with a steady amount of subliminal sleep messages and First Order propaganda, resulting in the production of soldiers who were completely loyal to the First Order. In addition, rigorous combat exercises and psychological conditioning, the First Order strongly emphasized the values of uniformity and conformity. They were therefore given alphanumeric designations instead of names. As such, their emphasis of uniformity and conformity was strict enough that the stormtroopers weren't allowed to even remove their helmets unless specifically ordered to do so, with the penalty of doing so usually being mandated psychological counseling. A trooper that displayed \"erratic conditioning\" could be scheduled for a full mental wipe and reprogram, also known as a brainscrape.

Unlike the Empire, which resorted to the use of numbing routine for its troopers, the First Order's training simulations, live-fire exercises, and sparring practices encouraged stormtroopers to embrace improvisation on the battlefield. They were, therefore, more effective in battle than the stormtroopers who served as their template.

Examples of defective soldiers included Company 77 and Finn. The stormtroopers of Company 77 refused to fire on unarmed prisoners and had a lack of zeal for the First Order's cause. Likewise, Finn had a lack of zeal for the First Order's cause; combined with his unwillingness to execute unarmed prisoners, it led him to doubt his loyalties before ultimately forsaking his allegiance to the First Order. Both Phasma and Kylo considered FN-2187 as a renegade, albeit the latter also saw him as a prime example of a stormtrooper training program which he viewed as flawed.
