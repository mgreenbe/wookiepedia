He rediscovered much of the galaxy's lost and forgotten secrets about the Force in the Unknown Regions, and he learned about the concept of a Force dyad through an ancient prophecy that featured prominently in the lore of the Sith Eternal. Snoke also became familiar with the Knights of Ren; likewise, their leader \"Ren\" was familiar with Snoke.

However, despite holding absolute power as Supreme Leader, Snoke mostly ceded control of the military to his generals and reputation of the First Order to propaganda maniacs, as he was more content to focus on spiritual matters.

Ultimately, it was Snoke's desire to see the First Order reclaim the galaxy that the Empire lost in its war with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Supreme Leader would then build on that rebuilt foundation, taking the First Order beyond what the Empire achieved in its time.

When he met \"Ren,\" the leader of the Knights of Ren, he saw a possible path that was different from the Jedi ways, allowing darkness to grow instead of being repressed.

Ben Solo was enraged by the revelation and felt betrayed by his family, which Snoke used to cap off his years of manipulations to turn the young man into a tool for the dark side. With Snoke's guidance and Solo's natural power in the Force, he would become even greater than his grandfather, Snoke promised him.

Snoke was correct in assuming Skywalker's survival, for Skywalker had exiled himself to Ahch-To, and his nascent Jedi Order had been destroyed, though Snoke, like the rest of the galaxy, was unaware of Skywalker's location.

In this conversation a droid alerted him to a message from General Brendol Hux, but Snoke ordered the droid to have him wait.

To stoke jealousy in Ren, Snoke often pitted him against Armitage Hux, who got many victories, and hated Ren, to fuel his negative emotions.

Snoke said that he knew Ren was afraid, as he should be, because, Ren wasn't in control. No, he was confused and unsure of his convictions. He felt powerless. Snoke proceeded to say that feeling that way was good. Powerless men often turned to anger and lash out blindly, with rage. But powerful beings can harness their rage and use it to strike. For either, they strike or they fall. Snoke then let go of Ren and let him fall, advising him to use his fear, turn it into anger, and turn his anger into power. Ren followed that advice and was able to hold himself up and survive the fall. He then inquired whether Snoke would have caught him if he wasn't able to catch himself.

He was both wise and cunning, having risen to power by undermining the First Order's leading officials through guile. A master at manipulation, he lured Kylo Ren to the dark side of the Force by using the young Jedi's desperate need for a teacher to his advantage.

Upon learning of Starkiller's impending destruction, he simply told Hux to evacuate the base with Ren, only to later scold and physically reprimand his apprentice out of frustration.

Despite his hatred for the Jedi, Snoke actually respected Skywalker while also fearing him, knowing that the legendary Jedi Master wasn't weak but misguided, even musing that had he taken Skywalker as his second-in-command instead of Ren, the galaxy would have been already his by the time of the Cold War. He regarded the Jedi Order as a threat to his designs and, therefore, plotted to destroy it entirely by killing the last Jedi. Upon meeting Skywalker's final apprentice, the Jakku scavenger Rey, Snoke remarked that she possessed the qualities of a true Jedi and, as such, was resolved to see her die before she could also become a threat to his plans.

His hologram used on the Starkiller Base projected him several times larger (around twenty-five feet) than his natural appearance, towering over Kylo Ren and General Hux. Snoke had an elongated face with pale, heavily scarred skin, and pale blue eyes. Even in person, however, he was still exceptionally large, standing over seven foot two inches tall. Nevertheless, Snoke didn't need size to impose his will given that the mere sight of his appearance could terrify. He sported a large scar from the top of his head, all the way down to his brow. Snoke also had what appeared to be a scar or burn on his right cheek that caused his mouth to be contorted. Snoke's left zygoma was malformed. His twisted build and extensive scarring indeed confounded attempts to identify his species. He wore ornate golden khalat robes with a gray underdress, tied at the waist by an elegant golden belt, and on his finger he wore a ring of gold and obsidian engraved with runes from the Dwartii. The black obsidian stone was excavated from the catacombs and mines beneath Fortress Vader on the planet Mustafar. Because of his physical frailties, which left him past his prime in terms of physical strength, he relied on material comforts such as slippers to deal with his ailing body which was in a constant state of pain due to his advanced age and wounds, and he could not defend himself in a physical fight, instead relying on his Elite Praetorian Guards to deal with any threats to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Snoke was not trained as a Sith, he was Force-sensitive and highly attuned to the dark side, with Force powers equally as impressive and terrifying.

Though having developed a great mastery over telepathy, Snoke's ability to communicate with an individual through the Force over great distances was not as strong compared to that of his creator.

He could even overpower her when both were using the Force at the same time, as he demonstrated by overriding her control of the Skywalker lightsaber, causing it to avoid Rey's grasp before turning around and smacking her in the back of the head.
