Around 3640 BBY he was posted on Voss, where he commanded a group of soldiers from a base called the Hawk's Nest located in the Old Paths. As callsign \"Harrier One\" he contacted General Thelonia Redrish, callsign \"Peregrine\" and informed her that the Hawk's Nest was compromised after an Imperial attack, to which Redrish replied that more were on the way and ordered to destroy the base and all evidence in the \"Operation Cave-in.\" However, as the commandos were setting charges, they were ambushed by a bounty hunter before they were ready for detonation. Deulo and his men were all killed in the resulting firefight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Colonel Deulo appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during a Bounty Hunter class mission on Voss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
