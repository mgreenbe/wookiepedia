Circa 1 ABY, the N.S.H. was negotiating its integration into the Imperial Military. However, the negotiations were disturbed when Leeta sliced the personal computer of Galiir Ac Yandar, the N.S.H. commander, and planted information that almost ruined his reputation with the Empire. By slicing Galiir's computer, Leeta planted incriminating evidence, which made it seem as though Galiir was putting the Empire in a bad light. Unfortunately for Poandeu, Galiir was cleared of any wrongdoings, but wanted revenge against the person who had sliced his computer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galiir discussed his plight with a spacer who was working for Imperial Colonel Braedic Ekirk. He informed the spacer that he was certain the slicer was a member of the A.C.L.O. He did not, however, know which member was responsible for the slicing. Galiir sent the spacer to the A.C.L.O office. The spacer was tasked with finding out more information, so that the culprit could be determined. After killing a number of A.C.L.O members, the spacer discovered a datapad which indicated that Leeta Poandeu was the slicer. The spacer went to the second floor of the office, and entered the central computer control room. Immediately, the spacer began attacking Leeta, who in turn fired back. However, it was no use.
