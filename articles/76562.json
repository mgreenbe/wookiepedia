During the war, his ship attacked several Venator-class Star Destroyers and gained infamy within the Republic government. The Jedi Order sent a strike team to infiltrate the battleship and destroy it, but the Admiral anticipated their actions and prepared a trap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vessel that was infiltrated was a fake and was meant to fly into a star after being jettisoned by the Admiral and his skeleton crew, taking the on-board Jedi with it. This plot was foiled, as the Admiral ordered the real Starcrusher to come pick himself and his skeleton crew up from their escape pods. The decoy was magnetized by Obi-Wan Kenobi, drawing in the real ship. The two vessels then plunged into the star, killing all the Separatist crew, including Kirst."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
