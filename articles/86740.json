At the last moment, the ship(s) would angle their hulls against the enemy's attack vector, protecting its fighter groups as they sortie. These fighters would then form up and, concealed by the hull of the ship, conduct a flanking maneuver to attack the enemy ships; if the enemy commander is unaware of the maneuver, his fighters and point defenses would be unable to respond in time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was a simple maneuver that was obvious to spot, but when properly executed, it had a highly unstructured attack profile. As a result, most experienced opponents would not fall for it, though species with a psychological blind spot for unorthodox tactics, such as the Elomin or simple-minded OOM command battle droids, would. In the case of the former, the Elomin forces retreated, exposing themselves to complete destruction. In the case of the latter, the droids pressed their ineffectual assault, pinning themselves between the hull of the ship and the flanking fighters, which attacked from all sides."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Ryloth, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano suggested the use of the maneuver against Separatist battle droids that had been abandoned by their Neimoidian commanding officer.
