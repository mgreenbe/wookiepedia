The Separatists possessed many battle droids that they used to defend their side of the ring. The Republic came close to taking the ring, attempting to finish off the droids stationed only a few feet away from the Separatist control center. This current battle ended with a forced retreat from the location by Republic forces the clone trooper known as \"Tup\" intentionally betrayed and killed Jedi General Tiplar in a trance-like state. Soon after with their momentum broken, Skywalker ordered a retreat when Droidekas backed by super battle droid rocket troopers held the line against Republic forces, pushing them back, with Separatist Admiral Trench also reporting the odd nature of the event to Separatist Head of State Count Dooku, and Dooku then reported it to his Sith Master Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Republic Fleet maintained a blockade of the planet. Shortly after Tup killed Tiplar he was to be transported back to Kamino, as the Republic wanted to know the reason why he had killed the Jedi General, as they could find nothing in their examination of him. The starships were ambushed before they could jump to hyperspace, and the droids killed all the clones save for Tup, whom they transported back to the space station. Skywalker and two clones, Clone Captain Rex and ARC trooper Fives, then rescued the clone from a Maxillipede shuttle as it left the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic sent Tup on another ship to Kamino, this time succeeding and being able to find out that a brain tumor, actually an inhibitor chip, was present in Tup's head. After this discovery, the clone trooper \"Fives\" removed a similar chip from his own head, but it was not degraded like Tups had been. Seeming to have gone insane he tried to tell the Jedi that every clone had the chips, which, in extension, programmed them with Contingency Orders for the Grand Army of the Republic: Order Initiation, Orders 1 Through 150, including Order 66 and Operation: Knightfall. But, in the process of trying to get them to listen to his case he went too far and was shot and killed by clone trooper commander Fox."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
