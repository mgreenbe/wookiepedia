Both Briila and Shalk were there for the awakening of Sintas Vel where Briila would asked for possession of Sintas' items and equipment under the circumstances that she was dead. However, their father merely took Sintas' belongings away in denial to this request. When Briila looked upon Sintas, she didn't believe it was possible for the Mandalore Boba Fett to be married to her because Sintas appeared to be far younger than Boba. During Jaina Solo's training under Boba, Briila would meet Jaina while holding a hold-out blaster like an adult."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
