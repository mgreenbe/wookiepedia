Larger in scale than the E-5 blaster, it required a tripod mount, and like other repeating weapons, fired rapid successive bursts. It was maneuvered by two handles, one for each barrel, and could be fired by a single operator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Ryloth, two J-10 dual blaster cannons were housed inside bunkers guarding the entrance to the city of Nabat. They were very successful holding the forces of Ghost Company at bay until Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi used the Force to levitate one droid popper into each bunker, disabling all the B1-Series battle droids located within. These weapons were also used by Geonosian insurgents during the Second Battle of Geonosis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
