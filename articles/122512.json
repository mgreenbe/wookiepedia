When the Havoc Squad defected to the reconstituted Sith Empire, they summoned its only remaining member for questioning. They asked about why the members would defect and let slip that it could be related to something Republic did on Ando Prime. They then let the new Havoc Squad go, though Senator Krasul was later kidnapped by one of the defectors soon after."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
