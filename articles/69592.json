Using an airborne chemical, jaw plants lured their prey to step onto their broad traps, which would then quickly snap closed around the creature and begin digesting it. Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis encountered jaw plants during his mission to rebuild the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The carnivorous jaw plants grew in the dark, moist Shadowlands of Kashyyyk, where they consumed unfortunate animals. Jaw plants possessed broad veiny traps that grew horizontally in relation to the ground on rigid stalks. These traps emitted an airborne chemical which stimulated the olfactory receptors of hungry animals, luring them with the false promise of food. The scent generated by the plant was likened by the human Cal Kestis to that of jogan fruit. Once a creature stepped onto a trap, the jaws would quickly close around it and begin digestion, devouring its prey whole. A captive capable of wielding a lightsaber, however, could easily use it to escape a jaw plant's clutches."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis's secret mission to rebuild the Jedi Order, he and the droid BD-1 encountered jaw plants while undergoing their expedition to the top of the Origin Tree on Kashyyyk. During their journey, Kestis made use of the plants' traps as platforms from which to jump, leaping between them with enough speed to avoid entrapment. Should he get caught in one, he could carve his way out with his lightsaber. Upon BD-1's scan of a deceased jaw plant, Kestis commented on the intriguing nature of the species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jaw plants first appeared in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
