The Catacombs were once an ancient monastery, and were located a half-day's walk from the Holy City. Once used to store the skeletal remains of the dead by an ancient and forgotten civilization, the site had a reputation for being haunted by spirits of the departed and was generally avoided by the locals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, the Catacombs were inhabited by the Church of the Contained Crescent. While inhabiting the ancient monastery, they added a latticed window. The Contained Crescent eventually left the Catacombs years prior to Saw Gerrera and his Partisans, who repurposed the Catacombs into a base which he named \"the Gut.\" It was destroyed when the Death Star tested its laser on Jedha's Holy City, which not only wiped the city off the map but also caused the surrounding surface of Jedha to peel off and destroy anything in its path, including the Catacombs themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
