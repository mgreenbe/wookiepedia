All the line troops of the GAR used this structure, although in the elite Special Operations Brigade, the term battalion was used for the units known on the order of battle as Commando Groups, directly subordinate to brigade command, and each consisting of 500 men in five companies. At least some non-clone troops among the Republic's forces were also organized into battalions, such as the engineering battalion commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Kreen on Praesitlyn, while logistics battalions were units involved with the GAR's supply chain, although it is not entirely clear whether these last were clone troops or not."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Army"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Imperial Army, a typical battalion was still commanded by a Major, and still consisted of four companies\u2014likewise, four battalions still formed a regiment\u2014but a number of different types of battalion had developed for specialist roles.

In rare circumstances, senior commanders were recorded improvising fighting forces out of their battalions' security troops, but regardless the security platoon's troopers were not counted as part of the battalion's Order of Battle (OB). Including the security platoon, the number of human personnel in the battalion HQ was 90, supplemented by a standard contingent of 145 droids, of which a hundred or more were usually MSE-6-series repair droids; the rest varied according to availability in the local sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A battalion was considered the smallest unit suitable for surface operations and in most cases could fit on a single Imperial landing barge.

However, there are also references to a three-company garrison deployment of 540 men, implying larger company units of 180 men. With nearly 90% of the front-line manpower of a line battalion, and just four men less than a special missions battalion, the nearest rival to a stormtrooper unit in the Army, it is possible that these three-company units reflected a command structure different from the typical four-company battalion used in the Army.
