Jaster's men served as mercenaries and warriors for hire, but their primary goal was to hunt the Death Watch. During the Mandalorian Civil War, the Supercommandos loyal to Mereel's True Mandalorian faction were eliminated to the last man at the Battle of Galidraan in the year 44 BBY. Following the war, many Supercommandos traveled throughout the galaxy as mercenaries. Decades later, during the Clone Wars, Mandalore the Resurrector and Fenn Shysa trained a battalion of Supercommandos that raided Republic holdings as Separatist mercenaries. By the end of the war, a large number of Supercommandos including those of the Mandalorian Protectors, had been killed in action. It is unknown if Shysa's later incarnation of the Mandalorian Protectors used the term Supercommando. By the time of the Second Galactic Civil War in 40 ABY, Mandalore Boba Fett had a total of one hundred Supercommandos to call on including Fett's granddaughter Mirta Gev, her fianc\u00e9 Ghes Orade, Orade's adoptive father Novoc Vevut, Baltan Carid, Ram Zerimar, and Goran Beviin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Second Battle of Fondor, Fett led a group of fifty Supercommandos allied with Admiral Natasi Daala aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Bloodfin to retake the ship from forces loyal to the Moffs attempting to join forces with Darth Caedus.
