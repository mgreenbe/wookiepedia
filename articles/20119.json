It was attacked by the Lialic II commanded by Rolf Treidum, masquerading as a New Republic ship. The Bravado III was running with a skeleton crew, not including any troops, and only forty survived the attack. The modified New Republic corvette FarStar offered assistance, but Captain Udine assumed they were hostile due to the Imperial ruse. Udine sent a coded message to her forces, and FarStar was intercepted by Juno II, Mirandine, Quillion, Siroma, Solidarity, and Triumph, which were all similar Marauder-class ships. The Kathol Republic ships escorted the FarStar to Dayark and impounded it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
