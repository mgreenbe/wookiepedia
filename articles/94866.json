When she was old enough, Naeshahn was selected as a Padawan by a Jedi Master and she began one-on-one training that would last for over a decade before taking and passing her Trials of Knighthood and ascending to the rank of Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Accepting missions and assignments from the Jedi High Council, Naeshahn was an active Jedi in the decade before the reemergence of the Sith. While she would never learn of the Sith's machinations, she would suffer the ripple effects of the dark sider's manipulation of events. After taking on young Ebor Taulk as her Padawan, the pair was dispatched by Master of the Order Mace Windu to investigate the disturbance in the Yinchorri system. Upon their arrival, the Sith-incited violence on Yinchorr overwhelmed Naeshahn and Padawan Taulk and they were killed by the war-like Yinchorri. At the behest of Darth Sidious, the architect of the uprising, Sate Pestage and Kinman Doriana arranged for the bodies of the Jedi to be shipped to the Presidential Tower of the Senate Building on Coruscant. Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum then contacted the High Council in hopes that they would send a larger strike force to deal with the Yinchorri Uprising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
