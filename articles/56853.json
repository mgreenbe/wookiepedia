It was located on a bridge city on Cato Neimoidia. Following Dod's death during the Clone Wars, the palace was turned into a vault where individuals from all sectors across the galaxy kept some of their most precious possessions for safekeeping.

When Amidala was shown her quarters, Clovis was taken to the palace's library by Dod. There, they discussed with Archduke Poggle the Lesser about the Banking Clan's investment in Count Dooku 's new droid foundry and the benefits it would bring. However, Dod and Poggle demanded a greater share of the foundry's profits in their greed. When Clovis refused, the other two resolved to poisoning Amidala to coerce the banker to acquiesce to their demands. With the help of a disguised Anakin Skywalker, Clovis confronted Dod and obtained the antidote, though he was still left behind to talk with the Neimoidian, as a squad of B1-series battle droids trained their blasters on him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cold war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dod later died during the war, and by 34 ABY, his palace was in the possession of Baron Paw Maccon of House Maccon.
