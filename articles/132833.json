After Secura shows the Jedi to his room, he receives a communiqu\u00e9 from Coruscant, and a mysterious patron commands Secura to kill Vos. During a conversation with his fellow Kiffar, Quin receives a transmission from Villie, asking him to meet him in the Rock Gardens. Upon arriving, Quin is attacked by Holmar Grahrk, who is killed in a betrayal by his cousin. As it turns out, Villie has placed another bet on Quin's survival, using his cousin as a pawn. Continuing his search for Aayla, Quin heads into an \"abandoned\" ryll mine, accompanied by Grahrk. Unexpectedly, they are attacked by energy spiders, imported from Kessel to assist in the creation of glitteryll. As the spiders overwhelm them, Quin is shot in the back by Asant\u00e9 Vos.
