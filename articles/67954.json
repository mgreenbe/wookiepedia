In 5 ABY, Itina flew a V-wing under the callsign Wild Eight during the hunt for the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, in which she participated in a skirmish in the G'Tep'Noi system, and later a battle at Chadawa to prevent Operation: Cinder and the genocide of the inhabitants on the planet Chadawa. Itina later participated in the Battle of Jakku, in which Captain Nath Tensent took over command of the Deliverance's starfighter wing following Wyl Lark's refusal to take another life. Her role, along with that of the other members of Wild and Flare Squadron, was to protect the remaining Y-wing bombers of Hail Squadron and Chass na Chadic's A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter, in their attack on the 204th's flagship Yadeez. After the bombers completed their job of disabling the bulk freighter, Tensent reported damage to his ship and had to retreat for repairs. Tensent passed command of the remaining fighters to Itina, because he consider her one of the old-time rebels from back when winning hadn't been inevitable, and gave his last order to aid a nearby Starhawk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Itina first appeared in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
