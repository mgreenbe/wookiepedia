The ship was controlled from a repurposed B-wing Mark II cockpit module that was locked in place and restructured to allow for a docking hatch. The B-wing's life-support systems and portside deflector shield projectors were relocated to within the adjacent cowling, which reduced cockpit visibility and forced the pilot to use holographic visual displays and a sensor suite. Engine pods were taken from Republic-era Montura-class shuttles, as they were sturdy and reliable. Faster-than-light travel was allowed thanks to two Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems S/min-12a hyperdrive, a miniaturized model engineered on the First Order designs. Passengers traveled inside two modular compartments found aboard freighters and cut-price starliners. These compartments were connected and encased with a shell of surplus hull plating. Cockpit was linked to passenger area thanks to a tunnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although it was usually escorted by starfighters, the transport could defend itself. The standard armament consisted in a Gyrhil R-9X laser cannon, but sometimes other weapons were added: an ion cannon, a proton torpedo launcher and two autoblasters beneath the cockpit. In the standard version a precision targeting laser helped the pilot. Cockpit and weapons pod were protected by deflector shield generators salvaged from B-wings, while their overlapping fields shielded passenger compartments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Passengers in the compartments, both troops and commanders, shared space with gear lockers and astromech droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The transports were used by the Resistance in its conflict against the First Order. Their use was to deploy troops on ground, after being escorted by fighter to reach the surface. One such craft transported General Leia Organa and her entourage to Takodana when the Resistance rescued Han Solo, Chewbacca, Finn and the droid BB-8 from temporary captivity. The transport was piloted by Cova Nell and reached the ground only when First Order forces led by Kylo Ren had been already put to flight, and General Organa could speak with Han Solo after the end of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The transports appear in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.
