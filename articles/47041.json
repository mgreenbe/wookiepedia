They stood at a height of about 2 meters and were 4 meters in length, and they were covered in green, scaly plates. They also had wide, armored heads and long, sticky-tipped tongues, which they used to catch their prey. Farleks were fairly common on a number of worlds, but albino Farleks were considered to be rare, and the renowned Equat epic-poem Hunting Telik the White told the story of a quest to hunt one such elusive creature. During the Galactic Civil War, the wealthy, Torina-based businessman Pelleo Thog purchased an albino Farlek from the Ithorian pet shop owner Eeksa, and Eeksa hired a group of Rebel Alliance agents to transport the creature to Thog's estate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
