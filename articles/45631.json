Etnam's Star Destroyer was in a task force that also included the Interrogator, and Etnam reported directly to Inquisitor Antinnis Tremayne. Brandl was brought to the bridge to be personally interviewed. Etnam drastically changed his mind about Brandl after this encounter, likely the result of a mind trick performed by Brandl. Etnam allowed Brandl to roam the Star Destroyer unsupervised."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
