LE-4DO was built in memory of C-3PO, Anakin's droid on Tatooine, and was programmed to assist the Padawan with his chores. The droid was cobbled together with parts scavenged from Coruscant's undercity, and he was continually being adjusted and tweaked. LE-4DO wasn't very smart, but his usefulness led Anakin to create several more droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
