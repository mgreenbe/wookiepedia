During the recovery operations surrounding Mount Tantiss on the planet Wayland following the assault on Mount Tantiss, New Republic archaeologists believed they had found the Duinarbulon Stones. Lead archaeologist Garv Debble was excited at the prospect as the discovery of the Stones would be the first proof that the Star Lancers were, indeed, real.

A Star Lancer was armored with a gloss-black coat of ionic mail made from kiirium ceramic, designed to reflect laserfire back on to the enemy. The death's head emblem of Xim's empire was embroidered on the coat. The Star Lancers were mounted atop Galdrian mustangs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lancers were armed with a Duinarbulon-made lance, with a handgrip made from Raxan seaweed and a reflective vamplate to protect the hand, also made of kiirium. The point was poisoned with malkite themfar. The Star Lancers were additionally armed with beam-tubes, distant ancestors of the blaster. Beam-tubes were bulky and slow to fire, with contemporary power packs offering only one hundred shots, so beam-tubers alternated fire by squad and carried large power generators on hoversleds. Nevertheless, they were much safer to carry and required less maintenance than the heatbeams and plasma cannons carried by the rest of Xim's military."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
