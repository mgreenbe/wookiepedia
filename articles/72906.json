His arms were equipped with flamethrowers to scorch the droids he battled for the amusement of his owners. He was tasked with fighting C-3PO and R2-D2 in an arena in the pirates' ship shortly after the two droids were captured on Balnab. But before he could attack the protocol droid, Separatists blasted a hole in the hull of the ship, sucking K0-5D, the pirates, 3PO, R2-D2, and a few other droids into space to be captured by Grievous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
