During the Galactic Civil War, Shashay astrogators memorized the coordinates and entered them manually, whenever they brought a ship to their world. Between the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Hoth, Rebels contacted the Shashay to establish a secret base on their homeworld, where it would be hidden from the Imperial Survey Corps. While the Shashay were sympathetic towards the Rebels, they refused at first."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Braig Farool, planetary governor of Narg and head of TransGalMeg Industries, Incorporated in the Rayter sector, learned two facts: that the Rebels had approached the Shashay about establishing a base on their homeworld, and that the Rebels had a spy in the entourage of the famous Shashay entertainer Crying Dawn Singer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The operation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Farool enlisted the help of his brother and aide to Moff Nile Owen, Nak Farool, and the pirate Yearo Seville. He had planned to have Seville abduct Crying Dawn Singer and blame the Rebels, thus destroying any possibilities of cooperation between the two factions. Nak Farool approached Moff Nile Owen with the plan and let him play the hero and \"rescue\" Crying Dawn Singer to gain the loyalty of the Shashay for the Empire. However, the Farool brothers planed to discredit him on the way and force him to resign, so they could take over the sector themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seville and his pirate gang ambushed Crying Dawn Singer at the Sector Performing Arts Center and abducted him and his entourage to Najarka.

The Rebels also picked up a broadcast message by Seville to the galaxy, where he claimed to be a Rebel and demanded control of the Shashay homeworld be handed over to the Rebellion.
