Each chip allowed for up to eight standard hours worth of recording from the PUT. Any sounds that were picked up by the PUT were recorded on these specialized chips. The range of recorded sounds was well into both the ultrasonic and subsonic ranges to allow accurate recordings from nonhumanoid species. The chips could not be overwritten or modified, and so each chip was only usable once."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Memory chips could also be used to enhance the memory capacity of droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
