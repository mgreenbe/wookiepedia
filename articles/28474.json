The colo had a flat eel-like body, a bio-luminescent tail, a crocodile-like head, a row of sharp teeth, and a set of mandibles. They had a set of venomous fangs that they used to stun their prey. Their digestive system worked slowly, so they were at risk of being consumed from the inside out if they didn't kill their prey before eating it. A pair of large claws were located just behind the fish's head and were used to force food into the creature's large mouth. The bioluminescent skin of the colo claw fish lured in prey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While trying to reach Theed during the Invasion of Naboo, Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Jar Jar Binks were attacked by a colo fish.
