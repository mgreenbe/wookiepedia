In 5 BBY, KesselRunner commented on the TTS-15 Series Tutorial Droid entry, passing on a rumor that Industrial Automaton were developing a version for sale rather than the current version which operated under a leasing model. In 3 BBY, KesselRunner replied to Andor Javin's claim that the Empire did not officially use IT-O Interrogator droids. KesselRunner refuted Javin's assertion, related a personal experience where Imperial officials sanctioned the use of an IT-O to interrogate them before shipping the smuggler to Kessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 ABY, KesselRunner commented on the entry for the MK 8001 Attendant Droid, noting that individuals could make a lot of credits selling the units to wealthy families. The trick was finding a source to buy them from that wouldn't cost a lot of money. KesselRunner later left a note on the entry for the RM-2020 espionage droid, passing on information that Churhee's Riflemen were in the market for the droids. Several months later, KesselRunner warned his fellow smugglers from conducting illegal activities around IN-4 information droids. Since the droids were being regularly used for espionage by the Alliance, the droids were often under surveillance by COMPNOR. Commenting on the entry for the C4LR litigation droid, KesselRunner wondered if the droid's mermory capacity could be adapted to other systems, such using their brains to upgrade navigation computers and damage control systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 ABY, KesselRunner commented on the entry for the V6-series pilot droid stating that they could not imagine letting a droid pilot their ship. While KesselRunner did see use for them in moving cargo over short distances, or moving ships in parking orbits, the smuggler was incredulous that both the Empire and the Alliance continued to use the droids in the middle of a war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
