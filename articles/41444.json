Though the station was unarmed, it was well defended, with shields as strong as an Imperial Strike Cruiser's. It was also guarded by an IPV/1 system patrol craft, the aptly named Bouncer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dunari's was frequented by spacers seeking refreshment, and the bar issued chits which were valid in exchange for drinks at the station. The drink chit was embossed with an image of a bottle identical to Zairona Ale, perhaps subtly advertising the availability of illegal substances at the station. In one incident shortly after the Battle of Hoth, Emon Azzameen gave his brother Ace one of these chits after the pair were asked to leave the station for attacking the Viraxo-allied starship Enkidu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance employed Dunari to assist in procuring much-needed supplies.
