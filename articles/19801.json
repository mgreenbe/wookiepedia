The weapons dealer Orion Ferret wore a bow-tie as part of his formal wear. In addition, the Star Tours F-series droid known as F-25-OJSx wore a red ornament on the front that was similar in design to a bow-tie. The bow-tie also acted as the partial namesake for the Galactic Empire's TIE Series of starfighters, as the various models in the line, in particular the mainstay fighter line known as the TIE/LN starfighter, bore a design that resembled the piece of clothing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Star Wars creator George Lucas, he coined the term TIE Fighter due to their designs reminding him of bowties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
