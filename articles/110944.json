Shortly after the formation of the Remnant, new Head of State Gilad Pellaeon struck at Orinda as a show of force, hoping to demonstrate to the New Republic that the Empire was very much alive. He first took the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Reaper to Borosk to recruit Turr Phennir and the 181st Imperial Fighter Group, and Pellaeon and Phennir subsequently captured Orinda and six systems coreward along the Entralla Route. Emissaries to the New Republic asking them for the Remnant's new borders to be respected were shunned, and the Orinda campaign was launched."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
