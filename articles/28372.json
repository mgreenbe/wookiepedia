She was a Rebel mole inside the Arrth-Eno Prison Complex and joined fellow spy Eneb Ray in a plot to kill Darth Sidious, the ruler of the Galactic Empire. The plot failed and Coleet, along with every Rebel spy on Coruscant except for Ray, was killed when the Empire destroyed Arrth-Eno to kill the spies, kill a group of senators who were being held prisoner, and score a propaganda victory against the Rebellion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
