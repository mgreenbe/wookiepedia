As a consequence, the last survivor, Darth Bane, established the Rule of Two, which restructured the sect so that there could only be two Sith at a time, a master and an apprentice. In the last decades of the Galactic Republic, the Sith Master Darth Plagueis tutored an apprentice in the ways of the Sith. After betraying and murdering Plagueis, Darth Sidious subsequently  took over his master's role as the Sith master, and managed to reach the highest echelons of democractic power before anointing himself Galactic Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Tyranus trained Asajj Ventress as his apprentice during the Clone Wars, though he was still apprenticed to Darth Sidious. As Ventress grew in power, Sidious grew suspicious of Tyranus' intentions. He ordered his apprentice to kill the Nightsister assassin, and Tyranus complied despite regarding Ventress as his most reliable asset. Tyranus then sought to replace Ventress with Savage Opress, intending to overthrow his Sith Master after training the Dathomirian Nightbrother in the ways of the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious eventually betrayed Tyranus by ordering Anakin Skywalker to kill him. Tyranus was then replaced by Skywalker, who pledged fealty to his new Sith Master as Darth Vader. Like his predecessor, Vader was an apprentice who mentored Force-sensitive students despite not holding the rank of Sith Master. His apprentices belonged to a cadre of fallen Jedi-turned-Jedi hunters known as the Inquisitorius. Sidious eventually sought to betray and replace Vader, by becoming the Sith Master of his apprentice's son, Luke Skywalker. However, he was killed by a redeemed Vader, after Luke pledged himself as a Jedi like his father before him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kylo Ren, the grandson of Vader, was lured to the dark side through the machinations of a revived Sidious and his creation, Supreme Leader Snoke. Although Snoke directly oversaw Ren's training, Sidious considered himself to be Ren's true master. By using Snoke as a proxy mentor for Ren, Sidious managed to circumvent a dark side tradition in which the apprentice completed his training by killing the master who trained him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
