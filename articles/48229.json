Alongside an army of Sith troopers, the Final Order was the culmination of an agenda over a thousand years and a conspiracy decades in the making. With each Star Destroyer armed with an axial superlaser capable of destroying entire worlds, the Final Order's objective was to bring the galaxy under the perpetual reign of a new Sith Empire through military force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Resistance fought against the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire in all but name, adherents to the Sith religion, the Sith Eternal, labored to create the largest armada in galactic history.

The Derriphan, one of the many Star Destroyers comprising the Final Order, demonstrated its power to the galaxy by destroying the planet Kijimi. In order to prevent Sidious from realizing his goal of establishing a new Sith Empire, the Resistance fleet deployed to the Unknown Regions in a last-ditch effort to prevent the launching of the Final Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, the Battle of Exegol was a decisive defeat for Sidious and his followers, with the Final Order utterly destroyed by the Resistance and a citizens' fleet.

It was composed of 1,080 Xyston-class Star Destroyers, with the overall design of warships being based upon the that of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyers utilized by the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire. The Final Order also possessed AAL-2100/9.5 atmospheric assault landers and TIE/dg starfighters. However, Xyston-class Star Destroyers were larger, had red accents along the hull of their vessels, and were equipped with a large axial superlaser capable of destroying planets, which took the place of a standard Imperial-class Star Destroyer's main hangar space. These Star Destroyers housed TIE/dg starfighters, with triangular wings and red accents, which were capable of ship-to-ship combat, and Sith troopers, including their variant Sith Jetpack Troopers, which were deployed via AAL-2100/9.5 atmospheric assault landers and divided into traditional Sith legions, each of which being named after deceased Sith Lords, and were comprised of five-thousand soldiers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Consisting of various ranks including Petty officers, lieutenants, and captains, the Final Order was staffed by Fleet technicians and Sith Eternal officers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Emerging from the shadows"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Final Order, also known as the Sith Empire, was created by Sith cultists as part of the Contingency of Darth Sidious\u2014Dark Lord of the Sith and Galactic Emperor\u2014who aimed to establish an eternal Sith rule across the galaxy. With the First Order rising to power under Darth Vader's grandson, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren, the Emperor announced his threat of revenge throughout the galaxy, prompting Ren to seek out Sidious in 35 ABY. Using a Sith wayfinder that once belonged to his grandfather, Ren discovered the legendary world of Exegol where Sidious and the Sith Eternal were located. He discovered many secrets within the Sith lair, such as the origins of his predecessor, Supreme Leader Snoke, as well as Sidious' rebirth in a cloned body and the secret heritage of the Jedi apprentice Rey. In addition to these revelations, Ren learned that he was the heir to the new Sith Empire envisioned by the cultists and their master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Snoke had fulfilled his purpose by dying at his apprentice's hand, the Sith Eternal having created the former Supreme Leader to ensure that Ren became a worthy successor to the Sith legacy.

Allegiant General Enric Pryde, from his Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast, pledged his loyalty to the Emperor he once served. With the support of Pryde, Sidious determined that the time had come to launch the Final Order from Exegol. Although the First Order and the Sith Eternal were both offshoots of the Emperor's Contingency, pragmatic First Order officers found it difficult to work alongside the fanatic Sith Eternal cultists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Acting on the Emperor's orders, General Pryde deployed a Xyston-class Star Destroyer, the Derriphan, from Exegol to destroy a planet close to the Resistance with its axial superlaser as a show of force. The target that they chose was Kijimi, and the capital ship's superlaser sent down a red laser beam to strike the surface, using red bolts of energy to hit the planet. Massive shockwaves erupted across Kijimi, and eventually, the laser beam broke through the core of the world and ripped it apart. The destruction of Kijimi was broadcast across the galaxy by the Sith Eternal, who proclaimed that the Resistance was finished and the Sith flame will burn and demanded for every world to surrender."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Downfall"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fleet, its warships too numerous for a simultaneous exit from Exegol without a guiding navigational beacon, relied on a navigation signal to operate their initial launch from the Sith world.

It was confronted by a small force of the Resistance fleet, led by General Poe Dameron and General Finn.
