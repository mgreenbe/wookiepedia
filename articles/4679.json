Also within the Maelstrom was the Maw Cluster, as well as massive creatures known as summa-verminoth. The Kessel Run was a charted route through the Maelstrom, which was in close proximity to the planet Oba Diah, the base of operations for the Pyke Syndicate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo: A Star Wars Story screenwriter Jon Kasdan has stated that the idea of the Akkadese Maelstrom was present since the film's first script draft. In Kasdan's words, the film's crew wanted a Jules Verne flavor and that they loved the idea of what might look like a storm in space.
