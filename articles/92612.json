Following the arrival of the Dark Jedi Exiles, Dark Lord of the Sith Sorzus Syn led an expedition across the planet to sites of interest to learn what she could of Sith culture. At the pyre she discovered the Altar concealed behind a mural of King Adas; within the altar was hidden a set of cursed scrolls and the headless corpse of Wyrmuk the Undying.
