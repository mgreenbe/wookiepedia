The ceiling of the bar was constantly hidden in a layer of foul smoke and only a single illumination ball hung from it to light the entire bar. Aliens of all shapes and sizes could always be found lounging in the semi-darkness. Ex-Imperial Admiral Joser arranged to meet up with a group of Rebels in this bar so that he could defect but was captured before he could do so. When the group arrived and started asking questions as to his whereabouts, they were overheard by an Imperial Gamorrean spy who then attempted to flee the bar on a swoop parked outside. Two members of the group immediately stole another two swoops to chase him while the rest of the group were stuck dealing with the owners of the stolen swoops in a brawl."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
