When the amnesiac former Dark Lord of the Sith Revan along with Carth Onasi attempted to visit the Hidden Beks' base while searching for Jedi Knight Bastila Shan, she at first barred them passage. After Revan suggested that he help the Beks in their war, the guard admitted the pair, advising them to watch out for Zaerdra, the bodyguard of Bek leader Gadon Thek, and to not make any wrong moves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Bastila was rescued at the Tarisian Season Opener, the guard warned Revan that the Black Vulkars would be looking for him so they could avenge the death of their leader, Brejik."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of the gang war, she became suspicious of most strangers, and immediately thought that Revan was a Vulkar spy when he approached her, wishing to see Thek. However, she relented when Revan offered to lend his support to the Beks' cause.

Before the player can enter the Tarisian Season Opener for the Vulkars, the dark-side player must then infiltrate the Bek Base and kill Gadon. After leaving the Bek base, the lookout will then attack the player."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She has a line where she recognizes the player as the winner of the swoop race, and if they raced for the Vulkars, she will declare intent of revenge and then attack. As this dialogue can only be initiated when she is non-hostile, and working for Kandon turns her hostile before the race occurs, this can only be seen by using glitches. After racing for the Hidden Beks and rescuing Bastila, you can still go kill Gadon. A Security skill of 91+ can open the \"Impossible\" locked doors that lead to Gadon where he will turn hostile. After killing him and exiting the base, you can hear this line from the lookout, despite the player never having raced for the Vulkars. However, she still remains invincible when glitching her this way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
