Governed by a tribe Mother, the tribe lived in peace under the guidance of Mother Kimania. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Wyrd-governed Zhadorii irstat attacked the Rinajaa and executed several villages in a show of force. When Mother Kimania begged for peace, a Wyrd sister used the Force to murder the woman and deemed the village under control of the Wyrd. Sometime after the village's occupation a band of mercenaries and freedom fighters known as the Heroes of Cularin led the Cularin Militia into the jungles of the world in search of the Wyrd sisters. Together the Heroes were able to topple the Wyrd sisters' control over the irstat and further diminish the groups' numbers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterward the fighting ended, the survivors placed all the dead inside the huts of the village and then set fire to them in order to cleanse the place of spirits.
