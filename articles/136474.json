In the aftermath of his failed campaign against the New Republic, Cronal fully embraced mechu-deru, a Sith power that allowed him to manipulate mechanical structures through the Force. In doing so, the Dark Side Adept combined mechu-deru with Sith alchemy, forming his own method of creation which he dubbed the Stygian Art.
