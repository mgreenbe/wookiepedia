They were the first Adumari unit to challenge Wedge Antilles' Red Flight in an honor duel, using only simulated lasers and pigment-filled missiles. The pilots learned several lessons from Wedge's Red Flight following the action. Several days later, Strike the Moons helped Red Flight escape from Cartann by firing upon Lords of Dismay Flightknife, justifying their action as refusing to allow \"some honor-grubber\" stop Wedge. They presumably flew under Cartann's colors during the following engagement; their captain, ke Mattino, was shot down and killed during that time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
