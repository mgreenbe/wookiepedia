In the year 4 ABY, Luke Skywalker, a member of the Rebel Alliance, arrived and intervened in their planetary affairs, helping Mary and her local resistance defeat the King.

Unfortunately, the Empire, having received word of the successful uprising from the traitorous Raggold, arrived on Solay to retake control. Mary was killed in the initial firefight, causing Luke to tread dangerously close to the dark side.

The group was led by the rebel, Raggold, who had fought the Solay government for fifty years. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Empire was supporting King Blackart and his government against the rebels. However, following the Battle of Endor, and the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, the Imperial support for King Blackart was weakened. Seizing their opportunity, the Solay rebels planned a decisive strike on Blackart's throne room, hoping to kidnap the tyrant and end the long civil war. At the dawn of their attack, the Solay rebels were joined by Luke Skywalker, an emissary from the Rebel Alliance, who had defeated the Empire at Endor. Skywalker agreed to join the assault after meeting with Mary and Raggold. With Skywalker leading them, the Solay rebels easily defeated the Solay Royal Guard and stormed the throne room, capturing Blackart."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, at the moment of their victory, Raggold was struck by a single blaster bolt from an unknown source. The Rebel leader collapsed in the throne room, fatally wounded, and Mary rushed to her leader, cradling his body. As Raggold spoke his last words, he told both Mary and Skywalker that the person who had killed him was a traitor within their own ranks. Mary was devastated by Raggold's death, but when Skywalker wanted to search out the traitor, she vehemently disagreed. Mary told the young man that further violence would not honor Raggold's memory and she asked him to put aside his desire for revenge. Skywalker agreed to Mary's request and he helped her carry Raggold's dead body to King Blackart's throne, laying the dead rebel at the throne that he had long fought for."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Solay leader"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The victorious Solay rebels chained King Blackart up and stripped him of his crown. Although Skywalker wanted to interrogate Blackart about the death of Raggold, Mary demanded no further fighting, declaring to the rebels that Solay would now be ruled by the many and not by the few. Skywalker's desire for action was temporarily stifled by Mary's words, and he agreed to join in a celebration of their victory. As Mary and Skywalker walked among the Solay rebels, Mary stated her desire to use the planet's newfound freedom to restart the arts and allow the inhabitants the freedom to do and think whatever they wanted. However, Skywalker was not as optimistic as Mary, telling the young woman that they had a lot of work to do to make sure that Solay remained free. As Skywalker told Mary of plans to start a new government and root out the last remnants of King Blackart's rule, Mary stopped him, telling the rebel that those plans could wait, and they should be allowed to celebrate. Skywalker, enraptured by Mary's beauty and impressed by her bravery, agreed.

Despite Skywalker's protests, Mary convinced him to leave the party and get away from the other rebels for a few hours.

Mary collapsed to the street, mortally wounded as the fleeing crowd trampled her injured body. Skywalker was forced to watch as wild looters pulled jewelry from Mary's fallen body, tearing at her neck and arms. Using the Force, Skywalker yelled at the crowd to get away from her, and he telekinetically lifted her body to him.

As a young man, Raggold had allied himself with the Empire to depose Blackart so that the Empire could take direct control over Solay. Upon his victory, he had committed suicide, wracked with guilt over the cost of his success, and knowing that the Empire would soon arrive to quash his rebellion. Skywalker was shocked by the revelation, realizing that in trying to track down the traitor that had caused Mary's death, he had trod dangerously close to the dark side.
