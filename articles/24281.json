Impressed by their dedication, Cattena's captain allowed the two to join the unit as \"honorary stormtroopers\". Though controversial, this decision went unchallenged. Cattena Squadron served in the Battle of Kalaan in 0 ABY. During that battle, one of the squadron's sergeants was killed and Brenn Tantor took command of his unit. Brenn's performance in that role drew the attention of Captain Beri Tulon, who recruited Brenn for the BHCI project, taking Dellis, who had been wounded in the battle, with him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
