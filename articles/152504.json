While Gorneesh waited below, the scout and Umwak climbed a vine to the platforms of the village and sneaked into the hut of Logray, the Ewok medicine man. There they sought to steal the Ewok soap that acted as an insect repellant. Instead, they inadvertently stole shadowroot soap, a soap that made those who used it invisible. The effect prompted King Gorneesh to later lead a full-force Dulok raid on Bright Tree Village; his invisible Dulok warriors attempted to steal Ewok goods and frighten the Ewoks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
