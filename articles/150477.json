With sizes ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 meters long, the lizards had four clawed legs, and a long tail. They emerged only during twilight hours, seeking out small bugs to eat, and retained virtually their entire weight in liquid; on the desert world, this made them valuable prey for larger creatures. The nomadic Slith valued the lizards as trading commodities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
