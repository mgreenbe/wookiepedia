In a desperate move to galvanize their fledgling rebellion, the Alliance to Restore the Republic launched a full-scale attack against a key target in the Galactic Empire\u2014the cloning facilities on the planet Kamino. Aided by Starkiller, a renegade clone of the late Galen Marek, the Alliance forces secured their first major victory under the leadership of Jedi Master Rahm Kota, a Rebel general and one of the few surviving Jedi veterans of the Clone Wars. In the aftermath of the fighting, the Timira City Cloning Facility was destroyed and the Sith Lord Darth Vader was taken prisoner by the Rebels, an accomplishment which Princess Leia Organa regarded as a turning point in the civil war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Marek's death aboard the Death Star in 2 BBY, the surviving founders of the Rebel Alliance\u2014fugitive senators Bail Prestor Organa, Garm Bel Iblis and Mon Mothma\u2014committed themselves to open rebellion against Emperor Palpatine and intended to fully restore the Old Republic that had been overthrown by the Empire's New Order. However, the Alliance leadership remained deadlocked in circular debates over what courses of action to take. While Bel Iblis advocated for bold but risky strikes against major Imperial targets, Mothma remained hesitant to engage the Empire in open battle due to the Alliance's limited resources. Organa's moderate stance on direct conflict and guerrilla warfare rendered him unable to completely support either side presented by his two colleagues, and so the Alliance remained relegated to small scale hit-and-run attacks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time, Darth Vader was determined to create a stronger and more obedient version of Marek, who had been secretly apprenticed for years to the Dark Lord of the Sith until his redemption as a Jedi and subsequent demise. As such, Marek's body was moved to Timira City where it was preserved as a source for cloning purposes. Although the creation of a perfect clone, based on the genetic code of a Force-sensitive template, had been considered impossible to achieve at the time, Vader proceeded to create a new acolyte via a new \"accelerated cloning process\". This refined version of the Kaminoan method enabled clones to complete their growth process in just under a few weeks rather than a full decade. Unfortunately, the procedure was far from flawless, and it resulted in numerous failed subjects\u2014all of whom were undermined by genetic defects and residual memories that they inherited from their progenitor, and ultimately driven to madness. Though the Dark Lord eventually achieved his goal with the creation of a fully stable clone, who he trained as his new secret apprentice, he was also confronted with the dilemma of hunting down \"Starkiller,\" the rogue clone who had escaped from Kamino shortly after Vader judged him to be another failure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his inability to overcome the memory imprints, Starkiller became obsessed with locating Captain Juno Eclipse, the Human woman whom Marek developed feelings for toward the end of his life. This soon led him to make contact with General Kota in the hope of finding Eclipse. However, Vader anticipated this and tasked the bounty hunter Boba Fett with abducting the Rebel officer, knowing that the clone would follow Eclipse back to Kamino. Starkiller responded as expected, but brought with him the entire Rebel fleet. The Imperial Star Destroyers were initially able to hold the Rebels at bay until Starkiller crashed the Rebel flagship, Salvation through Kamino's planetary shield, allowing Rebel troopers and commandos to attack Timira City. Huge numbers of casualties resulted on both sides, particularly for the Rebels as Starkiller only killed the Imperial soldiers directly in his way; focused solely on rescuing Eclipse, he ignored Kota's pleas to rejoin the battle proper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite significant losses, Kota's troops held their ground against the Imperials while Starkiller fought Vader in a lightsaber duel at the top of the city spire. Enraged by Vader's attack on Eclipse, the clone managed to trick Vader into lowering his guard and defeated him, but reluctantly spared Vader's life when Kota urged him to consider how valuable the Sith Lord could be to the Rebellion as a prisoner of war. With Vader captured and the Imperial garrison defeated, the Rebels sought to capitalize on their first major victory by transporting Vader to the Alliance hidden base on Dantooine. They also intended to crash a Star Destroyer into Kamino's ocean-covered surface so that the resulting tsunami would destroy Timira City. Soon afterward, the Alliance fleet left the system, unaware that they were being tracked by Vader's mercenary, Boba Fett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Background"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Kamino was an indirect result of Darth Vader's attempts to clone his deceased apprentice, Galen Marek. Through a new cloning process, the Sith Lord was able to accelerate a clone's growth to full maturity in a few short weeks, far quicker than the Kaminoan method and even faster than Spaarti technology. But such an unprecedented level of growth acceleration, combined with the inherent difficulty in cloning from a Force-sensitive template, lead to numerous defects in the first subjects. After the initial attempts produced a wave of aberrant monstrosities, Vader painstakingly endeavored to wipe out the emotional imprints that drove many promising clones to utter madness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next six months, Vader and the cloning technicians were successful in ironing out many of the process's flaws, and had begun to produce superficially stable clones. These clones, while exhibiting no physical or mental defects, still suffered from the problem of being unable to emotionally compartmentalize the original Marek's memories. However, during this time, Vader managed to produce a new clone of Galen Marek who showed a great deal of promise. Not only was he more stable than the clones who had preceded him, he had also survived the trials that most of his predecessors had failed. However, despite the clone's progress, he ultimately suffered from the same problems that undermined his clone brothers. In order to spare himself the time and effort of training a new apprentice all over again, Vader resorted to the accelerated cloning procedure so that the \"new Starkiller\" would biologically reach Marek's age\u2014prior to his death\u2014in less than a month. To train the clones in such a short period of time, the cloning procedure utilized memory flashes from the original Marek, which essentially served to download the original Marek's memories and behavioral patterns into the clones. This part of the procedure allowed the clones to utilize their genetically-inherited command of the Force. But as a consequence, every clone experienced an identity crisis which eventually drove them insane. The latest clone, though more perfect than those before him, ultimately proved to be afflicted by the same emotional imprints that were passed on by his genetic donor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Disappointed once again, Vader intended to eliminate his latest failed experiment, but failed to do so when the clone lashed out in a desperate attempt to escape from his creator. After successfully fleeing from his homeworld, the clone embarked on a single-minded quest to find Captain Juno Eclipse. Although the clone did not exhibit any of Marek's other emotional attachments, such as his commitment to the Rebel Alliance, he did develop the same feelings for a woman that he technically never met. As such, his artificial feelings forced him into an obsessive pursuit of Eclipse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unwilling to allow a renegade clone of Galen Marek to roam free, Darth Vader hired the bounty hunter Boba Fett and tasked him with locating \"Starkiller,\" as the clone subsequently became known as. Vader instructed Fett to find and capture Eclipse, predicting that Starkiller would come back to Kamino with Eclipse there as bait. Shortly after Fett and his partner Xasha tracked the clone to Cato Neimoidia, the two discovered that they had arrived too late. Starkiller was not only gone, but he had also left a trail of destruction and mayhem that brought about the complete ruin of the city of Tarko-se. Starkiller, after rescuing General Rahm Kota from Imperial captivity, failed to learn any sufficient information from the Jedi fugitive about Eclipse's whereabouts. His journey then took him to worlds such as Dagobah and Mon Calamari, until finally tracking down Eclipse's location to the Itani Nebula."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Traveling with Rahm Kota on Marek's old starship, the Rogue Shadow, the two arrived at the secret location of the Rebel fleet, including Captain Eclipse's Nebulon-B frigate, the Salvation. Unknown to either of them, Vader's bounty hunter also discovered where Juno Eclipse was hiding. Upon the Sith Lord's order to lure Starkiller back to Kamino by capturing Eclipse, Boba Fett and his Imperial strike team launched a surprise attack on the unsuspecting Rebels. Bypassing all of the other ships and fighters, Fett and his forces infiltrated the Salvation, stormed the bridge and captured Juno Eclipse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Starkiller annihilated most of Fett's Imperial troops, the clone failed to stop the bounty hunter from taking Eclipse to Vader on Slave I. Outraged at having failed to save Eclipse, Starkiller threatened to go to Kamino with or without Kota and the Rebels. With Starkiller willing to fight, the Jedi General saw a golden opportunity to launch a major offensive against the Empire, and complied with Starkillers wishes before warning the clone that Eclipse's abduction was virtually certain to have been part of a trap. Starkiller naively assumed that his creator would not expect the entire Rebel fleet to arrive at Kamino as well; Kota reluctantly agreed. However, both were wrong and Vader had indeed anticipated Starkiller's moves. Far from being caught unprepared, he positioned an entire fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers outside of Kamino's orbit in order to destroy the Rebel starships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately after exiting hyperspace, the Battle of Kamino commenced as Rebel ships were attacked by the Imperial fleet that had been awaiting their arrival. The Salvation itself was assaulted by numerous boarding parties. Before he could return to the bridge, Starkiller was forced to eliminate all of the Imperials that had infiltrated the Rebel flagship's hangar and engine sections. Upon arriving at the bridge, Kota informed the clone that the battle was going poorly for the Alliance; Timira City's deflector shield prevented the Rebels from launching any sort of ground assault the facility, and the Rebel fleet was being decimated by Vader's forces in space. In light of the Alliance's grim tactical position, Starkiller devised a desperate plan to destroy the shield generator by crashing the Salvation into Timira City."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the surviving crew members abandoned the ship at Kota's command, all systems were diverted to the bridge as Starkiller plotted a course straight through Kamino's atmosphere. As the ship plummeted to Timira City on autopilot, Starkiller cleared debris from the battle out of the ship's path, allowing it to smash through the shield. During its descent, the Salvation broke in half; the rear half plowed into the shield generator, while Starkiller directed the front half at the spire where Darth Vader was holed up. Realizing too late that Eclipse was also being held in the spire, Starkiller used the Force to destroy the entire forward section of the Salvation. Managing to survive the fall onto the facility, Starkiller proceeded to infiltrate the same city where he was \"created\" along with the other clones of the Marek template."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Making his way towards one of the Imperial hangar bays, he killed everything in his path, and dealt with a group of snipers harrying Rahm Kota and his squad. Rendezvousing with Kota, they broke into one of the Imperial command centers, hoping to use it to open the hangar doors, but the controls were destroyed by an Imperial bombing run. While Kota and his men looked for a security hub to prevent any more security lockdowns, Starkiller made his way to an alternate command center only to find the controls locked. Instead, he used telekinesis to wrench the doors open."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Needing a shortcut across the facility's interior towards the base of the cloning spires, Starkiller climbed on top of the hangar doors and leapt onto a passing Y-wing. The pilot, Wedge Antilles, obliged to Starkiller's request for a ride, flew the clone across the dome. Leaping off the craft, Starkiller began his ascent to the top spire of Timira City. Within the vast chambers that contained countless developing clones, he fought with Imperial Saber Guards and Sith Acolytes, and discovered to his horror that most of the cloning tanks within the spire contained more clones of Galen Marek. Wondering if the original Starkiller's corpse was located somewhere in Timira City, the clone was forced to accept that Vader did not lie about the existence of Marek's other imperfect clones as he originally believed. As he ascended higher and higher, he attempted to do so stealthily and with as little bloodshed as possible, but was given away by an unnoticed Terror Trooper, forcing him to kill it and the reinforcements it had alerted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time in the battle, he approached the cloning tank of Subject 1157 and hit it with a Force push, killing the other Galen Marek clone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the time Starkiller had broken off from Kota and his Rebel forces, the Jedi General had become increasingly frustrated with the clone's obsession with Juno Eclipse. Despite the initial successes of the Rebel ground assault, the Imperial forces had managed to regain control of the city's security centers, and had begun a devastating counterattack. With his troops in danger of being completely wiped out, he implored Starkiller to aid the Rebel forces, arguing that one life\u2014even Eclipse's life\u2014was not worth letting the entire Rebellion be destroyed. However, as the clone grew ever closer to the woman who had become the sole focus of his existence, he made it clear to Kota that his only priority was to save Eclipse; neither the Rebel Alliance nor was its war against the Empire was of any concern to him. Without Starkiller's aid, PROXY calculated that the Rebels would suffer severe casualties against the Imperial counterattack.

As he wandered through the smoke-shrouded corridors, he was suddenly attacked by what appeared to be Vader. Starkiller managed to fend off the assault, but was struck by a sudden and violent Force vision before he could counter, allowing his attacker to slip away. Tortured by his own mind as he wandered the corridors, Starkiller was attacked twice more before reentering the larger interior spaces of the spire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the clone looked around, the figure of Darth Vader appeared on one of the tank platforms, declaring that Starkiller would either surrender to him or die in the very chamber where he was created. Starkiller leapt up to engage Vader, but the armored figure evaded him. Fending off Starkiller's attacks while sending Sith Training Droids in the guise of various figures from Galen Marek's past to fight him, Vader sought to break the clone's resolve with psychological warfare, but Starkiller easily held them off and turned on Vader.

Though Starkiller had always professed to knowing that he was a clone of the original Marek, he had secretly harbored hope that this was not the case. However, faced with what were essentially alternate versions of himself and Galen Marek, Starkiller was forced to truly accept the fact that he too was a clone. His aggressive counters against the aberrant clones were reluctant, as he was essentially committing fratricide by killing clones that shared exactly the same genetic makeup as himself. Eventually however, Starkiller destroyed all the other clones with a Force Repulse so violent that it reduced his opponents to bloody mist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His emotions in turmoil after being forced to confront the aberrant clones, Starkiller rushed at Vader in a rage.

He ultimately went so far as to suggest that his master join the Alliance in order to destroy Emperor Palpatine, but Vader simply redoubled his own attack in response, making it clear that he wanted nothing to do with the Rebellion.
