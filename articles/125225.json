She lived at some point between the Great Sith War and the Mandalorian Wars. She became involved in Demagol's research, the goal of which was to create Force-sensitive children at his school on Osadia. The two eventually had a daughter, named Chantique. Wyrick, however, was more interested in the Force-attuned Arkanian offsprings than in his own daughter. Seeing her as a failure, Wyrick willingly gave Chantique to The Crucible, a slaving organization. The grief of losing her daughter caused Chantique's mother to commit suicide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
