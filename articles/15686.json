However, the Imperials soon learnt of the stash and placed a minefield around the containers with Assault Gunboats from Tau Squadron to destroy any recovery effort from the Alliance. Although fully aware of the trap, Alliance High Command sent a squadron of A-wings from Blue Squadron with Beetle Group soon behind to pick up the containers. The Rebels needed to hold of Tau Squadron and other Imperial reinforcements long enough for Beetle to pick and leave with just one of the containers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The outcome depends on what side the Player has chosen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
