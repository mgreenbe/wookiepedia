A philosopher named Sio Bibble was elected Governor of Naboo under Veruna's rule. During his reign, Veruna established a vast royal library collection in a tower at the back of the Theed Royal Palace. Veruna was considered a corrupt king, and was defeated in an election by the fourteen-year-old Amidala, who became one of the youngest Queens of Naboo in its history."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He shared his name with Veruna, one of the three moons of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ars Veruna was first canonically mentioned in Sio Bibble's entry from the 2016 reference book Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded, written by Pablo Hidalgo.

The 2019 canon novel Queen's Shadow, written by E. K. Johnston, established that Naboo monarchs can only serve for a maximum of four years, or two terms lasting two years each. The 2019 reference book Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition placed Bibble's election to the position of Governor during Veruna's reign, but did not maintain Veruna as Amidala's immediate predecessor, or specify the duration of his reign.

However, it has not yet been confirmed in canon whether this king is indeed Veruna."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Legends continuity, Veruna was first mentioned in the 1999 novel Star Wars Episode I Journal: Queen Amidala, written by Jude Watson.
