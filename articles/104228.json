In appearance, the class bore similarities in design to CEC's CR90 corvettes and DP20 frigates, and had a command tower similar to Consular-class cruisers. Medical frigates of this type were equipped with at least 4 escape pods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to maneuver more smoothly through space, the frigate was capable of opening up a set of wings to expose smaller auxiliary engines. The wings were usually folded up to minimize the ship's profile.
