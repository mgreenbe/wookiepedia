Many of the racing machines used for podraces combined multiple large engines with energy binders. Energy binders prevented engines in the system from naturally straying from one another, which could lead to catastrophic accidents. A notable energy-binder failure was during the Boonta Eve Classic podrace, when Ben Quadinaros' binders failed, sending his engines flying in multiple directions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
