After the modifications, it boasted a much faster hyperdrive and heavier armaments than a stock ship of its class.

The cockpit could fit two crew and up to two passengers. Behind the cockpit was passenger seating and an emergency airlock. Going clockwise around the ship's central saucer was a weapon storage locker, a holotable and lounge area, a galley, and a technical station. In the center of the ship was access the top and bottom gunwells as well as the airlock/connection hatch. The two forward prongs held maintenance accesses. Port of the cockpit held the captain's quarters and two passenger or crew cabins. Across from the cabins were a series of storage lockers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The aft of the ship held the sublight drives and hyperdrives, and there were engine insulators installed there. On either side of the engines were cargo bays that contained freezers. Forward of the cargo bays there was an escape pod on each side on the exterior of the ship and across the hallway from the pods were secret smuggling compartments. After Scizzic's modifications the Starbound Misfit boasted heavier twin fire-linked laser cannons than the stock model, an added concussion missile launcher, as well as a 0.5 Class hyperdrive and a backup Class 10 hyperdrive. The modifications also shortened the length of the Starbound Misfit from 36.58 meters to 35 meters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Starbound Misfit was purchased for the Near-Human tramp freighter captain Lynnori by her boyfriend Talandro Starlyte and modified by the Ugnaught mechanic Scizzic as a way to keep Lynnori safer on her travels.
