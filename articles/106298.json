Blank wanted Pluma as his young bride, and had his soldiers capture her and imprison her in a chest against her will. To safely transport her to Blank's underground fortress via subtram, Blank hired a team of highly skilled bounty hunters, led by Boba Fett, to protect her. Little did they know that the Kage Warriors would ambush the tram in an attempt rescue Pluma."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Krismo Sodi, Pluma's brother, found her, he was caught by Asajj Ventress, and both were handcuffed to the subtram's seats. Pluma pleaded with Ventress, her entreaty about the unfairness of being ripped from her home seemingly striking a chord with Ventress. The Dark Jedi instead bound and gagged Boba and stuffed him in the box, leaving him for Blank after receiving her credits. Later, halfway back to the station, Ventress took Pluma and Krismo to the very back of the subtram, where Krismo signalled a Milodon. When Ventress got her additional credits from the Kage, she released Pluma, who thanked her before the warriors departed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pluma was a kind girl who greatly disliked war and fighting.
