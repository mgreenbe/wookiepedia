This spice was trafficked by the Rebel Alliance but was also sought by the powerful criminal organization Black Sun. After they were detected and threatened, Vang considered that the situation had become too dangerous while Krieg decided to continue to investigate the source of this spice. The latter was finally assassinated in his house on Tatooine. Around 1 ABY, a group of spacers discovered a sample of the new spice while looking for a missing pilot, Cal Handro. They brought it to Doctor Vang but the latter exhorted them to interrogate Krieg instead of him, ignoring that his fried was already dead.
