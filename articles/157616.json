Casterfo was assisting Senator Leia Organa's investigation into the Amaxine warriors and posed as a collector of Imperial artifacts to investigate the Amaxine presence on Daxam IV. This dealer turned out to be Arliz Hadrassian, a former Imperial officer and the Amaxine leader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The teahouse was a rundown building that was staffed by human waiters since Daxam IV was too poor to afford droids. During their meeting, Hadrassian regaled Casterfo with stories about her work as a TIE fighter pilot and Imperial Security Bureau officer. Casterfo managed to gain her trust by posing as an admirer of the Old Empire. As a result, Hadrassian ascertained that he was a worthy buyer and arranged for him to collect the helmet at her compound in the Western Wastes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
