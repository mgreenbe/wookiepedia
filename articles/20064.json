At some point during her life, she earned the Corellian Bloodstripe and joined the Corellian Merchants' Guild. After many years as a freighter captain, MacMillian eventually decided to retire; she chose to settle on the planet Gandle Ott, a remote world located in the Kathol sector of the Outer Rim Territories. On Gandle Ott, MacMillian maintained a small Corellian Merchants' Guild Guildhouse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her time as head of the Guildhouse, MacMillian amassed a large amount of navigational information regarding the Kathol sector and was willing to copy it for members of the Corellian Merchants' Guild for a fee of 100 credits. In 8 ABY, the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar stopped over at Gandle Ott while on a mission to track down the rogue Imperial Moff Kentor Sarne. The crew of the FarStar was in need of navigational charts of the sector, as Moff Sarne had wiped the records on the sector capital of Kal'Shebbol clean during his withdrawal, and the crew only had access to partial maps that did not show details beyond Gandle Ott. During their layover, MacMillian was one of the potential sources from which they considered obtaining the information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 8 ABY, MacMillian was an aged woman, with salty hair and wrinkles covering her face. She possessed a no-nonsense attitude, and the Corellian Bloodstripe that she had earned proved her tenacity, displaying the fact that she was not a woman to cross.
