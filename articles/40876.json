It thrived in gloomy conditions, growing on stone and it gave off a faint purple glow. During the time period in which the reconstituted Sith Empire held Dromund Kaas as its capital the lichen was considered rare. At this time, Darth Nyriss, a Human female Sith Lord and member of the Dark Council, used the lichen to decorate the courtyard of her stronghold, where it was planted in decorative patterns amongst white stone pebbles. The Sith Lord Darth Scourge noted the lichens presence when he was summoned to the stronghold by Nyriss in 3956 BBY to investigate attempts on her life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This species of lichen first appeared in the first chapter of Drew Karpyshyn's novel The Old Republic: Revan in which it was given no official name but simply described from Darth Scourge, one of the Dramatis personage's, point of view."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
