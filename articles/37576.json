Generally they were police officers, however, Jedi such as Tera Sinube who were able to use the Force to help piece together the crime, would assist regular police detectives with their investigations, in their capacity as a Jedi investigator. Detectives from the Coruscant Security Force would sometimes be referred to as inspectors. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Imperial Security Bureau personnel could be assigned as investigators to investigate criminal and rebel activity, as exampled when an ISB major helped Darth Vader investigate a bombing on Coruscant when a Jedi emblem was recovered from a site in the early days of the Empire. In the Imperial Security Bureau, there was also an elevated rank of Chief Investigator. Erno, Mursey, and Shreen were detectives that worked at the Peace and Security Headquarters in Coronet City."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
