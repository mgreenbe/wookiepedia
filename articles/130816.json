They are the ultimate unit for long-range fighting and also work well at medium ranges and can also deploy auto-turrets for extra defense. While their long-range sniper rifles make them effective units in dealing with infantry, they also make them the weakest units in taking out vehicles and enclosed turrets, being able to deal practically no damage to artillery. Moreover, their rifles are light and quick at aiming even at close ranges, but the slow rate-of-fire and light armor make them nevertheless inefficient at directly facing groups of soldier units.

Commanders carry a blaster pistol for short range protection and emergency use if their chaingun is overheated or did not have time to spin up. They can also use Rally to temporarily boost all nearby friendly troops' morale and increase their resistance to damage, thus a team is at its most effective when traveling with a Clone Commander. In addition, they have a recon droid to serve as short-range reconnaissance. The recon droid, although is has a limited period of time before exploding, can defend itself with a weak blaster or a self-destruct mechanism.

Because of this, it is usually used in conjunction with their stealth field generator, which allows them to become invisible. While invisible, a Bothan spy can utilize ambush tactics on their unaware enemy or capture command posts unseen. However, the user would be immediately forced out of stealth the moment they fire a wave of incinerating blasts, and if timed incorrectly, they can easily be taken out by a group of soldiers. Unlike the previous three special units, the recon droid is replaced with a sticky time bomb that detonates with a large concussive blast after 5 seconds.

They are equipped with a rapid-firing commando pistol as a sidearm, which is stronger than the regular blaster pistol. These units can be used to sneak up behind enemies using their jetpacks and ambush them from behind, then spring away to safety while they reload. They are the Republic's answer to the CIS droideka due to their agility in dodging the devastating laser bolts from destroyer droids and their EMP launcher's effectiveness in taking down their shields.

Their shields can also be used to protect allies behind the shield and allow them to reload weapons. The droideka is not without flaws, however. It can not enter vehicles, as the manual states that the droideka itself is considered a vehicle. Its shield lasts for twenty to thirty seconds and can quickly be dissipated under fire from large groups of enemies. Additionally, they must be rolled up into a ball in order to travel quickly from place to place. Although fast, they are completely vulnerable when in this mode, as they are unable to raise their shield or fire their weapons.

The capital ships (battleships) contain all starfighters and rooms, while the others attack nearby enemies and provide defense/fire support. With the exception of the hangar, the rooms in the battleships have auto-turrets in them that will fire on intruders, though they are not as powerful as the turrets used by the auto-turret bonus. The battleships have a few powerful rapid firing auto-turrets on the outside which can make short work of any type of ship, which a player can also manually control like other turrets, and the shields on the ship make destroying the turrets very difficult. The external turrets will cease firing if the auto-turret defense mainframe inside the ship is destroyed, though the internal turrets will still operate. The shield generator's destruction, also inside the ship, results in the shields outside the battleship being lowered, though sometimes a glitch in the game causes that to not happen, and although just shooting at the battleship will lower the shields, doing so takes considerable time and destroying the shield generator on the inside is much faster. However, the shield generator can be repaired, but it takes some time unless multiple players, playing as the Pilot class, chip in with their Fusioncutters to repair it faster, protecting the external targets for an additional amount of time. Battleships can't be destroyed, but they do have internal and external systems that can be. Outside of the previously mentioned shield generator and auto-turret defense mainframe, there is an externally mounted bridge, life-support systems, communications relay, short-range sensors, and engines. Internally the engine cooling tanks and the life support systems can also be destroyed on the inside. Destroying these, unlike the shields and defense mainframes, does not affect gameplay, but does award whoever destroys them a large sum of points, except in CTF. Internal systems take roughly 2-4 time bombs to destroy. External ones take dozens of bombs at the very least. The other ships are frigates, which cannot be boarded. The number of them that each side has varies from map to map. Unlike battleships, they can be destroyed, but are very durable so it takes time. The frigates have several turrets mounted on them that can make short work of incoming ships, but they won't always fire on a ship depending on how close or how far away they are. Despite their strong weapons, the frigates are very vulnerable to bombers and even a single one can take out a frigate with little difficulty if no fighters intervene.
