A picture drawn by Dan Parsons, and a short informative blurb about him appeared in the June 2006 reference book Star Wars: Legacy 0, which introduced many of the series' primary characters and other elements. Everything that was showcased in Legacy 0 went on to play a role in the series, save for Gosem, who failed to appear in a single issue of Legacy during its fifty-issue run. Ostrander later stated that he and Duursema had had storylines in mind for the character, but that there had ultimately been no room to fit them in to existing stories which already featured Legacy's large ensemble cast. Gosem was finally referenced in the third issue of Legacy's followup miniseries, Star Wars: Legacy\u2014War, and was profiled in the 2013 StarWars.com blog article \"Viva Space Vegas! The History of the Marvelous Wheel, Part 2,\" written by Abel G.
