The Galactic Empire had imposed martial law on Mykapo. The starship was involved in a skirmish with TIE fighters and a Gozanti-class cruiser. During the fighting, the ship sustained damage to her hyperdrive. Shortly later, the Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla arrived with Phoenix Cell and wiped out the starfighters. This allowed the Sato's Hammer to drop explosive-laden cargo onto the Gozanti cruiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Hera docked her starship the Ghost with the Sato's Hammer. She and her crew Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren, and the astromech Chopper visited the Sato's Hammer and found the ship in a dilapidated state. Chopper got into a brief fight with R3-A3, who was protective of the ship's systems. Hera and her crew tried to persuade Mart and the Iron Squadron to leave with them.

One of Konstantine's TIE bombers planted a magno-mine on the ship's hull. Konstantine's allowed Mart to send a distress signal in order to lure his rebel friends into a trap. However, Hera and Ezra saw through this trap and devised a counter-strategy. They led Konstantine's TIE fighters on a pursuit while Chopper and R3-A3 removed the mine. With the ship unable to jump into hyperspace on its own, Hera magnetized the Ghost to the Sato's Hammer. Commander Sato's forces then ambushed Konstantine's ship's."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mart then dropped the magno-mine on Konstantine's Arquitens-class command cruiser, damaging the vessel.
