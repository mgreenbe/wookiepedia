The technician recorded that 1157 had become conscious and was physically stable, and explained that the clone was experiencing tremblings. During his 25th entry about 1157, the technician reported that Darth Vader was coming as a result of the success of the project and mentioned his pleasure at the scientific progress the technician was making. The technician also monitored 1157 while the clone, like his template, developed Force sensitivity. The technician gave the clone genetic memory imprints throughout his development. Subject 1157 was bothered by \"hallucinations\" and required systematic restraints to control the resulting tremblings. The technician, as a result, instigated new desensitization techniques. By Entry 65, the technician hypothesized that the clone would end in aberration due to the clone's unstable behavior, and experimented with new sedation techniques. He was unsure how to proceed by that point."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Kamino was attacked, and the facility was subject to an evacuation order. In his 78th entry, the technician recorded that on Darth Vader's orders, they were abandoning the non-viable test subjects, and 1157 would be released out of his tank to see if the imprint held. The technician expressed a wish that his life's work was not in vain. Before Subject 1157 was released, though, an individual referred to as Subject 1138 by the technician struck 1157's tank with a Force push, and the clone expired."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cloning technician was proud of his work and believed he was furthering a cause by the development of test subjects like 1157.
