She was the queen of the helper droids, a unique variant of the R2-series astromech droid which would give people repetitive advice on their respective professions. QU3-3N was unique, in that unlike her minions, she was much larger in size. After the Battle of Yavin, QU3-3N was leading the production of helper droids from a droid factory on Corellia. Around 1 ABY, she was deemed a monstrosity which had to be destroyed at all costs by Draykken Bender, a leader of the Meatlumps, a group technology-hating Corellian terrorists. Bender tasked a spacer with destroying QU3-3N. The spacer therefore fought the helper droids in the droid factory and finally destroyed QU3-3N."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "QU3-3N was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
