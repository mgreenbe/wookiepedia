They moved in large herds and were hunted for food by Horansi and tourists. They had four limbs, with elongated bodies, short necks and broad heads. Unlike many species of herbivores, kalans would not flee predators and abandon weak members. Their tactic was to act as a unit in defending themselves when attacked, making them very dangerous. They would coordinate their defense, with several individuals trying to lure the attacking predator into the center of the rest of the herd, which then overwhelmed the attacker. As the predator closed in for the kill, the other kalans charged the creature with their tusks, hoping to crush or gore the attacker. While they were deadly in close combat, kalans were defenseless against ranged weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
