As part of his plan to acquire the Shadow Arsenal, Kothe sent \"Saber\" and \"Wheel\" to Mon Gazza while the others had their missions elsewhere. After all pieces of the plan fell together, \"Saber\" and \"Wheel\" together participated in the infiltration of the Shadow Arsenal facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Legate\" then appeared to \"Saber\" and \"Wheel\", revealed their true allegiances, and attacked, killing them both in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
