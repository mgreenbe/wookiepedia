The tank was armed with twin forward-facing blaster cannons, while the pilot was defended by a dome-shaped windshield and a thick coat of armor.

Commander Ryden's cell, which was headquartered on Imvur, possessed four such tanks. When the Imperial commander Viggen attacked their base with two AT-AT walkers, the rebels set off in their MLC-3s to try and keep the invaders distracted until an evac ship arrived. Some time later, the rebellion was replaced by the more organized Alliance to Restore the Republic, which also used MLC-3s during their war with the Empire. Despite their obsolescence, the tanks proved themselves time and time again in numerous battles against Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The MLC-3 first appeared in the 78th issue of the Legends Star Wars comic and was modeled after the Kenner Products Mini-Rig toy.

However, the gameplay is non-canon, so the tank's presence is non-canon as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "MLC-3s later appeared in \"Vulnerable Areas,\" a comic strip written by Martin Fisher and illustrated by Bob Molesworth that was published in the seventeenth issue of the Star Wars Rebels Magazine.
