A number of Interdictor vessels were developed for the zone, but Moff Wilhuff Tarkin requisitioned them to use in an attempt to capture his stolen corvette, the Carrion Spike. The Imperial Advisor Kren Blista-Vanee informed Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine of Tarkin's plan to use the cruisers. Among the few who had clearance to fly through the zone was the tramp freighter captain Dana Galvason, a Rebel Alliance sympathizer who flew the Bakuran Blade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
