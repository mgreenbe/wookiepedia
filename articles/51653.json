Gabbera had been born into slavery, and was turned over to Zonnos as payment for a gambling debt. A cowardly individual, he was an excellent pilot, and had passed his skills onto many within Zonnos' operations. When Popara hired a group of freelance agents to rescue his other offspring, Mika Anjiliac Chiera, Zonnos allowed Gabbera to accompany Popara's agents as a pilot and guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
