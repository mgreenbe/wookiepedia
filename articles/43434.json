The capital was surrounded by the Cloudflower Wall, manned by guard droids and security devices, including surveillance droids, effectively trapping the workers of Romin out of the main city. Above the city, high in the clouds, was the Teda Landing Platform, the area's only arrival station. The city centerpiece was, of course, the grand palace complex of the dictator himself, \"Great Leader Teda.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the rule of that dictatorship, Eliior was populated by the wealthy. Worker hovels, by contrast, rose in concentric rings outside the city\u2014from which they grew, with increasing distance out from the city, progressively worse. Passes were required of all workers coming to the city, and they were required to have a work reason in order to gain entrance. The wealthy, living in luxurious and spacious villas framed by lush gardens and sparkling fountains, rarely ventured outside the city walls, and those who did usually were escorted under heavy guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 24 BBY, the Jedi Order dispatched a Jedi team to Eliior on a mission to track down and capture an escaped criminal of the Republic, mad scientist Jenna Zan Arbor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
