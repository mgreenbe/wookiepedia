The Jedi Temple on Coruscant, the capital world of the Galactic Republic, served as both their home and school, where the younglings received their first lessons in the Jedi arts before becoming Padawans to the more experienced members of the Order, such as Knights and Masters. Like all Jedi with the exception of Anakin Skywalker, the Bear Clan was initially instructed in the art of lightsaber combat and the ways of the Force by Yoda, the Jedi Grand Master and a leading member of the High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi interrupted the Bear Clan's lightsaber training session with Yoda, whose wisdom he sought in order to discover the reason behind the lack of information on the planet Kamino in the Jedi Archives.
