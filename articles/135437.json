However, Stecker, alongside Captain Ganig, came to the attention of the Imperial Security Bureau after his apparent casual attitude towards doctrine came to light. In addition, Stecker had contact with a soldier named Linds, who the ISB were confident was an Alliance to Restore the Republic sympathizer. Stecker subsequently served in the Raid on Picutorion, serving in Tensiger's 6th regiment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, troops from the regiment, including Stecker and Ganig, breached an Alliance-held tracking station. Stecker was killed during the assault after an ISB officer, Mar Barezz, counselled the mission commanders\u2014Commodore Bevven and High Colonel Theol Drost\u2014to delay starfighter support to their position. Although there was no evidence that Stecker intended to defect, Barezz was certain that COMPNOR would again honor him for his role in the Picutorion operation if he assisted in capturing the tracking station and that, for propaganda purposes, dead heroes were as good as live ones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
