The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Due to the nature of some characters in Galaxies, Teslo Ten'Doora's appearance was randomized during each server reset. For example, one screenshot depicts her as a female Zabrak, and another as a female Trandoshan. However, it cannot be said with absolute certainty that Ten'Doora always spawned as a female during each server reset. Therefore, the canonical species and gender of Ten'Doora remains unidentified."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
