This unit led a full battalion of B1-series battle droids during the battle, which participated in an ambush against entrenched Republic forces on the basis of information provided by a traitor in the ranks of the clone troopers. A betrayal obvious to them, the Republic forces sought answers even as they retreated in the face of TJ-55's troops. As a gunship arrived to retrieve the survivors, a clone trooper decapitated TJ-55, hoping to use the data contained within his memory to expose the traitor. Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" and Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody\" would later analyze the head and discover that there was a traitor in their ranks, finding that a signal had been transmitted to the enemy from a terminal in the barracks for Sergeant Slick's men."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
