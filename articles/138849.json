Roughly humanoid in shape, the TX-1118 was designed with a variety of on-board weapons systems. It was originally marketed as a soldier, but was priced too high, and MerenData found themselves with a surplus of droids in their warehouses. In order to recover their development costs, MerenData reprogrammed the droids to eliminate the ethics programming and turn the TX-1118 into an assassin that would kill any being they were told to. This droid, known as the Terminax, was armed with a blaster rifle in one arm and a fragmentation grenade launcher in the other. The TX-1118 was known for its loyalty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
