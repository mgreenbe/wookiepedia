He was among the many pilots who answered the summons of X-7, an Imperial assassin, for a high paying job. The group met on the moon of Iope, in the Rinn system, where their flying skills were tested by X-7. The Sorrusian was among the few survivors of the test and was granted safe passage to the hidden hangar on the moon. There, the surviving mercenaries met X-7 and received their mission to kill the Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker. When X-7 informed them that they would have to work as a group, the Sorrusian objected and reached for his blaster. But before he could draw his weapon, X-7 killed him with a shot to the head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
