In the case of sudden changes in velocity, it would project a small personal force field that would shield the wearer, preventing any falls, rockslides or collisions from being fatal, although they had limits. It was commonly used in pathfinding. They were typically box-shaped, and small enough to be worn on a belt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
