Wilkins' BTL Y-wing starfighter started an attack run on the Vehemence with ion cannons, however several explosions blinded Wilkin. A TIE/sa bomber accidentally rammed the Y-wing knocking Wilkins and the gunner unconscious. BXET-R2, Wilkins' astromech droid guided the starfighter away from the bomber's counterattack path, and fired a proton torpedo at the bomber distracting it and giving time for the Y-wing to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
