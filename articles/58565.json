It was designed primarily as an infantry fighting vehicle, meant to carry troops into battle and protect them once deployed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Featuring lighter armament and armor than other turbo tanks, the HCVw A9 compensated with its higher speed and a hull optimized for deflecting energy bolts. Structurally, it was divided into two sections; the large cargo area\u2014which could be configured to hold either troops or prisoners\u2014was connected to the command deck by a flexible, reinforced joint."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For weaponry, it boasted a pair of forward turret-mounted blasters for anti-personnel use and dorsal rapid-fire rotary laser cannon turrets for anti-aerial use. Consequently, HCVw A9s were rarely deployed alone, and instead played supporting roles in larger armored formations, alongside Juggernauts, walkers, and other fast assault vehicles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The HCVw was used during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early Imperial Era, an HCVw tank transported the prisoners Hera Syndulla, Gobi Glie, and Serin to the Imperial Refinery on Ryloth. They had been arrested for smuggling weapons into Ryloth.  This tank was also carrying Vice Admiral Rampart, Senator Orn Free Taa, as well as Captain Howzer who was guarding the two.  The tank was guarded by four BARC speeders. Cham Syndulla, Eleni Syndulla and members of Free Ryloth Movement attacked the convoy to rescue the trio of prisoners. Rampart ordered reinforcements to be sent to assist the convoy. Their plea never got through, as Lenk had jammed their communications. The attempt ended with Hera\u2019s rescue, as she and her droid, C1-10P \"Chopper,\" drove off on a speeder. Her rescue was at the expense of her liberators, who were captured by stormtroopers on Low Altitude Assault Transports. Rampart ordered Howzer and his men to sweep the area, adding that Hera would not get far."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One HCVw A9 was used to transport Jyn Erso and Oolin Musters, Imperial prisoners of Wobani Labor Camp, to an unspecified location. En route, the A9 was ambushed and the tank's lower entrance was breached by Rebel troopers of Extraction Team Bravo, who freed Erso from captivity ."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The HCVw A9 turbo tank first appeared in Gareth Edwards' 2016 anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
