Lasdal had three children and he worked as a shift foreman, overseeing the construction of capital ships. However, he secretly also worked for the Rebel Alliance and he acted as an Alliance insider aboard the station. After schematics for a Quadronomic Fluxer, an advanced sublight engine component that could increase the sublight speeds of small starships, was developed on Nessem, the Alliance sent a group of agents to the Nessem Shipyards to obtain the plans. The agents rendezvoused with Ladal and he introduced the Rebels to his workmates, claiming that the agents were friends of his family. He then showed the agents to his home and informed them that the schematics for the Quadronomic Fluxer were being stored aboard a completed capital ship on the sunward strut of the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
