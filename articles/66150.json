This Imperialization of Azzameen assets took place shortly after the Battle of Hospital, in which the Azzameens had taken place alongside the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Imperial action saw the family's home base, Azzameen Station, and their company's repair facility captured after a brief skirmish with Azzameen forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
