Like the rest of his species, which was also known as Teedo, Teedo had a strange sense of identity that led him to refer to himself as Teedo. Teedo rode a luggabeast as a beast of burden. In 34 ABY, the astromech droid BB-8 was caught in a net on Teedo's luggabeast, leading fellow scavenger Rey to free the droid. The next morning, Teedo and two other bandits attempted to steal BB-8 from Rey as they left her home for Niima Outpost. Rey was able to escape Teedo by forcing him to follow her into a crashed Star Destroyer, where his speeder bike was eaten by a nightwatcher worm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teedo is portrayed by Kiran Shah and voiced by David Acord in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.
