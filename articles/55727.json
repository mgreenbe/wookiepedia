It enforced traffic laws inside the space lanes of the planet. During the Gorse conflict, it partnered with TIE fighters to disallow civilian traffic flow off Gorse so that Count Vidian's Star Destroyer, the Ultimatum, and the Mining Guild cargo ships following it, could safely travel to the Calcoraan system. The organization was ordered to enforce the restriction until Vidian returned to Gorse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
