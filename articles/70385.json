He flew the Good Feeling to Prakith in the Deep Core with a group of Incom and Subpro scientists, who were developing a ship in the Imperial Testing Grounds on the planet's Outer Moon. However, the ship was attacked by mynocks and Seejo sent out a distress call. This was received by a group of Alderaanian Resistance agents, who had just arrived in the system and they helped to save the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was infested with mynocks again and Seejo was sacked and had the ship confiscated.
