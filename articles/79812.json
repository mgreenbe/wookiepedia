It was the remains of a spaceport, with a single runway. A transponder was buried beneath the ground that broadcast an intermittent signal, which was a variant of the accepted landing field signal recognized by starships. Most starships visiting Fyodos landed at the landing point. It was usually guarded by several Fyodoi, who patrolled it for ceremonial reasons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
