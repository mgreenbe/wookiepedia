Ixxis became friends and rivals with fellow scoundrel Prahman Su when the pair worked together on a clotheslegging job near the Cron Drift, which they mutually botched. The pair then began running semi-regular games of sabacc, in Coronet City on Su's homeworld of Corellia, which became known as Ixxis and Su's Floating Game. A game would begin whenever the pair both found themselves in the city at the same time and would then move from location to location. Players who wished to enter required a personal invite from Ixxis or Su, as well as a 5000 initial stake. The game attracted large numbers of up and coming gamblers and card sharks, although those without the necessary money where beaten and robbed upon arrival."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brali Ixxis was first mentioned in Suns of Fortune, a sourcebook released in 2014 for Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
