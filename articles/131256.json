The series was based on the animated Star Wars: Droids television show, which aired in the 1985\u201386 season and was canceled shortly after this series began."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike the TV show, which was set around 15 BBY, this series was initially stated to take place between 10 and 6 BBY[source?] and ended with a semi-adaptation of A New Hope told from R2-D2 & C-3PO's point of view. However, the second issue depicts the characters Tig Fromm and Vlix Oncard, who had been turned over to Jabba the Hutt in the last episode of the first TV story arc. That could mean either that the Fromm gang was later freed, or that issues #1-#5 occurred before the television series. The latter hypothesis is supported by a reference to the comic series character Zell in The New Essential Guide to Characters that takes place before the description of the events of the TV show. The blog series The Droids Re-Animated, however, officially confirmed that Issues 1-5 took place before the animated series, after some discussion with Jedi Council Forums."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the 1990s, Dark Horse released a comic of the same name."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Issues"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
