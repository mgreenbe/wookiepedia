To Rowan's misfortune, Naare arrives on the Eclipse Fighter and steals the fourth kyber crystal. The Freemakers follow her into space but come under attack from Graballa's starship Rancor's Fist. The Freemakers then flee into hyperspace. Graballa complains that they are gone but Naare tells him that she has a way to track them down. The Freemakers come up with a plan to steal the next kyber crystals in order to prevent Naare from reassembling the Kyber Saber. Realizing that the next two kyber crystals are on the planets Naboo and Ningoth. Realizing that Naare will go for the obvious, they decide to visit the more distant Ningoth first. Roger is unhappy with both choices; regarding Naboo as a graveyard for battle droids and that Ningoth's watery environment will cause his metallic body to rust."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Confrontation on Ningoth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Ningoth, Zander presents his submarine to Rowan and Kordi, who treat it with an admiration of cuteness to where she christens it as the Bubbly Snubbly. While Roger remains aboard the StarScavenger, the Freemakes take the Bubbly Snubbly into the depths of Ningoth's oceans. After a confusing set of directions, they find the crystal in the antenna of an opee sea killer. The opee sea killer uses the illuminating crystal to hunt for food. After a brief confrontation, they decide to trade their spotlight for the crystal. Rowan uses the Force to repair the damaged light. After completing their exchange, they rendezvous with Roger on Ningoth's surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Freemakers can leave aboard the StarScavenger, Naare and Graballa ambush them for the second time. While Roger holds off the Rancor's Fist with the Star Scavenger's turret, the other Freemakers use the Bubbly Snubbly to drag the Eclipse Fight underwater. Following a struggle, they are able to sever the tow cable and launch the sub into the ship's cargo hold. Before the StarScavenger's rear exit can close, Naare uses the Force to snatch the fifth kyber crystal out of Rowan's hand and departs in the Eclipse Fighter. The Freemakers then flee into hyperspace, triggering a wave that swamps Naare and the Rancor's Fist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Freemakers debate how Naare found them. Kordi remarks that Naare seems to know where they are going. Zander adds that they went to a planet where they are the only things on the surface; making them easy to spot. Roger than jokes that Rowan is not the only one terrible at this but it doesn't go down well with the others. Rowan then remarks that Roger also knows what to say sarcastically. Back on Ningoth, Graballa and Naare discuss the expensive damage to the Rancor's Fist's engines caused by the sea water. Naare is not concerned by such \"trivialities\". When Graballa complains that he seems to be footing the bill for everything, Naare reassures him that those \"trash-pickers\" will not escape for long and that she has a way to track them.

After landing in the capital city of Theed, they discover that the sixth crystal is hidden inside the former royal palace, which has now been revamped as the Emperor Palpatine Museum.

However, Zander comes up with a better plan that involves smuggling Roger into the Museum disguised as a decommissioned B1-series battle droid from the Clone Wars. Zander fools his way into the Museum disguised as a delivery worker. While pushing his \"cargo\" through the Museum, Zander has a near run-in with the Imperial General Durpin and Commander Plumestriker, who are assigned with safeguarding the exhibits. The officers joke about the stupidity of trying to break into the Emperor Palpatine Museum.

One of the heads breaks off and rolls down the hall; startling Roger while he is regaling his days as the head of the salvage operation to the inactive R0-HK. The head knocks Roger into the other exhibits, which triggers their blasters. The blast ricochets against several stormtrooper helmets before knocking the hanging N-1 starfighter exhibit into the Theed Hangar. The noise alerts the complacent Durpin and Plumestriker to the presence of intruders inside the Emperor Palpatine Museum. Durpin tries to dismiss the problem but Plumestriker sounds the alarm and orders the stormtrooper sentries to search the Museum."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Escaping the Museum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Kordi, who is wearing Queen Amidala's royal gown, stumbles upon Roger helping Zander out of the fallen N-1 starfifghter exhibit in the Theed Hangar. She asks the \"Nerf herders\" what they are doing before defending her right to have fun. Before the three can leave at Zander's urging, they are cornered by Plumestriker and stormtroopers. Durpin, who is tired of promotions and ceremonies, tries to convince Plumestriker to let the intruders go and dismiss them as \"mischievous\" kids. However, Plumestriker remembers the Freemakers from their earlier encounter on Kashyyyk and announces that they will answer for their crimes. In deference to General Durpin, he decides to skip the paperwork and orders the stormtroopers to execute the Freemakers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Imperials can execute the intruders, a disguised Rowan turns up dressed in Palpatine's robes and wearing a Palpatine voice changer device.

After the Imperials have left the hangar, Kordi and Zander thank Rowan for his quick thinking and ingenuity.

Roger is pinned down by the armed bounty hunter. When one of Dengar's blaster bolts hits R0-HK, this throws Roger into a berserker rage and he chases the bounty hunter out of the hangar with a blaster. Meanwhile, Rowan stirs only to be confronted by Naare, who is wielding both the Jedi and Sith lightsabers. Before she can kill Rowan, the boy uses the Force to collapse the bolt holding the dangling N-1 fighter. The fighter collapses; triggering an explosion which destroys the other ships in the hangar and causing the collapse of the Museum. The Freemakers escape before the Museum collapses with Roger vowing not to forget R0-HK. Rowan manages to steal Naare's Jedi lightsaber and comments that the color is more suited to him.

When Graballa asks what they will do next since their transmitter has been exposed, Naare tells him not to worry because she now knows that the seventh and last Kyber Saber crystal is on the ice planet of Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
