Circa 1 ABY, she had trouble with a local member of the technology-hating Meatlump gang. The Meatlump Hrath Koo repeatedly came into her shop and smashed whatever she was working on. After several of these incidents, Monnro was fed up. She tracked Koo to a cave near Tyrena that the Meatlumps used as their base of operations. She couldn't attack the Meatlumps on her own, but she was lucky and met an adventurer who was working as an independent agent for CorSec. The adventurer was investigating a Meatlump attack on the starship captain Osto Grissom and agreed to help her with her problem. When the adventurer emerged from the cave again, Monnro was reliefed to learn, that Koo would no longer bother her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teilo Monnro was a Non-Player Character (NPC) in Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
