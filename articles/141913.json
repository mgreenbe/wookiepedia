However, in 6 ABY, soon after Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa arrived on Hanoon to retrieve the shards of the Vor'Na'Tu, an ancient and powerful Jedi artifact, they decided they needed to free the colonists on Hanoon and so they captured the Processor with a New Republic army. The New Republic forces infiltrated the Imperial base which held the Processor and used R2-D5 labor droids to take control of it. After keeping the Processor from being recaptured, the Republic army destroyed the remainder of the Imperial base on Hanoon, including Moff Yittreas' Fortress, and freed the colonists on Hanoon from the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Terraform Processor was first mentioned in the strategy guide to the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds.
