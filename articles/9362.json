A close confidant of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Boda and Jinn shared a fascination in the study of immortality. In the weeks leading up to the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, Count Dooku, former Jedi Master and leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, traveled to the isolated Gree Enclave to purchase a special pre-Republic era solar sail for his personal solar sailer. Reports of Dooku's presence in the Enclave reached the Galactic Republic as well as the Jedi, but only after his departure from the Gree worlds.
