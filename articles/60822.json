Unwilling to risk exposing the entire village to a rakghoul attack, Trewin reluctantly refused.

Revan and Carth Onasi's combat skills were more than a match for the rakghoul, and Hendar was reunited with his wife."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He, like all the other Outcasts, left for the Promised Land when Revan later brought back enough evidence for Rukil, the village elder, to deduce its location.
