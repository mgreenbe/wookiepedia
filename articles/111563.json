He arrived to help oversee the slaves placed aboard the Cr\u00e8che, a clustership. Wurth Skidder, a Jedi Knight, attempted to convince the yammosk that Randa was planning to assassinate Chine-kal, the Commander of the vessel, but the plan failed. When it was learned that the Hutts had betrayed the Yuuzhan Vong, Chine-kal slated Randa for execution, but Master Kyp Durron and Ganner Rhysode managed to rescue Randa at Skidder's request, and he helped them destroy the yammosk."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Trapped on Duro"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unable to return to Nal Hutta, Randa fled to Duro, where the New Republic had established its SELCORE operations following the Yuuzhan Vong conquest of his homeworld. He attempted to secure his own safety, and at one point unwittingly revealed himself again as a traitor to the Yuuzhan Vong when he informed the senator of Kuat, Viqi Shesh, that there were Yuuzhan Vong spies operating in the biodomes. Shesh herself was a traitor and merely passed the information on to her superiors. When the Yuuzhan Vong invaded Duro itself, Randa was one of the first to be captured alongside Administrator Leia Organa Solo. During an attempt to reach the mining laser and kill himself along with several of the enemy, Randa was apprehended. He failed since Leia had coded the laser to her voiceprint."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, when Warmaster Tsavong Lah tried to sacrifice Leia to the Slayer God Yun-Yammka, Randa lashed out at the Warmaster with his enormous tail, knocking out several guards.

The Warmaster and Nom Anor then ordered their troops to take the body of Randa to the kitchens for studying."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R. K.
