Although members of the Galactic Republic wanted public executions, the Jedi leaders were inclined to banish the rogue Jedi into the Unknown Regions in hopes that with time they would see the error of their ways. The fallen Jedi were stripped of their arms and armor and loaded into unarmed transports on a barren world by their Jedi captors.

Guided through the Stygian Caldera by Sorzus Syn, who had spent years collecting rumors about the legendary Kingdom of the Sith, they eventually reached Korriban, a planet strong in the dark Side of the Force and home to the Sith people. They awed the primitive species with their display of dark side power and forged an alliance with the Sith king's Shadow Hand to gain the confidence of the king Hakagram Graush, and then overthrew him. They declared themselves rulers of the Sith people and became known as the Lords of the Sith, with their leader being called the Jen'ari, or \"Dark Lord\" of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the Exiles, however, were not satisfied to rule the Sith and wait to gather their strength.
