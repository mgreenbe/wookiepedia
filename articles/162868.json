When AP-5 asks Chopper what Zeb does, the astromech droid beeps that they never really figured it out, and Zeb growls in anger. When Zeb asks AP-5 what he does, the RA-7 protocol droid says that he will take the opportunity to conduct a thorough inventory of the base's munitions supply depot. AP-5 asks for help, but Chopper is not interested.

Zeb pushes AP-5 aside in annoyance and heads off to the command center to do some \"commanding.\" There, a communications officer informs the Lasat that they have been tracking several meteors which have been impacting the surface near Chopper Base. One of them knocked out a perimeter sensor in Sector 6. The officer asks whether they should send a unit, but Zeb says he will go and have a look.

Zeb thinks the marker was damaged by krykna, and soon discovers a protocol droid trapped between two dead krykna. Zeb marvels at how the droid got here, and remarks that it doesn't look Imperial. He thinks they should take it back to base for repairs, while Chopper advocates trashing the droid. Unaware that they have discovered an infiltrator droid, Zeb disagrees and carries the droid on his shoulders back to the landspeeder. Zeb also reminds Chopper that Hera placed him in charge.

Kallus replies that if they chased down every temporary comm failure, they would have little time to do anything else. He tells the officer to wait another cycle to hear back from the droid before they do anything."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at Chopper Base, AP-5 laments the disorganized state of the depot and remarks that the Empire was at least more organized. Shortly later, Zeb arrives with the infiltrator droid and asks if he can identify the model. AP-5 thinks that the droid is an old protocol droid, and charges it up. Due to the emergency restart, the protocol droid starts to revive quickly.

Kallus has become disillusioned with the Empire and is aiding the rebellion. Fulcrum's recorded message warns the rebels that the Empire is using infiltrator droids to sweep the Outer Rim Territories for rebel bases, and that the droids appear harmless in protocol mode. Looking at the schematics, Zeb is horrified to realize that the new droid is an infiltrator. Fulcrum also warns that one of the droids failed to report in recently, and that the Empire will come looking for it if it fails to establish contact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at the munitions depot, AP-5 leads the infiltrator droid and Chopper on a tour. He tells the droid to categorize everything and thinks that they will get along famously, stating that they will soon have the rebel base in tip-top shape. The infiltrator droid, reacting to AP-5's use of the phrase \"rebel base,\" begins repeating it just as Zeb enters the depot with his bo-rifle. Zeb tells AP-5 to step away from the droid because it is an Imperial recon droid. The infiltrator, remembering, identifies itself as EXD-9 and proceeds to transform into its attack mode. After identifying AP-5, Zeb and Chopper as rebels, the droid proceeds to attack them with its long grappling arms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid leaps on top of a raised bridge and jumps on top of Zeb, who fires his bo-rifle repeatedly.

Chopper electrocutes the infiltrator from behind, but EXD-9 hurls him against several containers. Zeb then shoots off part of EXD-9's left hand. The infiltrator runs away, and Zeb helps Chopper up.

Zeb and his comrades try to track down the infiltrator using the leaking fluid, but instead find a wrecked astromech droid. AP-5 states that the astromech has been drained of its power and its parts cannibalized. Zeb thinks that EXD-9 is repairing itself, and asks Chopper to track the droid's energy reading.

Putting their plan into action, Chopper searches for the infiltrator. He soon finds EXD-9 salvaging a GNK-series power droid and calls out to it.

AP-5 says that he can't detect any long-range communications, and reasons that the droid hasn't been able to reveal their location to the Empire. When Zeb asks about the bad news, the droid's chest opens to reveal a countdown. AP-5 reveals that the droid has activated its anti-capture failsafe, and states that it probably contains a proton warhead as well, which Zeb points out could vaporize the base. When Zeb asks how much time is left on the countdown, AP-5 tells him it's only twenty seconds.

He proposes sending EXD-9 back to the Empire, and asks AP-5 if he can tamper with the warhead and set the countdown to reactivate when it reconnects with the Imperial network. AP-5 thinks that is possible, and asks Zeb what he is planning. Zeb explains that they will send EXD-9 back to the Empire with the data, but set the droid to explode and destroy the other infiltrator units so the Empire won't know which droid blew up."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AP-5 says he can try to do it, and remarks that he is stunned by Zeb's ingenious plan.

After Chopper mumbles, AP-5 completes the main system restart, and the three rebels take cover. EXD-9 reverts to its disarmed state and wakes up.

When AP-5 fusses that he may not have properly reset the droid, Zeb reassures him that while they may not like each other, he commends AP-5 for doing his job.

Hera tells Zeb it will have to wait, as they go to hear the message. As they leave, Kanan asks Chopper what he means when he says that he had nothing to do with that. Fulcrum congratulates the rebels for reprogramming the Infiltrator droid he had warned them about, and for setting it to self-destruct. Fulcrum expresses his admiration for them.

Kallus and Thrawn agree that the rebel plan was ingenious. Kallus observes that the Grand Admiral is in good spirits despite the setback. Thrawn explains that despite the loss of the infiltrator droids, it was hardly a setback, because it means that the rebels are almost certainly on one of the systems the droids were sent to, narrowing down the rebel base's possible location to ninety-four systems from over a thousand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cast"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
