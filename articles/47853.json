Despite this, Bobb assembled a set of supercommando armor and became a mercenary and bounty hunter, undertaking special assignments on behalf of the Galactic Empire. Competent and ruthless, he had no trouble using torture methods such as the Burning during his hunts and even carried illegal disruptors. Bobb's most high-profile capture was the serial killer Kardem, who was, in reality, the fallen Jedi Vydel Dir'Nul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime prior to 0 BBY, Imperial Intelligence contracted Bobb and nine other bounty hunters to assist in the recovery of an I2-CG droid that had ejected from a Plexus Droid Vessel over the planet Goratak III while carrying information on an Alliance to Restore the Republic starfighter manufacturing operation on the planet Tar Morden. The bounty hunters were used to augment the Imperial force of two cold assault stormtrooper squads. The Alliance sent in a force of three squads to obtain the droid, assisted by the ex-pirate captain Grindol Maal and Wuwuhuul, a Thuwisten of the Tyia. The two forces clashed for control of the droid. During the engagement, Bobb was killed by Alliance Special Operations soldier Jodo Kast, who believed that Bobb was the notorious bounty hunter Boba Fett. After killing Bobb, Kast realized that anyone mistaken for Fett would have a tremendous advantage as a freelance bounty hunter; Kast took Bobb's armor and defected from the Alliance to begin his own bounty hunting career."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Feskitt Bobb had bluish-green skin and white eyes.
