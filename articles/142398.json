He believed that he could achieve this by using the Force energy of Caeleb, a Force-sensitive child who had been referred to in an ancient prophecy as the \"Child of Light.\" Rystra also eventually found a Force-sensitive Whiphid, Tol Skaros, who worked as an enforcer for the Hutts. Thaum sensed how strong Skaros was in the Force and offered to take the Whiphid as his apprentice. Skaros agreed, and Thaum trained him to use the dark side of the Force. After training Tol as a Dark Jedi, Rystra prepared to send his apprentice on dangerous assignments to hunt and fight other Force-users, known as Jedi. Skaros refused to learn how to use a lightsaber like most Dark Jedi; instead he would buy various weapons to fight the Force users."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rystra sent his apprentice to the world Dalicron-4 to capture Caeleb.
