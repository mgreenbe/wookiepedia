In the second, the ship is stopped midflight by Darth Vader using the Force, only to be let go when R2-D2 uses its onboard cannons to blast at Vader, who then sends a squadron of TIE/LN starfighters after it into space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
