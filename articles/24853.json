Three of them, led by a tall, cloaked Human, pulled their blasters on the group and demanded their money. Thannik opened fire, wounding the leader, and avoided the return fire. In the meantime, his companions fled to a nearby cantina, where they found themselves surrounded by more armed individuals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both of Rees' appearances are game play examples in Bill Smith's 1996 roleplaying game book Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded, published by West End Games.
