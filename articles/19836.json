Among their membership was the Lepi Jaxxon, who learned his marksmanship while doing jobs with the group. However, on a mission to the Corporate Sector, they were double-crossed, and the band was scattered. One of Jaxxon's rivals, a H'nemthe named Dafi, lost his starship and a finger on each hand in the botched Corporate Sector run, blaming Jaxxon for it and turning from rivalry to bitter enmity. The disastrous mission put an end to the Boys of Corus, and they disbanded, going their separate ways. After leaving the group, Jaxxon returned to Nar Shaddaa and pursued a career as a smuggler, eventually buying the Rabbit's Foot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"boys of Corus\" is a reference by \"The Starhoppers of Aduba-3\" author Pablo Hidalgo to Bugs Bunny, the cartoon character that Jaxxon was based upon. The name is an allusion to the \"Boys of the Chorus\", a memorable line which Bugs Bunny says several time in the Looney Tunes short, What's Up, Doc?. In telling his life story, Bugs refers to several of his stage performances, only for it to be revealed that in each he was a chorus boy, coming on stage only to sing the exact same lines, \"Oh, we're the boys of the chorus / We hope you like our show / We know you're rooting for us / But now we have to go!\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
