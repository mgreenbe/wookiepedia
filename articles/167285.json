The beliefs that the invasion was divinely ordained and that the galaxy was theirs by right were reinforced by Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane and the priest caste, the conduits to the gods all Yuuzhan Vong worshiped. Thus the species attacked with ferocity, their invasion stalling only once the fleet, under command of Warmaster Tsavong Lah, had overextended itself. A vendetta against Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order, a heretical movement brewing among the lower castes, and rumors that their long-destroyed homeworld haunted the Unknown Regions were only a few of the factors which caused the stagnation of the Yuuzhan Vong empire. After their swift advance, technological parity soon emerged between the New Republic and the Yuuzhan Vong. The Mandalorians led by Boba Fett joined the Yuuzhan Vong empire in it's quest to conquer the galaxy, this however was a ruse and the Mandalorians were actually double agents, later joining the rest of the forces defending the galaxy.

This dangerous end to the war was averted when Zonama Sekot, a seed of the lost living homeworld of the Yuuzhan Vong, emerged over Coruscant, its arrival precipitating the final battle of the conflict. Skywalker and other leading Jedi, who had located Zonama Sekot and urged its return, defeated Shimrra Jamaane and the true master of the Yuuzhan Vong, Onimi, during the battle, while fleets of warships clashed once more in space. The Yuuzhan Vong War ended with the deaths of the Supreme Overlord and the surrender of Warmaster Nas Choka's armada. The resulting Sekot Accords, which stipulated disarmament and amnesty for the Yuuzhan Vong, proved deeply unpopular for many; both the Yuuzhan Vong, and the aftermath of their devastating war, played a major role in events to come."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Cremlevian War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tens of thousands of years before the Battle of Yavin, the Yuuzhan Vong were a Force-sensitive species dwelling on the sentient, living world of Yuuzhan'tar in a distant galaxy.

The resulting conflict known as the Cremlevian War saw the destruction of many planets. It came to a close around 15,000 BBY, when Yo'gand used a technique that was later named after him, to drop a moon on the planet Ygziir, which was allied with Steng. The tactic destroyed the planet, and killed many of the leaders of Steng's faction, who were stationed on Ygziir. Steng was also killed in the battle, bringing the war to an end. The war left the Yuuzhan Vong's galaxy ruined; the Yuuzhan Vong living homeworld of Yuuzhan'tar was one of the worlds that had suffered. The war had turned the Yuuzhan Vong to violence, and Yuuzhan'tar stripped the bloodthirsty species of their ability to touch the Force. The Yuuzhan Vong began worshiping pain and espousing a philosophy of violence and death to all who opposed them.

By 3963 BBY, at least one Yuuzhan Vong scout had reached the outermost regions of the galaxy. In that year, a group of Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders under Canderous Ordo encountered a rock-like vessel later known as a Yorik-stronha, disguised as an asteroid in the Crispin system. It fled beyond the edge of the galaxy once discovered.

The Yuuzhan Vong soon learned that Zonama Sekot was no longer in its original system, and there was no evidence that the planet had been destroyed. Worried about the possibility of once more encountering Zonama Sekot, he developed the opinion that it would be best to move on to another galaxy. However, Jamaane, under the influence of Onimi and with the support of some of the more aggressive Yuuzhan Vong Domains, launched a coup.

Furthermore, sometime between being dispatched back to the Unknown Regions in 3 ABY at the time of the Battle of Hoth, and his return in 9 ABY, Mitth'raw'nuruodo, now serving the Empire as Grand Admiral Thrawn, encountered another advance Yuuzhan Vong force hiding in the Unknown Regions.

Anor was also responsible for infecting Mara Jade Skywalker and a hundred others with coomb spores, a fatal Yuuzhan Vong microorganism.

At the same time, Han Solo, along with his son Anakin and the Wookiee Chewbacca, had been on a delivery run for Lando Calrissian to the planet. Seeing the devastation being wrought by the moon, Anakin accompanied Sernpidal City's mayor to find the source of the problem.

The mayor sacrificed himself to kill the creature but this was too late to stop the moon from plummeting from the sky. Han, Chewbacca and Anakin managed to save many civilians, but while rescuing a small child, Anakin was knocked from the ship by some debris.

The New Republic Defense Fleet positioned itself to protect the major hyperlanes leading to the Core and Colonies (as well as the borders of the Bothan sector at the insistence of Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya) while the Republic built up its forces.
