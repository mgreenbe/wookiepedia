Seeking to cover up her unwilling role in the superweapon's destruction, Phasma proceeds to the nearest computer access point under the pretext of ascertaining how the First Order's shield defenses had been penetrated. As the starfighter battle above rages, Phasma navigates through the explosions and carnage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon reaching the computer she has used to lower the deflector shields under duress, Phasma deletes all records indicating that she had disengaged the shield defense under duress. While checking to see that nobody else has accessed the computer systems, Phasma discovers that Lieutenant Sol Rivas had accessed the defense shield files. In order to cover her complicity in the station's destruction, Phasma blames Rivas for lowering Starkiller Base's shields and proceeds to hunt him down.

They are accompanied by the BB unit BB-K8, who was performing a data update on TK-3465's fighter. After escaping the destruction of the planet, Phasma briefs TK-3465 about their mission to hunt down Rivas, claiming that he allowed Starkiller Base to be destroyed. Phasma then ends her audio report."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
