These tubes could be extended to create a tunnel between the ships, and retracted when no longer in use. Some boarding tubes were transparent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At times, the port area on either side of the tube needed to be repressurized before opening a port door to access the tunnel. If beings were inside when one side was disconnected, they could experience explosive decompression. These connections could be exploited to transfer an explosion within the tube to both conjoined ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
