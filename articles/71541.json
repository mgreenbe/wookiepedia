It depicted a stormtrooper looking onward as two TIE fighters fly by the stormtrooper across a starry sky, as well as the words \"Join the Imperial Army\" with the \"O\" being stylized to resemble the Imperial crest. Sabine Wren, a rebel artist, used Join as the basis for an anti-Imperial propaganda poster of her own, which featured graffiti and rebel symbols defacing Dunivee's poster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
