Amidst the possibility of an Imperial ceasefire with the New Republic, Devian and his followers seceded from the Remnant, feeling it strayed from the late Emperor Palpatine's original vision. Devian and his followers took control of a storehouse on the Class-6 planetoid RZ7-6113-23. The storehouse was secretly commissioned in the early days of Palpatine's rule, and was stocked with Clone Wars-era starships that officially ended production. Devian planned to build a military strong enough to topple both the New Republic and the Imperial Remnant. The so called \"hardliners\" of the Imperial Remnant dubbed themselves the \"Restored Empire\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The ambush"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While patrolling the sector containing RZ7-6113-23, the crew of the Endor intercepted two TIE/sr starfighters. Because of their short-ranged nature, the scouts' presence in the area led the captain of the cruiser to suspect an Imperial base in the area, and as such he ordered the crew to follow the TIEs from a distance. The two scouts diverted from their path and began heading to the planetoid's surface, confirming the captain's suspicions. However, as the crew of the cruiser detected a large energy spike originating from a cannon in the vicinity of the ground base, the captain realized they were led into a trap, and ordered an immediate retreat. However, he was too late to realize the error of his judgment, and the cruiser was destroyed by a single blast from the fully charged cannon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of the ambush, word of Devian's plot reached Vima-Da-Boda, a Jedi of Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order.
