During the elections in Bestine between Sean Trenwell and Victor Visalis, Orqiti encountered a spacer who she mistook as an individual interested in collecting influx capacitors. After listening to the Jawa for clarification, she learned that the spacer was not the one she was waiting for. Nonetheless, she used the chance to encourage the spacer to vote for Sean Trenwell as Bestine's Director of Commerce so that the marketplace in the city could thrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orqiti Aneofo was a Non-Player Character (NPC) in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies.
