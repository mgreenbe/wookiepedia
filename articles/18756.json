By the year 25,793 BBY, Bogan had been abandoned by the settlers and was used as a place of exile by the Je'daii Order for its members who had veered too much to the dark side of the Force.

These beliefs gave rise to a legend of the Je'daii Order which stated that the two moons were birthed by Tython from its fiery core in order to remind of the perpetual struggle between dark and light to all those who sought balance. In the second millennium following the settlement of Tython, the non-Force-sensitive Tythans colonized the moons, building stone cities there, and later settled the rest of the worlds in the star system.\nBy the year 25,793 BBY, Bogan had been abandoned by the settlers and was used as a place where the Je'daii would send those members of the Order who had strayed too far to the dark side of the Force. Those exiled Je'daii would meditate on the moon of Ashla in order to re-achieve balance between the two aspects of the Force, while, conversely, the Je'daii who had veered too much to the light side were sent to Ashla and contemplated the moon of Bogan."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Known Exiles"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first settlers of Bogan built cities on the moon, using stone as a building material.
