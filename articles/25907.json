Though a brave warrior, ready and willing to fight and die for his homeworld, he was ruthless in his viewpoints and preferred aggression over diplomacy.

They discovered the base empty, with multiple clone helmets mounted on spears. Cho and the Jedi also found an abandoned Separatist base on the planet but were convinced that there were droids around and that they could attack the party at any moment. Cho soon found out that Talz, a species which inhabited Orto Plutonia, were responsible for the attack and could be a threat to the Pantorans and supported military action against them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Chuchi did not respond well to Cho's actions, when he decided to go to war with the Talz and seize the planet for Pantora. Kenobi and Skywalker, who thought Cho was walking into a trap, gave the Pantoran chairman support through Clone Captain Rex and his squad, who accompanied Cho and his Pantoran warriors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, on Senator Chuchi's request, the Pantoran Assembly declared chairman Cho's actions \"out of order\" and instructed the senator to find a diplomatic solution with the Talz. Chuchi arrived in a Republic gunship to see Rex, Cho, and their forces pinned down and suffering casualties. Cho was heavily outnumbered and one of the Talz threw a spear in his back and mortally wounded him. He ordered Chuchi to wipe out the Talz with his dying breath, but Chuchi remained firm in her commitment to a peaceful solution. Cho died, but Chuchi's efforts were eventually met after speaking with the Talz chieftain Thi-Sen, who agreed to peace. He was succeeded as chairman by Papanoida."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chi Cho was a steadfast patriot of Pantora and venerated by his people for his long years of service in the Pantoran Assembly. He was an ally of the Republic, but was primarily focused on the governing of his people. Although a courageous soldier and a strong leader, Cho was arrogant and contentious in his dealings. As seen with the Talz, he considered any civilization he deemed lower than his own to be unworthy of recognition and adamantly refused to even consider negotiating, deriding them as savages. He was likewise curt and dismissive in his attitude towards Senator Chuchi's opinions, viewing her youth as a sign of inexperience and naivety, as well as those of the Jedi on the grounds that they were outsiders and he saw them only as potential tools of brute force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
