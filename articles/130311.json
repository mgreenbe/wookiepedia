Soon thereafter, the Stalker joined Death Squadron in its blockade of the planet during the Battle of Hoth.

This appears to have been based on dialogue between Captain Lorth Needa and a subordinate that did not make the final cut of the the radio dramatization of The Empire Strikes Back. However, the Star Wars Customizable Card Game later contradicted this, as did the PC program Star Wars: Behind the Magic and Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy. These three sources identify the Stalker as the Star Destroyer holding this distinction. Further adding to the confusion, Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary also identifies the Avenger as the Star Destroyer that launched the probe droid. Attempting to clarify the discrepancy, The Essential Atlas states that both ships were responsible for deploying probe droids, though does not state with absolute certainty which ship is seen in the film."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
