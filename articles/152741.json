In 3663 BBY, the assassin was tasked with the elimination of a Muun ambassador, and attempted to kill the target while in the middle of a crowd. However, the astromech droid T7-O1, who had been assigned to protect the Muun, fired a stun bolt into the crowd, and the assassin dropped their blaster and fled in the resultant chaos. The assassin was never caught, and the ambassador decided to resign in order to forestall any more assassination attempts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The GenoHaradan assassin was first mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011, during the conversation \"The Assassination\" with the Jedi Knight class companion character T7-O1.
