It was located on the edge of Koved City on Siluria III. Following the death of her husband at the hands of the Imperial occupation force, Adrimetrum formed a resistance cell using friends and family. Dovecote was used as their primary base, and it was their fallback point following the successful assault on Imperial Governor Quannith's mansion.
