This was not an official military conflict, however, as the Black Talon was simply a cargo and passenger vessel on it's way to the Sith capital world of Dromund Kaas.

An assault shuttle was also displayed in the Corellian Museum of Starships during the Cold War, and the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython used the shuttle to infiltrate the Korvalus Tower, Tyrelli Habitat, and the Gowix Corp superstructure to destroy the Firestorm Turbolasers there as part of a much larger mission to stop the Sith Emperor from completing his plans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
