Using ancient training droids and wild Arkanian dragons as opponents, Jeth educated his students in the ways of Lightsaber combat, Force techniques, meditation, and diplomacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many Knights passed through the praxeum's halls, including Ulic Qel-Droma, Cay Qel-Droma, and Tott Doneeta. During the Great Sith War, the Jedi High Council acknowledged Padawans Krynda Hulis and Barrison Draay's passage of the Jedi Trials and conferred upon them the rank of Knight. Along with the Knights stationed at the praxeum, Jeth formally knighted the pair, leaving out Padawan Haazen, as he had failed the Trials."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A two story structure made of lumber and stone, the praxeum building contained a main hall, which served to host knighting ceremonies, training bouts, and other events.
