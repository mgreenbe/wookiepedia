By the time of the Clone Wars, it had been long abandoned and the Liana Liberators traveled there in the space yacht Perihelion, to hide out there while they planned to slice into important computer systems in the Cularin system. While there, they reactivated some of the facility's systems, including the tractor beam and a large cutting beam. They used these to attack the Starchaser IV and Shiana Trist's Z-95 Headhunter when they arrived in the facility to try and capture the Liberators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
