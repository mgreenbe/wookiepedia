During the battle, the Yuuzhan Vong used the Mandalorian Protector mercenaries under Boba Fett to neutralize the spaceport on Birgis while the Yuuzhan Vong dealt with the New Republic forces. The defenses were wiped out and the Yuuzhan Vong warriors occupied the planet. During the battle, Fett was able to recruit a pilot to ferry intelligence to the nearest New Republic command, but the information carried by the pilot was not acted upon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 ABY, the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong fleet appeared in known space. At a rendezvous in the Outer Rim between Boba Fett's Mandalorian Protector mercenaries and the Yuuzhan Vong executor Nom Anor, Anor outlined his species' plans for their conquest of the galaxy. In return for the Yuuzhan Vong sparing the Mandalore sector during the invasion, the Mandalorians would serve them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On their first mission for the invaders, five days after the rendezvous, Fett and the Protectors were to create a diversion at a spaceport on Birgis, a planet the Yuuzhan Vong were planning to invade, with a view to terraforming it and taking the population as slaves. Agreeing to Anor's terms, but mindful of the threat the Yuuzhan Vong posed to his people and the rest of the galaxy, Mandalore Fett was already formulating plans to inform the New Republic of the Yuuzhan Vong's stratagems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A week after the opening battle of the Yuuzhan Vong War at the Outer Rim world of Helska IV, and shortly after the Yuuzhan Vong attack on the Seline system, Fett's forces commenced their operation on Birgis. Cognizant of the fact that the defenders on Birgis had sent out early warning craft and detected the Yuuzhan Vong advance, Fett and the Protectors set about distracting the spaceport's anti-aircraft gun, destroying the control tower, and generally causing enough disruption to allow the Yuuzhan Vong to effect a ground assault."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fett's lieutenant, Goran Beviin, encountered a pilot inside the facility and, along with fellow Mandalorians Briika Jeban and her daughter Dinua, managed to restrain her. Fett entrusted the pilot with vital intelligence to be ferried to the nearest New Republic command, and Mandalorian Cham Detta was chosen to escort her safely off-planet; while Beviin was quietly optimistic that New Holgha, a future Yuuzhan Vong target world, would be evacuated as a result, Fett was less certain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Detta was ordered to get the pilot to an operable ship nearby. Meanwhile, the local conglomeration of New Republic fleet elements, comprised largely of starfighters and ground forces\u2014including catering corps\u2014from conquered worlds along the invasion corridor, prepared to mount a defense from behind a barrier of wrecked speeders and repulsortrucks with a motley variety of weapons. As the Yuuzhan Vong warriors closed in, Fett's team withdrew. However, Beviin was curious as to how the Republic defenders had fared and discovered that they had been completely slaughtered. Birgis resultantly became part of the Yuuzhan Vong empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the conquest of Birgis, the main part of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet continued to invade worlds further along the Veragi Trade Route; the next being Bimmiel. However, some Yuuzhan Vong forces broke off to conquer Ord Janon. The intelligence dispatched by Fett to the New Republic was discredited, and the world of New Holgha consequently fell to the Yuuzhan Vong with little resistance as New Republic forces had been diverted elsewhere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle on Birgis first appeared in the eBook Boba Fett: A Practical Man, released in 2006 and written by Karen Traviss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
