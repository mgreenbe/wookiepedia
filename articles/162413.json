The droid was propelled by an effective unipod wheel supported by gyro-balance circuitry. The unipod's drive impellers generated enough power for quick bursts of speed ideal for use within confined spaces such as the floor of a dining establishment. In addition, the droid's design was embellished with a metallic skirt and matching head fins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid was fitted with more practical features, however, including a built-in order transmitter whose range could easily cover the interior of any diner or restaurant, and a vocoder allowing the droid to interact socially with patrons. Facial-recognition software enabled WA-7 units to recall customers' likenesses, and thus identify \"regulars\". The droid also sported a built-in comlink which could contact local authorities in some cases.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "WA-7 units remained in use throughout the Mondeo Modernist period and beyond, even into the era of the Clone Wars. By this point, although many still operated as waitresses, some WA-7 units took odd jobs such as courier work, and private collectors even entered a WA-7 team into the nuna-ball league. The WA-7 players defeated Serv-O-Droid's RIC droid team in a match in 22 BBY. Another notable unit was the WA-7 nicknamed \"FLO\", who operated in Dex's Diner in the last decades of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable units"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
