They wore a variant of the stormtrooper armor fitted with a rebreather pack. They wielded both an E-11 blaster rifle and a specialized heavy blaster. At the time of the Galactic Civil War, spacetroopers were part of the stormtrooper contingent aboard the Chimaera, the flagship of Grand Admiral Thrawn's Seventh Fleet. At one point, Thrawn ordered the deployment of a spacetrooper patrol in order to examine the hull of a wrecked way station. Spacetroopers were later used to patrol the outside of the Death Star, a moon-sized battle station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Spacetroopers appeared unidentified in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.
