This resulted in the fragmentation of the Fel Empire into two factions, one loyal to Fel and another loyal to the Dark Lord of the Sith.

Following the victory, the Sith attempted to destroy the Jedi Order by attacking the Jedi Academy on Ossus, against the express orders of Emperor Roan Fel. The Sith coup was secretly backed by a number of prominent members of the Imperial Moff Council including Grand Admiral Morlish Veed and Moff Nyna Calixte. However, Moff Calixte realized that with Fel gone, the Sith would no longer need the Moff's Council to control the Empire.

In retaliation for their assistance to Stazi, Darth Krayt retaliated by unleashing a genocidal purge against the Mon Calamari, exterminating one-tenth of them and ordering the rest to be placed in work camps.

He eventually escaped captivity and founded the One Sith order which adhered to the Rule of One. In contrast to the earlier Rule of Two which limited the Sith to one Sith Lord and one apprentice, Krayt's Sith order consisted of many Sith subservient to one Dark Lord. Though able to combat the effects of the seeds through his growing strength in the dark side of the Force, Hett was slowly losing his battle with them.

Despite being the most learned of Krayt's Order in Sith lore and ritual, Wyyrlok was unable to find a way to cure that which afflicted his Master. Thus, he consulted a holocron in his possession, one that belonged to an ancient Sith Lord named Darth Andeddu, who was known to have reanimated his flesh after his own death.

Using intelligence from the Sakiyan Naxy Screeger that indicated Isen was located on the planet Daluuj, they raided the Sith scientist's laboratory, but discovered a group of Imperial stormtroopers instead of Isen they were looking for. While Syn planted timed explosives, Skywalker and Sazen engaged a group of Sith before the last remaining Sith revealed to him the whereabouts of both the scientist and his planet-killing toxins. He also revealed only that Isen had previously used Daluuj as a base and had left no secrets behind. The raiding party left the Sith to die when the base exploded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several Mon Calamari survivors fled from their homeworld to Da Soocha in the remote Cyax system. The Hutt Azzim Anjiliac Atirue owned a spa at the Hutt Temple of Maya Armus on Napdu, the fourth moon orbiting Da Soocha. In response, the Sith Empire sent in the First Sith Imperial Strikeforce under Isen and Darth Azard to punish Azzim for sheltering Mon Calamari by bombing Da Soocha's oceans with deadly toxins. Upon arriving above Da Soocha's orbit, the War Hammer deployed its Sith-Imperial bombers of Squadron Quad Victor that would drop the deadly toxin into the oceans of Da Soocha; exterminating all life on that world. These bombers quickly accomplished their mission and return to the War Hammer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Azard also ordered the bombardment of Napdu and the secondary deployment of stormtroopers to mop up all possible survivors. Maya Armus was bombarded, killing most of the inhabitants including the Hutt Azzim. Several civilian freighters attempted to escape the Imperial attack but Darth Rauder, aboard her Sith Fury, ordered Skull Squadron to destroy them. On the ground, stormtroopers led by Sergeant Harkas eliminated the remaining survivors. One of his subordinates Corporal Trask showed disapproval of the ethics of his Sith masters' actions; but Harkas reasoned that they were only following orders and killed an injured survivor to support his argument."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the Hutt capital Nal Hutta, Azzim's uncle Vedo received a recording of the Sith atrocities on Da Soocha. He subsequently convened a meeting of the Hutt leadership on Nal Hutta to consider entering the war on the side of the Galactic Alliance Remnant and the Empire-in-exile. This was where Cade himself received a transmission from Queen Jool who requested the former's presence at this meeting.

Isen tried to escape while Cade gave chase. On the ledge, Isen ignited his lightsaber and fought Cade. During the duel, both sensed Darth Krayt, who had been resurrected, and soon after, Isen jumped into the sinkhole to release the vial. Cade leaped afterwards, and using the Force to catch up with Isen, sliced Isen in half before retrieving the vial containing the virus intended to eradicate Utapau, saving the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As of 139 ABY, the Temporary Archive for Integration of Materials Related to the Second Imperial Civil War was established on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Civil War is the primary backdrop for the stories of the Star Wars: Legacy series of comic books, with the exception of Issue 8, which depicts the Sith\u2013Imperial War and explains how it leads to the latter conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When asked whether the events in Broken were the same as the Sith\u2013Imperial War, John Ostrander replied that they were different wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
