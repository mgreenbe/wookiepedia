It came in a small, lightweight, nearly indestructible frame wrapped in weather-sealed polycarbonate. The M-300 was a favorite of professional hunters, and had also managed to find a niche among law enforcement snipers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hunting blaster employed trade-secret Galven and XCiter technology to achieve its intense and coherent stun blast in its class. It also came standard with an integrated telescopic sight, which possessed target assist and predictive trajectory software. However, the scope was so integrated into the weapon that it was nearly impossible to remove, and combined with a tamper-proof XCiter, made the M-300 one of BlasTech's least modifiable rifles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
