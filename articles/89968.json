Whenever a coralskipper, Kor Chokk, or even a worldship began to die, its organic material was fed to the miid ro'ik. The dying matter was converted into fuel for the warship's yaret-kors and other systems. Some of this material was also transformed into viscous secretions that oozed onto the vehicle's hull and hardened into gloss, black armored plates which could withstand blaster fire and collisions.\nThe remainder of the ship was composed of durable yorik coral, with several long coral arms sprouting from the vessel's sides. These red-and-blue arms latched onto coralskippers, transporting the starfighters through space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the warship's coralskipper complement could provide covering fire under attack, the miid ro'ik's main weapons consisted of sixty yaret-kors, arrayed across the hull, and often secreted within deep crags in the yorik coral."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition, the warship's hundreds of dovin basals\u2014which locked onto gravitational fields to pull the vessel through space\u2014could be used to drag enemy vessels closer to the deadly magma cannons, in much the same way as the New Republic employed tractor beams.
