Shortly after one of the rebels pulled off a public demonstration, she reported to their leader, Steela Gerrera, that King Sanjay Rash was going to execute the former king, Ramsis Dendup, in the square the following day. Later, she watched as Steela's sister Saw go on a rogue mission to rescue the king the night before his execution. She witnessed him get captured and reported back to Steela. She and a group of Onderon rebels, including Steela and Lux Bonteri freed Dendup during his execution as well as Saw. Unknown to Dono and the rebels, super tactical droid General Kalani had called for a squad of B2-series super battle droids and when Dono led the group of rebels away, the super battle droids arrived and shot her, killing Dono instantly. Her death would not be in vain as the rebels eventually succeeded in freeing Onderon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dono is voiced by Nika Futterman, who also voices Asajj Ventress in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
