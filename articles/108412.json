They could also be detonated with a timer or when a ship passed within the radius of an energy field around the mine. The only way to disarm a ground proximity mine was to crawl up to it and deactivate it. There were floating variants, which were deployed by Trade Federation starfighters during the Invasion of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Adi Gallia encountered these mines which were used in water by the Trade Federation. As part of the deal for the Prosecutor, the Trandoshans brought a huge supply of the mines and planted them throughout the ship. Delta Squad encountered many of them during the Clone Wars, as they were also used by the Trandoshans on Kashyyyk.
