He remains there to watch over Luke Skywalker; he and his sister, Leia, may be the last hope for the galaxy. One night after fulfilling his duty of watching Luke for the day he stops by a cantina, to see if he can pick up any news worth hearing. He only hears the usual gossip and exaggerations and begins to walk out the door. But at the last second he hears Ferus Olin's name mentioned. Ferus is running from the Empire (whereas Obi-Wan assumed he was dead), and Obi-Wan would love to help him, but is charged to stay and watch Luke. Troubled, he heads outside. He is confronted by Qui-Gon's ghost. After a brief conversation, Obi-Wan is convinced that his Master can watch over Luke long enough for Obi-Wan to help Ferus on the planet Bellassa. He receives a ride from Weasy, the pilot he heard the information from, and starts his desperate mission to find Ferus and revive the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His search first leads to Belassa, where Ferus was born. He heads to Olin and Lands, where a nearby tailor named Mariana tells him that the company is shut down and the owners are not there anymore.

Unfortunately that gravsled was the one that housed the street kid he met earlier, and forced to take over the vehicle learns that his name is Trever Flume. Eventually, his investigation leads him to the hospital that housed Roan Lands, Olin's partner in business. He eventually finds out where Olin lives and finds him.
