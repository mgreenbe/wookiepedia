Circa 0 ABY, Bloodhawk owned a spaceport with repair facilities, and employed a Ky'lessan by the name of Snake-Eyes. Snake-Eyes kidnapped Bloodhawk and kept her in her rooms, taking the command of the port. Snake-Eyes kept H2-1B4 around and pretended that Bloodhawk was on a leave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bloodhawk's friend returned at that point, needing repairs on a ship. Snake-Eyes informed the Empire about their presence, and also sabotaged their ship so they could not leave easily while pretending to repair it. H2-1B4 noticed the old friend's presence and risked being discovered to tell them about Snake-Eyes's treachery and Bloodhawk's predicament, asking them to rescue its mistress. H2-1B4 also offered its help in the rescue should it be necessary, and Bloodhawk was subsequently rescued. During the escape from the spaceport, H2-1B4 helped Bloodhawk to repair her friend's ship so they could lift-off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
