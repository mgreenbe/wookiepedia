It was located in a mountainous area, underground, and accessible via a passage underneath one of the planet's omnipresent rock spires. It was decorated with cave paintings done by the ancient people of Lothal, depicting people following Loth-wolves. In 1 BBY, three wolves led the Rebels Ezra Bridger, Kanan Jarrus, Sabine Wren, Garazeb Orrelios and Ryder Azadi to the den, helping them flee the forces of the Galactic Empire. When the Empire began bombing the mountain range, the wolves mystically transported the five Rebels from the den to a cliff dwelling halfway across the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
