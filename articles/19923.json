In the movie, the individual was seated at the table appearing at the start of the cantina scene. The mustachioed individual appeared in only one of the pick-up shots, and was quickly covered by Hem Dazon's head after it moved into the frame. The filming of this table was part of supplemental shooting for the cantina scene filmed in the city of Los Angeles in the United States after principal photography was completed. The masks used for the supplemental shoot were slip-on, made of rubber, and designed by makeup artists Rick Baker and Laine Liska. The mustachioed individual was based on a mask known as \"Terminal Man,\" one of Baker's pre-existing designs, which was an attempt by Baker to create an original Halloween mask of Frankenstein's monster."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Nameless"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the late 1990s, fans had nicknamed the character \"Fu Manchu\" due to his mustache, but no official source had named him. Leland Chee, the Lucasfilm official who maintains the Holocron continuity database, stated on the StarWars.com forums that he believed the individual's mask was the same as that of another character in the cantina named Trinto Duaba, with the addition of a mustache. This fact was confirmed by Rick Baker in an Official Star Wars Blog entry written by Pablo Hidalgo and posted on StarWars.com on September 26, 2012. However, Baker was unaware who put the mustache on the character's face, which he viewed as a stupid idea. Another one of the cantina makeup artists, Nick Maley, did not view the character as a high-quality design, and was one background character that he hoped people would not look at too closely."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Celebration VI naming"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On August 25, 2012, the mustchioed individual was given a name as part of Pablo Hidalgo and Tom Spina's \"Behind the Scenes of the Cantina\" panel at Celebration VI, a Star Wars convention held from August 23 to August 26 in Orlando, Florida. In order to have some control over the name of the character, Hidalgo and Spina formed the individual's last name\u2014\"Bakiska\"\u2014from the names of Episode IV artists Rick Baker and Laine Liska. During the panel, cards for Tom Spina's design company, which were decorated with the face of another cantina character known as \"Snaggletooth,\" were handed out to the audience. One fan received a card with a mustache drawn on the character's face, which was Hidalgo and Spina's way of selecting a fan to form the character's first name. An audience member named Brandon Connors received the special card, and Hidalgo formed the character's first name \"Braconner\" from Connors' name, although the spelling differed because Hidalgo did not verify the spelling of the fan's name. As a prize for winning the contest, Connors also received a replica of the character's mask made by Tom Spina Designs during the panel. After the original naming at the panel, Tom Spina and Pablo Hidalgo changed the character's name to \"Braconnor Bakiska\" in order to better represent the spelling of Brandon Connors' name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On September 26, 2012, Hidalgo wrote an official Star Wars Blog entry discussing the process of naming and researching the character. The blog post confirmed that Bakiska was a male, and clarified that Bakiska's character used the same mask as Trinto Duaba, who was identified as a Stennes Shifter in the 1997 Star Wars Adventure Journal 12 article \"Shape-shifters.\" This identification confirmed that Bakiska was a Stennes, but it did not confirm him to be a Stennes Shifter, since they looked the same as the Stennes species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
