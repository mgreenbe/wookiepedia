Rackus originally joined the Rebellion at age sixteen, well before the Battle of Yavin, after stealing his first starship from his father and crashing it on a Rebel-held planet. Rackus convinced his Rebel captors of his loyalty to their cause and went on to fly raids for the Alliance for many years, although he always carried with him a bad recollection of his father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mazer Rackus was born on the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth sometime before 16 BBY.

He had pinkish-white skin, red eyes, and long lekku extending from his cranium. However, rather than the luxurious robes traditionally worn by Twi'leks, Rackus usually wore a standard flight suit. He also had a taste for spending money."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although loud and brash, Rackus demonstrated unusual sensitivity for a Twi'lek, hating to see anything beautiful damaged. He was also particularly sensitive of his piloting abilities, and nothing ever happened by accident. Rather than admitting to pilot error, for example, Rackus had an excuse waiting to explain his mishap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rackus adored speed and risk-taking, as long as it did not cause his ship to crash. He was glad to engage in dogfights with enemy TIE fighters but made sure to avoid Imperial capital ships. He did not necessarily fear death, but he knew capital ships had enough firepower to imperil him and potentially cause another crash, which prompted Rackus to recall wincing thoughts of his father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rackus possessed mechanical ability in astrogation, repulsorlift operation, starfighter piloting, and starship gunnery.
