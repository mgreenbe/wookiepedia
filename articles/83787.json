During the Galactic Civil War, it served as a bar and its proximity to the pilot's lounge made it a popular location for off-duty pilots, as well and many of the engineering and administrative crew who worked in that quadrant. The room was darkened to accommodate the Quarren crew members and tables and chairs were made to glow pink in the dark."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
