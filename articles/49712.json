Circa 31 BBY, Maduk landed the Fool's Paradise in Hedrett on the planet Cularin, from where he planned to use the starship to transport a cargo of technical equipment to a research station on the nearby planet Almas. However, Maduk was attacked by a group of Believers led by the Dark Jedi Gar Granga and Kosa-Yin Hadu, who attempted to capture the Fool's Paradise. The Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents, intervened and defeated the Believers, and the agents subsequently escorted Maduk and the Fool's Paradise to Almas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
