Instead, Panaka ordered them to liberate Theed citizens from the Penladen detention camp. After disabling the shield generator protecting the camp, Varqom witnessed Theed gentry destroying B1-Series battle droids with their bare hands as they escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many years later, Varqom's memoirs were recorded in the 2,453th volume of the Royal Archives of Naboo. Remembering the Trade Federation's battle droids, he still harbored a deep distrust for droids.

Varqom also boycotted products manufactured by Neimoidians, Duros or from corporations that aided both sides of the Clone Wars, such as Tagge Company and the ones based on Balmorra and Kuat. The guard preferred to buy from within the Chommell sector. His great-granddaughter Lesia deemed him \"old-fashioned.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jason Fry, writer of The Essential Guide to Warfare, eventually cut any mentioning of Pars Varqom in the final product.

For Varqom's story, Fry took inspiraton from World War II veterans he knew who swore to never buy cars made in Japan after the conflict."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
