As the only surviving Sith, Bane recognized that Sith infighting had weakened them to the point that the Jedi could destroy them. To rectify this, Bane reformed the Sith and created the Rule of Two, mandating that there could be only two Sith\u2014a Master and an apprentice\u2014at any given time. These new Sith would begin a plot to destroy the Jedi and conquer the galaxy in secret. With Bane's defeat, rumored to have been caused by his apprentice, Darth Zannah, on the Inner Rim world of Ambria, the Jedi wrongly believed that the Sith were defeated with him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vendetta Bane held against the Jedi was fulfilled during the Clone Wars, when Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and a follower of the Rule of Two, transformed the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY and destroyed the Jedi Order. However, the victory was short-lived, as the redeemed Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, formerly the Sith Lord Darth Vader, defeated the Sith twenty-three years later, and the order was finally destroyed upon Sidious' final death in 35 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Establishing the Rule of Two"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hailing from Apatros, Darth Bane was a legendary Dark Lord of the Sith who lived during the dark age of the Old Republic, a thousand years before the Clone Wars. In his time, the Sith were often fueled by their own individual lusts for power, with squabbling Sith turning against their own. While serving in the Sith Empire, known as the Brotherhood of Darkness, Bane realized that infighting and greed from other dark side warriors created a weakness. The infighting eventually led to the defeat of their dark side order in 1032 BBY, as the Jedi Order was able to all but destroy the weakened Sith. Bane was the sole survivor of the Jedi-Sith War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Recognizing that the old Sith traditions were a dead end, Bane created a new Sith philosophy that succeeded the older and purer doctrine of the dyad in the Force, a rare and powerful Force-bond that existed between two individuals. Bane's Rule of Two mandated that there could be only two Sith at a given time: a Master to embody power and an apprentice to crave it. Only by slaying their Master could the Sith apprentice gain that title and take on their own apprentice, or the master could train another apprentice and have them kill and replace their outgoing apprentice. These Sith would favor the shadowy tactics of trickery and scheming to destroy their enemies rather than outright force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Called the Grand Plan, the plot's aim was to corrupt the Galactic Republic from within, diminish and disgrace the Jedi Order, and eventually rise and conquer the galaxy; in other words, softening up the Jedi before zeroing them in for total subjugation. Believing that this new principle would prevent the power of the dark side from destroying the Sith Order, Bane took on an apprentice of his own, Darth Zannah, and began passing on his knowledge. The Jedi learned of Bane's new philosophy and, with Bane's defeat, falsely believed that they had destroyed the Sith forever. However, Bane's plans continued through his apprentice. Although the historical records were not accurate about the identity of Bane's apprentice or how Bane died, it was rumored that Bane was finally killed on the Inner Rim planet of Ambria by Darth Zannah in a duel, a pattern that was repeated by nearly all Sith thereafter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Bane's death, his remains were placed in a sarcophagus in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Moraband, the ancient Sith homeworld.

These plans continued through Darth Sidious, publicly known as Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, who engineered the Clone Wars to gain more power over the Galactic Republic. He also manipulated the war, fought between the Republic and the Separatist Alliance, to make the Jedi compromise their ideals, as they served as leaders in the Grand Army of the Republic. Doing so would allow him to justify his eventual destruction of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war, Jedi Grand Master Yoda ventured to Moraband on a journey to discover the secrets of immortality. He entered Bane's tomb and encountered a fiery vision of the ancient Dark Lord. As part of Yoda's trial to learn the power of immortality, the vision attempted to convince the Jedi Master to turn to the dark side. Yoda refused, remarking that Bane was dead and that what appeared before him was simply an illusion who had nothing to offer.

Sidious declared himself Emperor and reformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire. To destroy the Jedi, Sidious issued Order 66, a command implanted in the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic to kill the Jedi as traitors. In addition, Sidious seduced to the dark side Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, believed by the Jedi to be the Chosen One of prophecy who would destroy the Sith.

In order to preserve the Sith as its last survivor, Bane adopted the Rule of Two, believing that limiting the number of Sith to one Master and one apprentice would allow the Sith to survive in secret so they could plot their revenge against the Jedi.
