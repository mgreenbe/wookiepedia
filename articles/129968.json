Separating from the rest of the group (much to Typho's chagrin), Amidala and Retrac begin to mingle, hoping to gain more information into the matter. Noticing that Drexx is being pulled over by Separatist leader Passel Argente's uncle, Amidala and Retrac follow, ignoring C-3PO's plight at the hands of an overzealous droid lover. Climbing up the stairs, the two women dispose of their dresses to reveal bodysuits, prepared for action."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Disposing of several guards using various means, the two reach Drexx's tower. They must split up when they find a split end, and Amidala ends up finding Drexx, about to accept a case of gold from Argente's uncle. Amidala's camera is spotted by the pair, who promptly send their guards after her. Tricking the burly men with her weak, feminine appearance, Amidala escapes into a speeder piloted by Retrac. Back in Organa's apartment, they are pleased to find that the incriminating video can be used to punish Drexx for his betrayal. It's only when C-3PO is credited for his help that a look of horror pass their faces: the droid has been left to suffer with the droid lover from the previous night."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
