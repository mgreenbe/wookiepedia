What was known was that Orloc was a former Imperial Intelligence agent masquerading as a Prophet of the Dark Side. He was also one of the few survivors of the massacre performed on the false Prophets by Grand Admiral Afsheen Makati."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following that, Orloc fled to the shadowy asteroid of Borgo Prime where he fell in with criminals and eventually ran his own crime organization. Orloc also had several pirates and smugglers at his service including a gang of Ranat mercenaries and pirate droids. In 22 ABY, Orloc learned from an unknown source that the lightsaber of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was kept within Bast Castle on remote Vjun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along with his henchmen, Orloc departed for Vjun. However, upon arriving at the chamber where the Jedi artifact was kept, he encountered the Jedi teacher Tionne Solusar and her students Anakin Solo, Tahiri Veila, and Uldir Lochett, and the Kushiban Jedi Master Ikrit. Orloc claimed to be a Mage that was skilled in the Force. However, the two parties were not able to agree and a fight broke out. During the confrontation, Orloc's henchmen managed to steal Kenobi's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response, the Jedi pursued Orloc and his henchmen on a chase through Bast Castle. During a confrontation, Orloc easily defeated Ikrit in lightsaber combat since the Kushiban had no lightsaber at all. He also deceived Uldir by claiming to train him all the Force skills he desired. However, the other Jedi managed to rescue Uldir and escape Bast Castle, along with Kenobi's lightsaber and the holocron of the ancient Jedi Master Asli Krimsan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite having escaped Orloc, Uldir still believed that the Mage would be able to awaken the Force powers within him, which nobody at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 had been able to do so. Uldir then stole Ikrit's ship Sunrider (named after Nomi Sunrider) and the two Jedi artifacts recovered during the previous adventure at Bast Castle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He eventually found Orloc at an abandoned space station called Exis Station, where Tionne had met Luke Skywalker years earlier in her search for relics. Having arrived at the derelict space city, Orloc took Uldir as his student. The Mage had already set up his base on the moon and planned to create his own Jedi Order. In reality, Orloc had no Force powers but had actually used high-tech gimmicks to deceive others with demonstrations of so called \"Force power\". Uldir did not realize it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately for Orloc, Uldir's Jedi companions Tionne, Ikrit, Anakin and Tahiri set out to find Uldir on their transport Lore Seeker and eventually found Exis Station. Having arrived, they tried to tell Uldir that Orloc was a fraud and that he had been deceived. The Mage attacked the four Jedi with his high-tech gimmicks, who fought back by using the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the duel, Orloc wounded Tionne, and Ikrit, who had sworn not to wield a lightsaber until he had found worthy students, made his decision and joined Anakin and Tahiri in their fight. Uldir then saw that Orloc was little more than a charlatan who used technology to deceive others with false demonstrations of Force prowess. Together, the Jedi defeated Orloc. He escaped and was never heard of again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
