It was a popular and busy location for both the higher echelons of Coruscant society and those engaged in more sinister activities. The club had a central bar which offered drinks and various cutouts where patrons could place bets on sports activities occurring across the galaxy such as podracing and grav-ball. Since the bar was located in a less developed region of the Entertainment District, many illegal activities were proudly displayed here. Criminals and other individuals who did not want to garner attention would use the club and surrounding areas to sell illicit goods such as death sticks. Fugitives often used the constant crowds moving in and out of the club to shake pursuit. Patrons of the nightclub wore flamboyant outfits, designed to grab attention on the dance floor or at the gambling tables. Colors that caught the eye were always popular, as were sheer or metallic fabrics."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Outlander was once a small and stylish establishment that catered to high class individuals.
