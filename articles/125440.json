He asks why BB-8, rolling around his feet, is so excited when the sun isn't even up yet. Kaz remarks that the machine is broken again. Just then, Tam walks up and pushes him aside, pressing the correct button. Kaz thanks her, only for Tam to take the caf for herself. Kaz and BB-8 follow Yeager aboard a Star Commuter 2000.
