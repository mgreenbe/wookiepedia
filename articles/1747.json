The Galactic Empire utilized the vehicle most notably during its occupation of Lothal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aratech's 614-AvA was a small, fast, lightweight speeder bike used by the Imperial Military. Designed initially as a portable, modular scout vehicle typically packed into a larger vehicle like a walker or a landspeeder, the 614-AvA was more akin to a swoop than to a full-fledged speeder bike. It consisted of little more than a combination repulsor drive-thruster pack, a control pod, and a set of variable-geometry control surfaces mounted to a pair of stout frame rails. The rails were telescopic, allowing the speeder bike to collapse to roughly a third of its full size with no need for tools. With the push of a button, the 614-AvA collapsed into a cube about a meter square; this feature allowed the 614-AvA to be easily shipped in bulk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Army ordered tens of thousands of 614-AvAs to be used by reconnaissance and military police units. For military use, the speeder bikes had some improvements, such as frame reinforcements, more powerful drive-thrusters, and a pair of light blaster cannons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Overall, the 614 had proven quite successful in Imperial service and had gained a reputation among its pilots as reliable, easy to work on, and easy to live with. The AvAs eventually were outgunned, outran, and out produced by the 74-Z speeder bike.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This militarized Imperial speeder bike model was used by Imperial combat drivers for rapid transit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The design of this speeder bike model was developed from an early illustration by concept artist Joe Johnston in 1979.
