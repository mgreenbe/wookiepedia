Fleet Support consisted of Fleet Support Base and Air Station in addition to its barracks, and was active after the outbreak of the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems at the First Battle of Geonosis. In the aftermath of the battle, Geonosis Forward Control called upon Fleet Support to receive twenty thousand injured clone troopers and an additional seventy-two thousand combat-fit troops, who were delivered via the Acclamator-class assault ship Implacable. A number of these troopers were accommodated by Fleet Support Base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fleet Support appeared in the 2004 novel Republic Commando: Hard Contact, written by Karen Traviss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
