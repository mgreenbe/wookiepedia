The grime-coated vehicle had seen better days by the time the family was visited by Director Orson Krennic; by this point, its directional thrusters were non-operational, and its repulsorcoils had corroded past reliability. Galen kept the speeder in order to salvage its conductor strips, and typically kept it mounted on blocks or struts to prevent it from sinking into the soil of the Erso's farm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
