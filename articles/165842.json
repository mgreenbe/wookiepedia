He was known as a great warrior, and wielded a powerful vibro-whip. Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered that Xist had information he needed in his mission to track down and redeem Asajj Ventress. Kenobi infiltrated Xist's estate, and upon finding the crime lord, engaged him in a duel. While Xist was skilled with his whip, he was prideful, and Kenobi handily defeated him. Knowing when he was beaten, Xist reluctantly gave Kenobi the coordinates to Drama Korr's freighter, saying that this was where Kenobi could find Ventress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
