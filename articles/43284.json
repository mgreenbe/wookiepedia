Little did Calrissian know that Gepta's flagship, Wennis, had orders to wipe out all life in the ThonBoka regardless of who won the duel. However, the Wennis was destroyed by Klyn Shanga and his fellow Renatasians before it had the opportunity to do so. The only place the deadly substance was known to exist after the battle was the otherwise dead surface of Tund."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The name of the technique that created the torpedo's payload is unknown, but the substance was called \"green flames\" or \"green death\" informally.
