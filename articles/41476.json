The quadrupedal reptiles were known to spook eopies, and they also exhibited aggressive tendencies towards sentients. Dune lizards were vertebrates with scaly skin, typically in subdued palettes of brown, though when held in captivity as pets, their skin could come in a variety of hues, including shades of red, yellow and blue. Dune lizards had yellow eyes, a long tail, and frills protruding from their back. A group of dune lizards was referred to as a pack, and there also existed a number of different subspecies. These included the armodragon, dragonet, rill, and scyk, all native to Tatooine. Many of these species of dune lizard were markedly similar in appearance. When vocalizing, dune lizards would emanate a hissing growl."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, circa 1 ABY, Imperial Custodial Officer Pfilbee Jhorn oversaw a number of pest control measures from his post in Bestine, capital of Tatooine.

Meanwhile, a Human chef by the name of Porcellus worked at the behest of Jabba Desilijic Tiure, a Hutt crime lord.

The facility was commanded by Colonel Bors Teraud along with the help of a loyal scientist named Doctor Knag. Together, the duo conducted cybernetics research on a number of different species, including dune lizards. A starfighter developed by MandalMotors known as the G1-M4-C Dunelizard fighter was named after the dune lizard. Dune lizards were also associated with the idiom, to \"kill two dune lizards with one throw.\" The Rebel Alliance hero and Tatooine native Luke Skywalker mentioned this saying to his droid R2-D2, while en route to the planet Honoghr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dune lizards appeared in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
