In the Ultimate Edition soundtrack, the theme is first heard in a jaunty form in \"Anakin Is Free\", as an action piece followed by a mellow variation in \"Qui-Gon and Darth Maul Meet\", and as a lament in \"The Tide Turns/The Death of Darth Maul\", which ends with a brief, triumphant version underscoring the arrival of Palpatine's shuttle on Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A brief reprise accompanied the vision of Qui-Gon in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"Overlords\".
