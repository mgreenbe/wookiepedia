He regularly traded with Jawas such as Het Nkik. Reegesk was not picky, and was willing to steal anything, even trash. His tribe needed power for their bootleg vaporator unit, so he went into Mos Eisley to look for a power source. He attempted to trade a Sand People battle idol to Nkik in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, during which he quietly stole the power source of Nkik's BlasTech Industries DL-44 for use with his tribe's vaporator, leading to the death of Nkik, not knowing his gun had no power during a shootout with stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reegesk was played by Sadie Eden."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
