These lenses further regulated the beam of a lightsaber, allowing the blade it produced to terminate at a given point. Different types of lenses yielded different properties in the lightsabers that they were built into; in addition, like most other parts of these weapons, they required skilled craftsbeings to produce though often they were available commercially or even salvageable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known types of specialized lenses"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though most works that reference lightsaber construction use a more complicated method, within Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, much like its predecessor, the process is markedly simplified. For instance, lightsaber construction is confined to a few simple parts and takes only \"a few hours\" to do, while most other canonical sources state that construction can take up to a few months, with many more parts needed besides.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
