The Resistance sent out a call for help to any allies able to help, but needed to buy some time, so the outpost's enormous main door was sealed shut and the Resistance forces prepared for battle. Captain Poe Dameron led a makeshift squadron of 13 V-4X-D ski speeders, left behind by the Alliance, and piloted by the few remaining Resistance pilots. Their plan was to  destroy the superlaser siege cannon the First Order had brought to put a hole in the main blast doors. This was flanked by AT-M6s and AT-ATs, with air support from TIE fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the battle ensued, the Resistance suffered heavy losses from the combined ground and air assaults, including the loss of the squadron's Nodin Chavdri and Ensign Pammich Nerro Goode. Unexpectedly, the Millennium Falcon arrived, piloted by Chewbacca and Rey, and drew the TIE fighters away from the battlefield. However, it wasn't enough as the First Order continued closer to overrunning the Resistance forces. As the siege cannon prepared to fire, Dameron ordered all speeders to fall back. Finn disobeyed and continued to fly his speeder towards the cannon in the hope of ramming it. At the last minute, Rose Tico crashed her speeder into Finn's, saving his life but injuring herself. With the base now vulnerable, the siege cannon fired at the main doors and created a hole. As the Resistance prepared for their final stand, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker appeared out of nowhere and faced off against Kylo Ren. This bought valuable time for the remaining Resistance forces to find a way out of the base and escape on the Millenium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Members"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Poe Dameron's makeshift squadron first appeared in the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, the second installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, however it did not receive a name in the film.
