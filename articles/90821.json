They had skin tones ranging from green and yellow to pink or purple. Most had traditional black geometric tattoos on their faces which symbolized personal achievements. The species had a strong connection with the natural world and typically believed in the Force. Mirialans included several members of the Jedi Order, including Jedi Masters Luminara Unduli and Cyslin Myr, the traitorous Padawan Barriss Offee, and the Seventh Sister, a fallen Jedi who hunted Great Jedi Purge survivors as a member of the Galactic Empire's Inquisitorius."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mirialans were a near-human species distinguishable by their yellow-green or pink colored skin and geometric facial tattoos. Though typical Mirialans had green or pink-colored skin, some had purple skin. Mirialan hair colors included black and brown, and their eyes could be brown, blue or purple. Mirialans were also incredibly flexible and agile, traits which aided them in activities such as lightsaber combat. As a near-human species, they were capable of reproducing with humans and having human-Mirialan hybrid offspring. Their natural habitat was desert or wastelands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though most members of the species got the traditional facial tattoos, not all did. More traditional Mirialan families felt strongly about the custom. Typically, these tattoos were done after a Mirialan completed a special task or achievement, and expressed the achievements or expertise unique to each Mirialan. Some appreciative of their species' culture considered the tattoos as merely status symbols. Because of her mixed heritage, the half-Mirialan Maize Raynshi considered either not getting the tattoos or only getting them on one half of her face. Eventually, Raynshi chose a tattoo design with the meaning of \"friendship.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mirialans were known for their spirituality and strong connection with the world around them.

However, he never got the chance, as he was atomized during the Great Hyperspace Disaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the time of the Galactic Republic the Mirialan Jedi Master Jor Aerith was a member of the Jedi High Council and trained Padawan Gretz Droom, who also became a Jedi Council member. The Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and her Padawan Barriss Offee were members of the Mirialan species. Another Mirialan who was once part of the Jedi Order was the Seventh Sister, one of Darth Vader's Inquisitors. It was a tradition among the Mirialan people that if any were to join the Jedi Order, they were compelled to take fellow Mirialans as their own Padawans, as in the case of Unduli and Offee. Despite this tradition, the Jedi Master Cyslin Myr chose the human Mace Windu as her Padawan. Another Mirialan, Synara San, once worked for the Warbird gang on the planet of Castilon, but eventually joined Team Colossus, and unofficially the Resistance, after opposing a mutiny staged by the pirate gang. The Mirialan Keo Venzee was a pilot for the New Republic's Vanguard Squadron.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mirialans first appeared in the 2002 canon Star Wars movie Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.
