Under the guidance of Professor Huyang, an Architect droid who had been teaching Jedi how to build a lightsaber for more than a thousand years, He showed different models of lightsabers and asked them to visualize what kind of lightsaber they wanted to build so that they could complete the construction of their lightsaber. Petro was the first one to finish building his saber and told Zatt that with his lightsaber, he would challenge Obi-Wan Kenobi to a duel and kill General Grievous. But after Huyang examined it, He noted that that the only person that Petro would kill would be himself as Petro incorrectly assembled his lightsaber because he inverted the emitter matrix which would cause the power grid to backfire. Huyang stated that if Petro tried to activate his lightsaber now that the only thing that would be left of him and his lightsaber would be his crystal. Huyang told Petro to start over and to follow the diagram."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But before Petro or any of the younglings could finish constructing their lightsaber, they were attacked by Hondo Ohnaka and his pirate gang.
