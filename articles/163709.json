Some were part of the 224th Imperial Armored Division on Mimban, a mining planet located in the Expansion Region. Owing to the planet's swampy environment, their armor was heavily customized to allow for optimal operation. Compared to standard stormtrooper armor, theirs had additional space between plates at the shoulders, hips, and knees, allowing for a greater range of movement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wet-weather gear stormtroopers were armed with E-11 blaster rifles, and some were equipped or customized their armor with bandoliers.
