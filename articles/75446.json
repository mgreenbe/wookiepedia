She eventually reached the rank of Jedi Knight in 1032 BBY, and participated in a dangerous Jedi operation into the Sith-controlled Grumani sector.

During her time on Chelloa, Holt earned the grudging respect of the narcissistic Daiman while gaining the animosity of Odion, following a climatic duel where he sustained serious wounds.

Following the defeat of the Dyarchy, Kerra and Rusher came into contact with the female Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra, who offered them refuge at her capital city of Calimondretta on Syned. Arkadia attempted to win Kerra and Rusher over by portraying herself as an enlightened Sith ruler and promising refuge to the student refugees. Arkadia also revealed that the conflicts in Sith Space were driven by a fratricidal power struggle involving the Calimondra family, a feuding clan of power-hungry Sith lords headed by the matriarch Vilia Calimondra.

This self-centered power struggle affected the lives of billions of sentients throughout the Grumani sector. However, Kerra became caught up in a plot by Arkadia to kill her grandmother Vilia, and subsequently a counter-plot by Vilia to stop her granddaughter through the Bothan spy Narsk. After helping Narsk to foil Arkadia's schemes, Kerra and Rusher managed to escape Syned, bringing around two thousands refugees including Kerra's student refugees who had fled the Daimanate and many Arkadianate defectors.

In the same vein, the pro-Republic Grace Command\u2014an Alderaanian-based mercy organization\u2014had deliberately inundated the Grumani sector with Deluge spice, as part of Operation Deluge to undermine the Sith war effort without diverting substantial Republic resources.

During her period in the Odionate, Kerra would learn about the existence of an ancient Sith artifact known as the Helm of Ieldis; which was capable of driving large numbers of sentient beings into a maddened homicidal frenzy. Kerra also discovered the existence of the cloisters, a system of planet-sized orphanages where thousands of children throughout the Grumani sector were imprisoned. She became part of a party of Novitiates sent by Odion to recover the Helm while moving closer to the end of the trail to find her parents. This quest brought her to Skarpos where she became caught in the midst of a fierce battle between three rival Sith Lords including Odion, Daiman, and Malakite.

She was the eldest daughter of Aron Holt, a skin diver, and Mercia Holt, an archaeologist. Kerra spent much of her early childhood on that planet and resided in the main city of Capital Cay. Both her parents were alumni of the University of Sanbra. Prior to 1042 BBY, both of her parents were involved in a research project to locate the Helm of Ieldis, an ancient Sith artifact dating back to the Great Hyperspace War. One of their research expeditions took them to the planet Sarrassia where they established contact with the Grumani Hierophants, one of the many religious sects inhabiting that planet. During that time, the Holt family befriended the Woostoid Grumani priestess Aunt Zoojoo, who became a close family friend. At one point, Kerra climbed onto the roof of the Great Hall, she caused the abbot to suffer a stroke. Kerra was later reprimanded by her parents for her mischievous actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1042 BBY, Kerra was about eight-years old when the planet Sanbra and its university were raided by the Sith Lord Odion, who at the time fought under the banner of Chagras, ruler of the Chagras Hegemony. The research team managed to escape offworld but not before Odion uncovered information about the Helm and sought to use it to gain an edge over his Sith compatriots. The Holts and ten other researchers fled back to their home on Aquilaris Minor. There, they planned to meet several Jedi on Aquilaris including the Jedi Knight and activist Vannar Treece. However, Odion obtained intelligence that the researchers were there. He was subsequently given authorization to invade Aqualaris from the Sith matriarch Vilia Calimondra, under the ruse of capturing Treece, a perennial foe of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, Aquilaris was invaded by Chagras Hegemony forces under Lord Odion who wiped out the weak Republic defenses, and slaughtered and enslaved much of the population. By that time, her mother Mercia was pregnant with their second child. During the invasion of Capital Cay, her parents were packing up and preparing to leave, intending to prevent Odion from gaining access to their sensitive research. Her father Aron was seen sporting a blaster pistol in the event that Sith troops stormed their house. They planned to flee to the harbor and escape on a submersible manned by the Seacroppers' Guild. While their house was being besieged by Sith troopers, Kerra was instructed by her mother to flee to the harbor first. Her parents would then meet up with her and they would flee with her childhood friend Joad Kreel and his father into the open seas. Finally, Mercia told her daughter not to come back looking for them and promised that they would join her there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kerra managed to reach the harbor while dodging Hegemony forces who were pillaging the city. There, she met Joad who was waiting by his Seacropper Submersible. His father had not returned and he stressed that they needed to go since Odion had already arrived at the scene. By that period, Odion had already developed a reputation as a ruthless and violent conqueror. Joad also told Kerra that he would wait for her to bring her family back so she could escape underwater. Despite Joad's warnings that it was too dangerous to return to her home, Kerra ran back to her home since she was determined not to be separated from her parents. By then, Odion's troops had captured both her parents and the other members of the research team. To cover up evidence about his secret project and entertain his nihilistic tendencies, Odion ordered the razing of the entire neighborhood block. By the time Kerra arrived at her burning home, all that she found was her father's pistol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, her friend Joad evacuated the harbor in his submersible alone to escape the Sith rampage and bombardment of the harbor. The two childhood friends would only be reunited several years later.During the subsequent house-to-house fighting that enveloped Capital Cay, Kerra encountered the Jedi Knight Vannar Treece. Initially, she mistook him for an intruder and nearly shot him with her blaster pistol. However, she quickly recognized him as a Jedi and related to him how her family had told her to flee but she went because she did not know where else to go. Taking pity on here, Vannar informed Kerra that he had a starfighter hidden nearby and offered to help escape offworld.

She subsequently became a Padawan under Treece's tutelage and lived on Coruscant, the capital of a rump Galactic Republic concentrated around the Core Worlds and Colonies. Under the custody of the Jedi, Kerra led an active childhood. At the age of twelve standard years, she was already coordinating travel assignments for volunteers. By the age of fourteen, Kerra was helping raise funds for Treece's \"knight errant\" operations into Sith Space. Within the last three years preceding 1032 BBY, Kerra had been responsible for outfitting Treece's Jedi operations with equipment. Thus, Kerra quickly gained the necessary experience and skills needed to run a volunteer paramilitary operation, which would prove essential to her work as a Jedi operating as a \"knight errant\" in enemy territory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of her earliest assignments as a Padawan was shutting down a ring of Core World-based smugglers who had been transporting fungi to Coruscant for processing into illegal narcotics. Mere law enforcement activities like spice interdiction were often assigned to Jedi Padawans since the Jedi and Republic were preoccupied with more urgent matters like the centuries-long protracted wars against the Sith and the effects of the Candorian plague. Kerra's experiences during that assignment led her to witness the effects of narcotics on people, which she came to conclude effectively stripped them of the power to control their own lives. This led Kerra to take a dim view of narcotics and drugs traffickers in her later career. By 1032 BBY, she had passed her Jedi Trials and become a novice Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While most of the Jedi Order had retreated to the safety of the Core Worlds to stave off a Sith invasion, her Master Vannar still staged hit-and-run \"knight errant\" operations into Sith Space with the secret consent of Supreme Chancellor Genarra. Vannar's operations were motivated by his concern for the plight of the billions of sentient beings living under Sith rule. For these operations, Treece utilized volunteers rather than regular Jedi and Republic military personnel since both Genarra and the Ministry of Defense were reluctant to commit substantial forces and other resources to invading the Sith-controlled territories due to the weakened state of the Republic. He was also able to exploit a loophole that allowed Jedi Knights a period of sixteen days of free travel anywhere in the galaxy between their regular routine of serving three months in law enforcement patrols and nine months of active service on the Republic's contracting frontiers. As of 1032 BBY, Vannar's missions were the only Jedi activity in the entire Grumani sector."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aflame"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Operation: Influx"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1032 BBY, Treece obtained intelligence from his old friend and former Jedi Knight Gorlan Palladane that the Sith warlord Daiman had discovered large deposits of baradium \u2014a volatile compound used in the manufacture of munitions including thermal detonators\u2014on the agrarian world of Chelloa. Following the collapse of the Chagras Hegemony in 1040 BBY, Lord Daiman had established an independent principality known as the Daimanate, developing a personality cult surrounded around his view as \"creator of the universe\". The baradium was being extracted from mines deep beneath the planet's surface and then shipped offworld for processing at munitions factories situated near the front line. Daiman exploited the local inhabitants slaves while he strip-mined the planet for the valuable ores."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since the Jedi feared that Daiman's access to baradium would change the balance of power within the Grumani sector, Treece assembled a strike team to sabotage the shipment of baradium offworld. This mission became code-named \"Operation Influx\" and involved a three-stage process of infiltration, sabotage, and exfiltration back into Republic space. Due to the serious nature of Operation Influx, Vannar had taken great pains to recruit several senior Jedi who had owed him a favor in the past. Some of these figures included the Trandoshan Jedi Knight Mrssk who had served in earlier Treece operations and the Quarren Jedi Master Berluk who had become distinguished within the Jedi Order for his combat skills. This mission was originally dubbed Operation Deadlock by Kerra. However, it was renamed Operation Influx when Treece recalled that it gave away their covert strategy of stalemating the Sith Lords against one another. This had the potential of alienating occupied civilian populations who looked up to the Jedi as their saviors and would allow the Sith to deduce the Republic's strategy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For Kerra, this marked her first return to the Grumani sector since the Sith invasion of her homeworld eight years ago. Her master Treece had learnt about the baradium operations from his old friend and undercover Jedi operative Gorlan Palladane, the leader of the Chelloan resistance. Palladane and his Rodian mechanic friend Skodo had used a stolen transmitter to reactivate a hyperspace relay and communicate with Treece. However, the Sith Lord Odion had been monitoring the transmissions and made preparations to invade Chelloa. The nihilistic Sith Lord believed that the planet's high concentration of baradium created an imbalance in the Force and thus had to be destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vannar's Jedi strike team traveled to the planet Oranessan in an unidentified Jedi starship. The planet was a polluted rain-drench world located at a key hyperlane within the Daimanate. While approaching Oranessan's surface, the Jedi intercepted and shot down a Daimanate personnel shuttle. The shuttle had been carrying several flight crew to the planet's spaceport where a fleet of Daimanate Heavy-Lift Starcrosser transports was waiting to depart for a delivery run to Chelloa. These flight crew would be used to crew the vast transports. The shuttle crashed on top of a hillcrest in the mud flats and the Jedi quickly retrieved the fallen crew's cloaks and identification badges. During the first phase of Operation Influx, Kerra was part of a four-member advance team which also included her Master Treece and the Cerean Dorvin Eltrom that approached the spaceport where a fleet of the Starcrosser transports were departing for Chelloa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The four Jedi then encountered a Daimanite party consisting of a female ground crew chief and four armed sentries who attempted to execute them for being late to a flight preparation meeting that occurred twenty minutes earlier. However, the Jedi quickly killed the Daimanite sentries with their lightsabers. Kerra herself personally killed the ground crew chief and stole her control device and jumpsuit, which would become handy later on. After stealing the dead Daimanites' equipment, the four Jedi commandeer an empty Starcrosser transport.

Kerra admitted that she did not like posing as a Sith and Vannar responded that she could not get very far in enemy territory without employing subterfuge. Prior to departing Oranessan, Kerra had another brief conversation with the Cerean Dorvin. He asked the young Human woman whether her decision to wield a green lightsaber reflected her aspiration to become a Jedi Consular like the current Chancellor Genarra. Kerra explained that she had only grabbed a lightsaber crystal from the top of a pile which turned out to be green in color. Dorvin was disappointed with Kerra's decision not to become a Jedi Consular. However, Kerra did not believe in adhering to tradition since she was more interested in learning enough Jedi skills as quickly as possible to fight the Sith in combat and avenge the invasion of her homeworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before they could depart for Chelloa, the Jedi team encountered a new obstacle when they discovered that the transport's navigation computer lacked an activation cylinder, a small device that enabled a ship to enter hyperspace. While the Starcrosser was still able to take off, it was unable to make a hyperspace jump and that meant Operation Influx would have to be aborted. Meanwhile, the other transports were already departing for Chelloa. Kerra quickly recalled that she had forgotten to retrieve a dispatch case from the wreckage of the downed personnel shuttle they had shot down earlier. The case had been trapped under one of the shuttle's consoles and she had mistaken it for a personal item. While it was standard procedure in the Republic for most flight crews to keep their activation cylinders with the ships, the Trandoshan Jedi Mrssk explained to his companions that the Starcrosser lacked one since Daiman had a policy requiring his flight crew to keep them on their persons in order to minimize the risk of desertion by his ground troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Kerra expressed frustration at her failure to retrieve the dispatch case, Treece was sympathetic towards the young Jedi woman since it was impossible for her to do everything. The Jedi were unable to travel to Chelloa on their own ship since the planet was tightly guarded by Daiman's forces. Time was running out since they had only one hour to infiltrate Chelloa and sabotage the baradium shipping before departing for neutral space. Vannar considered activating the fallback plan which involved flying the transport back to their hidden Jedi vessel and using it to shoot down the Daimanite transports before returning to the Republic. However, this plan had a serious drawback since Daiman could respond by rerouting other vessels to Chelloa. Kerra opposed this idea and suggested hijacking an ore transport but Vannar ruled it out since the ore transports were heavily armed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, Kerra suggested returning to the wrecked shuttle and retrieving the dispatch case. However, Vannar was uncomfortable about this plan since he did not want to risk the lives of the Jedi Knights involved. However, Kerra was still determined to carry out Operation Influx due to the considerable amount of energy, time, and resources they had already committed to the mission. At that point, they were interrupted by an announcement from the Sith control tower on Oranessan ordering them to hasten their departure or they would be punished. Vannar then ordered the team to opt for their fallback plan. He ruled out walking back several kilometers back to their hidden Jedi ship due to the wet conditions outside. Vannar also ordered Dolvin to secure all the vessel's hatchways."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Kerra disagreed with her master's orders and used her stolen remote control to open the transport's main cargo hatchway as it was lifting off. Donning the fallen ground crew chief's overalls, she then headed to the spaceport's hangar bay which stored several replacement navicomputers and activation cylinders. Despite flying at low altitude and the transport's external sensors, Oranessan's torrid weather made it impossible for the Jedi crew aboard the transport to detect Kerra. After several minutes, Kerra returned back to the departing Starcrosser transport and used her lightsaber as a beacon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A soaked and exhausted Kerra climbed back onto the transport's cargo deck where she presented the activation cylinder to her pleased master. Kerra then explained how she had obtained the activation cylinder by infiltrating the hangar while disguised as a worker.

When Treece commented that he thought that Kerra hated posing as Sith, the Jedi woman replied that she hated letting them win even more.

She knocked out a T'surr Daimanate Sith trooper with her lightsaber while Gorlan incapacitated a Human officer. Despite the warm reception from the liberated slaves, Palladane was disappointed that the mission was only a hit-and-run raid as opposed to a full scale invasion of Chelloa.

During the melee, Kerra was keen to display her combat prowess with the lightsaber. However, her Master Treece cautioned her not to be reckless with her life since she had already passed the trials.

Vannar explained that Operation Influx was not a rescue mission but rather a preemptive strike to sabotage the distribution of baradium and prevent further incursions into the rump Republic. Gorlan criticized Vannar's \"filibustering raid\" as insufficient in helping ordinary people living under Sith rule. Kerra intervened and defended her Master by stressing that the Vannar was right in asserting that a small tactical raid would keep the Sith deadlocked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vannar then took Kerra aside personally and stressed that Gorlan was right but admitted he was unable to help everyone. However, he noted to Kerra that their transport ship still had sufficient space for the dock crew.

Gorlan also stressed that there were still sixty thousand people in the slave cities of Chelloa and he was still needed as the de facto leader of the Chelloan resistance.
