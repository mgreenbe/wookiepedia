The farmer married a woman who was a red-skinned Sith like himself around 5113 BBY, and he believed that Tenebrae, the child she bore not long into their marriage, was his. However, the man was outraged when Tenebrae began to exhibit signs of Force-sensitivity in 5107 BBY, as neither he nor his wife had power in the Force. When he confronted his wife, she confessed that Tenebrae was the result of an affair with Lord Dramath, the Sith ruler of their world, but Tenebrae fed off of the man's anger and telekinetically broke his adoptive father's neck when the man attacked his mother. The Sith Lord Darth Nyriss explained the story of Tenebrae's father over a millennium later to her fellow Sith Scourge while describing Tenebrae's history."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tenebrae's adoptive father was first mentioned in Chapter 15 of Drew Karpyshyn's 2011 novel The Old Republic: Revan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
