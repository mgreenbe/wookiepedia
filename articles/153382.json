This sergeant directed AT-AT pilot candidate Davin Felth on an impromptu training exercise in command of a walker, designated Landkiller One, modified to simulate a surprise attack scenario. When Felth passed the test brilliantly, exposing a critical weakness in the AT-AT design, the sergeant expected the success of the scenario to propel Felth into an exceptional career. However, Colonel Maximilian Veers, head of the Imperial AT-AT program, buried Felth in the Stormtrooper Corps to mask the exposed weakness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
