The first of the Y-series were built in the Old Republic era, and new and improved models were made in every era since. Most of the Y-series were based on a core design, a disc-shaped main body and a large external cockpit. Though some models deviated from this design, they were few. One of the things that made the series so successful was that CEC reused as many parts as they could, thus making finding spare parts easier for the buyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Subseries"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
