There was a story in Niima Outpost that those men guarded a long-abandoned Imperial base somewhere in Carbon Ridge. Although she did not believe there ever was such a base, the scavenger Rey did notice that the dead-enders wore scraps of Imperial armor and reminded her of military types. Whenever someone entered their territory, the dead-enders would throw rocks at him or her, babbling apparently nonsensical strings of numbers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unkar Plutt once sent a group of six thugs to salvage equipment from Carbon Ridge, which caused a fight to break out between the thugs and the dead-enders. In the ensuing chaos, several dead-enders were shot, while two of Plutt's men went down, resulting in very little valuable salvage for Plutt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
