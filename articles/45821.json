Bane is looking for information about the Senate Building on behalf of Jabba the Hutt. Finding C-3PO devoid of useful information, Bane and his accomplices kidnap R2-D2 and extract the vital data, before memory wiping the droids of the incident, and letting them on their way. The floor-plans and security details of the Senate building are part of a plot engineered by the Hutt families to free their imprisoned brother, Ziro the Hutt, who holds potentially damaging information about Hutt activities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padm\u00e9 is stressing out over arranging a state banquet, the most important one of the season, for Senator Aang, despite Anakin's efforts to ease her mind. Senator Aang holds the deciding vote on the Military Oversight Committee, and Padm\u00e9 needs everything to be perfect. Her co-arranger C-3PO is helping to manage the details with the waiter droids sent to serve the party, and realizes that R2-D2 had forgotten the jogan fruit Threepio asked him to get for garnishing the dessert\u2014jogan fruitcake, which is Aang's favorite. Padm\u00e9 asks Anakin to handle it, who sends their two droids together so they won't get lost or distracted with 40 credits to buy the four jogan fruit needed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the market, Threepio grumbles a bit and argues that it is the astromech of the pair that gets \"distracted,\" which Artoo disagrees with. They find a fruit vendor that offers four jogan fruit in a canister package for four credits per fruit rather than one credit apiece; Artoo protests that as galactic robbery but Threepio feels they don't have a choice. Apparently overhearing that they really need the fruit, the vendor suddenly changes the agreed price from 16 to 32 credits, insisting that it's the best price he has today, but Threepio takes them anyway. As they start heading back with their purchase, a droid approaches them and suggests that they take a break at the nearby Droid Spa, a maintenance spa, for a cosmetic overhaul. Artoo takes to the suggestion enthusiastically despite Threepio's protests, but as he races off to the facility, Threepio is kidnapped by Cad Bane's droid gang."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Artoo enjoys the spa's amenities, Threepio is brought to Bane's hideout in one of the industrial areas of Coruscant, where his databanks are brutally scanned for information on the Senate Building's layout. Threepio's memory does not contain this information, but Threepio mentions that Artoo would know, so Bane decides to change targets. As Artoo exits the spa and finds Threepio missing, he is promptly pursued by Todo and HELIOS-3E. Artoo hides in a dark alley, but after he hears his pursuers preparing to dismantle Threepio, he surrenders himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Bane obtains the information he is looking for, he has the two droids mind-wiped of the kidnapping and dumped back where they were snatched. The two droids return with their purchase, none the wiser about what had befallen them, just in time for the cake to be finished and served to the delighted Aang. Meanwhile, Bane travels to Tatooine and delivers the plans to his employer, Jabba. Jabba, however, immediately offers Bane yet another assignment and contacts the Grand Hutt Council for a private conference. Bane's new mission is to free Ziro the Hutt from prison, as he possesses confidential information which might prove fatal to the Hutts should the Republic authorities get their hands on it; Bane readily accepts the job."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Temple Archives feature on The Complete Season Three Blu-ray includes the deleted scene \"C-3PO Reunited with Shiny R2-D2.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
