In 21 BBY, he fought in a skirmish on Dinlo until he was mortally wounded during the firefight. Before his death, Fi was comforted by Jedi General Etain Tur-Mukan while aboard a modified LAAT/c gunship. Fi shortly succumbed from his wounds and died. Fi's death hit Etain hard because he had the same name as Fi the clone commando, squadmate of Etain's boyfriend, Darman."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
