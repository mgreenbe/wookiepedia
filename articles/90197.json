The first of the droids to be uploaded to the Falcon was the transport droid V5-T, while the slicer droid ED-4 was uploaded at some point afterward. The brains acted as one entity, unconcerned with the droids they had formerly been. L3-37, a self-built droid, was uploaded to the Falcon after being destroyed during a job on Kessel. Refusing to lose her name and identity, L3-37 led the other two droid brains to operate as separate consciousnesses, working together to run the Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fleeing from the Empire after the Raid on Kessel, Lando Calrissian uploaded the conciseness of his droid companion, L3-37, into the navigational system of the Millennium Falcon.
