Used by the Agricultural Corps, it included a number of large globes containing alien flora and fauna and several gardens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grand Master Yoda used one of the laboratory's gardens to teach Padawan Dooku a lesson in telekinesis. Demanding that Dooku lift a pot that was situated in the middle of the path, Dooku concentrated to move the plant with the Force alone. After successfully moving the pot into the grass, the apprentice was surprised that the pot sunk into the soft ground. Yoda informed him that the alien soil in the pot was extremely dense and heavy; the lesson taught Dooku that size or weight did not matter to the Force. Dooku recorded an account of this event in the Great Holocron, which became required reading for all apprentices over the last two decades of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The laboratories survived until the end of the Clone Wars when Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, as his alter ego Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, ordered the Grand Army of the Republic raid the Temple and kill all its occupants.
