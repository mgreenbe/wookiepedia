It was a two-seater unlike the previous TIE models and was outfitted with enhanced weapons and sensor systems as well as a hyperdrive and deflector shields. The TIE/sf was reserved for members of the First Order's elite Special Forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A two-seat strike fighter used by the First Order's elite Special Forces pilots, the TIE/sf boasted weapons far more powerful than a standard TIE, combining laser cannons with a heavy weapons turret and a mag-pulse warhead launcher, giving the fighter a 360-degree field of fire[source?] and the ability to deliver special ordnance. Although the pilot had the ability to fire all weapons, the turret was ideally controlled by the rear-facing gunner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Special Forces TIEs were equipped with hyperdrives to enable the fighter to go on long-range missions far from a base or carrier ship, enhanced deflector shields, and high-yield cells that provided additional power to onboard systems, which were necessary because of its more powerful weapons and stronger shields. These versatile attack ships were used for both reconnaissance and combat operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This variant of the TIE fighter could be visually distinguished from its regular counterpart by the laser turret below the cockpit and the red flashes on its left side; similarly, the Special Forces pilots who operated them also had red flashes on their helmets, in a callback to the flight barons of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The captured Resistance ace pilot Poe Dameron alongside a then-recently-defected stormtrooper identified as FN-2187 hijacked a TIE/sf space superiority fighter to escape from the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer. The two initially ran into a problem due to the TIE still being connected to the ship by a supply cable. They finally broke free, and escaped the Star Destroyer, only to be shot by missiles fired from the ship's ventral cannon. The fighter ended up crashing on Jakku, although both Poe and FN-2187 survived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Numerous TIE/sf's later took part in the Battle of Takodana, assisting in leveling the Takodana Castle and killing many of its inhabitants, and engaged Resistance T-70 X-wing starfighters in combat above the ruins. Although the TIE fighters were successful in attacking the castle and supporting infantry, they proved to be no match to Resistance fighter forces, ending up losing many TIEs against the versatility of X-wings and Poe Dameron's superb skills, forcing the First Order to retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Kestro, Iden Versio, Shriv Suurgav, Zay Versio, and Dio stole two Special Forces TIEs to sneak aboard Commander Gideon Hask's Star Destroyer the Retribution."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some Special Forces TIEs were part of the Starkiller aerial defense force during the Battle of Starkiller Base; however, they were unable to stop Poe Dameron from destroying the key thermal oscillator which led to a chain reaction, destroying the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zay and Shriv used a Special Forces TIE to escape the Retribution and head to D'Qar to deliver the Project Resurrection and Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought information to the Resistance and go to Outer Rim Territories to find allies for them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Phasma and TN-3465 used a TIE/sf to travel to Luprora to hunt down and assassinate Sol Rivas, who also used a Special Forces TIE."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Evacuation of D'Qar, some Special Forces TIEs chased and attempted to shoot down Poe Dameron's X-wing Black One while he was destroying the Fulminatrix's turrets, and some Special Forces TIEs tried destroying their entire fleet of MG-100 StarFortress SF-17 strategic bombers before they could destroy the dreadnought."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, during the First Order's attack on the Resistance fleet, Kylo Ren personally attacked the Resistance's flagship, Raddus, in his TIE Silencer with three Special Forces TIEs flanking him. When Ren, sensing the presence of his mother, Leia Organa Solo, hesitated to fire on the Raddus bridge, his wingmen destroyed it instead, using missiles, killing everyone on the bridge except for Organa, who was incapacitated in the attack.
