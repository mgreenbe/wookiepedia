Unlike most of her sisters, Charal had chosen to ride a horse rather than a rancor. Thanks to the arcane magicks of its witch mistress, the stallion was able to change its appearance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months before the destruction of the second Death Star, Charal intended to capture the young Human Cindel Towani, hoping to force her release \"the Power\" contained in a starship's crystal oscillator. The sorceress thus transformed herself into a beautiful, young woman with blond hair, and gave her wild stallion the shape of a gracious white horse. Charal replicated the voice of Catarine Towani, the young girl's mother, in order to lure the child into her trap. Once Towani was in her clutches, the witch hopped on her horse's back and went galloping off into the forest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite its equine loyalty, Charal's stallion unwittingly betrayed its mistress.

Despite the animal's visibly brownish appearance, it is still considered a black horse. There are in fact two types of black horses: \"fading\" and \"non-fading.\" Most black horses are of the fading variety, and their coat tends to turn a reddish brown color with exposure to sweat and sun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the 2001 reference book The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide, it was stated that some Nightsisters favored horses over rancors, and that both the rider and her steed were capable of shape-changing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
