He found it more relaxing and calming to drink than the bitter black caf that he usually drank on the job. His beverage combined hot tea, local spices, and fresh blue milk from Bubo Wamba's Milk Stand. The resulting beverage was blue in hue and rich in texture, with mellow flavors and a pleasant aroma. Tuggs included his recipe for the beverage in his cookbook, titled The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook. He presumed that the reader would not have a bantha available and suggested plant-based milk as a possible substitution."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bantha Chai was first pictured and mentioned in the recipe book authored by Chelsea Monroe-Cassel and Marc Sumerak, Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which was released in 2019.
