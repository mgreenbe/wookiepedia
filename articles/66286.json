They were able to fabricate an information bunker, which attracted the attention of the droid. In turn, the unit ordered his troops to attack the bunker, prompting Inc and the men of the 327th to attack them from the rear. They were able to effectively dispatch the droid's troops, while Jedi General Aayla Secura beheaded the tactical droid. Since the droid had not gone into cyberostasis, they would be able to extract information from its memory banks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the last days of the wars the 327th fought in the Battle of Felucia under the command of Jedi Knight Barriss Offee.
