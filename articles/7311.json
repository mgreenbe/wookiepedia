Anoobas could vary in weight from 20 to 45 kilograms\u2014males being larger than females\u2014and often banded into packs of ten to twelve. These units were dominated by an alpha male and alpha female, and it was not uncommon to see entire packs waiting alongside podrace courses for an easy meal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like the winged urusai, accounts spoke of anoobas being so engorged on meals that they are unable to move.
