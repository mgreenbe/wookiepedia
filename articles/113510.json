She chafed at her clan's restrictions on women fighting, even though she was one of the best fighters in her clan. Eventually, Reirin left, having been hired by a trader in Mos Eisley to recover an item from a tribe of Jawas, in exchange for passage off Tatooine. She used the distraction of R5-D4's malfunction, after being purchased by Owen Lars and Luke Skywalker, to sneak aboard the sandcrawler. Once inside, she located and broke open a rusty chest containing wires, animal bones, and a green rock fragment. Taking the rock, she narrowly escaped being discovered by the Jawas. She studied the rock and felt a powerful connection with it. Reirin decided that it was more of a crystal than a rock, and to keep it rather than turn it over to the trader, intending to find another way offworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
