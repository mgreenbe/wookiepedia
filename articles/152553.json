The Galactic Civil War order was used by the Galactic Empire. It was likely that the base contained Imperial ship and medical items. Once Sabine Wren, Hera Syndulla and Chopper came here to steal the medical bag of a Lambda class shuttle. Sabine and Hera steal the shuttle, but realize that he has stolen the wrong shuttle.
