He was able to recover though, joining Lemo and Sanda in their hover car as they chased Chewbacca and Calrissian back to the Spaceport.

The three Rebels were also being chased by bounty hunters under the employ of Barpotomous Drebble, and the Near-Duros was unable to catch the group before they were stunned by Drebble's group.

In the brief firefight that ensued, Barpotomous Drebble's bounty hunters caught the gang in a crossfire.
