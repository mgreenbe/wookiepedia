Around 18 BBY, the Sullustan Den Dhur and his droid companion I-5YQ came into the Mandalorian woman's store seeking parts to upgrade the 5YQ-series protocol droid. She showed the two around the interior of the warehouse and negotiated a deal with Dhur to provide an additional sales manifest for items recently sold to the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian woman was tall and dark skinned, with vivid red-colored hair and sharp teeth.
