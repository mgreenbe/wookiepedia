Rather than destroying Centerpoint, Ben was able to show the droid the truth of the situation, and it scrambled the control interface before mindwiping itself, preserving the station in the hope that its undiscovered history and technology could one day be revealed, while rendering it inoperative as a weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jacen and Ben escaped the station and returned to the Alliance, although the Corellians subsequently attempted to restore Centerpoint to operation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
