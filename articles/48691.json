Around 33 ABY, during the Resistance's mission to Ovanis, the First Order deployed this platform from the Maxima-A-class heavy cruiser, Ravenous, to the surface of Ovanis to reinforce Agent Terex during his hunt for the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron. The platform brought with it 2 TIE/fo space superiority fighters, 6 TIE/sf space superiority fighters, 2 AAL-1971/9.1 Troop Transports, 2 single-person transports, a First Order speeder bike, and a squadron of First Order Stormtroopers consisting of at least 2 Flametroopers, 8 First Order jet troopers, and 2 First Order Special Forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The landing platform floated above Ovanis' rocky surface, blocking the entrance to a cave, cutting off Resistance starfighter group Black Squadron from their commander, Poe Dameron, who at the time was inside the cave negotiating with the native Cr\u00e8che. Dameron was unaware of the First Order's arrival, or that Agent Terex was in puruit with a squadron of troopers. In a bid to take the landing platform for themselves and gain the upper hand, Black Squadron attacked the platform, destroying the First Order's TIE support. However, during the assault the landing platform was destroyed. The debris from the destruction blocked the opening to the Cr\u00e8che cave, trapping Poe Dameron with the First Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The First Order landing platform made its first appearance in the 2016 debut issue of comic series Star Wars: Poe Dameron, written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Phil Noto."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
