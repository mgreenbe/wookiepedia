He eventually met the Jedi and revealed that Tabord had given the Zabrak all of her information on Krannus' plans before dying of her wounds. Warning the Hero that the weapons emplacements were too well-defended, Taldine suggested that the Knight take out the energy relays in order to power the region when the Jedi began to think of other options. The Republic facility they were in had a set of ion charges, which could be used to simultaneously to knock out the relays and disrupt the power grid, so the Taldine was ordered to wait in the base until the Hero's signal to detonate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the placement of the second charge, Paldine was able to trigger the charges, which disabled the ray shields and allowed access to the South Power Generator Facility. There, the Zabrak intercepted a distress call from Doctor Gantrell, who claimed that his team's sector had been overrun and the Imperials were searching for them.

Despite Bartaph's skepticism, the Zabrak claimed that he had changed during his time on the planet for nearly a decade and that he really wanted to help the Republic in winning the war against the Empire. The Hero vouched for Pak, citing his assistance in stopping Krannus. Though she couldn't release Pak, Bartaph agreed to restore his guard status. Bartaph later located Warden Playt's notes, which also confirmed Pak's story."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
