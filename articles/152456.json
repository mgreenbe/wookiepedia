Some years before the Battle of Yavin, the professor asked his students during class which of the three methods of self-destruct should be used in a situation when a Imperial-class Star Destroyer has been taken over by enemies. One of the cadets, Thane Kyrell, suggested the automatic self-destruct, which would give the longest time to detonation, allowing more troops to evacuate in the escape pods. The professor, not satisfied with the answer, turned to Kyrell's classmate Ciena Ree, who suggested that the Destroyer's captain should signal for all to abandon ship, seal herself on the bridge, provide cover for escape pods, and ultimately crash the vessel into the nearest object and die with the vessel. The professor, satisfied with the answer congratulated Ree and awarded her with one of his rare smiles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The professor first appeared in the 2015 junior novel Lost Stars, by Claudia Gray..
