During the Separatist Crisis, rival Arakyd Industries asserted that the XPLR-R borrowed heavily from the proprietary designs of their probe droid line. As a result, Arakyd demanded aggressive remuneration and technology rights of the younger firm and the two companies entered an 18-month-long dispute. However, VSIS was so focused on perfecting the XPLR-R's advanced sensor analysis that it ignored its needs in corporate defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars in the year 22 BBY, the dispute over the XPLR-R was resolved when Arakyd absorbed its smaller competitor in an armed takeover of Viper Tower and kept VSIS in operation as a research-and-development division. In possession of proprietary Viper technology, Arakyd released the Viper probe droid, the company's biggest success to date."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The XPLR-R was originally created for HoloNet News Vol. 531 50, a HoloNet News article written by Pablo Hidalgo and Paul Ens with illustrations by Joe Corroney and released on April 4, 2002."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
