She served as a Jedi Knight in the century before the Great Galactic War between the Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, and bore a daughter that she named Satele in 3699 BBY on the planet Brentaal IV. However, when she began to challenge the Jedi Order's views on attachment and marriage like her ancestors before her, the Republic pressured the Jedi Council into exiling her to a unnamed planet in the Outer Rim Territories so that she could meditate on her ideas. When the Council decided to retrieve Shan from her exile many years later, they found only her cliffside dwelling and a set of journals dedicated to her daughter, which they passed on to the young Shan. Shan brought one such work, entitled Aspects of the Force, The Light and the Dark, with her on her self-imposed exile to the planet Odessen decades later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tasiele Shan was first mentioned in Satele Shan's entry in the HoloNet on the official site for the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, in an Aurebesh phrase that read \"Jedi exiled her mother\".
