The school had its own recreational track, medical facilities, quads, and farmland. Moreover, the complex was protected by a series of Security Guides, walls, alarms, and watchtowers. In 44 BBY, the Circle was closed when the people of Kegan realized what was taking place within its walls and ousted as V-Tan and O-Vieve as Benevolent Guides."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
