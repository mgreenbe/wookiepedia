Fathiers could run at great speeds (up to 75 kilometers per hour) across various terrains, including beaches, fields, and cliff faces. Their speed made them sought after by wealthy residents of the galaxy, and the creatures were viewed as graceful and majestic. On average, fathiers stood three meters high at the shoulder; people seeing one in person for the first time were often shocked by their size. When cooped up, fathiers required endurance exercises, so fathier transports were equipped with double-gravity chambers. They were known for their stinky, spicy smell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fathiers could be domesticated, and they were used as mounts in competition.
