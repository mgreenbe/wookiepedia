After the Destruction of Caamas, she feared for Volette's safety and contacted former Jedi Jax Pavan for help in escaping Coruscant. However when the pair arrived at Volette's apartment to meet him, they found him dead. After they found Volette's murderer, however, she turned back on her decision to leave Coruscant and instead joined with Pavan and Whiplash, a resistance group to the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She attempted to form a relationship with Pavan, but he rejected her advance, leading her to betray Pavan and his group to Darth Vader.

Pavan organized a rescue mission, but upon their arrival in the building, Duare revealed that she had betrayed him. Vader then ordered Pavan to hand over a vial of bota\u2014a substance that was recorded to have the ability to strengthen a Force-sensitive's ability to touch the Force\u2014but when he refused, Vader attacked Pavan. Tarak then revealed that she had the bota, and Vader took it and injected it into himself.
