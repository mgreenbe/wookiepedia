Theoretically, this would have allowed the Vong to hasten their conquest of the galaxy by opening the way for 'peaceful' conversion of the rest of the population. However, with the help of Vergere, Jacen not only thwarted the project's goals, but tricked his would-be masters into believing that he had accepted, only to then betray them by bonding with the World Brain of Yuuzhan'tar and using that bond to sabotage the Vongforming of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
