Nymbis served as the apprentice of the Sith Lord Darth Caldoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The life of Ry Nymbis was recounted in a legend. It alleged that, from birth, Nymbis had a dark presence in the Force, which affected him greatly growing up. Most people related to Nymbis distanced themselves from him, having felt the darkness residing in him. His mother hoped only to protect and love Nymbis, however she grew shameful of what he was. Having grown up enough to understand his influence on others, Nymbis became distant and quiet from society. In what his mother perceived as hopeful, Nymbis was later visited by a dark hooded figure, who introduced himself as Darth Caldoth. Caldoth described Nymbis' presence as having the \"capacity for great power\" and offered to train Nymbis as his apprentice, in order for Nymbis to be able to control his natural connection to the living Force. Knowing that Nymbis would never be accepted by his peers, his mother reluctantly allowed Caldoth to take Nymbis from Ryloth, in which he would never return."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Champion of the pit"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now a part of the Sith Order, Nymbis was subjugated to extreme methods of training in order to hone his skills. The first act Caldoth took was dropping Nymbis off on a forest world called Simoth. From there, Nymbis became a slave and was forced to fight against creatures such as dianogas, slothkins, and other slaves. Soon enough, Nymbis became feared by the other slaves as a powerful weapon forged in the gladiatorial pit. For seven years, Nymbis fought as the champion of the pit. However Caldoth eventually returned to Simoth to acquire his Sith apprentice, which he had dropped off seven years prior. Caldoth easily cut through both slavers and prisoners with his crimson lightsaber, until Nymbis was the only one left. After pulling back his hood and revealing his alien eyes, Caldoth awakened an anger inside Nymbis, as memories of being taken away from Ryloth and being thrown on Simoth returned. In a fit of rage, Nymbis charged at Caldoth, empowered by his years of experience fighting in the pit. However, Caldoth was easily able to send Nymbis hurtling to the ground, having severed one of his lekku in the process. Nymbis had been put in place, and Caldoth was ready to formally begin his training."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Caldoth's apprentice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Caldoth's apprentice, Nymbis underwent several trials in order to become a Sith. One trial had Nymbis visit an ancient temple sacred to the Sith, which resided on the mountainside of an abandoned moon. For seven days, Nymbis traversed through the ruins, succumbing to visions of his mother and other people from his past, as well as a vision of what he might become. Another trial pitted Nymbis against a female knight, which he fought and killed for his own saber. Nymbis' final and greatest trial brought him to a fortress built by a Force cult on an asteroid in Wild Space. The fortress overlooked a crack in the void, which Caldoth believed was a vision into the living Force. After three days, Nymbis rose from the challenge, more fulfilled and aware than ever before. From there on, both master and apprentice set on to study ancient mystical powers which hadn't been seen for over a thousand years. These powers made Caldoth and Nymbis the most powerful people in the galaxy, uncontested by anyone who stood in their way. However, Nymbis wanted more, having fallen into a cycle of greed which fueled the Sith Order."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A heart of stone"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nymbis and Caldoth fell out of favor with each other when Caldoth began to withhold powerful information which they both uncovered. Caldoth was also only using Nymbis for his own benefit and goals, which enraged Nymbis. However, Nymbis knew he could not duel Caldoth on his own, as he was all too powerful. So, for many more years, both master and apprentice continued to rule together. However, Nymbis planned for the day in which he would strike Caldoth down, and the day came when they both went to visit Korriban. On that day, Caldoth ordered Nymbis to create a statue of himself, which would reside on top of a mountain. Nymbis, having stolen an alchemical ritual from Caldoth's chambers, hoped to use the ritual against Caldoth. The ritual could turn a person's flesh into stone, which would trap them in an eternal nightmare. However, Caldoth was prepared for Nymbis' eventual betrayal, and altered the words in the ritual so that it would affect the user itself. In a futile attempt to entomb Caldoth, Nymbis recited the words to the ritual, forever encasing himself in stone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ry Nymbis first appeared in \"Gaze of Stone,\" a story in the 2019 book Myths & Fables, which was written by George Mann and illustrated by Grant Griffin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
