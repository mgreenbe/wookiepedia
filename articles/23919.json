During a sweep of an Outer Rim sector in 9 ABY, he and fellow New Republic pilot Trapper Wolf approached the gunship Razor Crest, questioning why the starship's transponder was not emitting. The Crest's pilot, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, explained that the vessel was pre-Galactic Empire and promised to fix his issue. Teva then requested a ping from Djarin, which the Mandalorian eventually transmitted reluctantly.

Running tabs on the gunship after, the pair learned of some selfless actions Djarin made on the correctional transport.

During the reign of the New Republic, he served as a captain in the New Republic Starfighter Corps, flying a T-65B X-wing starfighter.

The pair came across the gunship Razor Crest near the planet Maldo Kreis. As the starship's transponder was not emitting, Teva reached out to the starship over comms, him and Wolf flying either side of the vessel. The gunship's pilot, the Mandalorian Din Djarin, replied and came to explain the Razor Crest was pre-Empire and so did not need to run a beacon. Teva, though, corrected him that the New Republic had new rules requiring all craft to run beacons. Djarin acknowledged Teva's statement, promising to get on setting up a beacon, and both prepared to part ways."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teva, though, continued, asking for Djarin to send him and Wolf a ping to ensure the pair that he was not affiliated with the Empire. The Mandalorian stalled, claiming the required hardware on his ship was offline and then specifying that it was not working. Teva told the bounty hunter to follow the New Republic pilots to the Adelphi New Republic outpost if the pair could not confirm he was not Imperial. Djarin then transmitted his ping, but Teva heard him whispering and asked what that was, the Mandalorian giving an excuse for it.

Teva remarked to his wingmate that the Crest might break apart in the atmosphere due to its age.

After Dune silently denied his appeal, he then pointed out that she was from Alderaan, asking who she had lost during the planet's destruction.

The producer became a fan of the show and chose to write a part for Lee in season two of The Mandalorian.

Lee also watched the filming of scenes from Filoni's \"Chapter 5: The Gunslinger\" and Chow's \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" and Filoni also gave Lee a tour of the season one sets after."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Casting and costume"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After some more months passed, the actor allegedly learned from Chow that she had advised the producer to write a bigger part for him, but he still held doubt that his part would come to fruition. That was until October 2019 when Lucasfilm asked Lee's agent for the actor's availability. Lee quickly accepted the role for his new character, who he stated was code named \"foodie pilot.\" It was planned that Filoni or Favreau would call him about his role, but Lee missed Favreau's first attempt to call the actor. When he finally was able to speak with Favreau, the show runner told him about \"Carson.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Lee, he flew down to the set soon after his call with Favreau and was almost immediately taken to the wardrobe to get his costume fitted. Lee's costume was tailor made for him with a custom painted helmet, he used his costume making skills to help the wardrobe experts helping with The Mandalorian with buckling ejection harnesses and other aspects of his new costume. When the wardrobe department wanted a reference photo of Lee in his X-wing pilot costume, they lent him the pilot helmet used as that of Biggs Darklighter\u2014a minor character from George Lucas' 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\u2014as his on set prop helmet was still being painted.

Around the X-wing set was an LED screen which projected a simulated star field backdrop around Lee, and the spacecraft model he sat in rocked, coming across very realistic for the actor.
