It was complex, with many deities. Among them were the moon-god Quay and the thunder god Am-Shak. Quay was their chief god: indeed, \"Weequay\" translated to \"Follower of Quay\". Each of their cities was centered around a shrine of black, polished stone, known as a thal, where the Weequay made offerings of food and valuables. Their religious code prohibited building thal off Sriluur, so off-world devotees were obligated to substitute animal sacrifices (usually large animals like banthas). A holiday devoted to Quay was the Month of Plenty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
