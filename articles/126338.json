At the time, there were rumors that Commandant Brendol Hux had created a secret society within the Arkanis Academy. On Tarkin's order, Cass transferred Lieutenant Chiron from the Academy for Young Imperials on Lothal to Arkanis so he could investigate the matter. The major notably made sure that Chiron's code cylinder would give him access to Area Null, a restricted part of the academy where the Empire ran a number of secret programs."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Death Star"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Siward Cass was still serving under Tarkin during the Galactic Civil War, which pitted the Empire against Alliance to Restore the Republic. At this time, he was a chief. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, the Imperial Army officer attended a meeting on board the Death Star in which he witnessed Admiral Conan Antonio Motti and General Cassio Tagge argue about the station's power, before the Sith Lord Darth Vader Force choked Motti. He later reported to Tarkin that the planet Dantooine was not the location of the main Rebel base. Not too long afterward, the Battle of Yavin commenced, with the Alliance destroying the Death Star battle station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Siward Cass first appeared portrayed by English actor Patrick Jordan in the 1977 original Star Wars film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, the first installment of the original trilogy. Though unnamed in the movie itself, he was referred as \"Cass\" in Alan Dean Foster's novelization. Jordan got the part of Cass in A New Hope through his friendship with Alec Guinness, who portrayed Obi-Wan Kenobi and whom had worked with Jordan for The Old Vic company in the 1940s. However, Jordan shared Guinness' contempt for the film, dubious about the film's prospects."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
