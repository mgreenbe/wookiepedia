The Holocron supposedly acts as a map. As the farmers debate whether to keep the Holocron safe or get rid of it, a teenage boy named Tenno, desperate to escape the rural planet and his abusive father, convinces his friends to steal the Holocron from the meeting and turn it over to the Sith, who will surely reward them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Tenno and his friends arrive at the meeting, a brawl breaks out, and at least two farmers are killed, including Tenno's father. The brawl is interrupted by a Sith Lord, who takes the Holocron.
