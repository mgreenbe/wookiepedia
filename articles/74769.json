The Fromm Gang also sought to take possession of the Moll family farm. In 15 BBY, the resistance discovered that the Fromm Gang was constructing a powerful weapons satellite, the Trigon One, in the secret base maintained by Sise Fromm's son, Tig, on the planet Ingo. The Fromms planned to use the new weapon to take over their rival gangs, and the resistance feared that the Trigon One would pose a threat to the galaxy in the wrong hands.

While she surveilled the facility, Moll saw two landspeeders, piloted by the local racing team of Thall Joben and Jord Dusat, accompanied by their droids C-3PO and R2-D2, pass into the base's restricted security zone. The automated defenses launched seeker probes after the intruders, and Moll realized that the racers would be killed if she did not intervene. Joben was able to evade his pursuers, although C-3PO was thrown clear of his speeder during the chase. As Joben raced to help Dusat, who had been forced to abandon his speeder as the seeker probes destroyed it, a sentry droid approached C-3PO and prepared to fire a seeker probe at the droid.

Unable to help Dusat, Moll saw his capture by Fromm's droids, emerging only when Joben and the droids, having realized that they were being followed by more of Fromm's droids, returned too late to warn Dusat. Claiming that her ship had been grounded on the salt flats due to engine failure and that she had gone to the speeder shop seeking a mechanic, Moll told Joben about Dusat's capture. R2-D2 soon detected the approach of more muscle droids, and Joben left the shop to retrieve his waiting speeder from outside only to discover that it had been sabotaged.

While Joben and R2-D2 proceeded towards the detention area in the speeder, Moll and C-3PO remained in one of the control stations in the service tubes, using the systems to redirect elevator and freight traffic out of the White Witch's path. Before long, the two were confronted by a Boiler droid, which inquired as to their identity. C-3PO claimed that they were the maintenance crew and that they were attempting to repair the automatic service systems. When the other droid stated that it was the maintenance crew, C-3PO claimed that he and Moll were from security and that the control systems had been sabotaged. Their lie was exposed when a real security droid entered, and the maintenance droid attempted to activate the alarm. Moll fought the security droid, but she was quickly overpowered.

C-3PO grabbed Moll and pretended to have captured her, then directed the other droids to pursue her accomplices down the service tube. They were led right into the path of the White Witch, which collided with and destroyed both. The group proceeded to the sentry droid hangar, and discovered that the droids within were deactivated. When they opened the hangar door, however, they found a group of droid cruisers waiting for them. C-3PO used the override controls for the sentinel droids to reactivate them, causing them to head outside to engage the droid cruisers.

The droids rushed to their master's aid but proved no match for the assassin, which turned its attention back to Joben. However, the commotion caught Moll's attention; as the assassin droid prepared to throw Joben into the wall, Moll entered and shot it with her paralyser disc.

Upon reaching the spaceport, however, they were captured by one of Fromm's guards, only to be saved by the arrival of Joben and the droids, who took the guard by surprise and incapacitated him. Joben soon devised a plan to sneak aboard Fromm's ship. Moll entrusted the thermal detonator to C-3PO, while she and Joben hid inside a pair of cargo containers.

Along the way, they were confronted by two guards. Unaware that the cylinder C-3PO carried was a thermal detonator, the guards took it and began to throw it around.

While the pair watched R2-D2's favorite program on an old subspace receiver, C-3PO attempted to adjust the antenna and accidentally tuned in to Tig Fromm's private frequency, learning that Vlix Oncard had the speeder shop surrounded. As the Fromm Gang's Annoo-dat Blue gangsters opened fire, Joben and R2-D2 returned and picked up Moll and C-3PO in Joben's landspeeder.

Joben eventually agreed to reveal the Trigon One's location in exchange for Demma and Dusat's release, but only to Sise Fromm himself. The prisoners were subsequently loaded aboard a Lambda-class shuttle for the journey to Annoo.

While Oncard and the younger Fromm left to retrieve the ship, Moll asked about her mother, but Sise Fromm refused to release her and ordered them locked up while he worked out what Joben was up to. They were taken to a detention area, where Dusat was also held, and placed in restraints. As Dusat explained that Demma had been taken away for interrogation, R2-D2 and C-3PO devised an escape plan.

While C-3PO and R2-D2 secured the White Witch to the Sand Sloth's hull in preparation to enter hyperspace, the vessel came under attack by Tig Fromm's shuttle, the Voor Viper. Moll attempted to activate the hyperdrive but found it unresponsive, and the Fromms inflicted damage to one of the Sand Sloth's engines before R2-D2 engaged the hyperdrive using the exterior controls.

Moll agreed, before she left with the others for a nearby medical unit to seek treatment for Dusat's arm, which had been injured during the Fromm attack. The injury was sufficient to keep him in the medical unit overnight and rule him out of the race. Although Joben could take over piloting in the race, the White Witch had sustained damage during the landing and was in need of repairs. While they waited at the medical unit, C-3PO met a droid named BL-17. Hearing of the group's problem, BL-17 informed C-3PO that his master, who was out of town, owned a garage which they could use to conduct repairs to the White Witch.
