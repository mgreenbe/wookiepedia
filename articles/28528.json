But don't let that stop you from showing your aff ection by spreading color across his world! The galaxy's greatest smuggler, his beloved piece-of-junk ship that's got it where it counts, and just maybe his best Wookiee pal (Laugh it up, fuzzball!) are all here in glorious black-and-white artwork by Marvel's finest, just waiting for you to bring their pages to life. But what are you gonna use? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good crayon, pen or pencil at your side, kid! So grab your favorite color, and punch it! But don't get cocky. Han isn't known for staying within the lines, and you might have some trouble, too. What are the chances that you'll get through Han's whole book without making a mistake?
