Sensor beacons were attached to people, vehicles or objects, often discreetly, in order to track them. Some sensor beacons could also scan the individuals in their vicinity. They were also used to mark the perimeters of planetary facilities. When establishing Chopper Base on the planet Atollon, members of the Phoenix Cell, such as Lieutenant Dicer, placed sensor markers around the base in order to detect incoming vehicles. After their encounter with the spidery krykna, the rebels discovered the sensors repelled the creatures, and used the sensors to keep them away from the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
