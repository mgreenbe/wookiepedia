Six months after the war's start, the Trandoshan and eight other bounty hunters of the same species intercepted a package that was intended to be a gift to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Galactic Republic. The bounty hunters planned to sell it to the Confederacy of Independent Systems on the planet Ord Mantell. However, news of the exchange reached the ears of the Republic, and two squads of clone commandos were dispatched to retrieve the package. On Ord Mantell, the goggles-wearing Trandoshan piloted one of three speeders the bounty hunters were using for transport. When the commandos attacked, the Trandoshan successfully navigated his speeder to an industrial zone while the other two speeders were destroyed by the clones. However, while the first commando squad was wiped out, the second squad gave chase. During the ensuing firefight, the commando squad leader, RC-1013, threw a thermal detonator at the Trandoshan's feet, which exploded and killed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
