Along with fellow Mandalorians Roggar Den and Warusman Ordo, he came to Tatooine to participate in a challenging trial. One would inject himself with lethal poison and have approximately 30 minutes to acquire the antidote from extremely hostile Sand People nearby. Warusman Ordo was trying to prove himself the best, but in the end, the poison weakened him enough for the Sand People to finish him. Roggar Den and Pit Rauhut then ordered a passerby Imperial to participate in the ritual."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
