He was heir to former Warlord Tulak. After Yaddle escaped from the prison Tulak ordered her sealed in a century prior, she decided to stay on Koba for a while and help the people of the planet. Kalut was not fond of this and challenged her. When Yaddle evaded his lunge, he fell on his own dagger, fatally stabbing himself in the throat. In this way, he fulfilled Yaddle's prediction that Tulak and his kin would \"die by [their] own hand,\" as victims of their own cruelty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
