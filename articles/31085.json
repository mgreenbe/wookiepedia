The beam was powerful enough to cut through the hull of Acclamator-class assault ships, causing their reactors to burst and destroy the ship. One Acclamator-class assault ship was destroyed this way during the Battle of Mon Calamari. The crab cannon was itself destroyed by Jedi Master Kit Fisto and the Mon Calamari Knights during that same battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
