They fought in countless battles against the Imperial forces during the lead up to and during the Galactic Civil War. They piloted starfighters such as A-wings, B-wings, X-wings, and Y-wings, as well as low altitude vehicles such as T-47 airspeeders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early rebellion and early war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early rebellion, isolated rebel cells combated the Galactic Empire. Rebel pilots in Phoenix Squadron flew A-wing starfighters in deep space raids against the Empire's convoys. After the action at Mustafar, the crew of the Ghost joined the Phoenix Cell, but their RZ-1 A-wing interceptors were outmatched by the Sith Lord Darth Vader during the Imperial attack on the cell. Although the Phoenix Home was lost, the cell managed to escape. Phoenix rebel pilots later fought in the Imperial blockade of Ibaar, although Phoenix Leader was killed during the first strike against the Imperial starships. After the second and successful attempt to get through, Hera Syndulla was promoted to his former position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY during Operation Handoff, pilots of Gold Squadron worked with members of the Ghost crew to protect Senator Mon Mothma from the Empire. After successfully bringing her to Dantooine, Mothma united the Phoenix cell and other rebel cells together as the Alliance to Restore the Republic. During the Battle of Atollon, Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn and the Seventh Fleet defeated the pilots and forces of the Alliance, forcing the Phoenix Cell to abandon its base on Atollon. Its survivors went to Yavin 4 and became part of the Massassi Group. Captain Syndulla and a squadron of BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bombers later undertook a failed supply mission."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Yavin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Battle of Yavin started, pilots of the Rebel Alliance were given a task to destroy the Empire's superweapon, the Death Star. With the valuable information R2-D2 provided after Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor found it on Scarif, the Rebels learned that the Death Star had a small exhaust port which might be a good spot to place proton torpedoes in order to destroy the space station, because Galen Walton Erso projected the port betraying the Empire and giving a chance to the Rebels of destroying his station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the mission briefing ended, members of Red Squadron and Gold Squadron were assigned to their X-wings and Y-wings. Soon after they were launched to space, they entered the Death Star's magnetic field and began the attack. During the attack run on the station's surface, they encountered turbolaser defenses. Due to the X-wings' small and fast body, the station's turbolasers weren't quite effective to the Rebel fighters. Noticing that fact, Darth Vader personally led a TIE/ln space superiority starfighter squadron in his TIE Advanced x1 to bring down the Rebels himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the race in the trench, Vader killed several Rebel pilots including Gold Squadron members Jon Vander, Dex Tiree, and Davish Krail; Garven Dreis, leader of Red Squadron; and Biggs Darklighter, close friend of Luke Skywalker. As Vader took aim at Skywalker's fighter, however, the Millennium Falcon, piloted by Han Solo, appeared from above, and destroyed one of his escort TIE fighter pilots. As a result of Solo's distraction, Skywalker had a clear chance to fire torpedoes to the exhaust port. Aided by the Force, the torpedoes entered the exhaust port, reached the Death Star's main reactor, and caused a chain reaction which ultimately made the entire structure explode."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the battle ended, the only surviving rebel pilots with the crew of the Falcon were Luke Skywalker, Wedge Antilles, and Evaan Verlaine.

They were found by one of the Imperial probe droids searching through the galaxy, and as a result, Death Squadron came to the Hoth system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But because of Admiral Kendal Ozzel's mistake, the Rebel Alliance noticed the approaching Imperials and activated a planetary shield generator which could protect their base from orbital bombardments. With the plan to bombard the rebel base from orbit precluded, Vader Force choked Admiral Ozzel to death and ordered General Maximilian Veers to lead the ground forces and destroy the shield generator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Empire was planning the assault, the rebel defense line was formed to hold off the attackers until the rest of the Alliance members evacuate the planet. When the rebels spotted the Imperial AT-AT walkers, rebel pilots employed T-47 airspeeders to face them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rogue Squadron, led by Luke Skywalker, led the air defense against the Imperial AT-ATs. Wedge Antilles and gunner Wes Janson utilized tow cables to entangle an AT-AT's legs to disable the Imperial Walker. This strategy was effective by focusing on the weak spot of the walker, but they were eventually defeated by the superior firepower of the armored walkers. The Empire claimed victory in the battle, while the rebellion and its pilots were forced to flee the planet. The Alliance Fleet spilt into different cells, but Imperial Commander Ellian Zahra was able to locate the Fourth and Eighth Divisions by using a signal analysis protocol she'd created. When she was attacking the Fourth Division and its pilots, however, the Millennium Falcon arrived. The Falcon and the other remaining Rebel forces escaped her grasp."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One year after the devastating defeat on Hoth, the Rebel Alliance gathered for planning a large-scale assault on the newly constructed second Death Star. When the Alliance Fleet exited hyperspace in the second Death Star's vicinity.

Meanwhile, an A-wing pilot Arvel Crynyd flew his craft towards the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer Executor. By his sacrifice, the bridge was destroyed, bringing the massive star destroyer to its end."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the Death Star, Wedge Antilles took a shot on the Death Star's power regulator. The following shot by the Falcon destroyed its main reactor and they flew their way out. The Death Star exploded just after the Falcon came out, and later on Endor, the rebel pilots celebrated their victory with the Ewoks and the rest of the Alliance members."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Endor saw the death of many pilots, including Green Leader Arvel Crynyd, Blade Leader Adon Fox, Ekelarc Yong, Grizz Frix, and Sila Kott.

Among the Resistance's ranks included Nien Nunb, the ex-smuggler turned war hero, along with Gial Ackbar and other celebrated members of Alliance High Command. Furthermore, the new pilots of the Resistance would all be trained in flight maneuvers named after pilots of the old war, such as the Skywalker Swoop, Antilles Intercept, and Porkins Belly Run, along with utilizing updated X-wing fighters, such as the T-70."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Training"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New Rebel pilots were required to watch The Pilot and the Rebellion, an introductory document and video during recruitment sessions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebel pilots were trained \"on the fly\" by their superiors, while most new recruits already possessed keen starfighting abilities. It was common practice for rebel pilots to be taught and utilize the scatter protocol, which set up a practice of randomly choosing a path through hyperspace after each operation before rendezvousing with the Alliance Fleet in an attempt to evade any possible Imperial pursuit."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebel pilots wore orange, blue, green, white, grey, or red flight suits with a flak vest and life support box on top.
