As a Princess of Theed, her dresses were simpler, geared more towards practicality than style. However, her robes and dresses during her terms as Queen were ornate and uniquely styled, geared highly towards Naboo tradition rather than comfort. After her second term as Queen ended, she opted for simpler, more practical clothing. After her marriage to Anakin Skywalker, she often wore dark, loose clothes to disguise her pregnancy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Princess attire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Princess Robe. A few months before she took the throne as Queen Of Naboo, Padm\u00e9 Amidala made a speech while wearing a bright red robe. The robe was simple, a wide garment that fell to her feet with wide sleeves dressed with two white stripes near the end. Over this she wore a tabard of a slightly lighter red, made of stiffer fabric. It went up and over her shoulders, flaring them, met at her neck, then traversed the length of her robe. The high collar of the garment was white, with a pattern of traditional Naboo symbols stitched in gold around it.

As the Queen of Naboo, Padm\u00e9 Amidala was most prominently seen in a traditional mode of dress and make-up, designed to express her commitment to maintaining Naboo's cultural history, and her role within it. Her wide-shouldered, red throne-room robe was accented by hand-stitched gold embroidery and a series of illuminated sein jewels just above the robe's wide, potolli-furred hem. In addition to this robe, Amidala commonly wore an ornate gold face frame, including the prominent Jewel of Zenda, and had her hair combed over a padded form. She also wore white nail polish during her times as Queen, one of the few traditions she retained from her home village. This extremely formal appearance belied Amidala's young age, projecting an air of unwavering confidence beneath inscrutable white make-up. This attire was worn during her coronation.

The shoulders and bottom of the cloak were smocked in a crimson fabric, and lined from above with a golden, triple-braided soutache. The remainder of the cloak was stitched with embossed rosettes, and sported long, billowing sleeves. Above this she wore a dark, thick, faux fur cloak with wide, exaggerated shoulders. To complement this dress and to make her more visible in the vast chamber, Amidala's hair was dressed in a wide arc centered by an escoffiate headpiece with golden hairbands to keep her hair's shape. This arc was decorated with dangling orichalc suspensas capped with golden hairtip ornaments.

This dark, somber dress was adopted by Amidala during her stay in Senator Palpatine's quarters on Coruscant, following the Invasion of Naboo. The black dress was befitting of the gravity of her situation, and served to subtly acknowledge Amidala's separation from her people. The fluffy, black, Cyrene silk dress was accented with beaded emblems over 240 years old that once adorned a former Queen's dress. The dress's sleeves were triangular, and within them was a smaller sleeve. The sleeves were lined with a dark, lustrous, Prussian blue material. Her hair was arranged in a fan shape with a prominent foreknot and small suspensas. The foreknot was intricate, with her hair rippling like small beads. It was capped with a golden hairtip ornament, with a single, disc-shaped bead dangling from it, which rested against her forehead.

These dresses were dyed from orange at the hood to bright yellow at the lower hem. The underdress was of bright red, which showed through the full, slit sleeves of the trevella dress. Also, the bright red peeked out once more as a bill-like hood, which shadowed the face of the wearer. The dress was capped off with a red sash. The handmaidens wore a variant on the trevella-cloth design, most notably worn during Amidala's address to the Galactic Senate on Coruscant prior to the Battle of Naboo.

This same fabric was used to make the smaller overshirt which reached down below her waist. This was tied with a blue belt inset by a red glass jewel of little value. Her billowy pants were black, as were her plain walking boots. Her hair was braided, with a braid traveling around the back of her head, a bun within the ring, and the rest of the braids running down her back to her waist.

Her headpiece was made of a coppery metal with a tight skullcap with ridges running up into an intricate, fan-like crown. The headdress is made from orichalc metal, and the Flower of Life emblem decorates the crest in a continuous pattern. Under this piece was a length of mustard-colored fabric that looped under her face and wrapped around her neck. The headdress was sometimes covered by a golden lace veil.
