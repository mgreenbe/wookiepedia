During the Battle of Ryloth, Alzoc III temporarily became a point of interest for both sides of the conflict. The bounty hunter Cad Bane had stolen the Gravitic Core of a new Separatist superweapon in orbit above the planet, leaving the Munificent-class star frigate that was carrying it to be hit by an explosion. The frigate crashed on Alzoc, where the gravitic technology had created a gravity anomaly, causing the wreckage to float in the air near the crash site alongside ice debris. Shortly thereafter, Jabba had informed the Galactic Republic of the CIS activity near the planet, hoping to punish the Separatist for passing through his territory without payment. The Jedi High Council had dispatched Jedi Masters Aayla Secura and Luminara Unduli to investigate the report."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Accompanied by a detachment of Grand Army of the Republic led by clone marshal commander CC-5052 and clone trooper commander CC-1004, two Jedi had arrived at Alzoc, dispatching several All Terrain Tactical Enforcers to the planet's surface. However, by that time the crash site was already visited by a Confederate assassin Asajj Ventress, the Dark Acolyte of Count Dooku. In order to keep the new gravitic weapon a secret, Dooku ordered his agent to destroy any evidence of the incident and allow no witness to be left alive. When the Republic forces arrived at the crash cite, both Jedi and the clone troopers were stunned by the view of a huge masses of ice and numerous starship parts floating freely in the air and decided to investigate. They were engaged by many battle droids stationed on the frigate, who survived the crash relatively intact and now viewed the Republic forces as hostile. On their way to what remained of the frigate's central computer, the Jedi were ambushed by the Dathomirian assassin. After a brief duel, two Jedi Masters have overpowered the Dark Acolyte, trapping her under the bulk of ice. After finding the ship's computer, the Republic forces were able to uncover the record of the ship's last moments, learning about the existence of the gravitic weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
