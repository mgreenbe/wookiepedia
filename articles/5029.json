Though Alderaan had abandoned their military forces in the wake of the Clone Wars and was now philosophically opposed to the concept of armed resistance, Organa recognized the importance of other fledgling resistance movements such as the Nizon resistance and Corellian Resistance and set about providing non-combatant support, including funding, technical expertise and intelligence gathered by his group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He made a number of offworld allies as well, including Jedi Master Denia and her associates, and made a number of important victories, including the Battle of Nizon and the Battle of Byss."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Towards armed resistance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually the Corellian Resistance would come to realize the necessity of combining forces with other resistance groups if they were ever to defeat the Empire and dispatched Bria Tharen to meet with other resistance groups.

Dalhney was unwilling to compromise Alderaanian ethics by committing his people to a combatant role and would only agree to continue the support they had already given. However, Winter came to agree with Tharen's arguments and promised the Corellian that she would argue the case for armed resistance with Bail Organa when she returned home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally persuaded that armed resistance was necessary, Organa began to clandestinely arm his people despite stiff opposition from within his own government."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Birth of the Alliance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bail Organa was eventually contacted directly by his former Senate colleague, Garm Bel Iblis, the leader of the Corellian Resistance.
