She occasionally saw visions of the future in her dreams. In 34 ABY, she and Kel escaped their homeworld of Tehar after First Order forces led by Kylo Ren massacred their village including their family. Kel and Eila fled to the Colossus platform on the planet Castilon. Despite being pursued by First Order troops led by Commander Pyre, the two siblings managed to find refuge with the help of Resistance pilot Kazuda Xiono and the Chelidae."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Orphans of Tehar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the New Republic era, Eila and her brother were forced to flee their homeworld of Tehar as stowaways when the army of the First Order, led by Kylo Ren, wiped out their village on their planet, including their parents. The two siblings were the only survivors. When the First Order discovered there were two survivors, they hunted down Eila and Kel, placing a 20,000 credit bounty on them, as they didn't want any word of the atrocity to spread."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the two arrived on the Colossus platform on Castilon, where Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono, in need of cash, had recently heard of the bounty, but not who placed it. He, his friend Neeku Vozo, and the droid BB-8 tracked down the siblings with the assistance of Vozo's Chelidae friends, who worked in engineering. In a chase in the Colossus marketplace after Kel had stolen food from a vendor, Eila broke her leg, which posed problems as any medcenter would ask for their identification."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When First Order agents led by Commander Pyre arrived on the platform and tracked the two siblings down, Xiono helped them fake their deaths to get the First Order off their trail.

From experience, she and Kel knew she was dreaming of the future. When Vozo's newly-acquired pet Bibo found his way down to engineering, the children knew that Eila's dreams and what was coming to the Colossus were connected to Bibo. Vozo and Tamara Ryvora eventually arrived in search of the pet, and Eila and Kel returned Bibo, and told the two of her dreams. The dreams heralded the arrival of Bibo's mother, an enormous creature who was intent on retrieving her child."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The unconscious stormtrooper"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the First Order occupied the Colossus, Eila and her brother were fishing for snarlfish on the underside of the platform when their laughter was overheard by a patrolling stormtrooper, CS-515. Kel claimed that the two children had lost their identification, so CS-515 attempted to take them away, grabbing Eila by the wrist. Kel and Eila fought him, eventually knocking him unconscious. Aware that this could lead to trouble, they decided to go to Xiono for help. Although it was dangerous for them to be on the platform's upper levels, they went to Jarek Yeager's Repair Station, where Xiono and Jarek Yeager were eating lunch with Vozo and Ryvora. When Eila and Kel asked for help, Xiono called for Vozo and BB-8 to come along. He tried to talk Ryvora out of coming because she hadn't listened to his warnings about the First Order, but she insisted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eila and Kel led the Team Fireball members to where they had stashed the unconscious trooper in a closet, which prompted panic, as Xiono was concerned he could wake up and kill them all, while Ryvora thought they should turn themselves in. When CS-515 began to come to, Vozo knocked him out again with a wrench. Xiono made it clear they had to move CS-515 before other First Order personnel discovered him, and the group hauled him off to engineering. Eila and Kel stayed downstairs while Xiono hit upon the idea of impersonating the trooper both so that his absence wouldn't be missed and to ascertain if the trooper had reported the children's presence. While Xiono was upstairs, Ryvora panicked about Xiono's actions, and Eila and Kel called her out for trusting the First Order's word more than that of her friends, who were telling her about the Order's untrustworthiness. Ryvora was shocked when the siblings told her about why they had fled Tehar. When CS-515 woke up, groggy, Eila and Kel initially hid with Ryvora while Vozo dealt with the trooper. When he panicked upon seeing a Chelidae, Eila managed to calm him down, before Vozo shocked him unconscious again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That evening, when Xiono contacted them and asked them to meet him with the unconscious CS-515, as Xiono was fleeing from the First Order after giving the stormtroopers the impression that \"CS-515\"'s mental conditioning was faulty, Eila, Kel, Ryvora, Vozo, and BB-8 carried the unconscious trooper through the halls. When they encountered Namua, Ryvora told him that the unconscious man was sick and they were taking him to the medcenter. They hid in the maintenance ducts underneath the floor before Xiono arrived, and stayed there as CS-515 was dressed back up in his armor and propped up to be recovered by the other stormtroopers. Afterwards, Xiono told Eila and Kel they were safe for now as the trooper hadn't reported them, but that things were going to get much worse on the Colossus."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sinking the Colossus"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Xiono, Yeager, Vozo, and CB-23 fell down a trapdoor while fleeing stormtroopers, Eila and Kel greeted them. Eila and Kel then reunited Team Fireball with their droid Bucket, who had survived being shot by Commander Pyre. The two siblings were present when Xiono and Vozo devised a plan to contact the Resistance by sinking the Colossus beneath the sea. This plan worked and enabled Xiono, Yeager, and CB-23 to swim up to Doza Tower and deactivate the communications jammer. Despite sending a message, Yeager was captured. Eila and her brother were present when CB-23 played a message from the Resistance leader General Leia Organa apologizing that she could not send aid.

Kaz and CB-23 were forced to flee back to the underwater corridor.

This allowed Kaz and CB-23 to find away to reach Doza Tower through the station's tunnels and corridors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Attack on Castilon, Eila remained in the hyperdrive room with her brother.

Under Mika's guidance, Kel and Eila used several star-shaped buttons to deactivate the grinder, saving Kaz and Mika from certain death. After Kaz and Mika escaped the chamber, Mika took a Sith artifact, seeking to prevent the First Order from getting their hands on it.
