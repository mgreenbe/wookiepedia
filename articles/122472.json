She served as a police officer with the Coruscant Security Force with the police rank of lieutenant. Around 3643 BBY, Talen was assigned to investigate a break in at the First Bank of Coruscant. The thieves were caught attempting to crack open a safety deposit box belonging to the Alderaanian noble House of Ulgo. They claimed to be Ulgo cousins, trying to reclaim \"valuable family heirlooms.\" The deposit box contained items smuggled from the Mid Rim. Talen assumed the Ulgos were planning to sell them on the black market to start raising more supporters for their cause. As Alderaan had seceding from the Republic, the case was a legal gray area. The Senate authorized for the safety deposit box to be placed in Jedi custody and the matter turned over the Jedi Order, much to the relief of Talen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Semphi Talen was first mentioned in a message that is sent in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG) by BioWare released on December 20, 2011.
