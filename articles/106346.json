He later expressed pleasure at seeing Leonis alive at the end of the exercise, in which Leonis's diplopod and another cadet, Xan Lanier, had been killed. Pocarto was later present during an assembly of the cadets and praised Leonis on the care that he took in the presentation of his ceremonial uniform, though later in the term he was annoyed by Leonis's scuffed boots.
