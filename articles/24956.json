Deployed from the ship's aft, a chaff burst caused a scattering of particles designed to confuse a warhead's guidance system, detonating the warhead prematurely and thus protecting the ship itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The chaff burst is based on its real-life counterpart of the same name, normally used by military aircraft. In real-life, chaff consists of hundreds of tiny strips of a reflective surface, such as aluminum, and is designed to confuse radar (such as on an incoming missile). In Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter and Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance, the chaff burst appears as bright flashes of multi-colored light. The precise mechanics of the system are unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
