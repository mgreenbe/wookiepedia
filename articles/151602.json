During that conflict, this Troxas participated in a delegation from his planet to visit Count Dooku at Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux, on the planet Vjun, where he was accompanied by the under-palatine for patriotic liaisons and that individual's assistant. In a bid to win more support for the world's resistance to the Galactic Republic. The under-palatine and his compatriots tried to convince Dooku that they were planning to surrender to the Republic unless more battle droids arrived in their system. Dooku used a mind trick to convince them to keep fighting, that reinforcements were on their way\u2014but not to surrender. This was part of a bid by Darth Sidious to make Troxar a resource sink for the Republic. At the end of their meeting, the under-palatine for patriotic liaisons presented Dooku with a parcel from Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Senator of Naboo. The under-palatine of the Bureau of Patriotic Defense explained that the Troxans had analyzed the contents and found it to be only a black candle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
