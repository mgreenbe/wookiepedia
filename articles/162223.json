She was the sister of Wraith Squadron pilot Shalla Nelprin, and the daughter of Old Republic intelligence officer Vyn Narcassan. She also served as a hand-to-hand combat instructor for Kell Tainer when he served in the commandos. She reportedly could throw him around like ragdoll and not even break a sweat. She eventually married and had a son named Wran Narcassan, who was at odds with his father. Deeming his father an unsuitable role model, Wran changed his last name in honor of Vula's father Vyn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
