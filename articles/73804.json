It was spherical in shape and had four landing legs which folded up seamlessly into the hull when in flight. The left side had a hatch that opened downwards forming a small ramp with a round platform.\nTwo thrusters pointed out from the back but not far enough to be seen from the side, keeping the spherical shape. These left a prominent purple light trail behind the craft for a significant distance.\nAn oval cockpit window on the front of the ship gave the pilot the ability to fly manually with the pair of flight sticks.\nThe ship had the ability to be quickly programed to follow a course and coordinates with the aid of an auto pilot. however, the interface (via holographic projection) completely obscured the pilots window."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As this ship is classed as a starship it can be assumed to have a hyperdrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Grievous stole one such vessel to escape from Kamino following the Battle of Kamino.
