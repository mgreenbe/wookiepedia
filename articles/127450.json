The top floor was made up of a single room that contained many terminals arranged in a classroom-like layout. Stairs led down to the first floor below ground which consisted of two rooms.

While there were several slicer NPC enemies in the house, none of them had to be killed for the mission. \"Chronicle Relics\" could be looted from them. Such relics could be used by players in the Chronicle Quest system to create their own quests for other players. By using the relics related to the slicer NPCs, the quests would task the player with killing slicer in the house, or just traveling to the house."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
