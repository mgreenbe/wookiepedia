Allying himself with the Galactic Empire, Sardoth aided the Inquisitorius in hunting down his fellow Jedi as the Jedi Order was exterminated during the Great Jedi Purge. He would serve as an agent of the criminal named Raze on the planet Ahakista."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Force-sensitive Iktotchi, Sardoth was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. Selected as the Padawan of Jedi Knight Lycan, the pair traveled the galaxy together; during this time Lycan introduced his Padawan to the dark side of the Force as he sank deeper and deeper into the depths of its power. Following his master's capture by the Jedi and his eventual death, Sardoth managed to ascend to the rank of Jedi Knight before succumbing fully to the thrall of the dark side. Coming into contact with agents of the mysterious Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, Sardoth was able to avoid execution during the initial days of the Great Jedi Purge by aiding the Galactic Empire hunt down and kill his fellow Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately Sardoth learned that betrayal was the way of the Sith. The Empire turned on Sardoth when his usefulness was diminished and he was forced to flee to the planet Ahakista during the early stages of the Galactic Civil War and open rebellion against the Empire. From Ahakista, Sardoth owned and operated the Daystar Casino and collected illegal Jedi lightsabers deemed contraband by the Empire. Aside from his business with the casino, Sardoth was working with the crime lord known as Raze who ran a black market organization in the criminal underground of Ahakista. In his capacity as Raze's majordomo Sardoth continued to monitor the Empire's growing presence on the planet, fearing that the construction of the Pyramid One would disrupt business and eventually lead to his own execution by an angry populace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the historic Battle of Yavin, Sardoth observed the escalation of the civil war brewing on Ahakista. Conversing with his associate Erla when Councilman Derral was assassinated, Sardoth hoped to prevent his own death during the oncoming war. He gave criminal agent Wyl Tarson his orders when the Human arrived on the planet to do a mission for Raze which involved cooperating with the local rebels. Allowing Tarson and Laynara to use the casino as a base, Sardoth and Raze were secretly planning a special surprise for Tarson when his mission was complete. When Sardoth discovered that Darca Nyl was traveling with Tarson he instantly recognized the lightsaber of his old master hanging from the man's belt. Believing Nyl to be a Jedi, Sardoth took the man into his private chambers to show off his own collection of lightsabers as a sort of silent threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Raze's command, Sardoth had arranged for Tarson and his companions to encounter Imperial agent Rasha Bex, a secret agent of Raze's also. Additionally the agents were introduced to Dunlan, the leaders of the anti-Imperial rebellion brewing on the planet. When each of Raze's minions were together, Sardoth revealed to them that their mission was to destroy Pyramid One and the Hub facility. Leading the group through the tunnels under the Imperial facilities, Sardoth trailed behind Nyl, who had broken away from the group to find his own way into the Hub. When they entered the darkness of the tunnels, Sardoth revealed his own Jedi heritage and accused Nyl of killing his old master and taking his lightsaber. Attacking Nyl, Sardoth was evenly matched by the man's skill and would have ended in a stalemate if not for the arrival of Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaping at the chance to become a Sith Lord himself, Sardoth forgot about his quarrel with Nyl and put all of his efforts into winning the the cyborg Sith's favor. Dismissing Sardoth's pleas as that of a failure who would have already been chosen if he was worthy, Vader ended Sardoth's life with a swift strike to the neck with his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
