They were a militaristic species, placing great importance on the strength of one's body and on the physical aspects of life. By refining themselves through combat and physical development, Anarrians strove to achieve perfection and a higher status in life. They were locked in a perpetual war with the other sentient species on the planet, the Altiri, and they felt it was the perfect testing ground for their beliefs. Most Anarrians spoke Basic in addition of their native tongue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anarrians' bodies were covered in fur that varies in color from light blonde to dark brown.
