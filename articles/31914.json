The cloak once belonged to the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village, but several years prior to 3 ABY, the cloak was stolen by the creature Gracca of the Floating Mountain. Gracca lived in his home on the mountain, where he ruled for several years, turning anyone who refused to serve him\u2014and often, accidentally, his pets\u2014into crystal. It was believed that only a great warrior had the power to retrieve the cloak. In 3 ABY, the Ewoks Latara, Wicket Wystri Warrick, Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, and Teebo flew to the mountain on their Ewok hang gliders and confronted Gracca. The cloak was destroyed when it fell into a pit of lava after Kneesaa used her lasso to remove it from the Gracca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
