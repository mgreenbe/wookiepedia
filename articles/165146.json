They were active during the Clone Wars, and many saw them as allies of the Sith. They were periodically attacked by the Jedi, but the Wyrd were always replenished in their ranks. The Wyrd increasingly came under the influence of the Believers and, after suffering a lot of setbacks, were stirred up into making an attempt to turn the Ch'hala tree to the dark side of the Force and gain control of the Cularin ecology.
