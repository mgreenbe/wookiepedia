In 34 ABY, the guard was on duty on the yacht while the baron hosted a party onboard it on the planet Cantonica. He discovered the Dor Namethian Lexo Sooger disguised as a member of the serving staff in a part of the barge off limits to staff and guests. The guard demanded Sooger leave, but the Dor Namethian tricked him into believing that Attsmun had sent him to give the guard a drink. After the guard left him alone, Sooger murdered the arms dealer Jerdon Bly and then claimed that the yacht was on fire, causing all onboard to abandon ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
