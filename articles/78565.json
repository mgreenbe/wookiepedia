This appearance detailed the orbital bodies, the primary star, and the sectoral location. An indirect mention was found within the article \"Castaways of Endor,\" authored by Wallace and Robin Pronovost and released on December 1, 2008, for StarWars.com's registration-exclusive fan club, Hyperspace, which has since been retired. The system was also mentioned in The Essential Atlas, a Del Rey reference book written by Fry and Wallace and released on August 18, 2009. The Kuna's Eye system was given an entry and placed on a map in the \"A Closer Look: Endor and the Moddell Sector\" chapter, which supplied descriptions for various astronomical objects, planets, and stars and also gave historical references and illustrations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sectoral location of the system is a subject of confusion. The Essential Atlas states that it is located in the Moddell subsector, which is said to be a freestanding subsector, while the newer Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion says that the Moddell is a subsector of the Zuma sector. This article assumes that the information from the Online Companion is correct."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
