Due to Derilyn being placed under martial law, and the establishment of Imperial Interdicted Space, starships traveling The Extreme were more than likely to be stopped by Imperial patrols and be harassed, boarded, or even confiscated. Since the risks of traveling The Extreme far outweighed the benefits, trade along that portion of the Elrood-Derilyn Trade Route was almost non-existent during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
