The family struggled to survive, but by working together they were able to endure, and after Grouaggerl had became an adult, they were finally rescued. Grouaggerl visited Kashyyyk, the Wookiee homeworld, but he felt uncomfortable among the world's lush greenery, so left to make a life for himself elsewhere."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire, Groaggerl planned to travel to Kashyyyk for his father's tricentenial birthday. Making the journey in his starship, the Wasaka, he stopped at the world Daimar whilst en route to Kashyyyk, hoping to trade his services to acquire some new parts. However, the Empire initiated a blockade of Daimar, trapping Grouaggerl on the planet. King Mitar of Daimar determined that Daimar's defeat was imminent, so he ordered some of the world's important figures to flee the the planet Byrsym, where Mitar's son Torrin was leading an anti-Imperial resistance group, so that they wouldn't fall into Imperial hands. Groaggerl accompanied them and they left Daimar aboard the Wasaka. After breaching the blockade, they traveled to Byrsym, where they successfully found and joined forces with Torrin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
