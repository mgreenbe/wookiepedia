As the Wookiee smuggler fought off his attacker, Solo discovered the skeletal remains of Genzhor, took the late doctor's stun stick, and used it to defend himself against the sarlaccs.

The two smugglers then returned to Black Spire Outpost on Batuu and delivered the sarlacc to Dok-Ondar in his store, Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities.
