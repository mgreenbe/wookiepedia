The Heavy TIE Bomber could be used in space and atmospheric conditions. The spacecraft was an enhancement to the standard TIE/sa bomber, having dual weapons pods in the place of the original single payload module. In a ground assault vehicle role, the Heavy Bomber was very effective at destroying mechanized and heavy weapons units such as T3-B heavy attack tank and artillery.
