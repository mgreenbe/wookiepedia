The two thugs and their crew quickly killed each other and Baras's apprentice went to report about the successful mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lanklyn and Baras's apprentice met again on Hoth where Lanklyn was tracking the Jedi Master Xerender for Darth Baras. Lanklyn went out to search for the Jedi with his men, but got himself captured and was only saved because Ensign Slinte provided the Sith with Lanklyn's last known location. Lanklyn reported that Xerender had a squad of Talz commandos at his disposal, which he used to cover his tracks as he approached his true objective: the Jedi Master Wyellett. Lanklyn, Slinte and the Sith later gathered to report Darth Baras on their progress, but during the holocall Xerender was able to tap into the message. Angered at the failure, Baras Force-chocked Lanklyn, despite being on the other side of the galaxy, and promoted Ensign Slinte to Commander of his operations on Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
