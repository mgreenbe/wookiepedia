Local military forces loyal to the old regime were effectively disbanded, and the pilots of the Air Cavalry were extended invitations to join the Imperial Navy. Merrick rejected. He viewed the offer as hollow and the Empire's TIE forces as unimaginative compared to the Rebel Alliance's starfighter squadrons, which demonstrated greater unit coherence and piloting ability. Alongside friend and fellow pilot Garven Dreis, Merrick instead opted for early retirement, left Virujansi, and sought out membership with the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Serving in the Rebel Alliance"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The early Rebellion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after joining the Rebel Alliance, Merrick earned the rank of General, and was made Commander of Rebel Alliance Starfighter Command. Merrick was in command of all starfighter squadrons at the Rebel's base on Dantooine, and then later on at Base One on Yavin 4. Under the callsign Blue Leader, Merrick personally led Blue Squadron, with Barion Raner as the squadron's second-in-command.

In Merrick's absence, or when operational authority was better served from a ground-based dispatch, General Dodonna commanded the fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Serving on the rebel council allowed Merrick to play an essential and influential role in the early rebellion. He contributed in the decisions to cycle the U-wing out of escort duty, and use X-wings as the backbone of Starfighter Command. Their hardware and handling was much like a bush hopper from Virujansi, Merrick's homeworld. Neither Merrick nor Garven Dreis would fly anything but the X-wings in combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Merrick sent multiple reports to Mon Mothma discussing the uses and details of ships both within the rebellion and those they fought against. In one, Merrick reported the use of UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft as a troop transport on Mantooine in the Atrivis sector.

Understanding they were often overlooked yet vital assets to the rebellion, Merrick pledged his support and expressed his admiration for them, stating that he assigned them specifically to U-wings as he knew they were all above the boasting of \"hot shot\" X-wing pilots. He also stated that this praise did not come from High Command, but from his heart. Merrick humbly considered himself a pilot more than a commanding officer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Merrick refused to risk lives needlessly, as he cared deeply for those under his command.

Blue Squadron entered combat above Scarif in conjunction with the Rebel Fleet led by Admiral Raddus. Merrick then led Blue Squadron's X-wings and U-wings through the Shield Gate to provide air support to the pathfinders on Scarif's surface. Blue Squadron proceeded to destroy several  AT-ACTs that had been harassing rebel forces.
