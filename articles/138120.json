Soon after this, he discovered that Charal had sent some Marauders under her command to raid the pirate's crashed ship, ensuring that Szingo could not find anything else. This angered Szingo who ordered the individual to kill the Marauders who had performed this act. Upon doing so, he rewarded the individual with 150 credits. Unfortunately, Charal managed to convince King Terak that she had nothing to do with the attack, and so Szingo hired the individual one last time. This time he was to eliminate an Arachne which had been attacking the Marauders outposts as a way to be forgiven. Once this was done, Szingo rewarded the individual with 350 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Szingo was a Non-Player Character (NPC) in Star Wars Galaxies, which gave quests to players as part of the \"Marauder Themepark.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
