Throughout the Galactic Civil War, Mon Mothma held the position of Chief of State. She had virtually unlimited authority over the Civil Government, although checks and balances were in place to ensure she did not overstep her position. Her decisions could be overturned by the Advisory Council with a two-thirds majority, in which case Mothma was required to step down from the position of Chief of State. The Chief of State position was up for election every two years. Each Allied Command had a single vote and the victor was elected by a simple majority vote."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
