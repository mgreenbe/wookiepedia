Jao was assigned to supervise the construction of the Ithori link of a galactic communications array system. After losing contact with Yalta Val, who had been assigned to the Carreras system, Jao ventured there to find his Master. There, he discovered that a rogue Sith named Darth Wredd had kidnapped and impersonated his Master. With the aid of the junk dealer Ania Solo, a descendant of the smuggler\u2014turned\u2014Hero of Yavin Han Solo, and her companions the assassin droid AG-37 and the Mon Calamari Sauk, Jao was able to rescue Master Val.

After tracking Darth Wredd's henchman Dieben to Nalyd, Jao and Ania traveled to the watery world of Dac where they discovered that a pirate syndicate led by another rogue Sith, Darth Luft, had enslaved a large number of Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees. While they were unable to find Darth Wredd there, Jao along with Ania's companions succeeded in alerting the Triumvirate authorities to the presence of the pirates, who dispatched a task force to free the slaves.

The real killer was the mysterious bounty hunter they had encountered on their journeys. As a result, Ania was released by the Triumvirate authorities.

When Jao objected again, Wredd taunted him by asking the young Knight about what good he was without having to serve the Fel Empire. When Jao asserted that the Imperial Knights brought peace to the galaxy, Wredd mocked the Triumvirate for focusing on construction projects rather than hunting down the One Sith, who were busy infiltrating governments and corporations across the galaxy in order to restore their \"golden age.\" Wredd then revealed to Jao that he had abandoned the One Sith in order to create a new Sith order based on the Rule of Two.

While walking through Lasgo Port, Jao found that Ania was wanted for the murder of an Imperial Knight named Teemen Alton.
