Although the Ewoks often collected the root, acquiring enough fgir root to create the paste was a dangerous proposition, as the roots were hollow and quite sensitive to pressure.If handled incorrectly, the roots of the fgir ejected a number of poisonous, needle-like spines into the air."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was this characteristic that earned the fgir bush the nickname \"shooter roots\". However, the Ewoks learned that when cut and dried it could be used to form a dart blower, while the moisture found in the roots could be distilled into an effective anesthetic. Despite its ability to heal Ewok injuries, fgir root proved ineffectual on Aqualish, Mon Calamari, Quarren, and Priapulins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
