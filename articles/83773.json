The crew of Lucky Bantha visited the Kattellyn system, traded with the Atrakenites on Trilos, then decided to salvage equipment on Atraken itself. Unfortunately for the crew, their space suits were of a cheap quality, resulting in the crew being exposed to the radiation in Atraken's atmosphere. Upon returning to the Lucky Bantha and leaving the planet, the crew died of radiation poisoning. In addition, the salvage recovered by the crew included a nest of vicious diehards who proceeded to wreck the interior of the ship. The Lucky Bantha was left adrift in the Kattellyn system until discovered by spacers around 6 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
