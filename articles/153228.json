The doctor served the Sith Lord Darth Vader as his personal medical caretaker. The doctor was also the supervisor of a nurse who became obsessed and psychotically in love with the Dark Lord of the Sith. After the doctor discovered that the nurse stole Vader's cape and had a container of Vader's pieces of armor and vials of blood, the doctor sought to report it immediately. The nurse, however, escaped and found herself in Vader's hibernation chamber.
