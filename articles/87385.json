As a senator, Amedda considered himself an honest politician and strove to voice the wants and needs of his people in the Senate. Addicted to procedure and a stickler for rules, Amedda's fellow members of the Rim faction, specifically Senator Orn Free Taa, were anxious to put him in the position of Vice Chancellor. Despite Amedda's allegiance to the Trade Federation, Taa and his followers successfully appointed Amedda to the seat made available by the departing Bothan Vice Chair; the conspiring Senators hoped to bog down Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum in meaningless procedural squabbles and eventually end his career. Amedda was also working closely with Senator Palpatine of Naboo to ensure Valorum became powerless, and is one of the few who knew that the Senator of the Chommell sector was more than he appeared to be."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Placed into office on the heels of the failed trade summit on Eriadu, Amedda was awarded unprecedented power over the Supreme Chancellor, capable of blocking his ability to call sessions of Congress as well as work with the Jedi Order. As the Chancellor was further weakened by a scandal involving money laundering, support of Valorum's policies in the Senate degenerated, which effectively paralyzed the Chancellor's government. Unknown to the masses of the Republic, Senator Palpatine and the infamous Muun leader of Damask Holdings, Hego Damask, were behind the problems bogging down the Chancellor. Indeed even Amedda was a puppet to Palpatine, who was in fact a Dark Lord of the Sith. While Palpatine almost had Amedda eliminated for his accelerated climb to power, the Sith Lord decided the Chagrian would better suit the Sith Grand Plan as Vice Chancellor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Brewing conflict"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Per the Sith Grand Plan that clandestinely controlled every function of galactic politics, Amedda presided over the motion of a Vote of No Confidence in Valorum's leadership, as requested by Queen Amidala of Naboo following Senate inaction in response to the invasion of Naboo by the Neimoidian arm of the Trade Federation. While driven by ambition, Amedda was not foolhardy enough to believe that he could attain the Chancellorship; instead the Chagrian was prepared to manipulate the future Chancellor in order to aid the galactic populace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Senator Palpatine's election to the Chancellorship Amedda continued to serve as Vice Chair, planning on manipulating the Naboo man for the betterment of the galaxy. Feeding his ideas to the Chancellor, Amedda believed that he was the true power in the Senate as the Chancellor seemed to play off of his suggestions. In an attempt to keep Palpatine content, Amedda, a connoisseur of rare art, would travel to ancient worlds and obtain precious relics for the Chancellor's collection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Amedda's attempts to keep procedure his office was constantly bombarded by accusations of scandal. Believed to continuously accept bribes from organizations such as the Trade Federation, Amedda disputed the claims and retained his position without cries for a recall. When the Separatist Crisis threatened to tear the Republic asunder, Amedda continued to attempt to manipulate events in the Office of the Supreme Chancellor. As the threat of the Confederacy of Independent Systems continued to grow, the Military Creation Act was hotly debated in the Senate Chamber; should the Senate vote to overturn the Ruusan Reformation and establish an army or should they continue attempts to negotiate? Upon the discovery of a droid army on the dusty world of Geonosis, Amedda conspired to persuade the unwitting Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar Binks, to propose to give emergency powers to the Chancellor. Unknown to the Vice Chair, the idea was in fact the Chancellor's own, and Palpatine had merely planted the idea in the Chagrian's mind."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Per Amedda's unsubtle suggestion, Representative Binks convinced the Senate to grant Palpatine emergency powers, and the Supreme Chancellor's first act was to create a Grand Army of the Republic. An army of clone troopers discovered by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi on the planet Kamino served the role, and the galaxy-spanning Clone Wars began. Retaining his post throughout the conflict, Amedda eventually came to know the truth of Chancellor Palpatine and his alter-ego, Darth Sidious. Believing that the Sith could bring order back to the galaxy, Amedda agreed to keep the secret and planned to do nothing as Palpatine drove the galaxy into turmoil and the Jedi Order in disarray. As Palpatine gauged Amedda's trustworthiness, the Sith Lord ordered his Vice Chair to plan the assassination of former Chancellor Valorum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a session of the wartime Senate, Amedda presided over the chamber as the Senators debated the potential threat that the Death Watch terrorist organization posed to the people of Mandalore. Despite the protests of Mandalore's Duchess Satine Kryze, the Senate was prepared to vote to allow the Republic to occupy the planet in order to resist the Death Watch. Amedda placed a datacard into a holoprojector that displayed a hologram of Mandalore's Deputy Minister Jerec calling for Republic assistance, though the message had in fact been doctored. Kryze was later attacked, and after being granted an audience with Palpatine, was told by Amedda and the Supreme Chancellor that the assassination attempt proved that Mandalore needed the Republic's aid. Amedda expressed his belief that Kryze was unable to keep the Death Watch reigned in by herself. When Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo uncovered Minister Jerec's actual holorecording, requesting that the Republic leave Mandalore alone, Amedda and Palpatine presided over a Senate session that rescinded the Senate's earlier vote to occupy the planet. Kryze, Kenobi, the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and Amidala later discussed the outcome of the vote with Amedda and Palpatine in the Supreme Chancellor's office, and the latter three discussed the logistics of ratifying the Senate's vote."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vice Chancellor attended Palpatine when the Supreme Chancellor welcomed Skywalker, Jedi Master Mace Windu, the astromech droid R2-D2, and the giant Zillo Beast of Malastare to Coruscant; Palpatine was eager to study the beast's fearsome armor despite the Jedi's discomfort with keeping the beast on the capital. Palpatine assigned Doctor Sionver Boll to the task of study, and brought Amedda with him to check on her progress. Back in the Supreme Chancellor's office, Skywalker and Amidala appealed Palpatine's decision to kill the creature, but Amedda expressed his opinion that uncovering the secrets to its armor was for the greater good. Some time later, Amedda and Palpatine presided over a session that saw Amidala present a bill proposing the cutting of military spending, and soon after attended the funeral of Amidala's ally in the Senate, Onaconda Farr of Rodia, who had been poisoned by his aide Lolo Purs. Amidala's bill was voted down, and Amedda was present outside of the Senate Chamber when Palpatine and Amidala discussed the outcome."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the Clone Wars, Amedda accompanied the Supreme Chancellor to Naboo to celebrate the Festival of Light.

Around that time, Amedda was present at a funeral for Jedi who were killed in the Jedi Temple bombing. Soon after, he served a role in the trial of the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano.

Assisting Palpatine, Amedda oversaw the Emperor's shock troopers' search for Yoda.

Despite losing his title of Vice Chair, Amedda retained a position of power, acting as Palpatine's representative in the Senate. As his position soon became largely irrelevant, Amedda was relegated to reclaiming lost Sith artifacts from worlds previously quarantined by the Jedi Order. Despite this apparent demotion, Amedda enjoyed his ability to pursue his thirst for knowledge of Sith history, exploring many Sith worlds. During this time, Amedda ventured to Yavin 4; discovering rare piranha beetles which delighted the Emperor.

He was escorting Queen Amidala to safety, following attacks by mercenaries paid by the Trade Federation. Amedda offered to sell his two Coruscant City Tour tickets to him for 50 Republic credits each (half of what he originally paid) because he had business to attend to on Alderaan. Panaka tried to barter for them with a pair of electrobinoculars, however Amedda declined, on account of having no use for them. He suggested Panaka sell the electrobinoculars to someone else to get the money. When Panaka returned with the 100 credits, Amedda asked for 200 credits to be paid. Panaka then brought this mistake to Amedda's attention, and Amedda apologetically gave him the tickets.
