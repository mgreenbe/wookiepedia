The painting depicted a wide variety of colors, including red, yellow, white, blue and green, all in various rounded shapes. Many of the different colors were in striped or circular patterns. An unclothed humanoid figure stood in the left foreground, his left arm raised upward. The painting was considered a contradiction, though, as the text on the top read \"Glorious Sacrifice\" while the bottom text read \"Freedom isn't Free\". The picture also didn't seem to go with the text, as though it was changed in a rush."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Freedom was a painting that appeared in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, which was released on June 26, 2003 and shut down on December 15, 2011. It could be used in the player's home as decoration, and was made by collecting all the parts for the \"viewscreen printer\" item which could be looted from various enemies in the game. When all were collected and combined, it would produce one of three random paintings, the others being Cargo Port Blueprint and Coronet Skyscraper Blueprint. When the New Game Enhancements were introduced in 2005, several items required for the viewscreen printer become no longer obtainable, which made the paintings highly valuable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
