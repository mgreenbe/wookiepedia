This bioship filled the gap between starfighters and light warships in the Yuuzhan Vong fleet. The Yorik-vec was designated as 'salt' by New Republic starfighter pilots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yorik-vec was armed with the yaret-kors used on coralskippers and corvettes, though the cruiser introduced two variations on the design. The first, the Yorik-vec's chief weapon, was a turret-mounted version of the weapon appendage found on coralskippers, while the second consisted of twin Yaret-Kors. The Yorik-vec also used a dovin basal for propulsion and defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its crew consisted of two pilots and three gunners. Though classified as an assault cruiser - the same class as the 850 meter-long Ralroost of the New Republic Navy, the vessel required only five personnel to operate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two Yuuzhan Vong piloted the ship via cognition hoods, which allowed pilot and vessel to share thoughts and commands - while the remaining three manned the yaret-kors. The Yorik-vec could also accommodate a further eight passengers or the equivalent of 100 metric tons of cargo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Yorik-vec could transport troops and cargo, it did not feature the external appendages necessary to transport coralskippers into battle, as most other warships did.

Several were attached to an armada\u2014approaching the planet Artorias\u2014which was being led by Commander Azca. These assault cruisers were called into action when an \"infidel\" vessel called the Pythea discovered the Yuuzhan Vong fleet; the Yorik-vec were dispatched to cripple the enemy vessel in order to allow a boarding party to capture its occupants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yorik-vec were also used during the later stages of Tsavong Lah's Battle Plan Coruscant operation, during which the galactic capital fell to the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong empire.
