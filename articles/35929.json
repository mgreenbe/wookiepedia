Once their training was complete, the new Death Star troopers became multi-talented individuals who fulfilled a wide variety of roles which included both combat and non-combat positions throughout the battlestations.

This seems to contradict previous EU, according to which stormtroopers are part of the Stormtrooper Corps while Death Star troopers are part of the Navy (and neither are part of the Army). However, the novel's Dramatis Personae indicates Stihl is part of the Imperial Marines, possibly suggesting Marines can cross-train to serve in any of these three military branches."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kenner action figure release of the Death Star Trooper originally called this character \"Death Squad Commander\".
