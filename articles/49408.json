The flowers were typically purple, blue or crimson in color, and they had a unique method of seed dispersal, whereby tiny, hydrogen-filled sacs inside the flowers allowed them to float and travel in a breeze for several kilometers, until the hydrogen sacs shrunk and their seeds were released. According to a rumor, the fragrance emitted by the floating archidia had a euphoric effect on those who inhaled it. The company PharmCorp secretly developed a method by which the pollen produced by the floating archidia could be concentrated to form an inhalant poison."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
