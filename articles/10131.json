Shortly before the conflict erupted, Moff Raythe's Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Dauntless prepared to depart the Imperial dockyard with experimental satellites meant for Operation: Cinder in tow while the special commando unit Inferno Squad oversaw its protection, before a rebel fleet attacked Fondor Station. The MC80 Star Cruiser within the fleet disabled the Dauntless with its ion cannons, leaving the Star Destroyer defenseless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To prevent the rebels from learning about the satellites' true purpose, Inferno Squad and several TIE fighters were deployed to engage the rebel ships. Inferno Squad defended the Dauntless from U-wings attempting to board the Star Destroyer. The leader of Inferno Squad, Commander Iden Versio, infiltrated the rebel Star Cruiser's weapons bay and sabotaged its ion cannons with the assistance of Agent Gideon Hask. Upon leaving the Star Cruiser, Versio continued to defend the Dauntless and freed it by destroying the docking clamps holding the ship in place. The battle ended in an Imperial victory when the Dauntless crippled the Star Cruiser with its turbolasers and departed Fondor Station with the satellites intact, where they would be deployed over Versio's homeworld of Vardos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Endor in the Galactic Civil War in 4 ABY, the Galactic Empire suffered a crushing defeat over the moon of Endor at the hands of the Alliance to Restore the Republic when the second Death Star superweapon was destroyed and the Emperor, Darth Sidious, was killed. On the orders of Vice Admiral Rae Sloane, the surviving Imperial forces retreated from the Endor system. Admiral Garrick Versio relayed the orders to Inferno Squad\u2014a special commando unit led by his daughter, Commander Iden Versio. The team was stationed on Endor when the Death Star was destroyed. After receiving the admiral's orders, Inferno Squad fought through rebel forces and fled the moon in TIE fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iden was personally ordered by Garrick to see him aboard his Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, the Eviscerator, which traveled to the planet Vardos, their homeworld. Garrick informed her of the Emperor's death and showed her a message from a sentinel droid detailing Operation: Cinder\u2014a plan to decimate several worlds using experimental satellites to impact their surfaces with extreme weather. Iden and Inferno Squad were tasked with retrieving the satellites that had been stocked for years at the Fondor Shipyards over the Colonies world of Fondor for the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Dauntless. Iden then relayed the mission to fellow Inferno Squad members Gideon Hask and Del Meeko aboard the team's Raider II-class corvette Corvus. Hask and Iden were to establish security for Moff Raythe, the Dauntless's commander, and gather the satellites for the Star Destroyer, while Meeko remained aboard the Corvus. Inferno Squad traveled to Fondor Station, where the Dauntless was parked, and successfully secured the satellites, allowing Operation: Cinder to begin as planned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Attack on the Dauntless"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Dauntless could depart the Imperial dockyard, however, a fleet of Rebel Alliance forces exited hyperspace and began attacking Fondor Station. The fleet consisted of an MC80 Star Cruiser escorted by multiple CR90 corvettes, X-wings, A-wings, and U-wing transports. The Star Cruiser fired its ion cannons at the Dauntless, which was still docked at the station, and disabled it. In order to prevent the rebels from learning about Operation: Cinder, Hask, Versio, and several pilots manned their TIE fighters aboard the Star Destroyer and exited the vessel to engage the rebel forces. Versio and Hask immediately attacked one of the corvettes and destroyed it, while Meeko dealt with other rebel ships aboard the Corvus. With the Dauntless disabled, the rebels attempted to board the vessel with the U-wings, but were thwarted when Inferno Squad shot down all transports."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the battle progressed, Versio destroyed multiple fighters tailing Hask's TIE fighter in her own TIE fighter. She then entered the Star Cruiser's hangar while Hask defended the Dauntless on the commander's orders. Inside the rebel ship, Versio opened fire on the hangar, destroying multiple ships and killing numerous rebel soldiers. Once the hangar was clear, Versio landed her TIE and began infiltrating the Star Cruiser to sabotage it while the rebels attempted to defend the ship. As the Star Cruiser continued to hammer the Dauntless with ion cannon fire, Hask entered the ship on Versio's orders and regrouped with her in the weapons bay. While Versio's ID10 seeker droid sliced into the ship's systems, rebel soldiers attempted to eliminate the two commandos, but were unsuccessful."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial victory"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid's slicing exposed the ship's ion cannon's cooling cells. Versio destroyed the first two cells before planting an explosive on the final cell. The resulting explosion jettisoned the cell into space, which collided with a nearby CR90 corvette and caused it to crash into the Star Cruiser, knocking Versio and Hask off-balance. The droid quickly activated the ship's shields before Versio could be sucked into space. With the ship's ion cannons successfully disabled, the two commandos returned to their TIE fighters and exited the Star Cruiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moff Raythe then ordered Versio to destroy the docking clamps on the station in order to free the trapped Star Destroyer. She destroyed Fondor Station's power sources, before multiple rebel X-wings attempted to attack the Dauntless. After the rebel fighters were shot down, Versio destroyed the clamps and freed the ship. The Dauntless then moved into attack position and fired at the Star Cruiser with its heavy turbolasers, severely damaging the rebel ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the attack on Fondor thwarted, the Dauntless departed Fondor Station with the satellites and traveled to Vardos, where they were deployed. The assault on the shipyard, however, resulted in Arquitens-class command cruisers becoming a rarer sight. After Hask and Iden returned to the Corvus, the commander briefed Inferno Squad on the status of the satellites and their next mission; Meeko was tasked with destroying the Emperor's Observatory on the planet Pillio in order to prevent the Rebel Alliance from utilizing the artifacts stored within against the Empire. With the unexpected assistance of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker on the planet, Meeko was able to infiltrate the observatory, but decided to keep the structure intact after Skywalker convinced him to do so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Meeko's mission, the Corvus traveled to Vardos, where Iden learned of the satellites' true purpose after seeing the Dauntless and the satellites positioned above the planet. Aboard the Eviscerator, the commander confronted her father regarding the decision to attack their home, but was forced to watch as the satellites were activated over the planet. Inferno Squad was then ordered to extract an Imperial, Protectorate Gleb, from the planet's capital, Kestro. During the mission, Meeko and Iden deserted the Empire and escaped Vardos aboard the Corvus, where they were eventually found by the Rebel Alliance and recruited into their ranks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 5 ABY, the New Republic, successor to the Rebel Alliance, attacked the Fondor Shipyards with the aim of destroying the Interdictor-class Star Destroyer Spectral.
