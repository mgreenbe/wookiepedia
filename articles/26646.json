Christya was impressed when Revan defeated Niklos, a local pazaak champion, in a match, praising Revan's wealth and good looks. She suggested that they go to the bar and buy some drinks for twenty credits. Revan handed her the money eagerly, and Christya began to move to the bar, telling him not to take too long. However, on her way through the cantina, Christya met a Tarisian noble, and ignoring her deal with Revan, she began flirting with him.

Therefore, it is undetermined whether Revan ever spoke with Christya, and, if so, what form the conversation took. However if Christya leaves with the noble then when the player is in Davik Kang's estate, the noble will be found dead on the floor with no loot-able items suggesting she killed him for his money."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If Revan is female, there is no option to buy drinks with her.
