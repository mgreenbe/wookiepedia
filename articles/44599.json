In the last days of the conflict, Pryde was appointed as the commanding officer of the Final Order\u2014a fleet of Xyston-class Star Destroyers\u2014by the reborn Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. Occupying a position of power and privilege, Pryde was a high-ranking First Order officer who wielded authority over the ground and naval forces of the First Order military. Pryde's flagship, the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast, was named in honor of the vessel he commanded during his time in the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A native of the planet Alsakan, Pryde was raised under the reign of the Galactic Empire. As such, his ideology was shaped by the principles of the New Order. A veteran of the Imperial Military, he retreated into the Unknown Regions of the galaxy after the Empire fell to the forces of the New Republic. Like other Imperial officers, Pryde joined the Empire's successor state, the First Order, longing to return to the High Human culture and civilization of his youth. During the New Republic Era, he served as part of a second wave of leadership that Supreme Leader Snoke kept in reserve after the unveiling of Starkiller Base. After Snoke's death, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren supported Pryde's career at the expense of his rival, General Armitage Hux."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the mysticism of Snoke and Ren were foreign to him, as were the dark side rituals of Sith cultists, Pryde was interested in the material benefits they offered to the military. As a member of the Supreme Council, he supported Ren's alliance with the Sith Eternal cult and personally executed Hux for committing the treason of espionage against the First Order. When Ren's mission to Kef Bir ended with his redemption, Pryde assumed command in the absence of a Supreme Leader. Having served the Emperor in the Galactic Civil War, Pryde swore his allegiance to the Emperor and was given command of the Final Order, comprising thousands of Sith Star Destroyers, fitted with axial superlaser cannons that were capable of obliterating entire planets. Pryde, however, perished when his command ship was destroyed by Resistance forces during the Battle of Exegol. Without the Steadfast, the Sith warships were unable to leave Exegol, resulting in the Sith fleet's destruction by the Resistance navy and their allies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Enric Pryde was born on the planet Alsakan in 27 BBY.

While the mysticism of his powers were alien to him, Pryde knew more about the Supreme Leader's machinations than many of his peers, and used his power and insights to cement his own power, obtaining the rank of Allegiant General. However, Pryde eventually came to suspect that Supreme Leader Snoke himself was subservient to an unknown force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 28 ABY, Snoke gave Pryde command of a Resurgent-class Star Destroyer, which was named the \"Steadfast\" by Pryde in honor of the Star Destroyer he served aboard during the days of the Galactic Empire.

Pryde was left as one of the most senior officers in the First Order High Command and commanded reserve forces. While rebuilding his command, Kylo Ren discovered the reserve forces under Pryde's leadership and brought Pryde to the fore, eventually making him a member of the Supreme Council he formed and promoted him to Allegiant General. Pryde knew far more about the machinations of Supreme Leader Snoke and the late Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious than his cohorts, which he used towards his advantage to cement his power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year after the Battle of Crait, a mysterious broadcast with the voice of the late Emperor Palpatine swept out across the galaxy. Deeming the Emperor's return as a potential threat to his rule, Ren diverted his attention from the Resistance and sought ways to track down the Emperor's whereabouts. The Supreme Leader became aware that he required a Sith wayfinder to do so, leading Ren to go, accompanied by Pryde and Hux, to the volcanic planet of Mustafar, once ruled by Vader from his personal stronghold, Fortress Vader. Upon arriving there, Ren and a stormtrooper squad engaged in a fight with the Alazmec of Winsit, a tenacious sect of Sith cultists devoted to protecting Corvax Fen and who venerated Vader as a deity of the dark side, while Pryde and Hux watched from a safe distance. As the fight ensued, Pryde asked Hux if he didn't like to see Ren fighting. When Hux expressed his opinion that Ren had gone mad due prioritizing a ghost's chase over the burning rebellion flames across the galaxy, Pryde reminded Hux that there was someone behind the message and that Ren would answer to no one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ren eventually made his way to Fortress Vader and recovered Vader's wayfinder, which he used to track down the Emperor. After discovering the returned Emperor Palpatine, his cult, the Sith Eternal and their built up forces on Exegol, and learning that there was a spy within the First Order who had sent a message to the Resistance, Kylo Ren presented the head of Boolio before Pryde and the rest of the Supreme Council and informed them of his findings during a meeting on the Steadfast. General Domaric Quinn expressed skepticism of the cult, dismissing them as soothsayers and conjurers, but Pryde supported the First Order's alliance with the Sith Eternal, noting that the Final Order would increase their resources ten thousandfold before snidely remarking that it would \"correct the error\" of Starkiller Base while glaring at General Hux."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After discovering that the Resistance was operating on Pasaana, Kylo Ren ordered Allegiant General Pryde to notify their local forces on Pasaana of the Resistance's presence.

Hux presented their captured prisoner, Chewbacca, to Pryde, who ordered he be locked up in the detention block. After the Resistance's mission to Kijimi, during which time Hux had helped Poe Dameron and Finn return to Millennium Falcon and escape the Steadfast, Hux reported to Pryde that the Resistance fighters had forced him to help them escape. However, Pryde saw through Hux's lie and, having realized that Hux was the spy, executed him on the spot before having the Supreme Leader informed of Hux's treason. Pryde also told Ren that the Sith dagger, upon which there was an inscription of the location of one of the Sith wayfinders, now in the Resistance's possession, had been scanned during the captivity of the Wookiee, allowing for Ren to track Rey to Kef Bir, where the Jedi aspirant hoped to uncover a Sith wayfinder that would lead to the Emperor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Serving the reborn emperor"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Destruction of Kijimi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kylo Ren renounced the dark side after his mother, Princess Leia Organa, sacrificed herself to reach out to him during a duel with Rey on Kef Bir, assuming his identity as Ben Solo once more. Sometime later, Emperor Palpatine discussed this turn of events with Allegiant General Pryde over a hologram. The Emperor ordered the Allegiant General to come to him on Exegol, and Pryde pledged himself to the Emperor, recalling to the Emperor that he had served him during the Old Wars, and now would do so again. Pryde's declaration thus cemented the alliance between the First Order and Sith cultists. The Emperor then informed the Allegiant General that he was sending him a Xyston-class Star Destroyer and ordered him to send it to a planet with ties to the Resistance.

A Resistance attack soon launched, hoping to prevent the Sith Star Destroyers from sowing chaos across the galaxy. After learning from a fellow officer that the Resistance was targeting the navigation tower on Exegol, Pryde had the source of the navigation signal needed for the Sith fleet to deploy from Exegol switched to the Steadfast, declaring that they would guide the fleet out themselves. However, Resistance General Finn realized that the signal had been transferred to the Steadfast, and the Resistance's ground team concocted a daring plan to land on the hull of the Steadfast. Pryde had legions of Sith troopers and Sith Jetpack Troopers deployed to repel any boarders and also ordered a bridge technician to jam the Resistance speeders, only to be informed that they were not using speeders; rather, to Pryde's astonishment, the Resistance mounted a cavalry charge on orbaks against the Sith troopers, causing a battle to break out on the ship's hull."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pryde was further baffled when another fleet comprised of thousands of ships arrived to reinforce the Resistance, wanting to know where such a vast amount of ships had come from, given that the Resistance had no navy.

When the First Order joined forces with the Sith Eternal, he was ambitious to use their forces while most of the First Order clashed with their new allies. Pryde viewed the arcane behavior of the Sith Eternal as by-products of a thirst for power. Unlike more arrogant officers, he knew not to disrespect these beliefs as he had personally seen Darth Vader in action.

Although Pryde served the Order faithfully, he had a disdain for the gruesome and horrible aspects of it. After the Resistance fighters escaped the Steadfast, Pryde was the first officer to identify General Hux's betrayal as the spy against the First Order and ruthlessly executed him on the spot without hesitation, showing no remorse for his actions. Pryde could see the value in the legions of Star Destroyers that had been created by the Final Order, even when others dismissed it. Pryde viewed the Starkiller Base superweapon as an \"error\", as the resources used in its construction and subsequently lost when it was blown up by the Resistance had made it difficult for the First Order to maintain a firm hold on the galaxy, and saw the offer of the Sith Destroyer fleet as a means of correcting that error. Although Pryde had ambition when it came to cementing his power, he was also loyal to Emperor Palpatine as a veteran of the Galactic Empire, pledging the First Order to him. Pryde was able to maintain a calm composure even when bewildered, such as when an allied fleet arrived to reinforce the Resistance at the battle at Exegol, something he had no backup plan for. When facing his death, Pryde ultimately lost his cool composition, giving in to anger and fear when faced with his last defeat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Enric Pryde was a human male who had blue eyes, fair skin, and gray hair.
