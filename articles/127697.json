When the proximity mines detected a target they would fly after them, talking to the target, trying to convince him or her that they were harmless and posed no real threat. They would say things like \"I am not a bomb\" and \"The beeping you hear is not a proximity detector.\" The smart mines might be a variant of the floating mine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hutt Cartel on Nar Shaddaa owned several smart mines. Three months after the First Battle of Geonosis, Urdruua the Hutt deployed several dozen smart mines to hunt down and kill Aurra Sing when he was trying to get revenge for when the Jedi hunter had badly hurt the Hutt Cartel during her Jedi training on Nar Shaddaa in her younger years. The smart mines chased Aurra through the skies of Nar Shaddaa, trying to make her think that they had an important message for her. However, the mines failed, and Aurra was able to get away, making the smart mines crash into a swoop bike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
