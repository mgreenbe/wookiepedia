While there were primitive ferns and other simple plants, many evolved to higher order plants, with active defensive systems.

Since animals were also required to gather as much food as possible before the harsh winter, most animals were omnivorous. Like the plants, many had venoms and poisons that they could use on prey. Most of these creatures had elaborate defense mechanisms as well, such as thick hides or the ability to camouflage themselves in the natural terrain. One of the more common predators on Sileron were the Derkolo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
