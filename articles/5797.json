She was apprenticed to the Disciples of Ragnos cult leader Tavion Axmis. In 14 ABY, the cult embarked on a quest to resurrect the ancient Sith Lord Marka Ragnos. In order to achieve this, the cult needed to siphon Force energies from locations with significant Force nexuses using the Scepter of Ragnos, a powerful dark side artifact. Under orders from Axmis, Alora infiltrated the Jedi Praxeum on the moon Yavin 4 and sliced into the facility's mainframe, stealing a list of such locations. Soon after, Axmis sent Alora to the planet Hoth to gather information on the area. Within a former Rebel Alliance base on Hoth she encountered and fought Jedi Initiate Jaden Korr. Alora again encountered Korr on the planet Taspir III, where the recently anointed Jedi Knight struck her down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alora, a female Lethan Twi'lek, was a member of the dark side cult known as the Disciples of Ragnos. By 14 ABY, she came under the tutelage of the Human female Tavion Axmis during Axmis' effort to resurrect the Sith Lord Marka Ragnos with a powerful dark side artifact called the Scepter of Ragnos. Alora was her most prized apprentice and was tasked by Axmis to infiltrate Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy on the moon Yavin 4. After gaining access to the Jedi mainframes, Alora stole a list of locations strong in the Force so that Axmis could siphon the Force energies from there using the Scepter of Ragnos and then use the energy to resurrect Ragnos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, Axmis sent her Twi'lek apprentice to the planet Hoth along with support from Axmis' allies in the Imperial Remnant to gather information on the Force energies located there. While they were searching Echo Base\u2014a hideout used by the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War\u2014a Sith cultist managed to determine from flight trajectories that Skywalker had traveled to the planet Dagobah following the Battle of Hoth. The cultist downloaded the flight information and transmitted the data to Alora before being killed by Jedi Initiate Jaden Korr, who was on Hoth as part of an investigation into the locations mentioned in Skywalker's records. Alora relayed the information to Axmis, who congratulated her apprentice and told Alora to meet her on Dagobah, when she was located by Korr in a hangar inside the base. Alora engaged Korr in a duel, but fled when she realized that she couldn't gain the upper hand. Angered, she taunted Korr as she escaped and claimed they would cross paths again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After her defeat on Hoth, Alora trained furiously and adopted a second lightsaber. She would encounter Korr again on the planet Taspir III while he and his Master Kyle Katarn were searching for Rosh Penin, Katarn's other apprentice who had renounced the dark side and was being held captive in the cult's large facility. Alora was at the facility to ensure that Penin was secure and unable to escape. She was surprised when Korr, recently granted the title of Jedi Knight, arrived and proceeded to lead him on a chase throughout the facility. Alora taunted the Jedi from various ledges and balconies until she reached the hangar where Penin was being held. Korr confronted Penin, angered by his betrayal. Seeing his anger, Alora encouraged Korr to strike down Penin and join her and Axmis in the dark side. With telepathic help from Katarn, Korr let his anger dissipate. Realizing that he would not turn, the enraged Alora cut off Penin's arm with her lightsaber and attacked Korr, who eventually killed the tenacious Dark Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alora was a red-skinned Twi'lek with green eyes who was extremely overconfident, a trait that she learned from her Master, Tavion Axmis. This overconfidence was evident when Korr first encountered Alora on Hoth, where she remarked that Skywalker was sending children after the Disciples of Ragnos. The second time she faced Korr, on Taspir III, she again taunted him, saying that she had learned many things from her Master and called Korr a \"sanctimonious fool\"; however, her overconfidence failed her and she was subsequently killed by Korr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alora was a very fast learner and picked up all that her Master taught her. She was flexible, agile, and feminine which was reflected in her acrobatic, graceful lightsaber styles. Focusing on lightsaber combat, she wielded a red-bladed Adept lightsaber and utilized the Fast style of the New Jedi Order. After her duel with Korr on Hoth, she began using an additional red-bladed Adept lightsaber and became extremely deadly with the Jar'Kai style of combat. In addition, Alora was very skilled in the use of Force Jump, Force speed and telekinesis. Although she did not use dark side Force powers frequently, she did demonstrate proficiency in the use of Force lightning and Force rage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alora first appeared in the 2003 Star Wars Legends video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy and was voiced by Grey DeLisle. In the video game, Alora is the only character to have a different animation for Force Jump. Her version is a forward cartwheel while the standard animation for all other characters is a somersault. She can also perform a unique saber throw, throwing both her lightsabers at the same time and has a different taunt animation, briefly levitating and spinning both her blades. If the player chooses the non-canon dark side path in Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, Alora commends Korr for killing Penin. However, Korr feels the Scepter should belong to him and Alora still engages him in a duel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A second Alora model and skin exists in the game files and is available for use in multiplayer, but the code for her alternate appearance to be used when Korr meets Alora on Taspir III is commented out in favor of reusing her primary attire. There are no comments in the code justifying the reason for this and it is easily changed with a third-party modification."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
