When his brother was caught skimming cargo during his runs and taken to a remote bunker complex on Endor to await judgment by the local Vigo, Reik approached his friends, Lando Calrissian and Dash Rendar, to help mount a rescue. Calrissian owed Sopil a favor and Sopil was able to cover Rendar's fee for the mission. The group arrived on Endor shortly after the local Vigo and Prince Xizor's assistant, the Human replica droid Guri, traveled to the moon to deal with Owal; and other matters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
