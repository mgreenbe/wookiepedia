The episode featured Jedi Knight Raynar Thul and reported on Thul's continuing rehabilitation as well as his lunch on the Jedi Temple steps at the same time every day. When Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala ordered the siege of the New Jedi Temple by Mandalorians in 44 ABY, Mandalorian commander Belok Rhal stated that he would shoot on sight any Jedi other than the psychotic Knights he had been sent by Daala to obtain\u2014Sothais Saar and Turi Altamik. However, Thul was not intimidated by Rhal, and decided to take his lunch anyway. Daala's Chief of Staff, Wynn Dorvan, who frequently took lunch with Thul, rushed to the scene, arriving on the Temple steps as Thul emerged from the Temple and effectively halting any Mandalorian attack on the Jedi as the two ate lunch. Tyrr, meanwhile, commented on the development, referring to the episode in which he had reported on Thul."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
