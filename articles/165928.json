A young world, Xorrn's recently-cooled crust provided access to mineral resources within the magma below. However, unstable tectonics on Xorrn prevented most mining operations that attempted to exploit the planet's resources from meeting success."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Clone Wars, Geonosians hid illegal battle droid construction foundries on Xorrn. After the war began, the Galactic Republic discovered Xorrn, and subjected the planet to numerous attacks, orbitally bombarding the droid construction facilities. With the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Xorrn was mostly forgotten, save for a clan of former Separatist sympathizers from Gall, which was razed by the Empire, who later resided in Foundry Four, an abandoned factory complex created by the Geonosians, which was transformed into a subterranean city by the Gall refugees. During the Galactic Civil War, Xorrn's inhabitants produced various starship components for both criminals and rebels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located in the Ferra sector, deep within the southern Slice of the Outer Rim Territories, and hidden along the Cranan-Excarga Hyperspace Route, spun the virtually uninhabited, but terrestrial planet Xorrn in the system of the same name, and had a rotational period of twenty-five hours per day, with an orbital period of 526 days per year. The few visitors of the world had described it as similar to the desert planet Tatooine, albeit more peaceful, and was home to a native breed of scurrier and a handful of transplanted species such as hawk-bats and conduit worms, as well as a populace of 350 lifeforms who spoke the galaxy's basic language."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most of the planet's life kept to its long, winding caverns which contained springs of molten minerals. And while life struggled on Xorrn, the planet was wealthy in its mineral resources. Xorrn was young compared to most planets, its rocky surface only beginning to cool in recent times, and as a result, its thin, unstable crust provided easy access to the mineral-rich magma below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ferra Sector Shipyard, a small repair slip, was secretly established in Xorrn's orbit during the reign of the Galactic Empire by Lira Hardin and her team of engineers. A 800-meter shipyard, its primary function was to repair ships that were unable to use ports under Imperial control or oversight. However, the yard was also responsible for refitting bulk freighters and haulers with armor, armament, and hangar space to transform civilian cargo vessels into combat warships for usage by mercenaries, pirates, and later the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Geonosian colonization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While it was difficult for small mining operations to establish business on Xorrn, due to the planet's unstable tectonic plates, which earned it a reputation for being a credit sink among resource acquisition analysts, the Geonosian race was able to find successes on Xorrn. Before the onset of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, in an effort to conceal the production of illegal battle droids from the Republic, the Geonosians hid a warren of droid foundries on Xorrn, in belief that it would be the last place they would search. Initially, they made attempts at erecting traditional Geonosian hive spires on Xorrn, but the planet's thin crust swallowed the citadels before becoming operational. However, once the Geonosians hit upon the idea of constructing spires in the opposite way, excavating rather than erecting, Xorrn became the insectoid race's best-kept secret, with millions of battle droids constructed far from the sight of Coruscant and the Republic in the Core Worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, despite the precautions of the Geonosians, Xorrn and their operations were eventually discovered by the Republic after the Clone Wars' inception, where it subsequently became war zone for the conflict's duration. Since its discovery near the war's onset, Xorrn had become subject to numerous attacks, and after a few failed attempts at an atmospheric insertion on other Geonosian worlds, the Republic decided that Xorrn was no longer worth further casualties. However, before departing, the Republic ordered the Ferra sector fleet to commence a planetary bombardment on the facilities, which caused several Trade Federation core ships picking up droid shipments to become caught in the attack, leaving behind a graveyard of their gutted hulls across Xorrn's surface."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Home to refugees"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the rise of the Galactic Empire, however, Xorrn was once again forgotten by much of the galaxy, save for some. A small group of refugees led by Cacique Jans Coorsa escaped from the razed world of Gall and took refuge in the Geonosian factory complex known as Foundry Four, where Coorsa became the leader of their established governing body, Clan Assembly, which eventually led to the reactivation of the factories within, while also transforming it into an underground city for the survivors of the Imperial attack on Gall. There, the refugees produced and installed a variety of custom starship components for Rebels, pirates, and smugglers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, during the Galactic Civil War, the Empire soon discovered what had been transpiring on Xorrn and proceeded to dispatch an Imperial task force under the command of Captain Ralchio Nervi, consisting of the Gladiator I flagship Blood Ambition and the Raider-class corvettes Sargantuan and Warhawk, were sent to Xorrn after discovering the shipyard and the operations on the planet. However, the Rebel Alliance had sent an armada in response to the Empire's attack, and so erupted a battle between the Empire and Rebellion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located beneath Xorrn's surface was Foundry Four, a functioning warren of five separate Geonosian-built droid factories, conjoined by a central command center, a monitoring station deep within the foundry, that was used to oversee the operations of the five factories, and later used to hold meetings of the Clan Assembly. After the collapse of several landing shafts during the Clone Wars, two shafts, located at each factory, remained active and were used for the importing of raw materials and exporting products finished within the facility. Each shaft ran 400 meters below the surface to a corvette-sized landing platform located near a staging area used for cargo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Starship Component Factory, westerly of two functioning factories, had a clear landing shaft so that raw materials and finished components were easy to move in and out of the facility. Below the factory was a smelting plant used to melt, purify, and pipe metals to the factory's dozens of assembly lines, where they were to be poured and stamped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The northeastern factory, referred to as the Belts, were used as the primary residential area for the inhabitants of Foundry Four. While the main walkway to the landing shaft was kept clear for traffic and finished products, the former assembly lines were used to support housing. Four-roomed prefabrication habitation cubes were among the first things constructed upon the foundry's reactivation by Jans Coorsa. And while only a few hundred lifeforms lived on Xorrn, most worked in either of the two factories or the orbital shipyard, or were too young or old to do so. The southeastern factory, the Arms Factory, was dedicated to the production of a variety of different starship-grade weaponry. Once produced, the larger weapons were moved one at a time on specialized skiffs through the residential area of the northeastern factory, which had the closest landing shafts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xorrn was introduced in the 2016 Fantasy Flight Games adventure book Friends Like These as part of the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
