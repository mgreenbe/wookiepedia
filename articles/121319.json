The soldiers who participated in the operation made use of special equipment which allowed them to function at all depths beneath the oceans of Sedri. When the Rebel Alliance first landed on the planet, it was the native Sedrians who gave them them training and valuable experience in the art of aquatic warfare. This allowed the Rebels to sneak on board the Imperial garrison base and examine the Imperial equipment. Based on this knowledge and discussions with the Sedrians, the Sea Commandos were born."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the formation of the New Republic, the Sea Commandos were adopted as part of their military.
