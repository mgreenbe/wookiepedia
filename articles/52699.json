It was the capital of the Galactic Republic that governed much of the known galaxy throughout the Republic Era, and during the Imperial Era, Coruscant was the center of the Galactic Empire. With the death of Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious in 4 ABY, however, Coruscant descended into rioting and civil war. The Empire ceded its capital to the New Republic by the end of the Galactic Civil War, and a provisional government was created to administrate Coruscant on the Republic's behalf. Breaking with a millennia of tradition, the New Republic stripped Coruscant of its central role in the galaxy and the status of galactic capital was awarded to different worlds on a rotating basis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Gang war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Republic Era saw a decline in law and order on Coruscant despite its membership in the Galactic Senate. Criminal syndicates came to dominate Coruscant in the absence of a strong governmental presence, allowing gangs to roam even the more respectable districts of Imperial City by the time of the mission to Batuu. The gangs ultimately fought over control of the planet, making Coruscant an undesirable destination to many outsiders and potential visitors. As a result, tourism all but vanished on Coruscant while gang violence became commonplace for the local Coruscanti. Only the wealthy could afford the protection of security droids and armed bodyguards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hondo Ohnaka, a pirate since the days of the Clone Wars, noted Coruscant's state as a tarnished world in his book Galactic Explorer's Guide. Though it was still considered the heart of galactic civilization, the reality was that Coruscant no longer represented galactic possibilities. Instead, the former capital had become a symbol of the conflict and disorder associated with the current era. The RA-7 protocol droid DK-RA-43 considered Coruscant's fall from grace as one of the greatest tragedies in galactic history."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the Battle of Exegol in 35 ABY, Coruscant revolted against the military rule of the First Order.
