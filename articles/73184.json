When his older brother, his hero, was killed, he blamed the young Obi-Wan Kenobi and could believe no wrong of his late brother. He seemed to hate Obi-Wan for Bruck's death, and almost gave in to his anger and hurt him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twelve years after the events surrounding his brother's death, Kad resurfaced as Uni, leader of a following of disenchanted idealists and \"refugees\" each leaving their planet's downward spirals. His father, Vox, now an old man, had also followed, and both still remained bitter towards Obi-Wan until Vox's selfish plan was uncovered and backfired, resulting in his death. Kad was able to forgive both his scheming father and Obi-Wan. He then went on his way in the universe, presumably to higher goals than leading his people to run away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
