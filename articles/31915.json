However, three of the four engines had been sabotaged by the fleeing Sugi. Kenobi fears that the Sugi will return in greater numbers and the two Jedi realize that they have to find a way to move the kyber crystal out of the ship quickly. Traveling out of the ship, the two Jedi spot a herd of quadrupeds. Kenobi suggests that his former Padawan Skywalker use his Force powers to convince the beasts to help the Jedi to pull the massive crystal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker tries to contact the quadrupeds but they ignore him. However, the Jedi sees a jamel and manages to convince it to assist them. While exploring a nearby encampment, Kenobi encounters an Amani but uses a mind trick to convince him that he did not see the Jedi. When Kenobi sees Skywalker with the jamel, he is not pleased with his former Padawan's efforts. Skywalker retorts that Kenobi should try befriending the animals next time while Kenobi jokes about bringing the Jedi Master Mace Windu with them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Endente and the other Sugi regroup at an arsenal depot and prepare for a counter-attack against the Jedi. Count Dooku informs Endente that General Grievous will be coming to meet them on the plains of Utapau. Fearful of reporting his failure to the Sith, Endente tells Dooku to send Grievous to meet them at Pau City instead because the Amani can no longer be relied upon to guard the crystal. Endente tells Grievous that they have a friend in the Utapau government. Having finished conferring with Dooku, Endente and his forces depart on speeder bikes to reclaim the crystal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at Endente's starship, the two Jedi return with the jamel to transport the kyber crystal, which is suspended from the ceiling. Kenobi suggested cutting the ropes holding the crystal while simultaneously using the Force to lower it onto a repulsorlift cart. Kenobi doubled the output of the cart to support the crystal's weight. Having accomplished this task, the two Jedi use the jamel to draw the cart. While Kenobi is pessimistic about their chances of reaching Pau City, Anakin tells him to relax. This prompts the older Jedi to complain that they are traveling at a snail's space. Shortly later, the two Jedi are pursued by several Sugi riders on speeder bikes. Anakin uses his Force powers and lightsaber to fight the attackers and to hijack one of their speeder bikes. He uses that speeder bike to shoot down the other Sugi speeders. Meanwhile, Kenobi continues guiding the jamel and the crystal cart."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile at Pau City, two Neimoidian shuttles land carrying General Grievous and several B1-series battle droids and IG-100 MagnaGuards.

Kenobi and Skywalker argue about burying the fallen Sugi warriors, whom Anakin disdains as his enemies. The two Jedi used the speeder bike captured by Anakin to transport the kyber crystal cart. As they continue their journey, they are attacked by a second wave of Sugi warriors. Kenobi stands on the cart while Anakin rides the speeder bike. The Sugi speeders open fire on the crystal, causing it to deflect their blasts back at them. However, they are still pursued by two speeders led by Endente himself.

General Grievous' MagnaGuards then close in on the two Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Endente heads to the Governor's office where he is confronted by Grievous. Grievous demands to know the location of the kyber crystal. Attempting to cover up his failure, Endente claims that there were problems with the Amani security but that crystal is being delivered to Pau City. However, Grievous is already aware that the Jedi have stolen the crystal and beheads the Sugi merchant for his incompetence.

Meanwhile, the General's shuttle takes off with the crystal into space. The Jedi give chase in another starship. Grievous arrives and the Governor apologizes for his failure to kill the Jedi.
