He introduced himself as a messenger for the syndicate, hiding the truth that he was, in reality, their leader. Gwi reminded Valance that the Bounty Hunters' Guild had a bounty on his head due to the bounties he poached from them. He offered the cyborg a job to eliminate \"a man\" and clear the bounty, but Valance, however, refused and reminded him that he lived by two rules; always know who he worked for and operate as a bounty hunter alone.

Gwi explained that he was required for the mission, but the cyborg revealed that the droid was a mole for the Hutts and that he lied about his profession.

Valance revealed that only he knew about his actual role, and that he deduced the location of the outpost as it was located in an asteroid field.
