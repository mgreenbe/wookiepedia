During a smuggling operation, the Windfall was pulled out of hyperspace above Mustafar by an Imperial Interdictor-class, and its captain was taken to be imprisoned in the fortress of Darth Vader. It was stored in the hangar while the smuggler was imprisoned. After breaking out and accepting an invite to join a uprising to stop the Aeon Engine, the smuggler and ZO-E3 were able to destroy the Engine. They were then able to take back the Windfall. Their next move was to follow the treasure map they unlocked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Windfall appears in the 2019 Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
