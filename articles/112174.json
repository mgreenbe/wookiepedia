The warehouse catered to the needs of the local scouts and explorers, and casual visitors were discouraged from entering by a group of Rodian guards employed by Rayne, but any being who identified Rayne was allowed to enter. No one was allowed into the warehouse itself, as Rayne chose to keep its contents a secret. She maintained a complete inventory on a datapad, and could call up any item in minutes. Spacers could also store their cargoes in the warehouse for a small fee, but Rayne insisted the her Rodian guards load and unload the cargo. The reason for the secrecy and security was that much of Rayne's business was with various criminal and smuggling operations in the Outer Rim, as well as the shipment of goods for Brentaal's Wayward Children. Hidden behind a jumble of shipping crates Rayne kept a hyperwave transmitter, used to make sure she was up-to-date on her customers' needs and shipments."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
