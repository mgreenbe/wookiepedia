However, due to the machinations of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who secretly manipulated both sides of the war for his own gain, the Mandalorian Protectors were led into a trap on the planet Norval II, where their army of Battle Legionnaire droids were destroyed by Republic clone troopers, and all but three soldiers\u2014Fenn Shysa, Tobbi Dala, and the broken Mand'alor Spar\u2014were killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the end of the Clone Wars, as the Republic transitioned into the Galactic Empire and turned its sights on the Mandalorian homeworld of Mandalore, Fenn Shysa took up the leadership of the Mandalorians and the title of Mandalore.

The Mandalorian Protectors fought against the Imperial occupiers in a guerrilla war for years, before finally killing the leader of their operations in an attack on the Empire's base within the City of Bone. Their numbers dramatically increased with an influx of freed Mandalorian slaves, the Protectors moved against Imperial Grand Admiral Miltin Takel and forced him from Mandalorian space, truly freeing themselves from the Empire at last. The Mandalorian Protectors under Shysa went on to join forces with the Alliance of Free Planets, first against the extra-galactic Nagai species, then in conjunction with the Nagai against their more dangerous mutual foe, the Tof.

Despite their allowance of former Death Watch troops, the Mandalorian Protectors were assembled in the image of the True Mandalorians, the army of supercommandos loyal to Jaster Mereel and Jango Fett who opposed the Death Watch during the Mandalorian Civil War decades prior to the Clone Wars. Following in the footsteps of the True Mandalorians, the Mandalorian Protectors placed an importance on high moral standards, exemplified in the Supercommando Codex authored by Jaster Mereel. The Codex outlined honorable behavior through a modernization of the ancient Canons of Honor and elaboration on the six Resol'nare, which the Protectors heeded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Mandalorians of the era traditionally held little regard for official rank and preferred an informal command structure with the ultimate authority belonging to the Mand'alor, a title which meant \"sole ruler\" in the Mando'a language and represented the traditional leader of the Mandalorian clans, the Mandalorian Protectors instituted a more rigid structure comprised of numerous military ranks during the Clone Wars. The lowest rank in the Protector army was verd'ika, the equivalent of private in Basic, held by soldiers typically assigned infantry duties. Above verd'ika were the ranks of alor'uus and ruus'alor, which translated as corporal and sergeant, respectively. Ranks above these were considered officer ranks, and included ver'alor, alor'ad, and al'verde\u2014lieutenant, captain, and commander.

Beginning as a fledgling, covert resistance, by the time of the Galactic Civil War, the new Mandalorian Protectors had become a guerrilla fighting force against a growing Imperial slaving operation that targeted Mandalore's citizens. Their numerical strength was nebulous, as their ranks were depleted by Imperial counterattacks, only to be bolstered with every Mandalorian slave the group rescued. After freeing the Mandalorian homeworld from its Imperial occupiers, the Mandalorian Protector ranks were swelled by an influx of volunteers from the countless slaves they had set free. With the Empire gone, the Mandalorian Protectors became literal protectors, establishing a patrolled border around Mandalorian space where they acted as a home guard. Occasionally, members of the Protectors during this era would take up mercenary work, but only with the express permission of Mand'alor Shysa, and only if the job in question posed no threat to innocents. That all changed with the death of Fenn Shysa and the ascension of Boba Fett as his replacement as both Mand'alor and leader of the Mandalorian Protectors.

On their backs, the Mandalorian Protectors wore jetpacks, allowing them to take to the air, and several wielded EE-3 carbine rifles. Their meager two hundred troops were bolstered by a legion of one thousand BL-series Battle Legionnaire droids, designed by Fenn Shysa and supplied by Baktoid Combat Automata after the Protectors allied with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

Utilizing weapons technology superior to that of the Separatists' B1-Series battle droids and Spar's own intimate knowledge of the Grand Army of the Republic from his days as an Advanced Recon Commando, Spar led the Protectors in hard-hitting blitzkrieg assaults. One successful strategy he implemented was to command the Protectors' Battle Legionnaire combat droids to attack the enemy's front line, while the Protectors used their jetpacks to drop into the middle of the enemy position, behind their lines, and strike. Assignments that took the Confederacy's droids months to accomplish could be finished by the Protectors often within a single day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Protectors were reformed under Fenn Shysa in the advent of the Imperial occupation of Mandalore, their resources were severely limited. The group lacked the deadly Battle Legionnaire droids it had so enjoyed during the Clone Wars, and over time, even Mandalorian armor became scarce as sets of armor were confiscated by the Imperials that took over Mandalore. Shysa's Protectors were forced to act as an insurgent fighting force, using their familiarity with the forests of Mandalore to launch hit-and-run attacks on Imperials.

The Mandalorian Protectors acquired a fleet of Pursuer-class enforcement ships from the MandalMotors company, and established a defensive patrol with the vessels to defend Mandalorian space. When presented with a hostile capital ship encroaching upon their region of space, the Mandalorian Protectors would forcibly board the ship, capture its bridge, and deliver it to Mandalore's spaceport in Keldabe, Mandalore's capital city.

Protector forces made use of older Pursuer-class enforcement ships during the war with the Yuuzhan Vong, in addition to Meteor-class Q-Carriers, Gladiator-class fighters, ancient dungeon ships, and a small fleet of Firespray-class attack crafts. Protector forces in the Second Galactic Civil War had access to a number of Bes'uliik-class starfighters, and by 44 ABY, the Mandalorian Protectors also possessed numerous Canderous-class assault tanks, QuickStryke assault sleds, Vyrhawk fighter-bombers, and multiple Tra'kad starships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Formation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The roots of the Mandalorian Protectors could be traced back to the Advanced Recon Commando Alpha-\u00d82, better known by the nickname of Spar. A clone of the Mandalorian soldier Jango Fett, Spar was born on the planet Kamino, a water-covered world in the region of the galaxy known as Wild Space, where he was one of millions of clone troopers bred to serve the Galactic Republic. However, Spar was unique among his clone brethren in that he had somehow inherited the memories of his progenitor, Jango Fett. Knowing he would be reconditioned were the Kaminoans in charge of the army's production to find out about Fett's memories, Spar resolved to escape the ocean planet.

In need of soldiers for his new Mandalorian Protector army, Spar recruited two hundred Mandalorian police, and another dozen recruits came from former members of the Death Watch faction. Among the first to rally to Spar's call were Tobbi Dala and his lifelong friend Fenn Shysa, a local constable and Mandalorian clan chieftain. Shysa convinced Spar to act as Jango Fett's heir, believing that Fett's reputation as a Jedi killer could be used as a symbol of strength for the Mandalorians, and spread the rumor that led many to believe Spar was Fett's son. Spar won out over the pacifistic New Mandalorian faction that had been ascendant on Mandalore for centuries but had recently been broken by the machinations of a reborn sect of the Death Watch. As a symbol that the traditional warrior ways would regain their prominence over the New Mandalorians' pacifism, in addition to being an inspiration to his troops, Spar claimed the title of Mand'alor, taking the sobriquet of \"Mandalore the Resurrector.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With his authority as Mand'alor, Spar officially allied the Mandalorians and the planet Mandalore with the Separatists of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the Mandalorian Protectors seized the facilities of the MandalMotors company in Keldabe, Mandalore's capital city, for exclusive use by the Confederacy.

Other units of Protector supercommandos were deployed to perform more covert operations on behalf of the Confederacy. Over time, the Mandalorian Protectors garnered a reputation for effectiveness, and were in high-demand among the Separatist leadership.

Though they were eventually forced to enact a full retreat, the Protectors had reduced the 327th to an effective fighting force of only sixty percent. After the death of a prominent Confederacy leader, the Mandalorian Protectors executed a blitzkrieg assault on New Bornalex, where they faced off against the Galactic Marines. Amidst the battle, Commander Bacara and the Marines earned themselves a fierce reputation for literally tearing the Protector's super battle droids reinforcements apart using their suits of powered spacetrooper armor, but the Protectors were ultimately able to claim victory over the Republic at the cost of a significant number of their own Battle Legionnaire droids. In another blitzkrieg attack in response to the Separatist leader's death, the Mandalorian Protectors struck at the clone troopers' homeworld of Kamino. There, they besieged the cloning facilities, devastating them in a move that earned the Protectors the ire of Kaminoan scientists like Taun We for decades after."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian Protectors' role in the Clone Wars finally came to an end when they were contacted by Darth Sidious, the secretive Sith Lord that had orchestrated and manipulated both sides of the Clone Wars for his personal gain.

Though the clan chieftains agreed to the Empire's request to purchase land on Mandalore in order to establish a base in the sector, Fenn Shysa was wary of the Imperial interest in the Mandalorian world; as the Empire arrived, Shysa accepted the title of Mand'alor in accordance with public opinion, succeeding Spar, who eventually left Mandalore to wander the galaxy. The Empire ultimately purchased the defunct, mythosaur-shaped amusement park outside of Keldabe known as the City of Bone, and while Imperial forces worked to install their new garrison within the park's skeletal shell, Shysa likewise began to lay the foundation for a new organization of Mandalorian Protectors in case they one day needed to resist the Empire. Together with Tobbi Dala, Shysa began training a contingent of new recruits, including volunteers from the Mandalorian police, even seeking the aid of Mandalorians formerly with the Cuy'val Dar\u2014Jango Fett's hand-picked band of soldiers contracted to train the Republic's clone commandos\u2014and attempting to recruit the clone deserters of Clan Skirata in order to seamlessly infiltrate the ranks of the Empire's clone stormtroopers.

Without the Battle Legionnaire droids they had fought beside in the Clone Wars, and Mandalorian armor growing in rarity among the troops, the Mandalorian Protectors were forced to become an insurgent force making due with their training and what little equipment they had. Shysa personally undertook victimless mercenary work to help finance the Protectors' operations, including the race to acquire the Tessent. The Protectors focused their efforts on harassing Imperial slaving operations, attacking slaver convoys, and freeing Mandalorian slaves. Reduced to hit-and-run missions, the Mandalorian Protectors' guerrilla tactics were based on their members' familiarity with the Mandalore's forests, allowing them to vanish into the planet's plentiful veshok trees before the Imperials could muster a counter attack. The damage these raids caused did not go unnoticed by the Empire: a bounty was put out for Shysa, and it was during one such attack that Tobbi Dala was captured by the Imperials.

In the resulting chaos, Shysa and the others recaptured Dengar, and stole an airspeeder to make their escape, destroying the master control unit that powered the energy cuffs binding the imprisoned slaves in the process. Set loose, the slaves revolted, while Shysa and his allies stormed the Suprema's office in order to open the blast doors trapping everyone inside the base. There, the Suprema shot and wounded Tobbi Dala before being violently subdued by Shysa; the mortally wounded Dala demanded that Shysa leave him behind to open the doors so that his old friend could escape with Organa, Dengar, and the former slaves. Though the slaves and the Mand'alor's speeder made it out, Dala closed the blast doors behind them, knowing full well that the Imperial squadron pursuing them would not be able to stop or break off from their course in time, and the resulting explosion from both fuel and ammunition would consume the base from within.

Rhal's detachment of the Protectors jammed communications and established a heavily armed perimeter around the Temple, utilizing multiple Tra'kad starships, several Canderous-class assault tanks, and numerous other ground vehicles, in addition to QuickStryke assault sleds, and a number of Vyyrhawk fighter-bombers. Rhal publicly demanded the Jedi release Saar and Altamik into Galactic Alliance custody within thirty-six hours, under threat of hostile action should they refuse. When interim Grand Master Kenth Hamner's apprentice, Kani Asari, was sent out to negotiate with Rhal, the man went against every ideal the Mandalorian Protectors had traditionally stood for and shot the unarmed Asari dead on the Temple steps, decreeing that any other Jedi beside Altamik and Saar that came out of the Temple would meet the same fate, and any attempt to recover Asari's body would result in the destruction of the Temple. The siege eventually came to an end after Luke Skywalker, the Jedi Grand Master in exile, put an end to the source of the mysterious psychosis, and both Altamik and Saar were publicly shown to be cured of the disease."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable Mandalorian Protectors"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Spar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commando originally known by the designation Alpha-\u00d82, Spar deserted the clone trooper homeworld of Kamino before the start of the Clone Wars. Unique among his clone brethren due to the genetic memories of Jango Fett he possessed, Spar traveled to Mandalore following the death of Fett at the start of the Clone Wars, where, with the support of clan chieftain Fenn Shysa, he claimed the title of Mand'alor and set out to create a new army of Mandalorian supercommandos. As the newly christened Mandalore the Resurrector, Spar recruited two hundred and twelve Mandalorian soldiers to his army known as the Mandalorian Protectors, and won out over the pacifist New Mandalorian faction, leading the Mandalorians into an alliance with the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under Spar, the Mandalorian Protectors became a devastating force for the Confederacy, often doing in days what their army of droids could not accomplish in months. However, the Protectors eventually fell victim to the machinations of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith manipulating both sides of the war for his own gain. As the secret leader of the Confederacy, Sidious ordered the Mandalorian Protectors to capture Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala at Norval II, while ordering Republic troops to ambush the Protectors there, as the Republic's Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. The Mandalorian Protectors were decimated in the resulting battle, with only Spar and two others\u2014Fenn Shysa and Tobbi Dala\u2014emerging from the conflict with their lives. The shell-shocked Spar abandoned his place as Mand'alor, and refused Shysa's attempts to get him to reclaim the title once they had returned to Mandalore. Spar eventually left to wander the galaxy, finally coming to the Extrictarium Nebula, where, suffering from clone madness, he was shot and killed by the vengeful daughter of Boba Fett, who mistook the clone for her father."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fenn Shysa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fenn Shysa was a Mandalore native, born on a small province off the coast of Mandalore's largest continent. Over time, he grew to become a well-respected clan chieftain and, together with his childhood friend Tobbi Dala, a local constable. Aware of his homeworld's history of being marginalized by the Galactic Republic, and the destitute state that loomed over a number of Mandalorians living on the planet, when Spar called for recruits to his force of Mandalorian Protectors, Shysa more than willingly joined, spurring Spar to become the new Mand'alor and spreading the rumor that the clone deserter was truly Jango Fett's heir. Shysa designed the Protectors' Battle Legionnaire droids in part, and fought alongside them throughout the Clone Wars at New Bornalex, Null, and Kamino, up until the disastrous battle at Norval II, where Shysa was one of only three Mandalorian Protectors to make it out of the fight alive, along with his good friend Tobbi Dala and Spar. Spar abandoned his post as Mand'alor, and though Shysa would attempt to get him to reconsider, it was Shysa himself who succeeded Spar as Mand'alor following the rise of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Empire established a presence on Mandalore, it was Shysa who began to reform the destroyed Mandalorian Protectors, forming them into a guerrilla fighting force to covertly resist the Empire. Under Shysa's leadership, the Protectors harassed convoys of Imperial slavers and freed Mandalorian slaves, until they finally broke the Empire's hold over Mandalore during the battle at the Imperial base in the City of Bone. Shysa then led the Mandalorian Protectors to oust Imperial Grand Admiral Miltin Takel from Mandalorian space, and rebuilt the Protectors into an organization capable of defending the entire Mandalore sector. His ties with the Alliance of Free Planets led Shysa to rally the Protectors to the government's aid during the Nagai\u2013Tof War, and he aided the subsequent New Republic at the Battle of Mindor, against the darksider Shadowspawn. However, Shysa's actions against Kamino during the Clone Wars had far-reaching repercussions, and decades later, the Kaminoan scientist Taun We hired the renowned bounty hunter Boba Fett to kill Shysa. Fett confronted Shysa on the planet Shogun, where the two came under attack by the Sevvets. Shysa was mortally wounded while saving Fett's life, and asked that Fett succeed him as Mand'alor.

Dala fought for the Mandalorian Protectors throughout the Clone Wars, until the battle at Norval II, when he was one of only three Protectors to survive a Republic ambush, along with Shysa and Spar.

Around the same time, the bounty hunter Dengar had attempted to collect an Imperial bounty on Fenn Shysa, only to fail and be captured by Mandalorian Protectors. The Protectors negotiated a prisoner exchange with the Empire, offering Dengar for Dala; this plan was ruined, however, by the arrival of Princess Leia Organa, who sought Dengar for her own purposes. She freed the bounty hunter but was betrayed and taken by the Imperials herself. Shysa mounted a rescue of both Dala and the princess under the cover of a Protector assault on the City of Bone. Shysa succeeded in freeing both Dala and Organa, but Dala was mortally wounded in a confrontation with the Imperial overseer, the Suprema.

Though he set out to follow in his father's footsteps as a bounty hunter, rising to earn a place of both esteem and notoriety as one of the greatest bounty hunters of his era, Fett remained estranged from his Mandalorian heritage for the majority of his life. It was only when Kaminoan scientist Taun We, whom Fett had grown up with on Kamino, offered a bounty on the life of Fenn Shysa for the damage he and the Mandalorian Protectors had wrought on Kamino during the Clone Wars, that Fett was brought back into contact with the Mandalorian culture. Fett hunted Shysa to the planet Shogun, where they were both attacked by the Sevvets and Shysa was mortally wounded while saving Fett's life. As he was dying, Shysa asked that Fett become the next Mand'alor after he was gone, believing in the symbolic strength of the Fett name. Fett gave Shysa his word, before mercifully killing him so as to spare him from suffering under the Sevvets. True to his word, Fett became the new Mand'alor, leading the Mandalorians during the Yuuzhan Vong War and bringing the Mandalorian Protectors to bear against the extra-galactic invaders in defense of the galaxy. Together with the Protectors, Fett fought off the Yuuzhan Vong's attack against Mandalore, and engaged them at worlds such as Gyndine, Tholatin, and Caluula. After the war came to an end and the Yuuzhan Vong settled peacefully on the living planet Zonama Sekot, Fett made a priority of helping Mandalore rebuild. With a third of the planet's population killed in the battle with the Yuuzhan Vong, Fett called for two million Mandalorians throughout the galaxy to journey to Mandalore in order to reinvigorate the planet's infrastructure.
