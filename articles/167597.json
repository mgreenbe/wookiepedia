It was one of three systems where the Givin cryptographer Drusil Bephorin predicted through analysis that the Alliance to Restore the Republic's fleet might be hiding following the Battle of Yavin, the others being the Pantora system and the Kowak system. She kept this information to herself while in the custody of the Galactic Empire, but revealed her guesses to the Rebel agent Luke Skywalker once he freed her from the Imperials. At the time of her guess, the fleet was located in the Pantoran system, not the Zaddja system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zaddja system first appeared in the Star Wars Legends Crimson Empire comic book series written by Randy Stradley and Mike Richardson and released between 1997 and 1998.
