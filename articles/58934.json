Like other swoop models, it was little more than an engine with seats. The Halberd-441 was manned by a single pilot and featured a sidecar for a passenger. It was notably used by Tayshin Maxa and Baroosh Pawk, members of the Cloud-Rider gang led by Enfys Nest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 10 BBY, Pawk and Maxa traveled aboard a Halberd-441 swoop bike with the other Cloud-Riders to the icy world of Vandor in order to attempt to steal a shipment of the hyperfuel coaxium from the Galactic Empire with the intention of using it to fund resistance against the Empire and the Five syndicates. The gang descended upon the 20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport ICC-5537, which was carrying the coaxium across the Iridium Mountains to Crispin Imperial Depository; however, they discovered that they were beaten to their target by a group of criminals led by Tobias Beckett and working for Crimson Dawn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two groups exchanged fire, while Nest dismounted onto the train. Maxa approached the Y-45 armored transport hauler piloted by Rio Durant with her swoop bike. She drew her swoop close enough to their adversary's starship to allow Pawk to leap aboard. After her partner dismounted, Maxa rejoined the other Cloud-Riders in assaulting the conveyed train and helped fire grappling hooks onto the transport car carrying the coaxium. The opposing gang of criminals then lifted the car with the Y-45 armored transport hauler, and it hung between the two groups as they attempted to escape. When the groups drew close to a mountain, the new pilot of the hauler, Han Solo, lost his nerve and released the car, forcing the Cloud-Riders to do the same and leaving the prize to tumble into the mountainside. To escape the ensuing explosion, the Cloud-Riders were then forced to withdraw from the planet empty-handed. Maxa fled Vandor aboard the Halberd-441 without Pawk, who perished in the skirmish."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Halberd-441 swoop bike first appeared in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story and was first identified as the Caelli-Merced Halberd-441 in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide.
