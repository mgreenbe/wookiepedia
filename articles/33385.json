The oldest and wisest of the Nightsisters, her knowledge of arcane magicks was unprecedented, lending her the reputation of being the most powerful member of her clan. The clan's leader, Mother Talzin, regarded Daka so in particular. One such ability was resurrecting the dead. The skill was notably used during the Battle of Dathomir, where the sisters stood against the vengeful Count Dooku's Confederacy of Independent Systems. The sisterhood's victory was not to be, however, as Daka was stabbed by one of Supreme Commander of the Droid Army General Grievous' lightsabers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Dathomir"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, in retaliation of Asajj Ventress' betrayal and plots against him, the Confederacy of Independent Systems leader Count Dooku dispatched the Kaleesh warlord General Grievous and the Separatist Droid Army to completely wipe out the Nightsisters so they could prove no further threat. When Seperatist forces landed and the battle began, Ventress declared to Talzin that the Nightsisters fighting at the frontier would need reinforcements to survive the onslaught brought on by the droid forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Listening to Ventress, Talzin journeyed to the Hidden Cave, a hidden room in the Nightsister lair which could be accessed through the use of magick. Talzin came before Old Daka who agreed to use a spell to unleash the undead Nightsisters to help fight the droids. Daka began to enchant and recite a spell which would raise the undead. When the undead army awoke and crawled out of their burial pods, they aided the living Nightsisters in fighting the droids. However, despite the support from the zombies, the Nightsisters were outmatched by the droid army, which pushed forward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku sent Grievous directly to Talzin in order to kill her before she could complete the spell to take the Count's life. Following the source of the magick, Grievous made his way through the fortress, and had a BX-series droid commando blast through the walls of the Hidden Cave, giving him easy access. Daka was helpless to stop the General, who roughly grabbed her and drove one of his lightsabers into her chest, grievously injuring the eldest of the witches of Dathomir, and flinging her aside. With Daka's spell broken, the undead army fell to ruin, leading to the swift extermination of the rest of the Nightsisters by overwhelming droid forces."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Death and legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the battle ended, Falta, a witch of no clan, arrived to search for her daughter Yenna.
