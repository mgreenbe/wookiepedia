The weapons were snub-nosed in appearance and emitted blue-colored energy bolts when fired, which could inflict intense pain onto any individual they struck. In 17 ABY, Nadreeson's lieutenant Iisner and four other Glottalphibs discharged swamp stunners on Skip 5 while attempting to capture the former smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
