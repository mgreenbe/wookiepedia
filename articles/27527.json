Clat used his talents as an empath to shatter the souls of Vader's stormtrooper guards, and easily gained entrance to the hive-palace where Vader was pitting his wits against Lady Dhol in a game of Firepath. Clat confronted Vader in the gameroom, and attempted to pry inside Vader's mind. However, so focused was he on eliminating Vader, Clat did not realize he had wandered onto the gameboard. With typical coldness, Vader activated a tile on the board, engulfing Clat the Shamer in a pillar of flame. Vader then revealed he knew of Dhol's implication in the plot, and destroyed her before leaving the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
