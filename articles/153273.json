After Gideon's ground forces, hunting the Force-sensitive infant Grogu, the light cruiser fired on the Razor Crest, obliterating the starship.

Sometime, an Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle designated Shuttle 2743 arrived out of hyperspace near Gideon's cruiser, pursued by the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Slave I.
