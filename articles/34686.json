The Sith Lord Darth Maul established his Party Town next to Queen Amidala's Royal Starship. When Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn arrived, he was distracted by the scene, as his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi was lounging, the young boy Anakin Skywalker was playing in the sand, and the Queen was playing a game. The droid C-3PO served drinks for everyone. Maul himself was using his lightsaber as a limbo bar for Captain Quarsh Panaka. After Jinn arrived, Maul launched into a duel with the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Maul's Party Town appears in the 2012 young readers book, LEGO Star Wars: Darth Maul's Mission, a humorous re-telling of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
