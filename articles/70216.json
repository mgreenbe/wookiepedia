Although they were free to choose their clothing from the time they became Padawans, most Jedi adopted the garments traditionally associated with the order, with notable exceptions like Aayla Secura and Ahsoka Tano. During the final years of the Galactic Republic, Anakin Skywalker wore darker garments than his fellow Jedi, a choice that drew concern from the Jedi Masters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Jedi had no set uniforms, their clothes tended to follow a pattern, consisting of an undertunic, an overtunic, an outer robe with a deep hood and wide sleeves, loose-fitting trousers, a tabard, a broad sash tied about the waist, and tall boots. Those pieces of clothing and footwear generally varied in light earth tones, though several Jedi were known for wearing darker versions. In the eyes of some, like the Kalleran scoundrel Janus Kasmir, Jedi robes made their wearers look similar to monks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having adopted a simple yet strict life style, most Jedi chose to wore robes in a traditional earth-tone. The clothes were warm and comfortable, and allowed for greater freedom of movement. The Order also permitted members to wear robes from their homeworld, such as the hybrid Mirialan-Padawan oufit worn by the Jedi Barriss Offee."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the time they were Padawans, members of the Jedi Order were free to choose their clothing.

Her fellow Twi'lek Finn Ertay, however, wore a long-sleeved, high-necked full-length dress that began to flare below the waist. Ahsoka Tano, the Togruta Padawan of Anakin Skywalker, dressed similarly to Secura during her early years, but eventually adopted an outfit which covered more of her skin, while still allowing great freedom of movement. The Kiffar Quinlan Vos favored sleeveless tunics, and sometimes donned a black leather outfit. Being a hair-covered Wookiee, the Padawan Gungi wore nothing but a sash, a belt, and a bandolier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi garments first appeared in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, though they were not revealed to be the general wear of the Jedi until Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
