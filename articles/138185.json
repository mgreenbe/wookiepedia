The two siblings were associates of the Nautolan hunter Nakano Lash, accompanying her to discuss business with the Abednedo technician Jhorstek at some point after 10 BBY. As they talked in Phelar Port on the planet Eriadu, the criminals noticed a young thief plead for help as he was apprehended by stormtroopers. Although Lash wanted to help the child, Jhorstek cautioned against it, not wanting to be arrested. When T'onga asked her brother if they should help the boy, he sided with the Abednedo. The group looked on as the ex-Imperial soldier Beilert Valance rose up to attack the troopers. Lash then came to Valance's aid, helping the cyborg when he was shot down."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Avenging her brother"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point later, T'ongor was killed after a botched mission on the planet Corellia.
