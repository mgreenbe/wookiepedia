During the Clone Wars, she served the Galactic Republic in the rank of Jedi General of the Grand Army. She often fought alongside her twin sister, Tiplar. Throughout the war, she was sent with her sister and the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to the planet Ringo Vinda, where Tiplar was shot by Tup in a battle between her troops and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Skywalker and Tiplee then tried to find out the cause of the clone's misconduct. Some time later Tiplee traveled with three other Jedi to the planet Ord Mantell, where they searched for clues to the whereabouts of Darth Maul. She then led the search for Maul, along with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, to a Mandalorian outpost where they found the Zabrak. Darth Maul received support from Count Dooku and involved the Jedi in a fight in which Tiplee was killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A red-skinned female of a humanoid species, Tiplee lived during the Rise of the Empire era.

After retreating back to base, Tiplee knelt by Tiplar's body, mourning her sister. While Skywalker interrogated Tup, Tiplee came to observe, standing in the doorway. Tup noticed her watching him and tried to attack her despite being restrained in binders. She quickly stopped him in his tracks by using the Force to lift him up and held him against the wall until he calmed down. She initially showed anger towards him, as he had killed her sister, but at a nod from Skywalker, she controlled herself and let him down.
