He was forced to work in the spice mines of Kessel until he and his fellow Wookiee slaves were rescued by a small band of rebels led by the Jedi Kanan Jarrus. Kitwarr was chased by a stormtrooper, but Ezra Bridger, a Force-sensitive human, came to his aid. The two were cornered on a catwalk by Agent Kallus, but they were able to escape soon afterwards aboard the Ghost. Kitwarr was able to reunite with his father; they and the other liberated Wookiees were picked up by an Auzituck anti-slaver gunship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
