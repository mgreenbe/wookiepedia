In 4 BBY, upon his arrival on the planet of Lothal, the man obtained information on a Jedi being present there at that time. In the wake of a new way to earn money, he undertook to collect a bounty on the user of the Force. However, when drinking in a the bar, the Duros was approached by Fissol and Gowski, two other bounty hunters. Curious about the Jedi, the men inquired about any information their speaker could be possessed of. While initially wishing to capture the Jedi by himself, the Duros bounty hunter eventually relented and revealed his information to Fissol and Gowski. After the pair had left, the Duros covered his head with a bandage. Some time later Fissol and Gowski returned to the bar after encountering the Jedi and being told to find the Duros and exact vengeance upon him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
