He also indicated that there were very few copies of the footage in circulation; the Hutts had suppressed it, not wanting proof of their own vulnerability to be passed around. Di told Organa that she would always have allies among the Niktos. He then tried to leverage her reputation for this lawless act to forge an alliance with her, proposing that she turn a blind eye to his cartel's spicerunning and other underworld dealings.

She used the tracker to narrow down his location on Sibensko and discovered an underwater complex used by his cartel. By then, Di had discovered the tracker and confronted her; once more, he replayed the recording.

Marquand hated the costumes created by John Mollo for Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, particularly Leia's Cloud City attire, and thought they did not show how sexy he considered her to be. Fisher felt differently about her prior costumes; though she was critical of the use of gaffer's tape instead of an actual bra under her primary dress in Star Wars: Episode V A New Hope, she considered her Hoth snow suit in The Empire Strikes Back one of her favorites and later joked that it had a \"gas station attendant\" look she enjoyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Return of the Jedi screenplay cowriter Lawrence Kasdan and co-producer Howard G. Kazanjian had a story conference with Marquand and Lucas from July 13 to July 17, 1981.

After Marquand said it would be nice to add a chain, Kasdan asked how they felt about Leia being the one to kill Jabba, and Marquand and Lucas both suggested that she use the chain to strangle the Hutt.

Aggie Guerard Rodgers, who had previously worked with Lucas on American Graffiti and More American Graffiti, was hired in fall 1981. Prior to Rodgers joining the team, Rodis-Jamero met with jeweler and sculptor Richard Miller, a friend of Industrial Light & Magic modeler Lorne Peterson who had created bronze sculptures in a style similar to Rodis-Jamero's concepts. Miller created three-dimensional representations and would later sculpt the faux metal components of the costume as the film's credited jeweler. In a costume featurette for Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Miller recalled Lucas telling him the purpose of the costume's skimpiness was to show that Leia had grown up.

In Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays, Rodis-Jamero said that Lucas always talked about a slave-girl outfit, but Rodis-Jamero struggled and kept coming up with clunky concepts reminiscent of Ben-Hur. Rodgers cited the paintings of Frank Frazetta, one of Lucas's favorite artists, as an inspiration for her.

Star Wars Costumes: The Original Trilogy states that she did not hesitate; Fisher's accounts differ. About two months before filming began, Lucas invited Fisher to San Francisco to show her a picture of the costume. She later described herself as \"aghast,\" thinking at first that he was kidding, and she was very nervous about it. For A New Hope, she had been required to lose weight, while for The Empire Strikes Back, she was told to gain. Fisher believed Lucas had shown her the picture to successfully frighten her into exercising, and she grew preoccupied with how she would look in the costume."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Instead of making a full-body or torso cast of Fisher, which Miller described as an extremely uncomfortable process that required getting naked and having plaster thrown on one's body, he utilized a wax casting technique used in bronze sculpting. The costume components were first sculpted in soft wax around bendable armature wire, then the wax was placed in an ice chest and transported from Miller's home studio to Lucas's Park Way house for Fisher's initial fitting. By wearing the cold wax against her bare skin, her body heat warmed and softened the wax so it could be shaped to fit her. Fisher's friend and fellow actress Penny Marshall accompanied her for the fitting with Rodis-Jamero. Miller then used the wax to mold and cast the structural components of the costume in a dense urethane."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The finished costume was made of silk, painted resin, leather, and rubber. Miller used gold-painted red or orange dense urethane rubber for the structural components of Fisher's costume, and a more flexible latex rubber for Eddon's stunt version. Leather lining was added to the backs of the structural pieces to improve its wearability, and fabric elements were added at ILM's San Rafael costume shop. One of Miller's students made the earrings, and boot maker John Shrader made the suede boots to which Miller added sculptural filigree. The faux metal elements were touched up during filming with Treasure Gold polish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fisher arrived in England shortly after New Year's Day in 1982 for makeup and costume fittings prior to the beginning of filming at Elstree Studios. Due to Fisher's weight loss, the costume did not have the intended snug fit. Miller made a replacement to send to England, but he was never fully satisfied with its appearance in the film. Part of the fit problem was due to Miller designing it to have the bra's support cords crossed in front, but the on-set dressers instead crossed them in the back, telling Miller that it had looked too confining."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Production"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Filming"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though not made of genuine metal, the costume still had little flexibility on Fisher and did not move with her body. Surrounded by a predominantly male cast and crew, she was initially embarrassed before eventually finding that \"dignity was out of the question.\" She later said that a prop man would check after shots to see if the top had slipped, then she began checking herself between takes and would be asked about her breasts before they resumed. \"It was a problem keeping it in place,\" Fisher told Bantha Tracks. \"It drove the wardrobe person nuts.\" She later made light of it: \"It was like steel, not steel, but hard plastic, and if you stood behind me you could see straight to Florida. You'll have to ask Boba Fett about that.\" Uncredited wardrobe assistant Janet Lucas-Wakely, who dressed Fisher throughout filming, said Fisher was happy in her princess dress and fighting gear, but hated the dancing costume and was uncomfortable in it.

The only way they could justify that, I told them, was if Jabba pulled my chains real tight so I couldn't speak. I couldn't see my character not talking. According to Marquand, Fisher loved Jabba during filming and would tell the crew operating the puppet's hand to pull the chain more taut so she would know how Leia felt. Frustrated that Leia had changed from defiant to silent in the costume, Fisher said that she decided to become a writer while shooting the palace scenes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to her weight loss, Fisher was required to sit up straight in front of Jabba so she would not have lines or wrinkles around her waist from bending or moving.

Sano was not given any particular art direction at first, and his original sketches were largely accepted by Lucasfilm with few changes. The only specific request officials made to Sano was to replace an existing image of Leia Organa with one of the princess wearing her slave costume.
