The species' lives revolved around water, but they did not need it to thrive and could settle far from it. Their scaly skin ranged in color from white and red to green. Because of their high intelligence, all Bivalls made good physicians, political advisors, researchers, and scientists. Sionver Boll and Okalin were members of this species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
