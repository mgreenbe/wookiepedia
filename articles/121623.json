Heading upstairs, he surprised Racto, who presumed he would have been defeated. Playing his one last card, Racto sealed himself in a blast-proof room and unleashed a squad of his assassin droids. When all was quiet, Racto unsealed himself, thinking that Korr was dead. Korr, standing behind Racto, ignited his lightsaber in front of Racto's throat. Racto meekly surrendered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Racto in custody, having confessed the location of his factory on Nar Shaddaa, the New Republic was able to quickly shut it down (Korr would later encounter some of the droids on Vjun). For the New Jedi Order, it meant one more supporter and financial backer of the Disciples of Ragnos was neutralized. In Racto's office were a number of artifacts, including a bust of Marka Ragnos which the Jedi Order confiscated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
