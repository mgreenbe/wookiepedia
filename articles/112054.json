In that year, he took the Mynock to the planet Utapau in order to assassinate the Sith scientist Vul Isen, who intended to poison the world's waters in retaliation for Utapau's harboring of Galactic Alliance Remnant Admiral Gar Stazi, an enemy of the Sith. When the Mynock made planetfall and was welcomed by Alliance representatives, the ship's co-pilot Jariah Syn, mechanic Deliah Blue, and astromech droid R2-D2 informed Alliance Lieutenant Ona Antilles that they were interested in selling or trading their Rawk V99 blasters to Stazi. Although Antilles wished to speak to Skywalker himself, the crew's distraction allowed Skywalker and the Jedi Master Wolf Sazen to slip away and hunt for Isen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A holographic symbol of Rawk's logo displayed by R2-D2 convinced Antilles of the weapons' legitimacy and worth, and she spoke with the three crewmembers until Skywalker contacted Syn and informed him that Isen had sent an assassin after Stazi. At that point, Syn demanded that the Mynock's crew be able to negotiate the blasters' prices with the Admiral himself. Antilles acquiesced, and, in Stazi's company, Syn surveyed the Admiral's entourage for would-be-traitors while Blue and R2-D2 bought Syn time by dragging out the bargaining. After Syn caught and killed the assassin and Skywalker elsewhere slew Isen, Blue and Stazi continued to haggle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rawk V99 blaster is mentioned in the forty-ninth issue of the comic series Star Wars: Legacy, in which negotiations over its black market price occur.
