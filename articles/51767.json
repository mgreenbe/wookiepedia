It was the site of the Battle of Gaftikar, which started with attacking the capital city of Eyat.

Neither species was native to the planet, but rather, the Marits had been hired by the Humans to create their cities for them, due to the Marits' high reputation of being skilled mathematicians and natural engineers. After completing construction, however, the Marits were exiled into the forests by the Humans, with almost no contact between the two species. The Humans had great fear of the Marits, especially since the former species was greatly outnumbered, afraid that they would someday rise up and take control of the planet. In truth, the Marits only wanted proportional representation in the government and equal rights."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
