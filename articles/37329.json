Located on the city's northern edge, the Desert Survey Office was established to map the desert terrain of the planet Tatooine, as well as to locate the various hidden \"treasures\" that could be found beneath the shifting sands. The office was usually filled with old-timers who had been on Tatooine their entire lives, and who enjoyed placing false \"hidden treasure\" locations on the maps in order to fool tourists. True scouts and explorers almost never entered the office, knowing full well that nothing of any real value was to be found in the desert."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
