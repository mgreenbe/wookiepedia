Mitth'raw'nuruodo utilized modulated laserfire on several occasions to discreetly transmit messages during his service to the Chiss Ascendancy. During a battle between Garwian Unity forces and pirates of the Lioaoin Regime at Stivic, Thrawn used modulated laserfire to inform Security Officer Frangelic of the Lioaoin weaknesses, allowing the Garwians to defeat the pirates without the Chiss becoming involved. Several years later, Thrawn used modulated laserfire to contact Admiral Ar'alani's Vigilant from a Vak fighter above Primea. Syndic Irizi'stal'mustro, who was aboard the vessel, correctly deduced the purpose of the laserfire and Thrawn's presence aboard the starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
