The sliders were served with Tapani triangles at the eatery known as Dex's Diner on the planet Coruscant at some point before its destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's rule. The Besalisk chef and owner of the diner, Dexter Jettster, created the slider\u2014which he considered delicious\u2014based on inspiration from the planet Giju, homeworld of the Herglic species and charged 7.7 credits for it. In addition to deep fried Tapani triangles, the slider also featured mega-leaf lettuce, algae-bread, two Mongo Beefhead patties, plankton spread, a triple serving of cheese, Boontaspiced mustard, and larded neutrino all on a trans-shipped medium-density foodboard with a green jumbolive on top. The Tapani sector was the sector of the Colonies in which Giju was located."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tapani triangles was first mentioned in the 2009 StarWars.com Hyperspace exclusive article, \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written by Gregory Walker as an in-universe menu for Dex's Diner.
