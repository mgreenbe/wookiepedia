The piece was included on the original release of the Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace soundtrack as track seventeen, which is titled \"Augie's Great Municipal Band and End Credits,\" and in the thirty-first track of the Ultimate Edition soundtrack, which is titled \"The Parade.\" It was composed by John Williams, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and the New London Children's Choir and recorded in England. Synthesizers were used for most of the recording. The vocals and brass were live, though certain brass phrases were performed at half-tempo and sped up in order to reach notes an octave out of a trumpet's range. It was written in the key of A, is polyphonic, has a tempo of 124 bpm, and has a duple meter with a time signature of 4/4. A Databank entry about Jowil was also written by Hyperspace member Chad Finke through the What's The Story? feature on StarWars.com, detailing much about the piece and its origins and naming the in-universe piece for the first time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was originally rumored that the track \"Augie's Great Municipal Band\" was an intentional reworking of \"The Emperor's Theme,\" having been sped up and switched to a major key in order to evoke a happy emotion rather than a sinister one. Ken Wannberg, music editor for The Phantom Menace, stated in a Soundtrackmag.com interview that the correlation was in no way intentional, and he went on to say the two pieces didn't even sound alike. This, however, was conflicted in the Star Wars Insider 109 article \"Menace Revisited,\" where it was stated that \"Augie's Great Municipal Band\" was intentionally reworked from \"The Emperor's Theme\" to symbolize Palpatine's first step to galactic dominion. This position was later backed by former LucasArts lead sound designer David W. Collins and author Timothy Zahn in Star Wars Insider 147."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game contains the victory parade scene at the end of the last mission, but it utilizes the track \"Hail to the Winner, Anakin Skywalker\" instead of \"Augie's Great Municipal Band.\" The piece was also used during the credits for the first two installments of the 2001 mockumentary R2-D2: Beneath the Dome, which began airing following that year's Thanksgiving showing of The Phantom Menace on FOX."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
