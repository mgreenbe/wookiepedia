Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker were sent to speak with the Pykes after new evidence revealed that deceased Jedi Sifo-Dyas and an advisor named Silman had gone to Oba Diah to negotiate with the Pykes. Upon arrival, Kenobi and Skywalker found evidence that the two had been there, getting Lom Pyke to bring them to Silman in exchange for amnesty concerning the Pykes' betrayal of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Count Dooku arrived on the planet not long after, looking to cover up loose ends to the conspiracy surrounding Sifo-Dias. Dooku killed Silman and confronted the two Jedi. The three dueled onto a landing platform where they were met by Lom and his forces to provide the Jedi with assistance. Dooku managed to slay Lom and jump onto a cargo freighter, where he called for his ship to pick him up. Anakin Skywalker went after him, but Dooku managed to defeat Skywalker and escape via his ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
