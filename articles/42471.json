It was well-known throughout the galaxy as a ship associated with the Exchange, and it passed through many hands before it was commandeered by amnesiac Dark Lord of the Sith, Revan, who was escaping the Destruction of Taris. After Revan joined the Jedi Order, the ship was instrumental in his search for the Star Forge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Revan traveled to the Unknown Regions to destroy the remains of a Sith Empire that had lain dormant there, the Hawk eventually fell into the hands of the Jedi Exile Meetra Surik, who used it on her quest to stop the Sith Triumvirate. The ship was heavily modified over the course of its life, to the point that it was difficult to determine its origins. With its extremely powerful hyperdrive, the ship was believed to be in the top ten of the fastest ships in the galaxy during its time, as it was the fastest ship in the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ebon Hawk was a Dynamic-class freighter, roughly resembled Aurebesh sigil  minus the inward curves at the ends of the outer prongs, with the center prong flush with them, and with a concave curve to the vertical line. Visualizing the open side as the bow, the Hawk's mass filled out the stern to the shape's midpoint and left only a small prong on the starboard side. The starboard mass contained a deployable turret that would extend from the ship's ventral side, and on the port and starboard sides were two more turret emplacements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was painted primarily white with the three prongs accented in red on the bow, as well as the dorsal and ventral sides. Towards the stern, on both the latter two sides, there were concave red stripes that curved parallel to the ship's stern from the center prong to the outer two, originating from the outward sides of two cylindrical engines, which met the center prong at its base and extended outward to port and starboard. This formed a symmetrical acute angle across the dorsal side on the longitudinal axis, with legs that met the rear curve. All along the outward-facing sides of these engines was another red stripe."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Interior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The interior of the ship was designed to accommodate a small crew, a good amount of cargo, and a small vehicle such as a swoop bike. There were two sets of crew quarters (starboard and port), each with three standard beds. The starboard dormitory had a secret compartment underneath one of the bunks, which Ratrin Vhek told Surik about in order to prove his prior ownership of the Hawk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cockpit had seats for a pilot, copilot and navigator, with two additional seats behind them. Also in the cockpit area was the galaxy map, where the next destination could be selected. The galaxy map offered a summary of the destination's terrain, native species, and docking facilities. This room was connected to the main hold by a long hallway, which also led to the communications room. In the communications room were a number of controls, including a console for accessing the ship's security cameras."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the center of the main hold was a large round console that included the ship's navigation computer, which could be voice-locked. The console further served as a holoprojector, both for communication and for tactical planning. The ship's security cameras were also accessible from here, as well as the security doors. There was plenty of seating in the main hold, and it was large enough for the entire crew to comfortably gather together. Off to one side was a small storage room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the main hold, another hallway led to the engine room at the back of the vessel, where the engines and the hyperdrive were accessible. There was usually something in this room that needed repair, particularly the temperamental hyperdrive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Off the hallway between the main hold and the engine room was the medical bay. There was no kolto tank and only one bed, but it was sufficient for treating all but the most serious conditions. Across the hall from the medical bay was the utility lift, which provided access to the controls for the three turrets and to the Ebon Hawk's outer hull."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cargo hold was spacious and included a code-locked smuggling compartment. Kang used this compartment for smuggling spice, using the code \"Red-47.\" On the other side of the ship was the garage, which was similar in size and shape to the cargo hold, but more easily accessible as it was connected to the exit ramp. It was designed to fit a small vehicle, and Kang kept a Lhosan Industries Daggerstar here, which Revan acquired along with the ship. There was also a workbench in the garage. The garage was blown open when the Harbinger fired on it and was under repair for the remainder of Surik's journey. The swoop bike was also gone by the time she acquired the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other facets of the Ebon Hawk's design included its twin turbolaser turrets (dorsal and ventral), as well as two heavy laser cannons on each side and other hidden armaments. The navigational computers were stolen retrofits. Its hyperdrive was a Class 1 unit, replacing the original Class 3, and the realspace speed was double the baseline for the class.

It was piloted by a man named Hudrow until he angered Davik by stealing a spice from the lab at the estate, after which he was imprisoned in Davik's prison. At this time, the Sith had quarantined the planet as they searched for Bastila Shan, and no ships were allowed to leave. The Ebon Hawk was believed to be the only ship capable of breaking through the blockade, and Davik hoped to do just that\u2014as soon as he could get his hands on the Sith access codes.

As it turned out, Canderous had ulterior motives. He was dissatisfied with mercenary work, and proposed a deal to Revan; if Revan could get the access codes, Canderous would help him steal Davik's flagship and escape Taris. Revan succeeded in obtaining the codes, with the help of the droid T3-M4, who had been made especially for the job, but, once inside Davik's estate, the group discovered just how difficult stealing the Ebon Hawk would be. The hangar security system was state-of-the-art, and they would need the security codes in order to have any chance of escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While exploring the estate, Revan stumbled upon Hudrow, Davik's incarcerated former pilot. Hudrow told Revan that he knew the security codes for the Ebon Hawk and offered them to Revan in exchange for his freedom. Revan released the man and used the codes to disable the security system. The party headed for the hangar bay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were stopped by Davik and his associate, the bounty hunter Calo Nord. Revan and his companions were forced to fight the pair of them, and Davik was killed. Calo Nord pulled out a thermal detonator and threatened to take the whole hangar down with him, but the Sith had begun their bombardment, and the roof collapsed on top of him.

The gizka escaped and, before the crew could figure out what to do with them, they had virtually taken over the ship. Revan later met a Selkath on Manaan who was an exotic animal collector and donated the gizka to his zoo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, on Korriban, Revan met a Rodian named Lurze Kesh. He had been expecting a shipment of spice from Davik and gave Revan the code to the locked compartment in the cargo bay so that he could retrieve it. After taking the spice off Revan's hands, the Rodian gave him a special box to deliver to Motta the Hutt on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan ran into another small problem after Zaalbar noticed that the stock of food was getting low. After hearing footsteps in several parts of the ship, Revan finally stumbled upon a stowaway. Sasha ot Sulem was a young girl who had been kidnapped by Mandalorians, and she had escaped them by sneaking aboard the Ebon Hawk while it was docked on Dantooine. Sasha didn't speak Basic, only a jumbled version of Mando'a, which Revan was able to understand after a great deal of effort. Sasha took a liking to Revan and told him that she considered the Ebon Hawk her home. After some persuasion, Revan convinced her to go with Lur Arka Sulas, a Twi'lek who had been searching for her on behalf of her worried parents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the crew was on their way to uncover the fifth and final Star Map, the Leviathan suddenly appeared. The Leviathan was the flagship of Admiral Saul Karath, Carth's old mentor, who had betrayed the Republic to become the right hand man for Darth Malak. The Ebon Hawk was caught in the larger vessel's tractor beam and the crew had only a short time to devise a plan for escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once freed from their cells on the Leviathan, the crew split up. While Revan, Bastila, and Carth headed to the bridge to disable the tractor beam, Canderous led the rest of the group back to the Ebon Hawk to prepare for launch. After a confrontation in which Revan learned of his true identity, Bastila remained behind to fight Malak while Revan and Carth escaped to the Hawk. With the tractor beam disabled, the ship was able to escape the Leviathan and continue on its mission, one crew member short."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after this, Revan was approached by Ziagrom, a Twi'lek who had done business with previous owners of the Ebon Hawk. Ziagrom told Revan that he had heard reports of the Ebon Hawk traveling all over the galaxy, and at the ship's last port he had placed a tracking device on it. Once aware of the ship's activities aboard the Leviathan, Ziagrom had used sources within the Sith fleet to uncover Revan's identity. Despite holding this valuable knowledge, Ziagrom wanted nothing more than to offer Revan access to his partner's premium wares."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the last Star Map, Revan's crew finally learned the location of the Star Forge. They set out for an uncharted planet in the Unknown Regions. As they emerged from hyperspace, a powerful disruptor field around the planet forced them to crash-land on the surface. The disruptor field had fried the stabilizers and damaged the hyperdrive. Replacement parts would need to be located before the ship could go anywhere. The disruptor field would also have to be disabled, or they would simply crash again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luckily, the Ebon Hawk wasn't the only victim of the planet's disruptor field. The surface was littered with wreckage, and Revan found suitable parts in short order. The real problem was the disruptor field. While Carth repaired the ship, Revan, Juhani, and Jolee Bindo made their way through the Temple of the Ancients, from which the disruptor field was controlled. After a confrontation with Bastila, who had fallen to the dark side, they shut down the disruptor field and rejoined the others at the Ebon Hawk. There the crew was contacted by Admiral Forn Dodonna of the Republic fleet, which had just arrived and begun its attack on the Star Forge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Bastila using her battle meditation against them, the chances of a Republic victory were slim. Thus, rather than joining the space battle, the crew fought through the Star Forge's defenses and landed the Ebon Hawk in the factory itself, where they set off to confront Bastila and Malak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Revan had redeemed Bastila and defeated Malak, there was nothing to prevent the Republic fleet from destroying the Sith factory.

When more of his memories of his days as a Sith Lord returned, Revan took the Ebon Hawk to the Unknown Regions with Canderous Ordo in search of Mandalore's Mask on Rekkiad. During the descent into the atmosphere, the Hawk was subjected to high winds, suffering damage to the landing gear when the ship scraped against a glacier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Canderous and Revan searched the planet for the Mask, T3-M4 repaired the ship. This journey, though resulting in Canderous' departure from Revan's group, did not mean Canderous wouldn't board the Hawk again. Revan then took the Ebon Hawk to Nathema. On Nathema, Darth Nyriss and Lord Scourge, who were on the planet at the time, assumed the ship was hostile and shot the Ebon Hawk down.

A simple calculation of the number of deck squares shows a Dynamic-class freighter to be 25.5 meters long, reasonably close to the Databank figure. Likewise, the Starships of the Galaxy deck plan shows the freighter to be roughly 22.5 meters wide. While this width figure seems to be incongruent with the Databank length figure, this article still asserts that this is roughly the size of the Ebon Hawk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
