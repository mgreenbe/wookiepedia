A squat and sad-eyed individual, he was one of the first cadets that Zare Leonis, who was secretly infiltrating the academy in the hope of rescuing his sister, met upon arrival. The two later participated in an exercise on the high-gravity planet of Sirpar. Leonis served as the leader of the Cresh-3 Platoon, with Cerroux as his sergeant major. During the exercise, Cerroux questioned Leonis's judgment in choosing to abandon a particular position that they had been told to hold, but Leonis overruled him, as movement was their only chance to meet the objectives for the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
