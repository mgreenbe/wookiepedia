As the Vestor Pulsar made this whole area a hyperspace \"dead zone\", travelling was rather difficult. The system could usually be reached with two- or three-leg jumps. From the Perlemian Trade Route, Goroth could be reach with a three-leg route within twelve days or with a faster, more dangerous two-leg jump within ten days. The closest system was the Baylin Cluster, 14 hours away, while the sector capital, Milarian, was 22 hours away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The system had two suns: Goroth Alpha, a standard, main-sequence red-orange star, most commonly referred to as \"the sun\" or \"K'Len\" by the Gorothites. The second star was Goroth Beta, a brown dwarf at the most outward orbital position. The system had four planets, one of them, Goroth Prime having spawned sentient life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Orbital bodies"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Oris"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The closest of the planets to Goroth Alpha, Oris was nickel-iron-rock asteroid, captured by the sun.

The native Gorothites evolved relatively late and became members of the Old Republic around 7,500 BBY. Goroth was devastated during the Corellian/Aqualish war around 4000 BBY when the Gorothites tried to play both sides against each other. Believed to be a volcanic wasteland for the next few millennia, the world was rediscovered during the reign of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Deneva"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A gas giant with a perihelion orbit of 40.7 light minutes, Deneva had a low density and a small, solid core. The planet was inhabited by non-intelligent gasbag-like creatures which grazed the atmosphere's organic compounds. Deneva had a strong magnetic field that, in conjunction with it's closest moon, formed a dangerous ionic storm."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Denbalen"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The other of the system's gas giants, Denbalen, was similar to Deneva in appearance, but had a higher density and no magnetic fields. It orbited the sun at 67.2 light minutes. Although smaller than its sister world, Denbalen had a larger core, almost the size of Goroth Prime. One of its moons, P'Check contained the ruins of an extinct species."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Goroth Beta"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Goroth Beta was the most outward orbital body and a gas giant that never ignited into a star.
