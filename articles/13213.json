After the Lambda-class shuttles Truncheon and Cudgel were destroyed on Gorse's surface during conflict between the planet's population and the Galactic Empire, Bastinade was sent to the Imperial Spaceport in Gorse's Highground neighborhood to pick up Count Denetrius Vidian and Captain Rae Sloane and return them to the Ultimatum. Like all Lambda-class shuttles, Bastinade was built by Sienar Fleet Systems and equipped with 2 forward double laser cannons, 2 wing-mounted double cannons, 1 rear double laser cannon and a hyperdrive. It measured 20 meters in length, and could carry up to 80 metric tons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bastinade first appeared in the novel A New Dawn, written by John Jackson Miller and published in 2014.
