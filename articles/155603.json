This slaver whipped Obi-Wan with a shock whip for talking, which was prohibited, then started whipping Roshti as a punishment. When Obi-Wan told him that Roshti should not be punished for his own mistakes, a second slaver electrocuted him with a rod to his collar. This slaver then said that he does not take commands from a slave and started to whip the Togruta again until Obi-Wan begged him to stop, calling him his master and asking him for forgiveness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
