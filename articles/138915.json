Around 5 ABY, during the fighting on Troithe between the New Republic and the governing Galactic Empire, Acting Governor Fara Yadeez and Colonel Soran Keize of the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing took regular walks through the plaza and above the Taa Complex. A funeral later took place in the complex for Garmen Naadra, one of the 204th pilots, and Keize told stories of the pilot with her squadron over a fire made from branches from the Taa Complex gardens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Taa Complex appeared in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
