Her son was forced into servitude by Captain Neg, who promised many times to free Tomo, but after forcing the boy to work endlessly for several months, his mother knew that Neg did not truly intend to let him go. She was Force-sensitive, and thus she recognized Qui-Gon Jinn as a Jedi upon seeing him, remarking to Jinn that she felt the Force was strong with him. She asked him to rescue Tomo, and the Jedi Master agreed to help. He was successful in releasing Tomo from captivity, and his mother gratefully rewarded Jinn with a repulse booster when he returned to her with Tomo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tomo's mother was voiced by Mary Kay Bergman."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
