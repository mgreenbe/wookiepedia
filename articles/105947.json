By patching it into the engines and setting the cobulators back a half pitch, the engine would run hot near the transponder director, effectively distorting and masking the ship's transponder. While a ship close by would be able to read the transponder with a little difficult, it was almost impossible to read at a distance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
