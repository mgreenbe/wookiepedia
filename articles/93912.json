While there, Skirata found a seven-year-old boy, Falin Mattran, living on the streets like a wild animal. The boy had attacked Skirata with his dead father's three-sided knife, but Skirata was able to calm Mattran and took the child with him back to the Mandalorians' camp. He would call the boy \"Kal\"\u2014\"knife\" in Mando'a\u2014and, confiding in his comrade Jun Hokan, Munin expressed his pride in the courageous young boy. As he shared a bowl of soup with Mattran in the camp, Skirata told him of his intentions to adopt him and explained the allure of a chance at a new life. Although initially hesitant, Mattran quickly warmed up to Munin when the veteran soldier comforted the traumatized child after he had nightmares about his dead father and destroyed home. Munin would indeed adopt Falin, from then on known as Kal Skirata, as his son and raise him as a Mandalorian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years after Munin had passed away, Kal would pass his armor on to Bardan Jusik, a Jedi Knight who would leave the Jedi Order to become a Mandalorian, and later become Kal's adopted son and Munin's adopted grandson."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
