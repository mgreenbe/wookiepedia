It was known for its low refraction index, which resulted in minimal beam dispersion when the blaster was fired. The beam produced by this blaster pistol inflicted excruciating pain upon beings who had the misfortune of being hit by it. The only known drawback of the Relby-k23 was its faulty safety. The officers of the Bespin Wing Guard were among those known to carry the Relby-k23 blaster pistol while carrying out their duties. However, because of the restrictions placed upon the sale of these blaster pistols, Cloud City's quartermaster was forced to purchase them under-the-table."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Relby-k23 was made from the main housing and pistol grip of a Nemrod brand pneumatic speargun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
