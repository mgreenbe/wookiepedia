During the Battle of Kelrodo-Ai in the Western Reaches Operation of the Reconquest of the Rim, Blade Flight was led by Captain Shea Hublin, and co-winged by Amp and Ahrens by the time of the initial attempt at infiltrating the shaft leading to the Citadel of Axes' shields' hypermatter reactor. Ahrens, however, was killed by an anti-capital ship turret shortly before the failed first attempt. Afterwards, Blade Flight brought in Dagger Flight's leader Starks for the more successful second attempt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
