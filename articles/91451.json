During the operation, the Rebel unit accidentally gave away its position to Imperial forces while its members defended themselves with blasterfire against Onderon's dangerous native wildlife. The Imperials, now aware of the Rebel presence on the planet, responded with heavy artillery and sent a strike force of All Terrain Scout Transports to the intruders' last known position. The recon team's misstep was critical, as it led to the Rebel command's decision to leave the reconnaissance detachment on its own without any further support. Of those in the unit under fire, only a scout named Sasha survived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sasha, the only survivor of her unit, went into hiding in the planet's hinterlands, remaining stranded on Onderon for some time.
