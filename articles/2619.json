He was known as AZI-3 by the ARC trooper \"Fives,\" who felt that numbers were demeaning, and simply as AZ by Omega. In 19 BBY, AZI-3 struck an unlikely friendship with Fives as the two worked together to investigate a supposed \"tumor\" that had caused Fives' fellow soldier Tup to assassinate the Jedi General Tiplar. During the course of their investigation, the two discovered that all clone troopers had been implanted with inhibitor chips for an unknown purpose, which subsequently turned out to be Darth Sidious's planned Great Jedi Purge.  Some time later, he had a friendly relationship with Omega."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "An unlikely friendship"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AZI-3 served in the medical facility at Kamino's Tipoca City. He was present for the arrival of \"Tup,\" a clone trooper who was suffering from a mysterious condition that had caused him to attack and kill the Jedi General Tiplar. AZI-3 was assigned to oversee testing on Fives, who might have been exposed to whatever condition had affected Tup."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fives, wanting to help his friend Tup, convinced AZI-3 that, by not helping the patient, he was doing the opposite of what he was programmed to. After convincing AZI-3 to help him, Fives explained to the droid that no clone went by a number these days and his camaraderie with Tup. AZI-3 suggested that they complete a level 5 atomic brain scan on Tup, but the Kaminoan doctor Nala Se refused on the grounds that a post-mortem dissection would yield the proper results. AZI-3 and Fives were unaware that Nala was trying to conceal the existence of inhibitor chips in all clone troopers, which was central to Darth Sidious' Order 66."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Continuing to work with Fives, AZI-3 performed the procedure, eventually conducting a biopsy based on the readings, and discovered a mysterious \"tumor\" inside Tup. It transpired that the tumor was actually a control chip, and when it was removed, Tup died. Shortly, AZI-3 and Fives were corned by Nala Se and Shaak Ti. Following an argument, Shaak Ti and Nala Se reached an agreement for the \"tumor\" to be transported to the Jedi Temple and then the Grand Republic Medical Facility for further analysis."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Unmasking a conspiracy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his role in helping Fives to defy his superiors' orders, AZI-3 was sent to have his memory wiped in order to purge his knowledge of these chips and their malfunctioning. On the way, AZI-3 casually informed Fives that the clone trooper was to undergo a memory wipe as well and to be reassigned to sanitation duty. Realizing that the Kaminoans were trying to hide a conspiracy, Fives broke free of his captors and fled the medical suite with AZI-3 in tow. The two stole a Kaminoan flight pod from a hangar and fled into the skies above Tipoca City."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fives then informed AZI-3 that his plan was to use the flight pod's autopilot to distract the Kaminoan security forces while he and AZI-3 returned to the clone laboratories to continue their investigation into the \"tumors.\" Fives flung AZI-3 into the sea before jumping in as well. AZI-3 then revealed that he could reconfigure his body into an improvised hover mode. AZI-3 and Fives then re-entered Tipoca City through a service hatch. Under Five's orders, AZI-3 lured another clone trooper into the service area so that Fives could knock him unconscious and steal his armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two then made their way to Kamino's Genetic Records Hall, where AZI-3 compared the tumor's DNA to that of the late Jango Fett, who had been the clone troopers' genetic template. The scan confirmed that the \"tumor\" did not match Fett's genotype and that it was an organic chip that had been implanted into Tup. After Nala Se learned of their presence, AZI-3 and Fives escaped Shaak Ti and several clone troopers through a ceiling hatch. While crawling through the service tunnels, AZI-3 speculated that the chip had an unknown purpose. Fives convinced AZI-3 to operate on him in order to investigate whether he too had the implant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After finding a sterile room, AZI-3 operated on Fives and found a healthy chip inside his head. The two then headed to the embryo room. On the way, they passed through a training room, and AZI-3 tried to distract the Kaminoan instructors by singing. After entering the embryo room, AZI-3 and Fives discovered that all of the clone embryos had been implanted with the chips at the third stage of their development. The two fugitives were soon cornered by Shaak Ti, Nala Se, and several clone troopers. Nala Se wanted to destroy Fives on the grounds that he was an \"aberrant\" clone who was Kaminoan property. However, Shaak Ti insisted that the clones were the property of the Galactic Republic and convinced Nala Se to allow Fives and the chips to be presented to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who was secretly Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AZI-3 expressed jubilation that he had helped Fives prove his case to Nala Se and Shaak Ti. He escorted Fives to a transport that took him to the galactic capital, Coruscant. Despite the efforts of AZI-3 and Fives, Darth Sidious and his Sith apprentice Darth Tyranus successfully conspired to prevent AZI-3 from revealing the existence of the inhibitor chips to the wider public. The concealed clone inhibitor chips would play an important role in advancing Darth Sidious' Great Jedi Purge at the end of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime before the arrival of Clone Force 99 on Kamino, AZI-3 would form a bond with the modified clone Omega who, at the time, worked as a lab assistant for the Kaminoans.

AZI-3 urged against their presence in the barracks, until Omega convinced him they were present for research. After being convinced, AZI-3 began digging through Clone Force 99's belongings to find what they were \"researching,\" at one point being scared by a dismembered B1-series battle droid head. When Omega and AZI-3 attempted to covertly leave the barracks, they were stopped by a shock trooper officer, who attempted to detain Omega. AZI-3 tried to stop the officer, stating that they were official Kaminoan personnel; however, the officer stunned AZI-3 and took Omega to the brig."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, AZI-3 was present while CT-9904 \"Crosshair\" underwent a medical evaluation, overlooking the procedures and seeing that his vitals were all at optimum levels.
