By the year 3.5 ABY, the gang was led by Gizman."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Big Gizz was the leader of Jabba's gang on Tatooine. The Hutt was often later annoyed by the gang riding their speeders inside the corridors of his palace. Spiker was Gizz's right hand man, and they were the only members of the gang to survive the encounter with Jedi Luke Skywalker. After Jabba's death, Gizz and Spiker were reunited, as Gizz was left for dead by Jix, a \"fellow biker\"/Imperial spy, and Spiker was shot in the attempt to retrieve Han Solo's carbonized body from Boba Fett. Having stolen a ship from Jabba's palace following the Rebel operation on Tatooine, Gizz and Spiker were almost killed by a deadly security device Jabba had installed onboard the craft, which turned out to be his personal treasure ship. After they crash-landed the ship, and escaped with their lives, the bikers left to find civilization in the company of Onoh, who had been guarding the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
