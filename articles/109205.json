He was informed that the compound would be able to make the Imperial probe droids far quieter so they weren't as easily detectable due to their loud whine and chatter. He once again contacted the individual who had delivered the comm, and tasked them with intercepting this compound while it was being delivered by Sergeant Montage.

Both he and 'Klee made a plan to stop the project altogether, again requiring the individual's help. Herm informed the individual that he had to meet with the Imperial Officer who was overseeing the project, a Captain Sargon, and get the blueprints for the new probe droids. The individual managed to do this by killing both Sargon and his stormtrooper escort, and gave the documents to Herm, who in turn gave them to the Alliance High Command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately, sometime after this, the Imperials found 'Klee's comlink and, learning of his betrayal, had him arrested and sentenced to death. For the final time, Herm asked for the individual's help in freeing 'Klee from Imperial captivity. He gave the individual 'Klee's last known co-ordinates and asked him to hurry. Fortunately, the individual managed to free 'Klee and brought him back to Herm just in time for Herm to save his life.
