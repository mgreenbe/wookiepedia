He developed a suit of armor created from genetically engineered plant matter and used himself as a test subject for it. The armor began influencing his mind, and he eventually became a vigilante in the Coruscant underworld, believing that the Empire was not doing its job to combat crime.

However, at some point Una attacked and killed three Imperial officers, prompting the Empire to send a squad of stormtroopers into Coruscant's lower levels after him. Only two of them returned from the hunt alive, having failed to capture Una. The Empire proceeded to post a bounty of 7,500 on the vigilante, wanted dead by disintegration.

As a vigilante, he was very dedicated to his cause and thought of himself as a hero fighting evil. The Empire believed him to be a very sick individual with a warped view of the galaxy who was quickly spiraling out of their control. The Empire also considered him armed and dangerous, and advised caution when approaching him. Una had in-depth knowledge of Coruscant's lower levels, having been able to survive living there for a long period of time.

This organic armor had a green-yellow, wooden appearance and a thorny surface designed to fend off physical attacks. It covered Una's entire body and had roots growing out from points along his legs, though the armor still retained a relatively anthropomorphic shape. The armor was asymmetric and had round, shell-like shoulder pads and a trapezoidal helmet. The suit had retractable claws and bladed gauntlets, which complemented the vibroblade Una carried with him. Although the armor was not sentient, long-term exposure to residual plant spores was thought to have affected Una's state of mind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vooz Nooxoo Una was first referenced in the 2001 Star Wars Gamer 6 article Bounties to Die For, written by S.
