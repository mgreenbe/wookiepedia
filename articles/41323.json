Many such weapons were appropriated from their owners by pirates and privateers. The Duelist vibrorapier was notable for its silence, as most vibroblades emitted a sharp, high-pitched whine. The rapier shifted its sound signature into the ultrasonic range, making it inaudible to Humans and most humanoid races."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Instant Adventures the weapon is mistakenly listed as \"SoroSuub LaserHone\" and has a damage stat too low to be a Vibroweapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
