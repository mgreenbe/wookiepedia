After the Galactic Empire's defeat in the Battle of Endor, Imperial forces withdrew from Kaal.

She solicited outside powers to come to Kaal and negotiate for Kaal's aquacultural exports, and received Admiral Kermen, representing the Empire; Utoxx Prentioch, a nearby warlord; Talon Karrde, posing as Syndic Pandis Hart of the Sif-Uwana Council; and a New Republic delegation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Benyalle received the group at her Grand Imperial hotel and casino, hosting a high-stakes sabacc game for the negotiators the night before the talks began. The next morning, she took the parties on a tour of a harvester factory and then began accepting bids aboard her luxury sail barge. Kermen, however, revealed a plan to retake Kaal by force, and he, his stormtrooper bodyguards, and the agents with which he had surreptitiously replaced most of the barge's crew attacked Benyalle. She was defended by Karrde, the New Republic delegation, and loyal crew members, but Kermen had bribed her bodyguard Sendir to betray her. The New Republic agents saved her from Sendir's attack, and escaped with her onto a submersible summoned by Karrde."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karrde explained that he had only been interested in the wreck of Emperor Palpatine's personal yacht, Emperor's Shadow, which he had destroyed to cover their getaway.
