Katarn tracked down the physical map, evading various Imperial troopers and bounty hunters, and learned about 8t88's digital copy of the map. Katarn killed 8t88's guards and cornered the droid, but they were interrupted by Yun, who was sent to destroy the physical map. Yun succeeded in his initial mission, and then dueled Katarn with his own lightsaber while 8t88 made his escape. Katarn bested Yun, but spared the Dark Jedi's life.

Ors brought the disc to New Republic leaders Mon Mothma and Princess Leia Organa and the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. After they viewed the message, Ors explained that Katarn had plans to personally hunt Jerec down in revenge for Morgan's death.

A bridge in the tower had been lowered, however, forcing Katarn to find the two control rooms that could control its movements.

The Jedi introduced Ors and WeeGee to 8t88's cranium, and Ors pushed the ship off. However, their escape was disrupted by the appearance of two TIE/LN starfighters. Katarn suggested they head to the Nefra Canyons to lose them. With fancy flying, the first TIE fighter was unable to imitate Ors' piloting through the rocky cliffs and outcroppings, and crashed into stone. The second pilot proved to be better, and managed to match Ors' flying."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Katarn climbed through a hatch on top of the Crow and used his Bryar pistol to shoot at the fighter. Although the pistol did little to damage the TIE fighter, a bolt scuffed up the cockpit window, forcing the pilot to lean over and lose his concentration.

Back in Morgan's workshop, WeeGee plugged into 8t88's cranium and used its photoreceptors to display the digital map over the room. Upon finding Ruusan's location, Ors and Katarn celebrated by dancing and a kiss, which was inturrupted by the appearance of a ship. Believing it to be Imperial, Katarn rushed to turn off the home's lights, but found that it was a New Republic X-wing fighter.

The experienced Jedi gave Katarn some advice about the latter's continuing journey, and learned that Jerec was already on his way to the Valley of the Jedi. He also revealed that he had known Morgan Katarn, and told them of a prophecy that dealt with the liberation of Jedi spirits trapped in the Valley.

Katarn slew the remaining Dark Jedi, excluding Yun who had actually sacrificed himself to save Katarn from Sariss, and eventually confronted Jerec after the Dark Jedi successfully drew upon the Valley's power. Ors was captured during the operation, but escaped with Katarn's help. Jedi and Dark Jedi clashed in the Valley for a final time, and Jerec was killed.

The first level dealt with Katarn infiltrating his old home; the second level featured Katarn leaving his home through the irrigation systems; the third level introduced Barons Hed; the fourth level featured Katarn's entry into the Dark Palace; the fifth level was the duel with Yun; the sixth level was Katarn's escape from the palace; the seventh level took place in Fuel City; the eighth level was Katarn searching the Sulon Star for 8t88; in the ninth level, Katarn dueled with Gorc and Pic; in the tenth level Katarn escaped from the Sulon Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Rick Barba, author of the game's official strategy guide, the third and fourth levels of the mission (the fifth and sixth levels of the game) were originally designed to be a single mission.

The exceptions are \"Mission 5: The Barons Head: The Fallen City,\" and \"Mission 6: Into the Dark Palace,\" which have no cutscenes set between them. \"Mission 9: Fueling Station,\" was originally designed where Fuel City was actually a spaceport not on Sulon's surface.

Rebel Agent was one of a trilogy of books by Dietz, the others being Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire and Dark Forces: Jedi Knight.

Firstly, in both the game and the novella, Katarn initially goes to Sulon by himself, as it's mentioned in the game that the Moldy Crow needed repairs. However, in the audio drama, Jan Ors scouts out Morgan's homestead with Katarn, and then stays behind when Katarn infiltrates his home alone. Later, when Katarn finds WeeGee, the game depicts Katarn leaving the droid behind. Both the novella and the audio drama depict Katarn bringing WeeGee along through the irrigation system. In all sources, after reaching the end of the system, they encounter a speeder. However, in the game, Katarn is picked up by Ors in the Crow. In the other two versions, Katarn and WeeGee use the speeder to leave the farm, and are later picked up by the Crow during a speeder chase, after which they depart to Barons Hed. The next obvious contradiction is the presence of 8t88's pet hornaguant, Grendel, which appears in the novella and the drama. The pet does not appear whatsoever in the game. Next comes Katarn's infiltration of Fuel City and the Sulon Star. In the game, Katarn battles Imperial forces around the Sulon Star while trying to empty fueling tanks and pipes, which would allow him to crawl into the belly of the ship via its fuel pipes. However, in both the novella and the audio drama, Katarn sneaks aboard the ship through a hatch on the top of the ship without raising alarms. It should be mentioned, though, that the game level after Fuel City begins at the ship's top hatch, and like the novella and audio drama, Katarn enters the ship through the hatch. Thus, the game actually contradicts itself in this matter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next set of differences lie in the duel with Gorc and Pic. In the novella and audio drama, when Katarn finds the beheaded 8t88, Grendel consumes the droid's head. This doesn't happen in the game, as Grendel does not exist in the game. The actual duel between Katarn and the twin Dark Jedi is also different. In the novella and audio drama, Gorc attacks first, is shot in the face and dies, and then Pic attacks. Pic is knocked unconscious, and then later killed when he attacks again. Afterwards, Katarn cuts 8t88's head out of Grendel. In the game, Katarn battles Gorc and Pic in a straightforward lightsaber duel at the same time. Katarn then simply picks up 8t88's head off of the ground after killing the Dark Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to deal with the various differences, this article foremost treats the general events of the novella as the correct depiction of events, while treating the events in the game as correct when they do not directly contradict the novella, such as when game events could take place in-between certain events. For example, the Barons Hed game mission is placed in-between Katarn's infiltration of the city, and his encounter with a bounty hunter right before he begins his infiltration of the tower. Moments that appear in the game that do not appear in the other sources are also treated as correct when it the events do not directly contradict the novella. For example, the novella does not explain how Katarn got into the Government House, whereas the game does. When this article follows the game, it goes by Barba's guide, and assumes that it is followed in its instructions and suggestions, such as when to spare civilians, and what areas of a level are visited."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The audio drama's events are treated as canon when they do not directly contradict the novella from which it is based upon. For example, the audio drama states that Ors and Katarn scouted Morgan's home at the same time. The novella, however, states that Katarn scouted his old home and spied upon the Dark Jedi invading it on his own. The audio drama is also used to procure names for certain individuals, such as the droid 8-13, who does not appear in the game, and goes unnamed in the novella. The audio drama also presents new dialogue, most of which is converted from prose paragraphs in the novel. However, the dialogue is also treated as correct when it does not obviously or directly contradict the novella's script."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
