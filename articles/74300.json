She was part of a New Republic diplomatic delegation led by Senator Tia'dor Emshwa that traveled to the planet Ithor in 5 ABY during the last throes of the Galactic Civil War. Their CR90 corvette Starfall was boarded by the Super Star Destroyer Annihilator, which had been commandeered by the hermaphrodite alien pirate Eleodie Maracavanya. When Eleodie offered the New Republic crew and passengers the opportunity to join his crew, Kartessa volunteered despite her mother's objections. Eleodie accepted Kartessa's offer and told the mother to respect her daughter's decision. The woman tearfully followed her rebellious daughter aboard the Annihilator. By the time of the Battle of Jakku, Kartessa had grown tired of her mother following her and abandoned her on the engineering sublevel. Eleodie chastised Kartessa for disrespecting her mother."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kartessa's mother first appeared as a tertiary character in Chuck Wendig's 2016 novel Aftermath: Life Debt, the second installment in Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy.
