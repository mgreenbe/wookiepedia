Featuring a tall, black body shell, its heavily shielded outer casing protected its sensitive internal circuitry from harsh external conditions, including the most intensive radiation. However, it also gave the droid a lumbering, cumbersome appearance. The Mark II reactor drone was equipped with a magfield sensor ball."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A successful series manufactured by Industrial Automaton, the Mark II reactor drone's body shell was reused for their R1-series astromech droid, also known as the R1 reactor drone, when legal hassles prevented the company from directly transforming their P2-series astromech droid into a consumer product. As a result, R1 units were commonly mistaken for Mark II reactor drones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beyond repair, a Mark II reactor drone was cannibalized for its magfield sensor ball by Jawa scavengers on the planet Tatooine.
