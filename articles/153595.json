The planet's gravity was higher than standard, with a Human feeling like they weighed a least a hundred kilograms heavier when exposed to it. The lower layers of the planet's atmosphere had pressure levels of a thousand atmospheres, which was beyond the tolerance level of Humans. It was believed that the planet was devoid of life, but a gray, flying life form lived in the cloud layers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the Galactic Civil War, the Galactic Empire assigned a bathysphere to operate in the planet's atmosphere. At some point, the bathysphere was boarded by Roark Garnet, a smuggler. Garnet and the bathysphere's crew fought, and the smuggler neutralized all but one member. The altercation also caused the craft to spin out of control. The pair wrestled for control of the vessel; first the Imperial gained the upper hand and stabilized the bathysphere, only for Garnet to take advantage of his fatigue and take the wheel, narrowly avoiding crashing the bathysphere into one of the planet's native life forms\u2014an act that shocked the Imperial since he believed that there were no life forms on the planet. The bathysphere's repulsors then failed, exposing the craft to the planet's full gravity. Garnet managed to repair the repulsors and stabilize the craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This planet appeared only in an example scenario in the first edition core book of West End Games's Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game published in 1987."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
