It once terrorized a Cor village until a shaman bound it to the land. This act remained effective as long as Cor remained on that location; however, the Karflo Corporation forcibly relocated the tribe causing the beast to re-emerge and attack their construction site. Once the Cor tribe was returned to their tribal lands, the beast was able to be subdued."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
