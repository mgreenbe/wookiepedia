During the Clone Wars, crates containing the starship's parts were shipped to Jedi Master Darrus Jeht from a departure point in the Taris system. Jeht and his associate Trilinae Untaire investigated the parts shipments in an attempt to find out who was sending the ship to Jeht and why, but they were unsuccessful at discovering the vessel's origins. Jeht began to re-assemble the ship and he found that some parts were missing, so he called in some favors and obtained the parts that he needed, allowing him to restore the ship to working order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jeht later kept the Legacy aboard his flagship, the Maelstrom. In 19 BBY, shortly after the declaration of Order 66, the Maelstrom engaged the Separatist warship Shadowblade in a battle in the Cularin system, and Jeht ordered Milinae Untaire\u2014the sister of Trillinae\u2014and the droid R-0 to take the Legacy and flee the battle to safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
