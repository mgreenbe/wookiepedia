At the suggestion of two of its members, the company established a large manufacturing facility\u2014the floating city Ipsus\u2014on Genarius in 36 BBY. The Cularin system's position would allow easy distribution of product to both the Core and Outer Rim, and also points in-between."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As some of the representatives were reluctant to take the risk, Naescorcom agreed to commit an initial 50,000,000 credit budget to build Ipsus, pending the first gain (which had not been reached as of 32 BBY). Furthermore, a Naescorcom board was to become the remote ruling body of Ipsus city, and the facilities would be managed by two Naescorcom operation overseers destined there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naescorcom believed that diversification in product lines would lead to success. Their manufacturing facilities often produced multiple items that had little relation.

Tibeeme was forced to accept the deal. Other employees, such as Ipsus's Line Two archivist Nui Gneppe, worked there by their own will."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naescorcom leaders of Ipsus had claimed mining rights on the inhospitable moon of Ulbasca, disputing the rights of rival company SoroSuub, even though none of them have ever made a real effort to mine there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point before 32 BBY, Naescorcom employed El'Tar Miskin as a shipping clerk, but he mixed up two shipments, sending textiles to Outer Rim pirates and thermal detonators to a Coruscant orphanage.
