Unlike other repeating blasters, the VX could its own high rate of fire through the use of five rotating barrels, each of which featured its own actuating module, Galven coil, and crystal housing, distributing wear and preventing excessive buildups of heat on any one barrel. Although it was designed for use with its included bipod, a wielder with sufficient strength could carry and even fire the weapon on the move, albeit invariably with reduced accuracy. Those that intended to wield the VX themselves often attached a shoulder strap, although even then the weapon required two hands to wield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
