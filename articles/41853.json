Gher was an associate of the Human smuggler Nanika Senoj and around 0 BBY, Gher and Senoj were approached by the Toydarian Unko while in Chalmun's Cantina on the Tatooine, who attempted to hire them to deliver so contraband to Imperial Center. Gher and Senoj declined the offer, because they were wanted by the Imperial Security Bureau, and Unko instead paid the Sullustan to find him someone who could take on the assignment. Gher attempted to persuade the smuggler Dash Rendar to accept the job, but Rendar declined because his starship was in need of repairs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
