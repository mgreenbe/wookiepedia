Their objective was to protect Blank's unwilling bride, the Kage Pluma Sodi as she was trapped in a chest. The fight between the bounty hunters and Kage Warriors resulted in over half the hunters being thrown from the train. Blank's loyal henchman, Rigosso, teamed up with what was left of the hunters. The Kage people were suffering an increasing number of casualties, and the battle for Pluma seemed in favor for the decreased number of just two hunters and the loyal Major Rigosso."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pluma's brother, who was the leader of Kage warriors, boarded the subtram as it approached Otua Blank's fortress.

Sodi threw his blade into Rigosso's chest, killing the Belugan. Sodi recovered his blade and continued to his sister, rescuing her with the help of one of the bounty hunters, Asajj Ventress.
