In it, Kressh detailed a plan that he had enacted to establish an army by forming alliances with mercenaries and pirates. Thousands of years later, during the Republic Dark Age, the holocron was discovered by the Human Sith Lord Mandragall. Mandragall eventually became the ruler of a region of space, and found himself without sufficient forces to defend his territories from rival Sith Lords, so he consulted Kressh's holocron and followed to the letter Kressh's plan on how to create an army of independent operators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
