After the Mon Calamari began to revolt, he was in command of an Imperial blockade of the planet Mon Cala and informed another officer that they were to destroy any Mon Calamari ship that tried to break the blockade and to cripple any that did not before they boarded each ship to exterminate all resistance. His underestimation of the Mon Calamari proved his undoing, however, when he ordered one such cruiser that rushed the blockade be fired upon without verifying its designation or cargo. When a subordinate identified it as the Aurora Flare and carrying a load of coaxium, highly volatile hyperfuel, Meori panicked and ordered his crew to cease fire and take evasive action. The order came too late as the Aurora Flare rammed Meori's Star Destroyer, igniting its cargo and destroying both ships and their crews."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
