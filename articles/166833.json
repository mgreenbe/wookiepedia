They were eaten by members of the sentient, slug\u2013like Hutt species, although it would take millions of the worms to sate a single Hutt's appetite. The Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure ate handfuls of live Ylesian white worms from a large basket filled with the creatures to the point of overflowing whilst he viewed a Podrace at the Mos Espa Grand Arena in the year 22 BBY. On Ylesia, members of the T'landa Til species, working as priests, would bathe in red-colored mud in which Ylesian white worms could be found, as the Corellian smuggler Han Solo discovered to his horror when he joined a pair of T'landa Til in such a mud hole around the year 10 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ylesian white worms first appeared in the 1997 novel The Paradise Snare, the first story in The Han Solo Trilogy, written by A.
