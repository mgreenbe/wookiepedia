It was later reprinted in the short story anthology Tales from the New Republic published by Bantam Spectra in December 1999. In it, Boba Fett takes on an entire Imperial garrison. The story is notable for its expansion of Fett's abilities, tactics, and character. It makes him far more morally ambivalent than the clear-cut \"bad guy\" character he was used as in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the story, Boba Fett finds an old mark.
