It was most notable as being Naboo Senator Palpatine's first moment in the political spotlight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his speech to the Senate, Palpatine announced that, according to the wishes of his king Bon Tapalo and his constituents on Naboo, he would be abstaining from the vote. The vote was later passed, giving the Trade Federation greater voting power and influence in the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine's abstention earned him the animosity of Senator Pax Teem of the Gran Protectorate, who had been hoping that the new young Senator would be in a mood to vote his way. This played an essential part in Palpatine's kidnapping by Santhe Security agents hired by Teem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unbeknownst to all, however, the vote was a further part of the obscure Grand Plan of the Sith Order, orchestrated by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis, who appeared in public as the Muun Hego Damask, Magister of the lobbying company Damask Holdings, and his secret apprentice, Darth Sidious, a.k.a. Palpatine. Plagueis's plan was for the new member-worlds to be caught between a Republic that heavily taxed them and a Federation that exploited them to foment discontent and pave the way for a future secession crisis that would eventually destroy the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
