Resembling a signet ring, the top of the nexus ring could be flipped up to reveal a chemically-coated monofilament fiber with an energy jack connector. The ring also had a power cord that could plug directly into cybernetic attachments such as prosthetics. The ring could be plugged into a power source and energy stored in an internal battery, or transferred directly into a cybernetic attachment. The ring's energy converter adjusted the power flow to boost the performance of the attached prosthetic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
