It was the point of entry for off-world visitors to Ropagi II. Customs checks were enforced for weapons only, and anything else was fair game. Each entrant had to convince the Ropagu Felis Alverite that they were planning to trade and seek knowledge rather than look for mercenary work. Ropagi II's meager space force of six BTL Y-wing starfighters were based at the starport, and Chief of Security Leesa One-Eye maintained her office and private residence there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
