Very rarely, a capsule supposed to contain a red crystal was instead found to contain a fragment of obsidian. These unique obsidian shards had been mined from dark side shrines and were infused with the power of the dark side of the Force. As a result, the shards had gained similar properties to red kyber crystals, and when inserted into a lightsaber, they would produce a red blade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
