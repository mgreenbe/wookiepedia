During the Padawan Roan Novachez's third year at the Jedi academy at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, a student prank caused hundreds of clones of the voorpak known as Voorpee to be created. Fellow Padawan Gaiana took the responsibility of finding homes for the voorpaks and donated a number to the Naboo Zoo. The zoo, however, was not able to accept all of the voorpaks, so she donated the remainder to the Voorpak Rescue Organization, save one, which she kept as a personal pet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
