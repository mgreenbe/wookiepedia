The track \"Grievous Speaks to Lord Sidious\" has the most discernible and complex form of the theme. The piece is generally polyphonic, meaning that sections play their own unique parts dissimilar in rhythm and pitch to those of other instruments or groups. In this track, the theme starts off with a rapid string part. Trumpets then come in, followed by horns playing the main melody, which is broken into three sections by short rests. This is repeated once, before the London Voices enter, singing between the brass phrases. The theme ends suddenly as the chorus and orchestra drop off all at once. The theme also appears in the track \"Star Wars and The Revenge of the Sith.\" This version is simply a tuba soli\u2014a part that features a single section rather than an individual musician\u2014which is followed by the beginning of the theme, replacing the horns with tubas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Use"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In the soundtracks"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"General Grievous's theme\" is featured for the first time four minutes and forty-six seconds into the track \"Star Wars and The Revenge of the Sith,\" the first track on the Revenge of the Sith soundtrack.
