A unit made of Rebel pilots, they participated in many major battles such as the Battle of Yavin, the Battle of Hoth and the Battle of Endor during the Galactic Civil War. It was one of the Alliance's greatest assets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although a small, unorganized resistance against Imperial rule of the galaxy had existed since at least 19 BBY, the Starfighter Corps itself was not organized until 2 BBY.[source?] By this time, the Starfighter Corps had access to BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bombers, T-65B X-wing starfighters, T-65C-A2 X-wings, and UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support crafts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps partook in the mission to Eadu, where they fought the Eadu Deployment and destroyed the Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the theft of the Death Star plans at Scarif, the Empire discovered the location of the Rebels' headquarters on Yavin 4, and deployed the massive battlestation to destroy the moon. The Rebels deployed a force of 22 X-wing starfighters and 8 Y-wings for a desperate assault on the space station's reactor, which was accessible through a thermal exhaust port located at the end of the meridian trench. Despite massive casualties and fierce Imperial resistance, a young pilot named Luke Skywalker used the Force to destroy the station with a pair of proton torpedoes. Out of the initial attacking force, only 2 X-wings and a single Y-wing survived the assault."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, the Starfighter Corps dramatically increased the size and diversity of its forces. The Alliance was able to provide Saponza's rebel cell on Tatooine with new starship classes including A/SF-01 B-wing starfighters, E-50 Landseers, Fang fighters, HWK-290 light freighters, LAAT/i gunships, RZ-1 A-wing interceptors, and Z-95 Headhunters. Within a year, the Alliance had also acquired T-47 airspeeders, which would see action at the Battle of Vrogas Vas with Cyan Squadron. After the Alliance hijacked an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Harbinger, Luke Skywalker and Sana Starros used the TIE/ln space superiority starfighters for patrol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, the T-47s were used at the Battle of Hoth. Although mainly used for pulling cargo sleds in the area surrounding Echo Base, a number of airspeeders served as effective atmospheric assault fighters. The resourceful pilots of Rogue Squadron used their harpoons and tow cables to tangle the legs of Imperial AT-AT walkers, and then blasted them with their laser cannons in their weakened state. Wedge Antilles employed this tactic successfully. Thane Kyrell of Corona Squadron used a different approach, slicing off a walker's foot pad with the sharp wing edge of his airspeeder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Starfighter Corps struck a decisive blow to the Empire in the pivotal Battle of Endor. Under the command of General Lando Calrissian, the Corps led a desperate assault on the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station. With Calrissian at the controls of the Millennium Falcon, the Rebels destroyed the new battlestation, while the redeemed Anakin Skywalker sacrificed his own life to destroy Darth Sidious. Later that year, the Alliance to Restore the Republic reorganized itself into the New Republic. As part of this wider change, the Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps was reorganized into the New Republic Starfighter Corps, which continued to see action in the Galactic Civil War up to and including the Battle of Jakku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
