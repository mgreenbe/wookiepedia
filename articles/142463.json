The convoy is intercepted by an Arquitens-class command cruiser, which deploys several TIE interceptors. A dogfight breaks out and the TIEs wipe out the starfighters. They then proceeded to attack the transport ship, despite the captain contacting the TIEs and offering to surrender. The leading TIE pilot, Captain Vult Skerris, simply fires a final burst into the transport's cockpit."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sabine's call"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Chopper Base on the planet Atollon, Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren run into the command center, and Ezra says he heard that the supply run to Teralov failed. Hera Syndulla states that it's worse: they lost the entire escort of six A-wings and all crew aboard the transport ship. Ezra asks how many pilots they still have, and opines that at this rate there will be no one left to fly for the rebellion. Commander Jun Sato then replies that he has been working on a solution with Fulcrum.

AP-5 will prepare fake credentials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Ezra asks why he is not involved with the mission, Sabine replies that she was a real cadet for several years. Hera explains that Ezra is too well known to the Galactic Empire, while Sabine is the least known among the cell.

She joins a queue of Imperial cadets who have to slot their ID cards into an Imperial astromech droid. The droid rejects Sabine's card, leading the Imperial officer to hold Sabine aside for questioning. However, Sabine tells the officer to give it another try, claiming that the new ID cards often have problems. She takes off her helmet, blows on the card, and polishes it on the shoulder of her uniform before handing it back to the officer, who reinserts it into the droid's processor. The card is accepted, and the officer allows Sabine to proceed. As she walks away, Sabine surreptitiously pulls a comlink out of her helmet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, aboard a rebel CR90 corvette, Ezra, Kanan and Chopper receive word that Sabine is in. Ezra is unhappy about having to sit and wait, but Kanan reassures him that she will be fine.

She is contacted by her wingman TIE-SS25, who tells her she can call him Wedge. Sabine identifies herself as Ria Talla. Instructor Goran then reminds the cadets to only use their com numbers. For the exercise, the TIEs have to intercept and destroy four simulated Y-wings. After destroying the Y-wings, Wedge and Sabine are ordered to proceed to new coordinates and destroy a rebel transport. The simulated transport is heavily damaged and transmitting an offer of surrender.

When \"Ria\" says that the final ship was no transport, Skerris exits the third pod and reveals that the transport was the Ghost, stating that the rebels tend to use non-warships modified for combat. He warns SS-36 and SS-25 that insubordination will get them killed in real combat. Wedge tells Sabine that she is brave in breaking protocol, but she replies that she follows her gut instinct and what she thinks is right.

Wedge is troubled about the recent simulator exercise and tells Sabine that this is not what he signed up for. Sabine confides that shooting on unarmed transports was not what she had signed up for.

Pryce then presses a button which detaches the TIEs' solar collectors, leaving the TIEs floating in space. She then orders Captain Skerris to destroy one of the pods; killing Rake. Skerris' TIE Interceptors then target the rebel transport, inflicting serious damage to the top of the ship. Sabine tells Ezra to get out, but he replies that he will not leave her.

Wedge, worried about Sabine, accidentally lets her real name slip, to Sabine's dismay. Satisfied, Pryce orders Kallus to escort Wedge and Hobbie to a cell, intending to interrogate Sabine alone.

Back in the torture chamber, Sabine breaks free of her stormtrooper captors when they uncuff her to strap her into the torture device and fights with Pryce, who is trained in unarmed combat. She compliments the Governor on her skill, and Pryce smugly responds that the Empire taught her well. Sabine retorts that her clan taught her better, and knocks Pryce out by pushing her into the torture device's stinger, shocking the Governor unconscious.

Pursued by stormtroopers, the trio run down a corridor, dodging several blast doors before being halted by a blast door closing in front of them.

Sabine and the defectors flee in a TIE bomber, chosen despite its slow speed because it can take a hit, before the stormtroopers can capture them.
