Born to a wealthy schinga breeding family on Makem Te, she was lauded as a beauty, and was sent to Coruscant by her kin to represent her ranch in the Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition. At the galactic capital, Dokes decided to go on a spending spree, embedding her body with all manner of valuable gemstones. As a result, she emptied the family's accounts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ashamed, Dokes took refuge in Coruscant's lower levels, and turned to art, as a way of expressing her loneliness.

During the Republic Classic era, she was sent to the galactic capital Coruscant, to represent her ranch in the Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition. While there, her vanity led her to spend her funds at a dizzying rate, as she went on a shopping spree. Clearing out the family accounts, she purchased troves of gemstones which she then implanted into her body. Dokes, however, soon found herself out of resources, and she decided to take refuge in Coruscant's seedier districts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now aware of her own folly, Dokes was forced to live in the gutters of the galactic capital. All alone, she discovered that she had a talent for expressing her loneliness through artwork. For both her paints and her canvas, she used the dregs of Coruscant's lower levels, creating an array of disturbing, dark, and macabre artwork. She enjoyed success with her new profession, and rose up through the society of the galactic capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She eventually reached such a level that she came to frequent the Outlander Club, in the Uscru Entertainment District.

Faytonni was interested in sponsoring Dokes' future artistic endeavors, but, despite the Human's charm, the Swokes Swokes suspected that he was trying to con her. Despite her suspicions, she decided to go along with them, and decided that her new acquaintances would make suitable artistic subjects. In particular, she began to picture a work featuring dismembered extremities clad in tattered Judicial uniforms, but she decided that she needed to wait for proper inspiration. She also came to accept that if pawned, her embedded jewels would be able to help her accumulate a moderate amount of money, should she find herself in financial trouble again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oakie Dokes was perceived as a particularly beautiful Swokes Swokes, and she regularly made others aware of it. She possessed gray skin and red eyes. She was incredibly vain, to the point that she ignored the needs of her family, valuing her own appearance far more. She spent compulsively on items of decadence, until she was finally brought to destitution. While destitute, she came to the sobering conclusion that her parents would be so disappointed with her conduct that they would not even eat her themselves. Dokes found herself incredibly lonely while living on Coruscant, so much so that she felt the need to express her feelings through art. Despite the fact that she had some suspicions about the motives of Lieutenant Faytonni, she decided to follow her heart and accompany him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Oakie Dokes first appeared in George Lucas' 2002 film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.
