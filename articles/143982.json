These YVHs come equipped with weapons powerful enough to destroy the Vong's vonduun crab armor, making them a significant resource in the war against the invaders. Meanwhile, the Jedi learn of this new voxyn threat and, through research done by Cilghal, realize that the voxyn are clones of an original genetically modified beast native from Myrkr. In order to stop it, Anakin Solo suggests, and Luke Skywalker agrees, to send a Jedi strike team to the worldship at Myrkr to destroy the voxyn cloning lab. The idea faced some resistance, mainly from Han Solo who rightly believed that the mission was dangerous and was unwilling to send all three of his children right into Yuuzhan Vong territory. Ultimately, the choice was Luke Skywalker's, who is currently leading the Jedi, who thought that it was their only chance and volunteered himself for the mission. Anakin rejected his offer on the grounds that he was too valuable to the New Republic and the Jedi, as well as being too important and strong for the Yuuzhan Vong to consider taking alive. Instead, Anakin volunteers himself and others follow his lead. Lando gives the strike team two Yuuzhan Vong Hunter droids for assistance. The members include Jaina, Jacen and Anakin Solo, the latter the leader of the whole strike team, and they are accompanied by Alema, Lowbacca, Tenel Ka Djo, Tahiri Veila, Ganner Rhysode, Tesar Sebatyne, Krasov and Bela Hara, Ulaha Kore, Eryl Besa, Raynar Thul, Jovan Drark, Tekli, and Zekk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lando, acting as a traitor to the New Republic, convinces a Vong force led by Duman Yaght that he has brought them Jedi in exchange for his homeworld's safety. The Vong take the Jedi, but the latter group, after passing behind enemy lines, escape with the help of their YVH assistants, YVH 2-1S and YVH 2-4S, and use the ship they were captured aboard, the Exquisite Death, to reach Myrkr. Ulaha Kore and one of the YVHs are lost during the team's escape, staying behind to hold back the enemy. After landing aboard the Vong worldship where the voxyn are being cloned, called the Baanu Rass, they encounter the captured Dark Jedi Lomi Plo and Welk, who agree to assist them after being freed from the Vong's clutches. Through encounters with Yuuzhan Vong forces several of the Jedi and their remaining YVH assistant are killed. Using their knowledge of the worldship, Plo and Welk guide the strike team, but are perturbed when they discover that the Jedi have no escape plan. In order to escape, they steal the Tachyon Flier, injuring Lowbacca and abducting the wounded Raynar Thul and M-TD (Lowbacca's translator droid) in the process. Anakin becomes severely injured during one of their many confrontations with Vong forces and ends up sacrificing himself to hold off the warriors while the remainder of the team goes after the voxyn queen, right after Anakin achieves complete oneness with the Force. Jacen, replacing Anakin as leader, orders the remnants of the strike team to steal one of the Vong's frigate ships and escape the worldship while he kills the voxyn queen, who is being cloned several times to produce the voxyn. With the help of Vergere, Jacen confronts the queen and kills it by confronting it in a basal-comb.

During this, Viqi is chased down by Leia after her failed attempt at kidnapping Ben, but Viqi nevertheless escapes and regroups with the Vong. Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker get shot down during the Battle of Coruscant and are almost killed had it not been for the Millennium Falcon saving them. Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya meets his end when Vong forces led by Romm Zqar raid the Imperial Palace and he sacrifices himself with a proton bomb blast, initially in order to kill Tsavong Lah, who, thanks to Vergere, sees through the plan and stays off of Coruscant at the time of the explosion. Fey'lya takes about twenty-five thousand Yuuzhan Vong with him. The adult Solos, Skywalkers, and their friends escape Coruscant, looking, despite the catastrophic loss of the New Republic capital, for a better tomorrow to the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1997 and 1998, a Bantam/Dark Horse invasion storyline was developed which explored a different story than what would become the New Jedi Order series. This initial story pitch involved Anakin as protagonist, one in which he would nearly be corrupted by the dark side by a female villain (who would also serve as a romantic interest), eventually leading to a confrontation by Jacen and Jaina in a final battle of \"intense sibling rivalry;\" this confrontation would have resulted in the death of Jacen Solo, after a conflict with an extragalactic Sith species. By May of 1998, this story conception was reviewed by George Lucas himself, who felt that many elements of the story pitched lacked originality and too closely mirrored the prequels. Among other things suggested (including suggestions which led to the creation of the Yuuzhan Vong), Lucas suggested changing the primary character to Jacen instead of Anakin. Following this, the series pitch was totally rewritten and underwent significant changes, eventually becoming the New Jedi Order story."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the new story pitch, the New Jedi Order story team decided to focus the story around Jacen Solo's development, and planned on utilizing Anakin in a false protagonist capacity, leading eventually to his death midway through the series. It was at this point that the novel outline for Star by Star was drafted. This pitch was approved by George Lucas in 1998, and development of the series began officially. Although an urban myth has been repeated that George Lucas later intervened during the production of the series to kill Anakin, this is not true; Troy Denning later confirmed in a radio interview that before Vector Prime was written, it was already written in the story bible of the series that Anakin was slated to die in Star by Star, confirming that this was the intention of the NJO story team before publication of the series began."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Regarding the scale of the novel as Denning's first Star Wars novel, \"It was a little bit intimidating, but not only that -- Coruscant falls, which was, to my mind, almost as big a deal as killing Anakin.
