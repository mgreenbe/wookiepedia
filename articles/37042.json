Around 25,793 BBY, Aarlaa aided Clan Ryo in the kidnapping of Oma Dessain, the youngest daughter of Dessain Mining's leader Eomin Dessain, on Zerist. Sent to find the kidnapped girl and prevent violence from breaking out between Dessain Mining and its workers, Hawk Ryo discovered and attacked the kidnappers' stronghold in the town of Kainnan. In the process the ranger used the Dark side of the Force to Force pull Aarlaa toward him, impaling the guard on his sword before he could sound an alarm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deon Aarlaa first appeared in the short story Eruption, a prequel to Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void written by John Ostrander and published in Star Wars Insider 141."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
