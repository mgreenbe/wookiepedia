As the government struggled to re-establish order and elect a new Chief of State, the New Republic Defense Force remained on the defensive, scattered amongst numerous worlds and commanders. Some, like Admiral Traest Kre'fey, continued to take orders from the Defense Force high command. Others, like Garm Bel Iblis, gathered remaining fleet units and held on to individual regions of space, acting independent of the government. All of this began to change following the Chief of State election. When Cal Omas was elected the new Chief of State, the government began to reform and reorganize. The new stability in the government was coupled by the return of aging retired admiral Gial Ackbar, who worked with Chief Omas and then-current Supreme Commander Sien Sovv to ready the New Republic military for a major offensive. Following the major victory at the Battle of Ebaq, the New Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Victory over the Yuuzhan Vong"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Alliance Defense Force was initially established out of the former New Republic Defense Force following the reorganization of the government into the new Galactic Alliance. The fleets of the Galactic Alliance slowly began to turn the tide of battle, liberating key worlds like Fondor and Yag'Dhul. Despite some setbacks, like the Battle of Bilbringi, the Defense Force continued to gather its strength in preparation for the coming end of the war. The fleets of the Defense Force defended Mon Calamari from invasion and led the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post war years, 30- 35 ABY"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the end of the war against the Yuuzhan Vong, the Defense Force remained active. It was expanded to five strategic fleets, a direct nod to the previous five fleet structure of the old NRDF. With the majority of the known galaxy allied with the new government, the Defense Force concentrated on routing out the numerous pirate bands that rose up following the war. As the galaxy continued its reconstruction, the Defense Force worked alongside the New Jedi Order in bringing stability and maintaining the peace."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Swarm War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first major conflict that the Defense Force fought following the resolution of the Yuuzhan Vong war occurred in 35 ABY, when the Killik hives were rediscovered in the Unknown Regions.

This crisis threatened to blow up into a new civil war. As diplomatic efforts on both sides began to break down, the Defense Force deployed a task force of the Second Fleet to Corellia in a display of military might."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the breaking of the blockade, Commenor and Bothawui joined Corellia, and the Confederation was formed, along with the newly unified Confederation Fleet. Other planets soon followed; Fondor, Bespin, and Adumar prominent among them. During this time, the GADF and the Confederation Fleet were locked in a state of standoff, with both sides concentrating more on preparing for an inevitable war rather than a direct assault; instead making sporadic and minor raids against each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thus the Battle of Gilatter VIII was the first major fleet action against one another.

While most of the galaxy was subsequently once again under the control of the new Empire, the remnants of the Galactic Alliance military, in the form of the Galactic Alliance Core Fleet, continued the fight against the Empire, which itself broke off into two rival factions, one of which stayed loyal to the deposed Emperor Roan Fel. The other remained under the control of Darth Krayt, who usurped Fel's throne and claimed the Empire for himself.

The overall structure of the fleet was modeled on the older New Republic Navy, with five strategic fleets serving as main units of operation for the Alliance. It presumably also maintained static sector fleets, coupled with private planetary navies. These federal forces were augmented by fleets of various member states, like the Imperial Remnant or Hapes Consortium."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the first year of the Alliance's existence, the fleets remained fairly unorganized, grouped to individual commanders or assigned to various key worlds, like Kuat, Mon Calamari, Corellia, or Kashyyyk. In the final months of the war, the Defense Force was reorganized into the system modeled after the old Defense Force. Numbered fleets were established, forming a strategic arm of the Alliance military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Original fleets of the navy:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As of the Second Galactic Civil War, the Alliance government added the following fleets:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fleets were reorganized as such before the Sith\u2013Imperial War:"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Marines"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the fleets, the navy kept Marines as ship-to-ship assault and defense units, just as they did previously in the New Republic Navy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Starfighter Corps"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Defense Force's Starfighter Corps was the successor of the New Republic version.
