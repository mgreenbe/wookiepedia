A variant of the dovin basals that the Yuuzhan Vong used to pull their craft through hyperspace as well as for shielding, it was developed by Qelah Kwaad and based on research by Nen Yim. The mabugat kan was designed to consume HoloNet relays by tracing the HoloNet signals to their source and generating a singularity.
