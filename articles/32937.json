Unlike the DLT-19, the DLT-19x released all of its power in one shot before it would need to cool down. The DLT-19x was an incredibly powerful weapon, and could take down most enemies in one shot. The weapon had a scope which could be zoomed in farther than most scopes. This targeting blaster was a weapon of choice for many snipers, and was very effective and silent. The LOM-series bounty hunter 4-LOM also wielded a DLT-19x."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
