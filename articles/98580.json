Nox was a verdant world and it had supported vast forests and complex ecosystems. But settlers had quickly made use of its rich metal deposits and endless wood supplies to build giant smelting plants, extracting 90 percent of the metals used across the system. Over the space of a thousand years, most of the forests had vanished into ash, and with them the creatures they had supported. It had been a merciless despoliation of the planet, but at the time the system had been a new, mysterious frontier, and those brought there by the Tho Yor were desperate to make a home for themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 25,793 BBY, Nox had become a manufacturing world, with nearly ninety domed cities established on the planet dedicated to the production and refinement of ore.

The planet was depicted in a schematic of the Tython system. Since its establishment in 2008, The Old Republic's website has gone through a number of changes, resulting in the removal of some of the features and images that were originally located there, including the aforementioned schematic. Nox's name and additional information on it were provided in Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi 0, a preview issue of the Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi series of comic books. The issue was published on February 1, 2012, and was written by John Ostrander and penciled by Jan Duursema.
