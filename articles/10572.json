In the story, two Duros newlyweds named Etro and Droza Edthatt are \"abducted by Human beings\" from the planet \"Urthha\". After over four solar periods of bizarre experiences, they somehow use a \"matter catalyst\", which the Humans call a \"blender\", to leave the planet. Lucasfilm employee Leland Chee, who maintains the Holocron continuity database, has indicated that information contained in the book is non-canonical."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
