Following the liberation of the world by the New Republic, Ned'Ix attempted to join the crew of the CR90 corvette FarStar, which was tasked with a mission to track down the rogue Imperial warlord Moff Kentor Sarne, who had fled from Kal'Shebbol with his forces. Despite Ned'Ix's superior technical skills, the command crew of the corvette felt that his habit of jury-rigging equipment was actually more of a danger than an asset and turned him down. Undaunted, Ned'Ix repaired and modified a Ghtroc Industries Class 720 freighter that he found abandoned on the planet.

In 8 ABY, Ned'Ix was present on the planet Kal'Shebbol in the Kathol sector of the Outer Rim Territories when it was liberated by New Republic forces. The local Imperial warlord, Moff Kentor Sarne, was forced to flee his capital and headed deeper into the sector with the bulk of his military forces. Realizing the threat that he still presented to the stability of the sector, the New Republic authorized a mission to track him down, assigning the CR90 corvette FarStar to the job. However, a lack of available manpower meant that the New Republic was forced to hire civilian personnel from the local population of Kal'Shebbol to assist in crewing the vessel. Ned'Ix learned of the mission, and, seeing an opportunity for adventure, he applied to join the crew. However, despite his exceptional technical skills, Ned'Ix was turned down as the command crew felt that his penchant for jury-rigging and modifying equipment could have placed the ship and crew in unnecessary danger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rather than be left on Kal'Shebbol, Ned'Ix resolved to help the FarStar in any way possible. Discovering an old Ghtroc Industries Class 720 freighter that had been abandoned on Kal'Shebbol, he repaired the vessel and enhanced it with junk components left behind by both the New Republic and the Galactic Empire. Ned'Ix gathered together a large amount of technological parts\u2014including disassembled droids, fused turbolaser circuit boards, and ion drive power couplings\u2014and fitted the ship with a small laser cannon and a pair of proton torpedo launchers.

A determined and adventurous being, Ned'Ix wanting nothing more than to join the crew of the FarStar and assist them in their expedition.

His skills allowed him to modify a comlink into a jamming device, but he was easily distracted when working on a new gadget. However, he indulged his creativity too much sometimes, often to the point of forgetting about everything else. Several times, Ned'Ix landed the Fxz'Et on the nearest planet he could find regardless of any danger, or allowed the ship to drift in orbit. Often, the result was Ned'Ix getting into trouble with local Imperial forces or criminal elements who discovered him. He also had a habit of modifying equipment that did not need it. This usually resulted in making the equipment more powerful or more useful, but rendering it unstable at the same time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A capable pilot and astrogator, Ned'Ix could fly small vessels and operate their weapons and shield systems effectively.
