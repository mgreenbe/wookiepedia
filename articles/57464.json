It was very different in appearance from the standard nerf, with long legs, sparse hair, a short tail, and a long snout, as well as deer-like antlers. In fact, con artists sometimes tied antlers to the heads of eopies and tried to pass them off to na\u00efve collectors as Grizmallt nerfs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
