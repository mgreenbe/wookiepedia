It could carry a message (up to five-minute long holorecordings), data, or a small object that it could deliver in a detachable, spring-loaded compartment. The M4 was not round like many hovering droids, and its slim profile and lack of protruding antennae meant it could slip into small areas. They were notorious for making deliveries no matter how much time had passed or how much damage the droid had received."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A military version, the M4m, was produced by Cybot Galactica."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
