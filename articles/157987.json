In about 0 BBY, Unko attempted to find a pilot to transport a cargo of illicit contraband from the planet Tatooine to Imperial Center. He initially offered the job to the Sullustan spacer Dwanar Gher and his Human associate Nanika Senoj, but the pair declined. Unko subsequently hired Gher to assist him with finding someone who was willing to accept the assignment and while drinking in Chalmun's Cantina in the city Mos Eisley, the pair offered the job to the smuggler Dash Rendar. However, Rendar turned them down because his starship was non-functional and required repairs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
