Then, the race continued along a long bridge which opened up to the searchlights of Desolation Alley which were looking for any escaping convicts. Soon after, pilots were forced to navigate through giant fan blades at over six hundred miles per hour. Not long after, they were sent through the first of many antigravity tubes, which were littered with raw ore."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Next, the tube opened up to a massive room with free-floating ore: the reactor core of the facility. The filament would sever the magbeam holding the engines together, which racers had to dodge, and reenter the tubes. Again, the tubes opened up to massive towers, which racers had to dodge or suffer excessive collateral damage, which may have included their lives. Another shot from the antigravity tubes and the racers were shot out back onto the surface, where they had to navigate the straightway back to the arena."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The avenues which divided the cell blocks were very wide, so racers with high top speed and cooling ratings would excel on this course."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Tournament and race number"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This course was the sixth race in the Amateur Podracing Circuit tournament."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Track favorite"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fud Sang"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Other tracks of Oovo IV"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
