During the Jedha insurgency, Sesquifian sold a portion of local worms to the former Guardian of the Whills Baze Malbus. Sesquifian had not cleaned the worms very well, and while eating the worms chopped up in a noodle soup, Malbus's housemate Chirrut \u00cemwe would occasionally find grains of sand. The pair agreed this made the meal fairly wretched, and assumed that Sesquifian had gotten the worms from Dobias Cole-Truten, a local trapper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sesquifian was first mentioned in the novel Guardians of the Whills, which was written by Greg Rucka and released in 2017."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
