While watching the strag competition, Kaird poured wine poisoned with myocaine. Fifteen minutes later, Biggs and Ord were paralyzed, and the Human was forced to reveal all the codes in order for the assassin to board Admiral Erel Kersos' private ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Biggs\" and \"Bogan\" are both names found in early drafts of Star Wars.
