He was generous and always tried to have a decent meal to offer slaves and the poor when they entered his bar. When a morose Human Jedi named Jelph Marrian entered the establishment, the elderly bartender sensed Marrian's sadness and guessed that the Human was concerned over a woman. The bartender poured him a mug of sweetwater and offered to leave the bottle should the Human need more. The Keshiri also served Marrian a bowl of porridge out of concern over his woe and gave him kind words and pieces of love advice, telling him that anything could happen when he involved himself with a woman."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The purple-skinned Keshiri bartender was pleasant and generous to his patrons, offering kind words in addition to food and beverages. When the impoverished or the enslaved entered his bar, he was quick to provide them with a meal and prompt to apologize when he believed they did not enjoy it.
