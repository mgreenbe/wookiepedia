The Graf family of hyperspace prospectors, who were responsible for both great works and great horrors, mapped out several routes and played a role in the rush that was still whispered about by the people of the Outer Rim Territories and frontier many years later. The San Tekka clan, rivals of the Grafs, also spent lives while prospecting during the rush. Toward the end of the rush, the San Tekkas turned a tide of loss and pain into one of profit using the abilities of the hyperspace savant Mari San Tekka, whose abilities helped them mapped valuable new routes through areas like the Relgim Run and the Bitmus Cloud after the rush. During the rush, a hologram was taken of San Tekka writing out the locational code for a navigational beacon in the Berenge sector using numbered blocks. The Grafs eventually hired a information broker to find out the clan's secret and so learned about San Tekka, who then went missing before the rush finished."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grafs kept some of the routes mapped during the rush private until the scientist Chancey Yarrow and others like her campaigned to have all routes made accessible by the Republic. However, over one hundred years later, the Graf family still kept some private routes using a number of their beacons that were still left over from the Hyperspace Rush. The beacons were encrypted and appeared only in the navigation computers of the Grafs. The Yarrow mentioned the Hyperspace Rush when explaining San Tekka's abilities to Nan, a member of the Nihil, in around 231 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hyperspace Rush was first mentioned in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Out of the Shadows, which was written by Justina Ireland."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
