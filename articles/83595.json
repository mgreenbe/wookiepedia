During the Galactic Civil War, the Incom Corporation\u2014a Fresia-based manufacturing concern\u2014was taken over by the Galactic Empire and the new regime used the Lower Coromon Chain to house slave laborers that worked in the Incom manufacturing plants, which were located an hour's transport journey from the Lower Coromon Chain. The laborers that resided on the islands consisted mainly of B'trillans, Wookiees and Yuzzem, and they were discouraged from escape attempts by the presence of a stretch of gazarant feeding grounds within the islands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
