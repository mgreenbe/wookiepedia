These boots made a visual distortion when active, with the thruster assembly being extremely explosive and vulnerable to blaster fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nimbus commandos of Jabiim used repulsorlift skates to navigate the muddy world of Jabiim, considered untraversable by walkers and other such conventions. With these skates, the Nimbus Commandos were considered nearly unstoppable on their homeworld, and used the skates to incredible military effect during the Clone Wars. Using the skates, squads of three could penetrate enemy lines withe ease, reach heavy equipment and walkers, and destroy them with charges and grenades. Commandos would then scatter mines behind them in retreat - their skates' repulsors allowing them to glide over the mines without detonating them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
