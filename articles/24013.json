She was part of the crew of the Sky Princess and the girlfriend of its captain Andronikos Revel, until the first mate Sylas Wilkes led a mutiny against him and ejected Revel out in an escape pod. Though Rix liked Revel, she had to pretend to put up with Wilkes and his advances. Eventually Wilkes joined up with the Exchange on Tatooine and Revel, who did time in an Imperial prison, followed him to the planet. Unable to act on his own, Revel was unable to leave his private room in the Siltshift cantina in Mos Ila until Kallig came to question him on the artifact that Wilkes stole. Kallig made contact with Rix, who jumped at the opportunity to finally be rid of Wilkes and gladly gave directions to his hideout. After Kallig and Revel confronted and killed Wilkes, Rix stopped by to bid them farewell at the Mos Ila Spaceport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Casey Rix appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Sith Inquisitor class mission on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
