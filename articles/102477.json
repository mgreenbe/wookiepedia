It received its unusual nickname for the vicious-looking end of the barrel, wide mouth, and long stylized sights that resembled fins. The pistol's projectiles released an acidic compound upon impact that was dangerous to both biological and mechanical entities. The schematic for the weapon was discovered by a group of spacers during the mission to retake the rogue Imperial Star Destroyer known as the Blackguard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The P8 Lamprey pistol appears in the 2003 MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. It was added to the game on January 15, 2008 with the release of the Chapter 8: The Nova Orion Crisis game update. It is obtained by looting the schematic for it from the corpse of any of the \"boss\" level enemies the player defeats during the retaking of the Star Destroyer Blackguard. The player may then bring the schematic to another player of the Munitions Trader profession and have that player craft the weapon for them. The pistol also appears as a \"Weapon\" card in the Price of Victory expansion set for the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game. The expansion was released on December 14, 2010."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
