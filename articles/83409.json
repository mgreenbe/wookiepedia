They were unable to contact the outside galaxy or repair their vessel, so the Tribe remained trapped on the world until the arrival of a Sith Meditation Sphere known as Ship in 41 ABY. Ship helped take the Sith offworld to stage attacks on vessels, which were salvaged for parts to repair the Omen and captured for use in the Sith fleet. In 43.5 ABY, the Tribe felt the presence of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker in the Force, and Ship was forced to leave the Tribe by the dark side entity Abeloth.

The alliance held together until they battled Abeloth, and the Sith betrayed the Jedi and tried to capture the entity. The Jedi nevertheless survived, and Luke Skywalker appeared to kill Abeloth.
