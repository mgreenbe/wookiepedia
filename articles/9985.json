The Galactic Republic tried to liberate it in 22 BBY and were only successful through a series of strikes called Operation Katabatic nearly a year later. The Separatists engaged in a \"poisoned well\" policy, releasing a biochemical plague into the planet's water table that killed 90% of the population. The survivors mostly relocated to Trilos, if not to other neighboring worlds.

Its oceans, those that hadn't boiled away, were now large bodies of poisonous water and the poisonous air carried what remained of the chemical weapons that were used.
