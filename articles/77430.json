To counter this perceived deficiency, the Qunaalac built many dams across the world to create large lakes and artificial swamps. One of the most well known Qunaalac estates on the world was Fort Dandunc, which housed Qunaalac treasure vaults and war trophies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
