Most Imperial supporters would come to consider the campaign on Turak IV a success, due to the large amount of damage done to the Alliance. Despite being decimated by Alliance forces, the 112th would be reassessed by the Empire and given new funding and material, including the new Imperial Repulsortank 1-H."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A battle within the battle took place, as retrieval teams on both sides clashed over retrieving the damages, but still operational, repulsortank Hammer 4:3."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
