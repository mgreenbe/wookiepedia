It allowed a reconfiguration of matter on a molecular level by changing its nuclear structure. This technology allowed the Gree to take simple basic elements such as silicon, carbon, and hydrogen to create rarer and more valuable isotopes and elements. Masters within the Gree operator caste who specialized in material synthesis were called Synthesors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
