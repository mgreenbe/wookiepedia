Following a fierce battle for leadership, the Nightsister clan of witches on Dathomir has banished one of their own, an extremely powerful Force sensitive named Kyrisa, who has developed the ability to control the minds of beasts with the Force. At the orders of Clan Mother Gethzerion, Kyrisa was exiled from Dathomir and crash-landed on the planet Hoth. Enraged at her banishment, Kyrisa vowed revenge against Clan Mother Gethzerion and the Nightsisters. Taking refuge deep within the icy caverns on Hoth, she quickly took control of wampas, creating a new pack of minions that she used to wreak havoc on both the Rebel and Imperial military forces on the surface of Hoth, stealing supplies necessary to help her return home to enact her revenge. Her abilities to manipulate the beasts is so complete that both Jedi and Sith want this knowledge, or at the very least to remove the Force-user as a threat to their objectives on the surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Card List"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fixed Cards"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Promo Cards"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Loot Cards"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Artists"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "List of notable artists who provided original art for the sixth game set."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
