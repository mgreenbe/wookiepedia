After both groups failed to steal a shipment on Vandor, Nest and her lieutenant, Weazel, tracked Beckett's crew as they stole coaxium from Kessel. Nest and the Cloud-Riders found Beckett's crew on Savareen, where she revealed the group's true purpose as allies fighting against Crimson Dawn. Solo sided with Nest and they teamed up to steal the coaxium from Crimson Dawn, dealing the syndicate a critical blow in the process. Nest intended to use the coaxium to help give life to a rebellion, so she gave the coaxium to Saw Gerrera of the Partisans and his young ward, Jyn Erso."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born during the twilight years of the Galactic Republic in 27 BBY into a family whose women fought to protect the galaxy for many generations, Enfys Nest was the daughter of a woman who led the Cloud-Riders, a band of pirates who sought reprisal against the Galactic Empire and criminal syndicates that terrorized the galaxy. She came from a world that was brutalized by the criminal organizations of the Five syndicates and carried a specific vendetta against Crimson Dawn\u2014widely considered the deadliest and most powerful of the Five syndicates\u2014for what they did to her homeworld, family and innocents across the galaxy. In 11 BBY Nest's mother perished, leaving the 16-year-old Nest to take up the mantle of her mother's distinctive mask and armor and her place as leader of the Cloud-Riders to carry on the mission of fighting back against the threats to the galaxy's safety. With her identity and age hidden behind mask and vocoder chest box, she built a reputation as an infamous and dangerous pirate, not underestimated for her youth as she had been in the past."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Raid on Gargon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 11 BBY, about a year following her ascension to leader of the Cloud-Riders, Nest led a squad of six marauders on a raid of an Imperial spice cache on Gargon. The raiding party approached the cache aboard their swoop bikes and stole its stores of medicinally processed spice, kept in ready-for-use triage kits and emergency packs. Although pursued by Imperial forces that came near to closing in on them, the Nest and the Cloud-Riders successfully escaped with their quarry. In the ensuing Imperial Security Bureau investigation of the incident, Agent Andressa Divo observed how the raiding party took only the medicinally processed spice, forgoing the raw spice that could be refined into a lucrative narcotic form and sold for immense profit. While her compatriots attributed this curiosity to a hurried escape forced by Imperial pursuit, Divo judged it was a deliberate decision on Nest's part and reflective of the ideological motives behind her gang's activities. She suspected Nest was not simply out to make a profit but fostering an insurrectionist movement against the Empire and preparing an army to go to war."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tricking Beckett"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In need of some blank identichips, Nest decided to trick her rival Tobias Beckett into acquiring some for her.

Beckett tried to intimidate them with the threat of Dryden Vos showing up, but Val had deduced that Nest had been the one to send them on their mission. Nest threatened Beckett with a blaster, asking him where the identichips had been hidden. To prevent Nest from getting the cargo, Beckett destroyed the Rampart, escaping with his crew during the explosion."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Train heist on Vandor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having been a thorn in the side of Tobias Beckett and Crimson Dawn for an extended period of time, the possibility of Nest and the Cloud-Riders interfering with Beckett's heist on Vandor was brought up by Val, whose advice fell on deaf ears; Beckett had been assured that only he and his inside men had the knowledge of the supply carried by a 20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport in the mountains of Vandor. However, Val's fears were soon proven correct when Enfys Nest arrived with her Cloud-Riders, attempting to thwart an attempt by Beckett's gang to steal a large quantity of coaxium from the conveyex, wanting to take the coaxium for themselves. As Beckett and his gang detached the train car carrying the hyperfuel, Nest and the Cloud-Riders, flying swoops, attached tow cables to the car and attempted to wrest the fuel from Beckett's stolen Y-45 armored transport hauler, flown by Rio Durant and Han Solo. In the ensuing struggle, the coaxium cargo fell into a mountainous ravine, resulting in a huge explosion."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tracking the Millennium Falcon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before Beckett and the rest of his team left Vandor, Nest had other members of the Cloud Riders place a homing beacon upon the ship.

After the fuel was processed, Beckett and his crew planned to deliver it to Dryden Vos, but were once again ambushed by Enfys Nest and the Cloud-Riders, who had been tracking them since Vandor. One of Beckett's crew members, Han Solo, attempted to bluff that the Millennium Falcon was poised to dispatch the Cloud-Riders, only for its owner, Lando Calrissian, to flee the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a confrontation, Nest revealed that the Cloud-Riders were not \"marauders\" as Beckett had believed, but freedom fighters trying to stop crime syndicates and the Empire from gaining more power. Solo was sympathetic to her cause, and hatched a plan to double-cross Crimson Dawn for the coaxium. The Cloud-Riders would then temporarily go into hiding and villagers would pose as the Cloud-Riders in order to lure away the Crimson Dawn's Hylobon Enforcers so Vos would be alone and easy to kill."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo's plan worked and the Hylobon Enforcers disarmed the \"Cloud-Riders,\" securing the coaxium vault. Before they could take the coaxium back to Vos, Nest and the real Cloud-Riders appeared in the encampment, ambushing and quickly defeating all of the guards. After the deaths of both Vos and Beckett, Solo handed the coaxium over to Nest, who stated that such a large quantity of the valuable material would help fund a rebellion against the Empire.

Meeting on the condition that Gererra come alone, Nest was vexed by sounds of another person from within his shuttle and the Cloud-Riders readied their weapons for a fight. Gererra diffused the situation by revealing the companion was his eleven-year-old ward, Jyn Erso. Jyn had wanted to accompany him, curious to observe the exchange; believing she needed to learn to survive the dangers of the Empire, Gerrera allowed it. While initially surprised by her presence, Nest saw much of her younger self in the young girl and sensed Jyn lost her innocence at a young age much as she had. Choosing to break with her custom of hiding her identity and age even from potential allies, she removed her mask to reveal she herself was very young. Nest asked Jyn if she thought her age protected her. When the girl said no, she warned Jyn that people would still underestimate her and advised she make them regret it. Redirecting their attentions to the true purpose of the meeting, Gerrera and Nest boarded his shuttle to negotiate the exchange of coaxium, leaving the Cloud-Riders behind to secure the ship. As Nest walked in, Jyn quietly told her that Gerrera would underestimate her, impressing the older woman with how quickly she learned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Enfys Nest wore gauntlets made of beskar armor plates that could be fanned out using a built-in servo and act as shields.
