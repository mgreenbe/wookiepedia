In 22 BBY, the battle droid was stationed at the B'omarr Order Monastery on the planet Teth, inside which the Separatists held Rotta, the son of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Forces of the Galactic Republic visited Teth to rescue Rotta, and the sergeant spotted the approaching Republic transports, reporting the arrival to his OOM commander. The OOM command battle droid ordered the sergeant to fire on Sector 11374265, leading the sergeant to become confused by the complicated order. As the Republic forces approached the base of the cliff below the droids, the sergeant leaned over the edge in an attempt to locate them, but leaned too far, falling over the edge. The sergeant was destroyed after he hit the ground, and his commanding officer ordered him to return."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
