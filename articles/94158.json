Behemoths were once major predators, and due to their hibernation cycle, some were underground at the time of the Imperial bombardment and escaped the spread of toxins and ruin of the atmosphere that followed. Twisted by radiation and poison, the behemoths mutated to survive. Mutated behemoths had six legs with clawed feet. They were covered by uneven patches of fur, exposing a scaly hide. They also had oblong heads with bony ridges and many sharp teeth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
