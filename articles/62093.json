Holographic shells had a number of drawbacks, however; the system memory only had the capacity for a single disguise which had to be programmed in ahead of time, and could not be changed on the fly. Additionally, the disguise was only useful at a range of several or more meters - closely investigating or touching the disguise would ruin the illusion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
