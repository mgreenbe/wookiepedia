The only Bosph allowed such glyphs were those who were Force-sensitive, known as Ela b'Yentarr, who also made up the entirety of the government on the Bosph homeworld of Bosph. Any object that a glyph was placed upon was considered to be owned from that moment on by the owner of the glyph. If two Bosph both claimed ownership of an item they would duel for it, sometimes to the death. All items not claimed with a glyph were considered equally owned by all members of Bosph society. The Bosph smuggler Bora Boru owned such a glyph and used it to claim his ship, the Bosphon Forever."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
