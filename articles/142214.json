Under the jurisdiction granted to them by the treaty, the Thaereian military took a heavy-handed approach to maintaining order in the Cularin system, which led to the outbreak of an armed conflict between the military and the loyalist Cularin Militia, who sought to drive the Thaereians out of Cularin. The plight of the citizens of Cularin was raised in the Galactic Senate and in about 20 BBY, the Republic rescinded the agreement. However, the Thaereians refused to leave the Cularin system and were subsequently driven out during the Battle of Cularin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
