Dexx attended the same school of political studies on Coruscant as Cavin Chistor. While he apparently did not work for the Corellian senator, Dexx did know him. Cavin and Dexx arrived on Cularin about the same time, with Cavin working for his father and Dexx for himself. He and Cavin ran the Syndicate. The two desired to gather as much power and wealth around them as possible and arranged for expertly forged documents to fall into Imperveri's hands, documents that showed a strong financial relationship between Barnab Chistor and the Metatheran Cartel. While these false documents would not stand up to a thorough investigation, they would be good enough to cause Governor Chistor trouble. The pair planed to control a large percentage of trade entering and leaving Gadrin when the port was finished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
