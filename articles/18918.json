During the year 3 ABY, it was stationed at the Rebel Hospital only weeks after the disastrous Battle of Hoth. The hospital was tasked with tending to the hundreds who were wounded during the evacuation. The Bolt carried a repair crew to tend to the various starships in the area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Azzameen family's bacta shipment to the Rebel hospital, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Corrupter attacked the Rebels with Lancer-class frigates Blue Hawk and Cascade. The Bolt quickly launched to power up the various freighter craft in the area so that they could escape, since most of the vessels had been powered down while in park. The Bolt ensured that almost every starship in the area was at least given a chance to escape the Imperial ambush."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
