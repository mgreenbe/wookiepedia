In the real world this emblem has clear connections with the healing efforts of the International Red Cross and first aid, and Christianity. The cross is not colored red in most depictions, as the Red Cross symbol is protected by international treaties (the Geneva Convention), and the International Committee of the Red Cross has vigorously protected its exclusive rights to use the symbol, as it is a \"protected symbol\" (a sign of truce giving at least theoretical protection to the bearer/marked structure) during times of war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
