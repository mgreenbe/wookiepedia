Lumbra saw another ship, one that belong to Jedi Master K'Kruhk and a group of younglings. He headed a team to salvage their ship and discovered the younglings' identity as Jedi. He shot Chase Piru when she tried to defend her friends, leaving her for dead, while towing the others to his ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Piru was revived by K'Kruhk and they set out a plan to rescue the younglings.
