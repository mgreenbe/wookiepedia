At some point after the Battle of Endor, during which the Empire lost both its supreme ruler, Emperor Sheev Palpatine, and its second Death Star battle station, Governor Ubrik Adelhard locked down the entire Anoat sector, establishing the Iron Blockade. Early in the blockade, the ISB officer was tasked with conducting a contraband sweep at the Longstar Marketplace on Burnin Konn. There had been reports that someone was attempting to smuggle synthetic kyber crystals, which were both highly explosive and illegal. Before the shop of Shortpaw, a Chadra-Fan junk dealer who secretly led the Trade Spine League, the ISB officer started questioning a young scoundrel whom he thought looked suspicious. When the Imperial turned his back to interrogate other passers-by and merchants, he was shot by the scoundrel, who was indeed guilty of smuggling the crystals. Nevertheless, the smuggler's weapon was just a modified rat-stunner, and the security officer merely fell unconscious. In accordance with instructions the officer had given to a sergeant five minutes earlier, an Imperial \"cleanup team\" ended up arriving on the marketplace, and they went after the scoundrel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The security officer was a fair-skinned man who sported short black hair.
