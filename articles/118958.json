Sebatyne was originally discovered by Jedi Master Eelysa, who, after recognizing her powerful Force-sensitivity, took the Barabel as her Jedi apprentice. Sebatyne was trained to the level of Jedi Knight by her Master on the Barabel homeworld of Barab I, before training several apprentices herself, including her son Tesar, and forming them into the Wild Knights squadron. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Sebatyne was involved in several important campaigns against the invaders. Indeed, the Barabel Jedi found herself responsible for the accidental death of thousands of her species; however, she managed to overcome her guilt and aid the Skywalker family in their search for the sentient planet Zonama Sekot.

Sebatyne continued to sit on the Jedi High Council during the Second Galactic Civil War, taking part in several operations including the Battle of Kuat and the Battle of Kashyyyk, before which she was forced to read the eulogy at the funeral of her dear friend Mara Jade Skywalker.

When Hamner favored a policy of appeasing Daala and her hostile policies, Sebatyne was foremost among the Council members to oppose Hamner, and she led a consensus to relieve him of his position. However, when Hamner saw Sebatyne and the others as treasonous to the Order, Sebatyne dueled Hamner and killed him, an act which caused her to feel significant guilt. With the urging of the other Masters, Sebatyne temporarily assumed the position of Grand Master, planning to remove Daala from power for the good of the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sebatyne later led a coup against Daala which was launched at the same time as Senator Haydnat Treen and General Merratt Jaxton launched their own coup.

After the Jedi's withdrawal from the Triumvirate and the Alliance, the Sith infiltrated Coruscant and the galactic government.

The voxyn proved to be a great menace to the Jedi Order, as they were created for the purpose of hunting and killing its members. The Jedi soon learned that the voxyn were clones of a single source, the voxyn queen, and as such Anakin Solo masterminded the daring mission to Myrkr in the hopes of destroying the voxyn queen and hence eliminate the threat of the voxyn; Sebatyne's own son Tesar, and his hatchmates Bela and Krasov Hara accompanied the Myrkr strike team.

Ultimately, the Order were allowed to retain custody of the rogue Jedi Seff Hellin and Natua Wan who had succumbed to a strange psychosis, so that Jedi healers could study them. Unfortunately, the similarly afflicted Valin and Jysella Horn remained in the hands of the government."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To make matters worse, the exiled Jedi Luke Skywalker discovered a resurgent Sith threat abroad in the galaxy, which the Jedi Council was powerless to aid him in dealing with due to the threat of Daala shooting down their ships should they launch without her approval. As more Jedi Knights caused public incidents after succumbing to the psychosis\u2014Jedi that the Council refused to hand over to the Alliance government\u2014Chief Daala issued a vague threat to Grand Master Hamner about the safety of the families of the Jedi should they continue to resist her administration. Shortly after issuing her threat, the Chief of State authorized a siege of the Jedi Temple, further entrapping the Council. Faced with no possibility of reinforcements from the Order, Skywalker was forced into a fragile alliance with the Sith in the hopes of defeating the monstrous entity, Abeloth, whom he suspected was behind the sudden outbreak of psychosis in young Jedi Knights."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, the siege was ended when it appeared that Skywalker succeeded in destroying Abeloth, thus healing the infected Knights of the psychosis. However, although Daala withdrew her forces surrounding the Temple, she refused to hand over Valin and Jysella Horn to Jedi custody. During a meeting of the Jedi High Council, Hamner insisted that the Order give Daala a little more time to come to her senses and willingly release the Horns, while Sebatyne was one of the Council members that said they do anything and everything to free their fellow Jedi. Although when Hamner insisted that the Jedi should try their best to avoid a conflict that could kill Galactic Alliance personnel, the Council decided to give Hamner's plan a chance. Seconds later, Han and Leia Solo walked into the meeting and informed the Council of the slave uprising on Blaudu Sextus. After discussing the situation, the Council decided to send a pair of Knights to investigate whether Freedom Flight, a secret organization determined to completely eradicate slavery, was behind it. When Tesar and the other Wild Knights were suggested, Saba told the Council that all Barabel Jedi would be unavailable, though she did not give a reason (the reason being that Tesar and the others had built a nest in the Temple's depths and were guarding it until their offspring hatched). But the discussion of who to send to Blaudu Sextus soon changed when Hamner told the Council that he had an arrangement in motion that would allow the Jedi to get the StealthX Wing off Coruscant without fighting. When Hamner said he couldn't comment any further, Saba came close to rejecting his authority and launching the StealthX Wing anyway. The only thing that stopped her was when Hamner made it clear that anyone who wanted to reject his authority was going to have to fight him for control of the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saba was later present at a meeting where the Council, Leia and Han saw a media announcement about the events on Blaudu Sextus: when Belok Rhal, the Mandalorian who led the siege of the Temple as well as killed the representative that Hamner sent to negotiate with him, attacked and killed Madhi Vaandt during the broadcast, the Jedi sent to Blaudu Sextus stepped in to stop him and his commandos from killing anyone else. The reporter who took over the broadcast mistakenly announced that the Jedi's actions meant the entire Order had decided to support all slaves who rebelled against their oppressors. Saba, along with most of the Council members, interpreted this mistake as the Force's way of saying the Jedi needed to stop shying away from a confrontation with Daala and strike against all their enemies and believed that this turn of events would finally convince Hamner to take action. Hamner, however, declared that the Jedi couldn't afford to take any actions that might bring about a reprisal from Daala. Instead, he planned on going to Daala to try and convince her that the Jedi are not trying to destabilize her government. But this led to Han telling the Council that Hamner had been stalling for time in hoping that Nek Bwua'tu, whom he had made an unsanctioned deal with, would awake from the coma he fell into following an assassination attempt and solve all his problems by convincing Daala to be reasonable to the Jedi. Outraged by his deception and finally fed up with his attempts at appeasement, the Masters relieved Hamner of his position as acting Grand Master and removed him from the Council."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Jedi Grand Master"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Hamner's removal, the Council rallied behind Master Sebatyne as their new leader. Under her leadership, the Council decided to openly oppose Chief Daala and lend support to the growing galactic slave uprising.

When former Grand Master Kenth Hamner discovered the Council's plan, he defied Sebatyne's order to confine himself to his chambers, and fought his way into the hangar bay, knocking two Jedi Knights unconscious. Believing that the Jedi were committing treason against the Galactic Alliance, he attempted to force Sebatyne to stop the launch. Sebatyne refused to stand down as she felt that the Jedi's duty was to the will of the Force, not the Alliance, thus causing Hamner to attack her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A ferocious duel erupted between the two Masters, with the Barabel ultimately besting her predecessor. At the conclusion of their duel, Sebatyne used the Force to push Hamner backwards, knocking him off of a catwalk. However, she genuinely cared for her fellow Master and wished only to incapacitate him, not kill him, despite his readiness to kill her. The Barabel Jedi telekinetically caught the falling Hamner, who proceeded to use his own powers by throwing his lightsaber at the hangar bay controls in an attempt to stop the launch. Sebatyne strove for telekinetic control of the lightsaber, while simultaneously holding Hamner aloft, and ultimately was forced to allow her predecessor to fall to his death in order to break his control over the Jedi weapon. Although she regretted Hamner's death, Sebatyne stood firm in her allegiance to the will of the Force and felt that ensuring the launch's success was necessary for the greater good.\nSaba later answered Daala when she contacted the temple and demanded to speak with Hamner about the Jedi's recent actions against her. When Daala declared that she now had no choice but destroy the Jedi, Saba told Daala that the Jedi wouldn't lose. However, Daala couldn't launch an immediate attack against the Jedi because, to ensure the Jedi StealthX Wing could launch safely, the Jedi had taken hostages. Saba later requested that the Masters decide on a new leader, and they declared her to take over as acting Grand Master in Hamner's stead. She was strongly opposed to doing so as she regarded her inability to save Hamner's life as a great failure. The other Masters, however, refused to accept no for an answer and insisted that the Jedi Order needed a strong leader at the head of the Council. Thus, Sebatyne reluctantly agreed to temporarily accept the title of Grand Master, stating her intention to be judged for her actions upon Skywalker's return. She then told the Masters that to protect the Jedi Order and prevent Coruscant from erupting into a battleground, the Council had to remove Daala from office."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Masters then formulated a plan to take control of the Alliance. When Daala ordered yet another Mandalorian attack on one of the slave revolts occurring across the galaxy, this time the uprising on Klatooine, the Council put their plans into action ahead of schedule to prevent the slaughter. Whilst several senior Jedi stormed the Chief's office and placed her under arrest, Sebatyne interrupted a meeting of the Senate and announced Daala's arrest. At the same time, a conspiracy led by Kuati Senator Haydnat Treen put their own plans to remove Daala into action. The acting Grand Master negotiated with Treen and put into place a ruling Triumvirate, consisting of Senator Treen, General Merratt Jaxton of Starfighter Command and Sebatyne herself, which would act as a constitutional replacement for the office of the Chief of State until new elections could take place. In this way, the Senate, the Defense Force and the Jedi Order all had equal representation in the Triumvirate and a two-thirds majority would be needed between the three Triumvirs to make decisions and effectively run the Alliance's executive branch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following this bloodless coup, the Jedi held a funeral for former acting Grand Master Kenth Hamner. Sebatyne also personally charged her former apprentice, Leia Organa Solo, with a mission to Klatooine, to negotiate with the various anti-slavery organizations that were in the process of revolting. As a Triumvir of the Galactic Alliance, Grand Master Sebatyne authorized Organa Solo to offer the organization closest to winning their planets independence full membership into the Alliance and a seat in the Alliance Senate. Klatooine itself quickly proved to be the planet closest to gaining independence, and was ultimately accepted into the Alliance and granted a Senate seat as Sebatyne had promised.

She also differed from other Barabels when it came to her temperament. This was shown by her remarkable self-control, as she refrained from attacking a GA colonel who called her a \"short-tail\" (an exceptionally insulting term for a Barabel), though it was mentioned that had she not been able to control herself, she would likely have severed the colonel's arm and beaten him around the head with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a member of the Jedi Council, Sebatyne was naturally a Jedi Master with an extremely strong attunement to the Force.

Master Sebatyne also detected Ben Skywalker's periodic disappearances and subsequent reappearance in the Force during his torture at the hands of Jacen Solo. Indeed, Jacen Solo regarded Sebatyne's Force sense so highly that he feared she had penetrated his \"public face\" at his aunt's funeral and recognized that he had become a Sith Lord.

It is possible that Master Sebatyne was capable of utilizing the power of Force valor, to overcome the pain of her injuries, as evidenced by her seemingly impossible ability to remain upright after being wounded by an exploding YVH droid. Sebatyne was also particularly skilled in the use of Force meld, being one of the original proponents of the technique, and one of its fore most coordinators, during the Yuuzhan Vong War.
