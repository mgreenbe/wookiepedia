It measured 36.8 meters in length and could reach atmospheric speeds of 950 kilometers per hour. It was equipped with upgraded sublight engines, upgraded hull sections, a primary class 2 and backup class 12 hyperdrives, upgraded deflector shield generators, a navigation computer, and a turret-mounted medium laser cannon in the area typically designated for an observation deck. The YT-1930 had a crew of two and could accommodate eight passengers, had a capacity of 200 metric tons, and had consumables for four months. A new YT-1930 was priced as 135,000 credits while a used YT-1930 was priced at 62,000 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The YT-1930 transport had a central cockpit situated between the two mandibles, which offered a wider view but also diminished the practicality of the two mandibles. The broadened, wedge-shaped sections that extended from the aft of the transport were fully integrated cargo areas, although they appeared to be modular add-ons for maneuverability and actually had the ability to serve as full-ship stabilizers and brakes in atmospheric flights. Compared to other YT-series models, the YT-1930 had double the cargo capacity, and its crew could easily load and offload cargo through hatches in the cargo areas in the aft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many customers and pilots of the YT-1930 were in consensus that the model provided more stable flights than any previous YT-series model, and shipping companies favored the YT-1930 since it cost less than two YT-1300 freighters but could carry as much cargo, although some customers were not impressed with the transport's design."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The YT-1930 transport served in the capacity of a transport used by individuals and shipping companies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Corellian Engineering Corporation manufactured the starship, it only produced less than 1,000 YT-1930 transports, and added the YT-1930's design innovations to the YT-2000 transport, which rendered the YT-1930 obsolete."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The YT-1930 transport was first mentioned in the 2018 canon reference book YT-1300 Millennium Falcon Owners' Workshop Manual.
