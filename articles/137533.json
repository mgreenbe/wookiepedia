By 3966 BBY, Suurja, the star system's primary world, served as a resource world for Taris, a nearby city-covered planet. That year, the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, who had been conquering independent planets beyond Galactic Republic\u2013controlled space for a decade, began to threaten Suurja and other Tarisian resource worlds, causing the Republic to grant Taris membership and military protection. As a result, a Republic security cordon called the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line was created, and the Suurja system was one of the systems that was located on the frontline."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following year, the Mandalorian forces engaged the Republic Military in four inconclusive battles on Suurja in the span of six weeks.

After Zsinj's death, the territory surrounding the Suurja system became a part of the Imperial Space, and it remained within that region until the Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn's defeat. During the Imperial Remnant's campaigns against the New Republic, the star system containing Suurja was located within the area controlled by the latter government, while by the year 137 ABY, the Suurja system fell within the borders of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suurja, the primary world of the Suurja system, was home to Suurjans\u2014a species that lacked ears.
