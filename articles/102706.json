Following the pacification, a Wookiee uprising occurred in which the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk was instrumental in cowing. No senator in the Imperial Senate tried to help when the planet was besieged, nor did they help when some Wookiees were taken off world to be made to labor in work camps and mines, as they were focused on helping their own worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
