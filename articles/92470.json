One in three cases of the disease were fatal. It could remain dormant in its host for several years as the host aged. When it finally became active, it was already too late to save the victim. Rapid degeneration of the nervous system was the primary result of the virus, which eventually left the Mon Calamari unable to survive. For these reasons, all Mon Calamari children were immunized against it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Commander Sesfan, a member of Admiral Gial Ackbar's staff, was tested for Mon Calamari Nerveshock.
