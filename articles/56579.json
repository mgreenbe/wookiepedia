Before the squadron could commence their bombing run on Vader, the Sith Lord used the Force to propel rocks and wreckage from his downed TIE at the Rebel starfighters, which destroyed at least one Y-wing and caused the rest of the squadron Y-wings to collide with each other."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, Horton Salm (Gray Leader) led Gray Squadron during the Battle of Endor, in an large-scale Rebel assault on the Empire's second Death Star alongside the Alliance Fleet and many other starfighter squadrons such as Gold, Red, Green, Blue, Blade and Corona Squadron. During the space battle, the squadron was composed of a mix of starfighters that included Y-wings, A-wings and B-wings. The battle was a key victory for the Alliance, which resulted in the destruction of the battle station and the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader.
