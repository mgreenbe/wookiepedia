Designed to be sleeker and smaller as well as less heavily armed than the Republic attack gunship, the patrol transport was better suited for policing the dense, planet-wide city while reducing the risks of collateral damage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the formation of the Galactic Empire, the patrol transport saw a broader use as a patrol craft for the Imperial Military on various worlds, as well as an escort carried on some of its capital ships.

Designed for crowd control, the gunship was fast, maneuverable and armed with light but efficient weaponry, making it ideal for law enforcement in heavily built-up locales. The police gunship possessed a spoked cockpit and solar gatherer panels which acted as the power generator for the ship. Two ball-mounted laser cannons were underneath the cockpit and one laser cannon was mounted on the rear of the ship which were better suited for patrolling the city scape as well as having a lower risk overall in causing collateral damage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The patrol transports were also equipped with searchlights in the event that they had to conduct searches at night or in areas of Coruscant where visibility was low, such as the underworld. The gunship's cockpit also had two seats for the pilot and gunner, with the pilot being slightly behind of and elevated over the gunner. The side hatches opened for entry, and had a ramp near the rear in the event that the circumstances required rapid deployment of its personnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The patrol transport was armed with ball-mounted turrets and fixed cannons. A troop bay allowed for the rapid deployment of police officers. Though utilized primarily by the Coruscant Security Force, the patrol transport also was available to the Coruscant Guard shock troopers who could procure them if need be.

Pryce's remaining gunships were shot down and the Governor herself was taken prisoner. The rebels later used two captured gunships to infiltrate the \"Dome\" during the Liberation of Lothal.
