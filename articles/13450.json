Hammer Station was designed by the Galactic Republic and was thought to have been destroyed during the Great Galactic War, but was instead seized by the Advozse Hegemony looking to grow their territory. During the Cold War, these Advozsec used the station's gravity cannon to help them gain control over neutral worlds in the Outer Rim Territories. The expansion campaign eventually came to the attention of the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, both of which dispatched agents to the station in order to seize it for their respective faction. The Sith strike force was directed by Darth Malgus and the Republic strike force was commanded by Satele Shan, both leaders were opposed by the Advozse Battlelord Kreshan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
