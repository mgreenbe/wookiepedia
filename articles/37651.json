It was located in the Colonies, near the Corellian Trade Spine. It was a planet of low mountains and deep valleys linked by thousands of rivers. The planet had strict capital punishment and a matriarchal government."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Developing hyperspace technology as early as 30,000 BBY, the Devaronian culture had developed quickly from hunter-gatherers to an industrial power in a short amount of time. The species developed a divide in gender roles during their tribal stage when males had to travel several days from settlements to hunt for prey while the females maintained the safety and organization of the camp. While the matriarchal government developed and funded space technology, it was the wanderlust of the males which drove the species to the stars and beyond. Exploring the region of space around Devaron, Devaronian explorers made contact with other hyperspace scouts and helped blaze the Corellian Trade Spine. One of the earliest planetary governments to join the Galactic Republic, sometime between 25,000 BBY and 22,000 BBY, Devaron was one of the farthest points in known space, forming a border with Wild Space for millennia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the government of Devaron was a representative government that matured to a point where the strict divisions between gender roles was blurred, Devaronian females were historically the most prestigious government officials. To this end, the government was largely matriarchal, as males sought out roles that better suited their primal wanderlust that drove them into the jungles or the stars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Jedi Civil War, the planet was the site of a battle won by the Republic. Devaron was represented in the Galactic Senate jointly by Elsah'sai'Moro and Vien'sai'Malloc during the final days of the ancient democracy. However, in 22 BBY, Elsah was assassinated by Aurra Sing who had been hired by Vien, who was herself arrested (and presumably executed) for both her assassination attempt and her secret sponsoring of a Separatist base in the Blue Mountains. In that same year, bounty hunter Cad Bane attacked a Republic outpost on the planet in order to capture Jedi Master Bolla Ropal, who was the keeper of the Kyber memory crystal, which contained a list of Force-sensitive children in the Galaxy. Later, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano arrived in the Star Destroyer Resolute in order to reclaim the holocron. During the battle, the Resolute later engaged Bane's Munificent-class star frigates. Bane managed to escape, but the bounty hunter fleet was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, the Temple of Eedit on Devaron was attacked by Separatist forces. This battle was the first appearance of Count Dooku's new apprentice Savage Opress and where Jedi Halsey and his Padawan Knox died. Under President Aven'sai'Ulrahk, the planet continued to support the Republic throughout the rest of the war before falling under the sway of the Galactic Empire following the war's end. Around 5 BBY, Devaron was the site of an uprising against the Empire, which was put down by the Imperial-aligned Devaronian Army, led by Kardue'sai'Malloc, whom was thus called the \"Butcher of Montellian Serat\". To escape persecution, the Butcher fled to Tatooine and changed his name to Labria. In 19 ABY, Boba Fett captured Labria and took him to Devaron, where the Butcher was executed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was denied membership in the New Republic due to its violent capital punishment. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the planetary government of Devaron attempted to appease the Yuuzhan Vong by offering Jedi Knight Hivrekh'wao'Cheklev, who was able to escape. Some female Devaronians wished to join the Galactic Alliance and proposed a termination to feeding criminals to the quarra. However, they met with strong resistance from traditionalists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimate Alien Anthology erroneously states that Devaron is in the Expansion Region."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
