The Galactic Republic's victory in the battle put a stop to a Separatist advance during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Republic had suffered multiple defeats by the Confederate General Grievous, which was weakening the Republic's foothold in the the galaxy's Outer Rim. After the loss of the battle group at Falleen, Grievous's fleet moved to take the strategic planet Bothawui. Jedi Knight/General Anakin Skywalker, his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and their task force of three Venator-class Star Destroyers were then assigned to protect and hold the world of Bothawui. However, Jedi Council member Obi-Wan Kenobi urged Skywalker to retreat and regroup, knowing that Grievous was coming. In addition, spies had alerted the Separatist general to the presence of the Jedi cruisers beyond the planetary rings. Despite being outnumbered, Skywalker had devised a plan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grievous, reasoning that an attack from above would render his ships susceptible to enemy fire, ordered his fleet moved in to attack by approaching through Bothawui's asteroid belt, which, in addition to transferring power to his forward shields, protected his ships from Skywalker's fleet. When they got in range of Skywalker's fleet, Grievous' fleet opened fire, eventually crippling the nearest cruiser. Skywalker, flying as Gold Leader, commanded Gold Squadron as they took on Grievous' fleet. One of the V-19s was also hit by enemy fire and collided with another fighter, destroying both. Skywalker thus ordered Gold Squadron to take evasive action and retreat. However, Skywalker continued to participate in the battle and then unveiled his surprise to Grievous. Ahsoka then signaled Captain CT-7567 and his AT-TEs that had been positioned on the asteroids to open fire on Grievous' fleet from their rear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having directed all power to their forward deflectors, the frigates were left completely vulnerable to the attack from the rear and were quickly torn apart one by one. Sensing the momentum of the battle had changed, Grievous decided to retreat; however his droid captain inquired as to where. With the frigates unable to maneouver to escape, the general then took his personal starfighter, the Soulless One, and flew himself away from the battle. Skywalker attempted to pursue him, but his fighter was damaged and incapacitated in the meteor field."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, Skywalker was rescued by Rex. However, R2 was lost and presumed destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early in the battle, when Grievous enters, two battle droids are seated in front of the viewport, but later the chair at the right of General Grievous is empty. As the battle continues, a battle droid can clearly be seen at Grievous's right, but what model of battle droid this is unclear. As they appear in Downfall of a Droid, OOM pilot battle droids can be distinguished from B1-series battle droids by, in addition to their blue markings, several small marks and darker lines on their head. A battle droid with these darker markings and a mark on its head may appear to the right of Grievous in the battle; this would indicate it is a pilot droid, but later it is replaced by a B1."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
