During the battle, Interrogator deployed Hellhound Two, an All Terrain Armored Transport of the Hellhound attack force in a last ditched defense of the Imperial research facility. The walker was abandoned after the Empire's defeat on Jakku, and eventually became the home of the scavenger, Rey. In the battle, the Star Destroyer crashed onto the surface of Jakku, where the wreck of the ship remained for decades. Rey salvaged parts from the Interrogator's interior during her time on Jakku, and presented her findings to Unkar Plutt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
