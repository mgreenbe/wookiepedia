Myneyrshi were tall, thinly built bipedal humanoids; they had four arms, each pair corresponding to a torso one on top of the other, and also had a smooth layer of blue crystalline flesh. A primitive, warlike species, they were constantly at war with another of Wayland's sentient species\u2014the Psadans. A Myneyrsh lived an extremely ritualistic life, with rituals for everyday actions such as walking, eating, and sleeping. Myneyrshi were excellent hunters and trackers, and could move through forested areas without making a sound. Their awareness of their environment was so responsive that Jedi Master Luke Skywalker likened their perception skills to those of a Force-sensitive when he visited the planet in 9 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Galactic Empire conquered Wayland, turning it into a secret storehouse for the Emperor. After the Emperor was deposed, the mad clone Joruus C'baoth took over a secret Imperial storehouse inside Mount Tantiss, enslaving the Myneyrsh and other species of the planet. They were freed upon C'baoth's death. Decades later, the Myneyrshi were nearly wiped out by the Yuuzhan Vong during the Yuuzhan Vong War, and survivors of the conflict were driven deep into the jungle. The Yuuzhan Vong later released a species of parasitic worms to make the planet uninhabitable, forcing most Myneyrsh to flee their homeworld entirely, though some stayed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One hundred years later, Wayland was designated as a planet that would be restored using Yuuzhan Vong terraforming technology as part of the Ossus Project. While it showed great success at first, the project was sabotaged, and the planet became inhospitable once again.

They had two upper torsos, positioned in such a way that one was on top of the other. Females of the species had breasts far more pronounced than the males, and the males had nipples on theirs. Each torso had a pair of long, muscular arms, giving a Myneyrsh four arms. Myneyrshi had one primary hand and three off hands, although they could carry weapons in each hand, or use two hands to carry larger weapons such as a spear. Each had four fingers, one being an opposable thumb, with joints like a Human's. Having four arms also aided a Myneyrsh's ability to climb, and in one case it allowed a Force-sensitive Myneyrsh to utilize three lightsabers while dueling. They had small feet with several large toes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Myneyrshi had upward-pointing ears, which they often pierced and hung things from. Instead of a nose, Myneyrshi had a short, downward-pointing snout. Their twin eyes were white and lacked obvious pupils. Averaging almost two meters tall, Myneyrshi were covered in a layer of smooth, crystalline flesh, which made them look as if they were made of a type of glass. The skin came in shades of blue that ranged from greenish-teal to almost purple. The crystalline skin acted as a sort of armor to basic weapons similar to their own\u2014arrows, spears, and knives. New Republic scientists theorized that this layer existed as a result of a chemical reaction to the moisture and oxygen in the air. Myneyrshi usually had long, dark hair that came in shades of brown, green, and blue. In the aftermath of the sabotaged Ossus Project, an attempt to restore the devastated surface of their homeworld, Wayland, many Myneyrsh were mutated. They became large, gray-skinned beings with sharp protrusions all over their skin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Myneyrshi aged and physically developed at a rate similar to most sentient species in the galaxy. Considered children until they were twelve standard years old, Myneyrshi became adults when they reached eighteen. By the time they were fifty standard years of age, Myneyrshi were regarded as middle-aged by society.

When Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and the smuggler Han Solo met a Myneyrsh tribe during their attempt to infiltrate an Imperial base in Mount Tantiss, which Wayland's inhabitants considered forbidden, they encountered Myneyrshi ritual and participated in the offering of a fowl as \"satna-chakka,\" or a peace offering. While the bird was elevated on a ritual staff, no physical or verbal conflict could be made. Once this ritual was completed, the Myneyrshi presented that staff to guests, a gesture to show unity and friendship. Skywalker received the staff, a sign signifying that his group had the Myneyrshi's permission to roam the planet freely."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Myneyrshi were excellent hunters and trackers\u2014they had the ability to move through a forest without making any noise whatsoever. Luke Skywalker once compared their perception and awareness of their surroundings to those of Force-sensitives. The Myneyrshi had enough spiritual mettle to combat severe mental manipulations.

These robes varied in color from dark brown to white and light orange. The robes often had intricate, golden designs and patterns on them. Myneyrshi usually wore quivers on their backs and pouches for storing items strapped to their waists. Members of the species did not wear footwear, and often wore gold bracelets around their arms.

They had a long-standing aversion to technology, which was heightened by the Imperial occupation of Wayland during which the use of exotic technology by Humans forced them into servitude. After the departure of the Imperials, Myneyrshi became actively opposed to the use of technology because it was seen as a representation of their Imperial conquerors. Myneyrshi shamans declared anything technological in nature as an \"item of shame,\" and that they must avoid technology if at all possible. In contrast, Myneyrshi living offworld did utilize technology for their own benefit, fighting with blasters or piloting airspeeders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Myneyrshi hated and were constantly at war with Wayland's other native species, the Psadan. The Psadan were a more primitive species who worshiped nature and were always eager to fight.

The two species had a long history of inter-species hatred and violence. They engaged in many wars and bitter campaigns against each other. During the Galactic Republic's Expansionist Era, Human colonists were sent to Wayland and crash-landed on the surface. A clerical error in the Republic's planetary registry removed the planet Wayland, the colonists, and all knowledge of its native creatures from all known charts. For a short time, the forgotten Humans dominated the more primitive species, brandishing blasters and high-tech weaponry, which the Myneyrshi feared. However, with no way to replenish the power packs in their weapons, the colonists took up bows and arrows after a few generations, and the struggle became less one-sided. Eventually, the three species formed an uneasy peace after years of warfare."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Empire rose to power in 19 BBY, they built a secret storehouse for the Emperor on Wayland. The Myneyrshi and the Psadan once again joined forces to attempt to defeat the invaders; however, they soon found out that their crossbows, while powerful, were not strong enough to pierce Imperial Battle armor. The Empire conquered the planet easily, enslaving the Myneyrshi and their allies and putting them to work building an immense Imperial complex beneath Mount Tantiss. The Imperial occupation of Wayland ended shortly after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor had taken a special interest in the world\u2014he had installed a Guardian to protect his facility inside Mount Tantiss.

Eventually, the insane clone Joruus C'baoth defeated the Guardian and took his place. He used his mental manipulative powers to continue subjugating the city inhabitants, although the strong-willed Myneyrshi never truly submitted to his rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Grand Admiral Thrawn's visit to their home planet, the Myneyrshi watched the Imperials work at Mount Tantiss, rather than returning to their warlike ways. They had learned from their mistakes of attacking better-equipped adversaries in the past and waited out the suffering. In 9 ABY, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and a New Republic team arrived to stunt Thrawn's attempt at reviving the Empire. After being stalked by Myneyrshi during their long trek through the Wayland jungles, the team met with a tribe of Myneyrshi. The Humans used the protocol droid C-3PO as an interpreter and learned the species' history. The natives were, at first, wary of Skywalker, seeing his group as merely invaders. Skywalker was able to persuade them that he wished to free them from the Empire and was given free passage on the planet's surface. Skywalker's party was able to destroy the Mount Tantiss storehouse and kill C'Baoth in the process. After Thrawn was killed aboard his flagship during the Battle of Bilbringi, the Myneyrshi were free of their bonds to the Empire and were allowed independence. Shortly after the destruction of the Emperor's facility, the New Republic began researching the planet of Wayland and its history. Though it was true, New Republic researchers were unable to confirm Myneyrsh and Psadan tales of C'Baoth's killing the Guardian and they regarded these stories as mythic. A well-regarded theory posited that the Guardian and C'Baoth were the same person. At some point during the rule of the New Republic, the Shi'ido anthropologist Mammon Hoole included an entry on the Myneyrshi in his publication, The Essential Guide to Alien Species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 ABY, the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong species invaded the galaxy and conquered worlds in the Outer Rim Territories, including Wayland, thus making the Myneyrshi one of the hardest-hit species during the war.

The invaders tried to exterminate the species, forcing survivors into the forests for safety. A group known as the Free People, led by a Myneyrsh named Txer, sought to remove the Yuuzhan Vong from Wayland. Among its members were not only the Myneyrshi but Psadans and native Humans, all focused on the same goal. They would use whatever weapons they could use, provided they were not technological, and their enemy's own bioform weapons were no exception. During their campaign, the Free People met rescue pilot Uldir Lochett. After they helped him find the Jedi Klin-Fa Gi, a Yuuzhan Vong force attacked them while activating a parasitic Vongspawn worm, a Chom-Vrone, which began digesting a portion of land. Rather than fight them, the Free People fled the area after helping Gi and Lochett gain entrance to the worm, where captured Jedi were being held. After the war ended, an infestation of the Chom-Vrone took root on Wayland and decimated the planet's ecology. With the world barely able to sustain life, most Myneyrshi fled as refugees.

A mere six months after the planet had seemingly been rehabilitated, its terrain was replaced by an inhospitable Vongformed landscape. The Myneyrshi, too, were affected, mutating into large, monstrous versions of themselves, covered in gray skin with jagged projections and now invisible to the Force. The Myneyrshi placed all blame for their misfortune on Nei Rin and demanded that she face their rite of punishment. Skywalker and his team fled the world to try to find a cure for the mutations and to save the shaper's life; the Myneyrshi swore to kill them as they watched the ship depart.

Bene survived the enaction of Order 66 in 19 BBY and fled to the planet of Vaklin, where the populace still supported the memory of the Jedi Order despite the propaganda of the newly-risen Galactic Empire. Bene helped lead the Vaklin insurgency that acted against the Empire militarily. There was also a female Myneyrsh in the insurgency's ranks. She wielded a blaster rifle and wore a shift that covered most of her body. When Darth Vader, personal enforcer for the Galactic Emperor Palpatine, tried to capture Bene and crush his rebellion, he was unprepared for the public support the Myneyrsh Jedi enjoyed among the populace. Under the advisement of the Human Imperial Security Bureau Major Oniye Namada, Vader instigated a program of effacing traces of the Jedi from the planet.

His organization utilized Yuuzhan Vong bioforms and any other primitive weapons they could find to combat the \"Cut-Up-People.\" After Txer helped Uldir Lochett find Klin-Fa Gi, the group was attacked, and the Yuuzhan Vong began activating the Chom-Vrone of the planet. Instead of fighting the Yuuzhan Vong directly, Txer and his men tied off ropes to the worm nearest them and climbed away to avoid the battle, leading Lochett into the worm before departing.

The comic, penciled and inked by Edvin Biukovic and Eric Shanower respectively with Pamela Rambo responsible for coloring, portrays the species in the fifth issue with tan skin, a square jaw that juts out from the skull, and only three fingers per hand. The mini-series has since been reprinted as a trade paperback dedicated solely to the The Last Command serial and another, which includes all issues from the Thrawn Trilogy comics; both reprints maintain the variant appearance for the species. Since then, as in the Ultimate Alien Anthology, the Myneyrshi's coloring has remained faithful to the West End Games sourcebook description."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the supplements to the West End roleplaying game, Myneyrshi suffer a distinct disadvantage to their Human counterparts, as they are intended only as non-playable characters. Myneyrshi in the game have a much lower maximum level of potential at the game's various attributes, half that of Humans and many other species. Myneyrshi do, however, receive a bonus to their strength to represent their glass armor, making them more resistant to various blows. They also have the ability to wield several weapons at once, though with a single dominant hand and three off hands. The Wizards of the Coast version of the roleplaying game depicts Myneyrshi in largely the same way, but in a more specific manner. As a primitive species, characters of this species have less aptitude than Humans at intelligence and knowledge, but more for perception and willpower. They retain their natural armor and ability to use multiple weapons, but they suffer major penalties when attempting to use technology of any kind. Their alert, stealthy manner is also depicted in this version, giving them advantages in certain situations. Myneyrshi begin with the ability to speak their native tongue and the Psadan language."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In sources expanding upon Myneyrsh history, doubt is cast in-universe on whether or not Joruus C'baoth actually killed the Guardian that controlled Wayland. Alternatively, the sources speculate that the two were one and the same. This ambiguity persists in materials released long after the original novels, appearing in C'baoth's Databank entry. The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia of 2008 objectively establishes that the Mount Tantiss settlement had been controlled by two, separate regimes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "MedStar I: Battle Surgeons, a 2004 novel by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry, includes a Myneyrsh offworld during the Clone Wars. At that time, Wayland's location had been removed from the registries for around 20,000 years, which creates continuity problems. As yet, no explanation has been given for how a Myneyrshi found himself offworld; why this offworlder wielded a blaster and drove a speeder, \"items of shame\" to his people; or why a Republic Admiral, Tarnese Bleyd, knew about the species and its aversion to technology. The latter issue does show that the authors depicted that Myneyrshi as aberrant intentionally, however. Bleyd's knowledge of the Myneyrshi, treated as casual, also stretches greatly the premise that Wayland was hidden at that time. The comic books Star Wars: Purge: The Tyrant's Fist by Alexander Freed, released in December 2012 and January 2013, depict several Myneyrshi offworld, all of whom accepted forms of weaponry more advanced than their ancestors. Further, one of these Myneyrshi is shown to be a well-known Jedi with knowledge of his homeworld and its culture, although his homeworld is not named. It is worth noting that there was a battle of the Mandalorian Wars fought in the Wayland system in 3963 BBY, which contains the planet of Wayland.
