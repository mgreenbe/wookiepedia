During his employment as head of security he at some point gained intelligence from several of his underworld sources that a gang called the Blank Look Gang were planning to steal something from the archives. Durgo approached a number of law abiding spacers and unofficially paid them to simply hang around the district near the archives as he didn't want to look like he was hiring mercenaries. The spacers successfully stopped the theft although the objects taken, a collection of antique Twi'lek pots was likely destroyed in the criminals attempt to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ket Durgo was a character in the saga edition Star Wars Roleplaying Game mini-adventure Art For Art's Sake and so the above biography assumes the adventure is completed as suggested in the article.
