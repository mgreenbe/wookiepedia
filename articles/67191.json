Of little interest to both Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, Darvannis was only defended by mercenary forces hired by the Hutt Cartel.

A factory was constructed on world that produced ships, weapons and Skytrooper droid forces for the Enernal Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Invasion of Darvannis is mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire in the codex entry obtained during Chapter 14: Mandalore the Avenger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
