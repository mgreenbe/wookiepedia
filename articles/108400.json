She was the leader of the White Worms, a group that took in young Corellians, their \"children,\" dubbing them \"scrumrats\" and giving them food and shelter in exchange for their participation in criminal activities on Lady Proxima's behalf.

Proxima became angry because of his failure, and she ordered Rebolt to hit Han with his staff. Han blocked and grabbed the staff from Rebolt and said that he would hit back if threatened. Moloch then pulled out his blaster and pointed it at Han. Qi'ra ran in front of Moloch's blaster and suggested not to shoot at Han. After this, Han then grabbed a rock, which he first used in a bluff, trying to convince everyone in the room that it was a thermal detonator. Proxima was not fooled, calling Han's bluff and prompting him to throw the rock through a window, bringing sunlight pouring into the chamber, onto Proxima's face. This move left the left side of her face burned for years, and it caused her to retreat into the water. Han then took Qi'ra, escaped the White Worms and ran outside the den to escape on his M-68 landspeeder. Moloch, Rebolt, and several other members of the White Worms chased after Han and Qi'ra. They were able to capture Qi'ra but failed to capture Han."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Reunion with Aphra"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Doctor Chelli Aphra traveled to Corellia and convinced her ex, Sana Starros, to arrange a meeting between her and Proxima under the pretense of an introduction.

While talking with Em-Five, Moloch recognized Solo. Moloch captured Han and Chewbacca and brought them to Proxima. Proxima told Han he would be punished for failing to deliver her the coaxium he had failed to give to her in 10 BBY, and for scarring her face by exposing her to sunlight when he fled her. While Han was communicating with Proxima, Chewbacca gave Han a thermal detonator, which he used to detonate the window above her, exposing her to sunlight again. The sunlight permanently burned the right side of Proxima's face, and left her blind in her right eye. Han and Chewbacca then escaped and left Corellia after taking fire from Moloch."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Meeting Bazine Netal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the Cold War, Bazine Netal arrived on Corellia to talk to Proxima about if she knew she had the location of the Millennium Falcon.

Screenwriter Jon Kasdan was the one who suggested casting Linda Hunt as Lady Proxima, having admired Hunt's haunting opening narration of Shelley Duvall's 1989 horror anthology TV show Nightmare Classics. Hunt had also worked previously with Kasdan in his 1985 Western film Silverado. During production of Solo, the character's name was Mother Proxima, but was changed to Lady Proxima late in production."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Proxima's design evolved through the development of Solo. In an interview with StarWars.com, creature concept designer Jake Lunt Davies revealed that the initial brief for the Den of the White Worms suggested Proxima's appearance, including the possibility of actually having tentacles underwater which might interconnect with her attendants. Though the creature effects concept team questioned whether Proxima was more like a worm or a serpent or whether she had scales or arms, they always designed her in a way she would be dominant over Han. Proxima's final design was produced by Ivan Manzella, but Davies designed her costume, comparing Proxima to Fagin, one of the antagonists in Charles Dickens' classic novel Oliver Twist, who also recruited children to give them food and shelter in exchange of performing criminal activities like pickpocketing.Proxima might also be based off Garris Shrike who debuted in the 1997 star wars legends novel The Paradise Snare and also took Han Solo as an orphan and forced him into a life of crime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
