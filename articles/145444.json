The then Vice Admiral Thrawn had, unfortunately for Zaarin, set the missile boats up as bait in a trap to capture Zaarin and destroy his task force. However, Thrawn in turn was thwarted by the fact that the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Whirlwind was stalled by a surprise ambush and thus the trap failed to pin down Zaarin. Yet Zaarin did not make good use of his advantage. His attempt to capture the missile boats failed and among the losses Zaarin suffered that day was the Thinin, destroyed in the engagement by the famous Imperial pilot Tan Maarek Stele."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
