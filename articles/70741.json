The Rebel battle strategy called for the base's Special Forces soldiers to be broken down into five companies, under the leadership of field commander Colonel Ledick Firest, to stall the Imperial invasion force long enough for base personnel and equipment to evacuate the planet. Allashane fought in the Rebels' defensive ice trenches against Imperial walkers and snowtroopers during the ensuing Battle of Hoth, which culminated in a tremendous Rebel defeat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jess Allashane was a veteran warrior of the Rebel Alliance's cause.

The Hoth Limited set linked Allashane with a production photo of a Hoth Rebel soldier extra from the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. However, it is unclear whether the extra\u2014and, by extension, Allashane\u2014appears on-screen in the film."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many in the online Star Wars fan community have credited American actor Treat Williams with Allashane's portrayal. Williams visited England's Elstree Studios during the 1979 filming of The Empire Strikes Back and was photographed in-costume on the Echo Base set with actress Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia Organa. However, the film's external Hoth scenes, which include the Allashane character production photo, were shot in Finse, Norway, concluding on March 11, 1979. Moreover, the extras hired to portray Rebel soldiers during the Battle of Hoth were local Norwegians, including several dozen mountain-rescue skiers. Filming at Elstree Studios did not begin until March 13, once the Norway shots were completed. Therefore, Williams' involvement in the film does not correspond to the Allashane character."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Norwegian author and television personality Arve Juritzen, who appeared in The Empire Strikes Back as a Rebel soldier extra during the Battle of Hoth scenes, has previously autographed the Jess Allashane SWCCG card for fans, suggesting that he, in fact, portrays the character in the card's picture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
