Upon entering 100 Imperial standard meters of the vessels and scanning the cargo, verifying their claim, they then allowed them through. The officer in charge of the checkpoint then congratulated Gamma 1 and suggested that Gamma 1 either return to the checkpoint or continue on."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just before Gamma 1 could make a decision, however, three freighters called Sunnida and two shuttles named Yagmar entered Imperial Space. Gamma 1 then inspected Sunnida's cargo, and discovered illicit material inside the freighters (specifically, Sunnida 1 contained narcotics, while Sunnida 2 and 3 both contained stimsticks). Gamma 1 was then ordered to back up the Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transport Epsilon 2 so the latter could board the smuggling freighters and take them into custody, with Gamma 1 doing so by draining their deflector shields. Likewise, the Yagmar shuttles, carrying smugglers, proceeded to attack Gamma 1 and the Imperials to stop the boarding, although Gamma 1 proceeded to shut them down. The head of the checkpoint congratulated Gamma 1 for the pilot's efforts in stopping a smuggling operation, and had the ships delivered to an Imperial storage yard to be impounded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly afterwards, however, six Rebel B-wings belonging to Red and Gold Squadrons proceeded to attack the checkpoint, with Gamma 1 being directed to eliminate them. Gamma 2 eventually entered in to provide backup.
