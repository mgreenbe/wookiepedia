Based on a very popular line of droids used by the Verpine Hives, the \"hatchling\" was a single minded, but highly useful droid. Much larger than average maintenance droids, the \"hatchling\" found its home in busy spaceports and shipyards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sporting the common insectile design scheme in use by the Roche company, this six-armed droid was the equivalent of a WED Treadwell in space. Though too large to be a benefit to most light freighter captains, larger ships were known to carry a few outfitted with blasters. These modified drones were sent out with the sole purpose of hunting mynocks feeding off the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "StarForge Station, a popular shadowport, was known to have three dozen of these droids in service, repairing ships and performing general maintenance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
