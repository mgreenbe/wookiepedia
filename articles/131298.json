There are 12 decks of 31 cards each featuring a major character and 1 or 2 minor characters. Players choose character sets and duel each other by rolling a die, moving their figures around the board and drawing and playing cards constituting \"actions\" each turn. The game is simple in design, but provides endless depths as no two duels are ever the same."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Duel Maps"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characters"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Vassal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vassal gaming engine has a gaming mod, or module, that allows you to play Star Wars: Epic Duels online in real time for free.
