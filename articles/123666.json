In 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars, Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps constructed the Malevolence\u2014a Subjugator-class heavy cruiser armed with two ion cannons capable of neutralizing the power of an enemy ship\u2014for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. After the defeat of a Republic task force in the Abregado system, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker devised a plan to stop the Confederate warship. Skywalker would lead Shadow Squadron, including Shadow Twelve, on a mission to destroy the Malevolence, which was on its way to the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, where 60,000 wounded clone troopers were being treated. The squadron would then destroy the bridge, killing the commander of the cruiser, General Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shadow Squadron, which had been joined by Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, and Jedi Master Plo Koon, departed from the Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute. Skywalker contacted all pilots, and after they had checked in with the Jedi General, the squadron jumped to hyperspace. Emerging at the Kaliida Nebula, Skywalker led Shadow Squadron to the Balmorra Run, a shortcut to the medical center. Skywalker was, however, unaware of the neebrays inhabiting the nebula. Evading the massive creatures, Shadow Twelve and the squadron made their way out from the nebula, arriving at the medical center just as the Malevolence emerged from hyperspace. The massive warship targeted the Republic group, launching an ion ray from one of its ion cannons. Five pilots were caught in the ion ray, but Shadow Twelve and the rest of the squadron continued toward the Malevolence. Due to the increasing laser fire, Tano and Koon advised Skywalker to abandon the original attack plan. Skywalker ordered Shadow Twelve and Shadow Squadron to fire their proton torpedoes at the starboard ion cannon, which was targeting the medical center. The squadron successfully managed to cripple the weapons, stopping the Malevolence from destroying the medical center."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone trooper with the call sign \"Shadow Twelve\" first appeared in \"Shadow of Malevolence,\" the third episode of the first season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, which aired on October 10, 2008.
