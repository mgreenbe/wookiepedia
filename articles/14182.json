The Skakoan scientist Kul Teska led CIS battles droids on an attack on the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems initiated the assault with a Munificent-class star frigate and Droch-class boarding ships. The boarding ships delivered battle droids, super battle droids, and droidekas. Kul Teska and chameleon droids also reached the station. Teska went to the communications center and the chameleon droids made their way to the station's reactor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Plo Koon were both in the station at the time and were quick to react. The two Jedi Generals moved through the facility, helping clone troops they came across. The Jedi eventually reached the station's hangar. There, Plo Koon ordered all the pilots to their ships. As the two cleared the hangar of droids, Kenobi contacted clone trooper commander CC-2224 on his comlink. Kenobi ordered the commander, nicknamed Cody, to divert power to the space station's shields. Cody took the order and informed General Kenobi of the droids near the reactor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cody lead a small group of clones to the generator room to reroute power to the shields. The group fought their way through many battle droids to the generator and sliced into several consoles to bring more power to the shields. Meanwhile, Kenobi and Koon went to the reactor. There they found and destroyed the chameleon droids to prevent them from further harming the reactor. After securing the reactor core, the Jedi traveled to the communications center. Kul Teska noticed them enter and ended his conversation with Separatist leader Count Dooku. The Jedi attempted to place Teska under arrest, but Teska was able to distract the two by detonating explosives placed throughout the space station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the detonations rocked the station, Kenobi ordered Cody to get to the escape pods. Cody complied and made sure several other clone troopers made it to escape pods first. However, the last pod Cody tried to launch was unable to leave on its own. A clone called Switch stayed behind on the station to launch the pod manually."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plo Koon and Obi-Wan Kenobi eventually cornered Teska in a windowed room. In the ensuing skirmish, Teska used chameleon droids to get an edge on the Jedi, but it to no avail. The Jedi managed to get the Skakoan through an open window and seal it back up at the cost of both their lightsabers. Kenobi and Koon remained trapped in the chamber. Teska, however, survived the vacuum of space and traveled to Ryloth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Kit Fisto later arrived with reinforcements on a rescue mission. After fighting their way through the station and rescuing Switch, they arrived at the control room, while clone trooper commanders Ponds and Cody searched the outer walls of the space station for remaining droids and found Plo Koon's and Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsabers floating in space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
