Most members of the Brotherhood were clad in heavy vermilion robes and cowls to represent a physical vow of silence, a counter to their natural physical expressiveness. Some followers carried staff-mounted censers filled with burning Qatameric incense that permeated through their heavy fabrics and masked their natural scent. In-keeping with the faith's concealment of individuality, some members went so far as to strip themselves of their own names, such as the High Priest, who was referred to by his followers only by a keening wail of a specific pitch. Some members, such as leaders of a congregation, wore Blue Gowns of the Sullen Moon and Lorrdian Cowls of Quiescence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of the Brotherhood of Beatific Countenance often went on religious pilgrimages to worlds of spiritual significance, such as the Mid Rim desert moon of Jedha.
