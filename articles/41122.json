Dubrillion would duly become a world of the Galactic Empire after the Clone Wars; when that government fell, entrepreneur Lando Calrissian would take over the planet and serve as its administrator. There was an asteroid belt situated near the planet, which was used by Calrissian as the basis for a large operation a while after the Empire's end. In addition, Dubrillion hosted many luxury suites and massive, high-rise cities. Leia Organa Solo was its ambassador for a short time. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the planet was attacked and eventually conquered by the invading Yuuzhan Vong. Following the Yuuzhan Vong's defeat, Dubrillion later became a world of the Fel Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Old Republic era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the decades before the Great Galactic War, the planet was ruled by the Drayen family, a dynasty of war heroes who took their position as Dubrillion's rulers through treachery. Their reign lasted until King Arak Drayen III was overthrown by the nobility of the planet. However, the Drayens managed to keep the crown out of their usurper's hands. The Drayens went into exile as the usurper kings hounded them and the crown. It wasn't until the Cold War did the smuggler known as the Voidhound, under the direction of the pirate lord, Nok Drayen and his daughter Risha, locate the crown. Risha then set off on the task of reclaiming the throne of Dubrillion, but sought to do so honorably. She managed to find a sympathetic count amongst Dubrillion's aristocracy, but this soon set off a civil war dividing the aristocracy between supporting Risha and the current king, Actavarus III. During the same time, the planet was afflicted by a famine and was forced to purchase foodstuffs for the starving people. Dubrillion was eventually sacked by Empress Vaylin's Eternal Fleet during the revolt against the Eternal Empire. The planet was devastated, forcing the King to flee the planet with his nobles."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the onset of the Clone Wars, Dubrillion was located within Separatist space, though its resident sector of space was contested between both the CIS and the Galactic Republic.

The world hosted a factory and testing facility for new weapons in the midst of the Dubrillion Ocean, including a prototype laser for the second Death Star. It was destroyed in 3 ABY by Rogue Squadron, with the help of defected Imperial General Crix Madine, after several Rebel ships passing the planet were destroyed by a beam fired from Dubrillion. The superlaser facility was subsequently rendered inoperable by the Rebel forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the fall of the Empire at the Battle of Endor, the area of Oversector Outer that Dubrillion was located in was reformed by Moff Ardus Kaine into the Pentastar Alignment, and Dubrillion became one of its member worlds."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post-Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War in 25 ABY, Dubrillion, now under the flag of the New Republic, was the site of Lando's Folly, an asteroid assault course that contestants ran using TIE Advanced x1 starfighters.

Despite an initial assault on Dubrillion failing against New Republic defenses, the Yuuzhan Vong set up a base camp in the nearby asteroid field and, for two months, attacked ships traveling to and from Dubrillion, and sent coralskipper squadrons to wreak havoc on the planet's surface, slowly wearing down Administrator Calrissian's defenses. When the New Republic arrived to help evacuate the planet, the Yuuzhan Vong emerged from the asteroid field, destroying countless ships carrying refugees and invading Dubrillion proper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the New Republic forces had retreated to Dantooine, the Yuuzhan Vong concentrated on subjugating the remaining populace of Dubrillion. Despite earlier ferocity shown by the coralskipper attacks, most of Dubrillion's surface was left in a recognizable state. Shedao Shai oversaw the conquest of Dubrillion, and chose the planet as the main base for the Yuuzhan Vong in the Outer Rim. The remaining citizens that had been unable to flee attempted to resist the invasion, but were eventually found and killed by Chazrach warriors sent in by Shai to rout resistance holdouts. Others were enslaved to help future terraforming projects on the planet. A major landmark, the Dubrillion Aquarium, was left intact by the invaders\u2014a rare mercy owing to its vast collection of galactic marine specimens, which appealed to the Yuuzhan Vong's reverence of natural life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the later stages of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Dubrillion, as purported to Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane by prominent Yuuzhan Vong priests, was a site affected by a particularly powerful uprising of the Jeedai heresy that would help unseat the Vong hold on the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yuuzhan Vong forces from Dubrillion under the leadership of Commander B'shith Vorrik later attacked the Imperial Remnant in 29 ABY; these forces launched an attack on Bastion and another at Bescane."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 137 ABY, Dubrillion was located in a region under the control of the Fel Empire, and remained loyal to the subsequent Empire-in-exile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dubrillion, along with its sister world Destrillion, was first introduced in 1999 in The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime by R.
