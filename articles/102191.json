Ovech had served under Moff Broysc along with Lieutenant Malavai Quinn and had a high opinion of him, until Broysc arranged Quinn's reassignment to Balmorra. By the time of the Galactic War Quinn was serving the Emperor's Wrath and traveling aboard the Fury-class Imperial interceptor, when he registered an emergency transmission from Ovech. By the time his call was answered Ovech had given up all hope and was glad to see a familiar face in Quinn. Ovech explained that Moff Broysc had sent him and the other officers to a supposedly secret warehouse on Cato Neimoidia, where they found an ambush waiting for them. As transmission broke, Quinn immediately launched a rescue operation, which was a huge success and resulted in saving the lives of Ovech and the majority of other officers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
