In the game Star Wars: Battlefront II, he can be seen alone in the torture chamber with a leg almost torn off. Its vocabulator is not the same as the one on a 2-1B surgical droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
