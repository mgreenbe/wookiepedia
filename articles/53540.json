He harbored a paranoid resentment towards Captain Voba Dokrett of the cruiser Gorath, a larger, newer and faster ship which he saw as eclipsing his own command's success. He also carried a neural whip inside his tunic, which he used to impress his opinions on his subordinates. Nevertheless, Gegak's bullying bluster seems to have coexisted with a basic awareness of the realities of power within in the Prakith navy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike Captain Dokrett and the Gorath, Gegak and his ship survived the Prakith navy's encounter with the Teljkon Vagabond in 17 ABY\u2014perhaps ironically, because the destroyer's ill-maintained sensors could not track the alien ship effectively.
