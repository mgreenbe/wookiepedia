In 34 ABY, he and his sister escaped their homeworld of Tehar after First Order forces led by Kylo Ren massacred their village. Kel and Eila fled to the Colossus platform on the planet Castilon.

The siblings were the only survivors. When the First Order discovered there were survivors, they sought to hunt down and kill Kel and Eila, posting a 20,000 credit bounty on their heads."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the siblings came to the Colossus platform on Castilon, where Kel stole some food for them from an Ugnaught vendor, and as a result they were forced to flee the marketplace, bowling over Kazuda Xiono, Neeku Vozo and BB-8 on their way out. Xiono, secretly a Resistance spy, had heard of the bounty on the siblings' heads and, not knowing who placed it, was trying to find the children as he needed the money. Kel angrily refused Xiono's help, and he and his sister ran off. He lost a wooden charm attached to his wristband in the process, which Xiono picked up and later gave to Captain Imanuel Doza."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While they were hiding in the service ducts, Kel and Eila were tracked down by the Chelidae who worked as the platform's engineers, who had been asked to do so by Vozo. When he met Xiono again in the engineering room, Kel explained that, contrary to the bounty report, he and his sister were runaways, not missing, because they didn't have a home to go back to. When Xiono realized they were running from the First Order, he promised to help them get away safely. Kel was accompanied by Xiono, Vozo and BB-8 when they went back to the marketplace to pick up some herbs to help with Eila's broken leg."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, some First Order troops led by Commander Pyre had come to search for them, and they were seen, resulting in a chase back to engineering. There, Xiono came up with a plan to help the siblings fake their deaths. Kel and Eila, cornered by Pyre and his troopers, made it look like they jumped into the ocean rather than allow themselves to be captured, with two Chelidae jumping in their place, and then slowing down their vital signs.

And when he and Eila caught Vozo's loose pet Bibo after he got loose, the siblings were aware that the pet was connected to the danger. They informed Vozo and Tamara Ryvora of the danger when they came down to engineering to retrieve the animal, confirming the statement when the roar of Bibo's mother, a full-grown rokkna, was heard."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The unconscious stormtrooper"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the First Order occupied the Colossus, Kel and his sister were fishing for snarlfish on the underside of the platform when their laughter was overheard by a patrolling stormtrooper, CS-515. Kel claimed that the two children had lost their identification, so CS-515 attempted to take them away, grabbing Eila by the wrist. Kel and Eila fought him, eventually knocking him unconscious. Aware that this could lead to trouble, they decided to go to Xiono for help. Although it was dangerous for them to be on the platform's upper levels, they went to Jarek Yeager's Repair Station, where Xiono and Jarek Yeager were eating lunch with Vozo and Ryvora. When Kel and Eila asked for help, Xiono called for Vozo and BB-8 to come along. Xiono tried to talk Ryvora out of coming because she hadn't listened to his warnings about the First Order, but she insisted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kel and Eila led the Team Fireball members to where they had stashed the unconscious trooper in a closet, which prompted panic, as Xiono was concerned he could wake up and kill them all, while Ryvora thought they should turn themselves in. When CS-515 began to come to, Vozo knocked him out again with a wrench. Xiono made it clear they had to move CS-515 before other First Order personnel discovered him, and the group hauled him off to engineering. Kel and Eila stayed downstairs while Xiono hit upon the idea of impersonating the trooper both so that his absence wouldn't be missed and to ascertain if the trooper had reported the children's presence. While Xiono was upstairs, Ryvora panicked about Xiono's actions, and Kel and Eila called her out for trusting the First Order's word more than that of her friends, who were telling her about the Order's untrustworthiness. Ryvora was shocked when the siblings told her about why they had fled Tehar. When CS-515 woke up, groggy, Kel and Eila initially hid with Ryvora while Vozo dealt with the trooper. When he panicked upon seeing a Chelidae, Eila managed to calm him down, before Vozo shocked him unconscious again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That evening, when Xiono contacted them and asked them to meet him with the unconscious CS-515, as Xiono was fleeing from the First Order after giving the stormtroopers the impression that \"CS-515\"'s mental conditioning was faulty, Kel, Eila, Ryvora, Vozo, and BB-8 carried the unconscious trooper through the halls. When they encountered Namua, Ryvora told him that the unconscious man was sick and they were taking him to the medcenter. They hid in the maintenance ducts underneath the floor before Xiono arrived, and stayed there as CS-515 was dressed back up in his armor and propped up to be recovered by the other stormtroopers. Afterwards, Xiono told Kel and Eila they were safe for now as the trooper hadn't reported them, but that things were going to get much worse on the Colossus."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sinking the Colossus"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kel and his sister Eila were present when the Chelidae picked up Xiono, Yeager, Vozo, and CB-23.
