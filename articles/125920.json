After losing his last slicer to his pet rancor, the Hutt crime lord had been searching for a replacement. One suitable prospect was a Human male criminal named Sirad Far. According to Jabba's Twi'lek majordomo Bib Fortuna, Sirad Far was one of the best slicers on Tatooine. Jabba wanted Sirad in his pocket, but to accomplish that, Jabba needed to help eliminate the slicer's rivals. Ree-Yees ultimately tasked this responsibility to the spacer attempting to curry favor with Jabba. In exchange for a credit reward, the spacer embarked to eliminate Raf Daris, a rival of Sirad's who worked as a thief for the Valarian gang, an organization led by the Whiphid crime boss known as Lady Valarian. The Valarian's also happened to be one of the greatest threats to Jabba's power on Tatooine. Despite being ambushed by three additional Valarian thieves attempting to defend Raf Daris, the spacer succeeded in killing all four of the rival gang members. Accomplishing this goal earned Sirad's loyalty, and indebted him to Jabba's criminal empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Transponder Delivery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a vessel crashed in the dunes near Jabba's Palace, Ree-Yees tasked the spacer who had helped him before with recovering its transponder. At first, Ree-Yees did not care to reveal why Jabba wanted the transponder. Nevertheless, as soon as it was recovered, he tasked the spacer, who he derogatively referred to as a \"worrt\", with delivering it to Sirad Far. Ree-Yees eventually revealed that the ship that crashed near the palace met the same specifications as Jabba's own personal starship. Ree-Yees surmised that Jabba wanted the transponder hooked up on his ship, so that he could transmit a false identity whenever he wanted. However, to accomplish that, Ree-Yees required prompt delivery of the transponder package to Sirad. Despite being ambushed by thugs along the way, the spacer managed to rendezvous with Sirad at a scheduled meeting area near Jabba's Palace. Sirad Far offered his assurances that the transponder would meet Jabba's expectations."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Lady Valarian's Ledger"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ree-Yees commended the spacer for the successful completion of the \"Sirad Far deal,\" as he called it. For their part in the deal, the spacer was awarded a piece of Mabari armorweave. However, this would not be the last time Sirad Far found himself involved with Jabba's criminal enterprise. Another member of Jabba's court, a Chevin by the name of Ephant Mon, found himself in possession of a ledger stolen from a courier working for Jabba's rival, Lady Valarian. The ledger contained financial information from Valarian's compound, which Ephant Mon believed could be used to ruin her. Unfortunately for Jabba and his ilk however, the ledger was written in code using an obscure form of a language known as Old Drall. No one in Jabba's Palace knew how to read it, but Sirad Far was on Jabba's payroll, and had the expertise needed to read the ledger for the Hutt crime lord. Because Jabba had been very helpful to Sirad in eliminating some of his problematic rivals, he was more than willing to return the favor. However, delivering the ledger to Sirad was a dangerous prospect. According to Jabba's spies, Lady Valarian was enraged by its theft. To halt any attempt to decode the ledger's information, a Valarian assassin was dispatched to kill the spacer. However, this last ditch effort was an exercise in futility. The spacer managed to kill the Valarian gang member, before locating Sirad Far to hand over the ledger. Fortunately for Jabba, Sirad's skills lived up to his expectations, and he made quick work of decoding the sensitive information. The pleased Ephant Mon gifted the spacer responsible for delivering the ledger one of two paintings, including either an advertisement depicting the Pa'lowick Sy Snootles, or a Portrait of a Twi'lek Female."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sirad Far had fair skin, brown eyes, and gray colored hair with brown eyebrows. He possessed at least some skill in unarmed combat. Highly intelligent, Bib Fortuna considered him to be one of the best slicers on the entire planet of Tatooine. Aside from his fluency in Galactic Basic Standard, Sirad Far also had an understanding of computer code and a working knowledge of an obscure form of Old Drall, a language which the Valarian gang had used in their secretive ledger. Sirad had a chipper demeanor, but he could at times be ruthless. He relied on Jabba to eliminate his troublesome rivals, a deed for which he remained greatly thankful. Owing a debt to Jabba thereafter, Sirad remained on Jabba's payroll, and was readily willing to aid the crime lord whenever the need arose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sirad Far was unarmed.

He was included in three quests of the original Jabba's Theme Park in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine. In the first quest given by Ree-Yees, players had to kill a rival of Sirad's named Raf Daris. Completing that quest would earn the player 250 credits. In the third quest given by Ree-Yees, players had to deliver a broken instrument calibrator to Sirad Far. Completing that quest would earn the player 50 faction points in favor of Jabba, and a piece of Mabari Armorweave, including either a chest plate, helmet, or pants. In the third quest for Ephant Mon, players had to yet again meet up with Sirad Far, this time to deliver a ledger.
