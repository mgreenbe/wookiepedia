In 19 BBY, when the Separatists invaded the Coruscant system, the Impavid was orbiting the capitol planet when it was hit by a Separatist cruiser exiting hyperspace. Seeing the collision, General Saesee Tiin flew aboard the Impavid in his personal starfighter where he was informed by the Impavid's clone commander that the Star Destroyer was too heavily damaged to continue fighting. Taking command of the Impavid, General Tiin ordered the destroyer to pass over the Separatist Providence-class carrier Prosperous.

In 19 BBY, towards the very end of the war, the Confederacy launched a full-scale attack on the Coruscant system, catching the Republic unprepared. The Impavid itself was in orbit over Coruscant when the battle started, with dozens of Separatist cruisers and warships exiting hyperspace around the Star Destroyer. However, there were too many Separatists ships around the Impavid for the destroyer to avoid, and the Impavid was hit on its port side by a Confederate Providence-class carrier/destroyer leaving hyperspace.
