Originally Republic Sienar Systems, Santhe/Sienar Technologies provided numerous starships for the Galactic Republic for many millennia. A short lived subsidiary, Sienar Design Systems, produced the Sith Infiltrator. Though they denied any involvement in the ship's design, SDS was forced to shut down due to intense scrutiny from the Senate.

The Emperor quickly revived the company as Sienar Fleet Systems and placed it under the control of Raith Sienar. SFS quickly became one of the largest and most prolific Imperial manufacturers. Its chief rivals for Imperial military contracts were Kuat Drive Yards and Corellian Engineering Corporation. Later, Sienar would form his Advanced Projects Laboratory (whose purpose was very similar to SDS). This firm is responsible for Darth Vader's TIE Advanced x1. Sienar was the CEO for many years of SFS, but was killed in an assassination."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lady Valles Santhe of the Santhes took direct control of the company, following the assassination of Raith Sienar, and operated it after the collapse of the Empire.
