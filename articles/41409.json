It contained several hollowed out trees which served as the homes for the Duloks as well as a main plaza centered that served as a meeting area and fire pit on cold nights. The Duloks would conduct dances and celebrations in the main plaza while Gorneesh sat on his throne surrounded by Dulok guards. The swamp also served as a staging point for periodic raids on the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village.
