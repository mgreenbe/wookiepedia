It stars Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker escaping from bounty hunters in Death Canyon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Death Canyon, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi impatiently watches as Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker patches up an old VXL speeder. There is a squad of bounty hunters chasing after them and only one way out of the canyon, a path that the hunters have closed off. Skywalker zooms the speeder out of the garage and Kenobi hops on, skeptical of his former Padawan's modifications but soon hanging on for his life as the VXL blasts off. Unfortunately, Skywalker informs him that they could not slow down even if they wanted to, and this proves troublesome when a harpoon is stuck into the speeder. Rather than stop it, the harpoon gun itself is pulled out of the ground, forcing Kenobi to jump onto the top of the speeder and dispatch the bounty hunter trailing behind it. The two Jedi next face two rows of bounty hunters on each side of them, some with rocket launchers and some with blasters. As Kenobi deflects the bolts, Skywalker takes both lightsabers and hooks them up to the power core, giving the speeder a moment of sonic speed and allowing it to jet to safety, to the Republic headquarters where Grand Master Yoda awaits. The old Master remarks on how good the speeder looks, and Kenobi groans as Skywalker quips \"once a classic, always a classic\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
