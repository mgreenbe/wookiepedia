They appeared similar to Gamorreans, though had paler skin. The Orincans had a dislike for the Mizi, another sentient species from the same region. An Orincan starship was one of several vessels that became stranded on the Amaxine station when hyperspace travel was limited after the Great Hyperspace Disaster.
