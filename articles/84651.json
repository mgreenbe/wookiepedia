Even nearly thirty years after commission, the Dawn of Tranquility, in service with the Resistance under the name Raddus, was still able to outrun the First Order's modern battlecruisers and the massive Supremacy. Propelled by eleven sublight ion engines of different sizes, these massive ships were as fuel hungry as they were fast."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Offensive and defensive systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While undergunned for a typical ship of its size, featuring only a few dozen heavy turbolasers, heavy ion cannons, and point-defense laser cannon turrets in total as well as half a dozen proton torpedo launchers, the MC85 compensated for this with highly durable advanced deflector shields. These experimental shields that cocooned the ship were capable of repelling huge amounts of damage before failing, far more than most other ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One ship, the Raddus, served as the flagship of the Resistance navy, and was crucial in the evacuation of D'Qar.
