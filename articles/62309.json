One of Rectonia's lasting contributions to the Order was the transcription of the Jedi Code in its classical form. Consisting of five precepts, the Code would be modified and altered over the millennia; however, following the Ruusan Reformation of 1000 BBY, Rectonia's original work was restored by Jedi Grand Master Fae Coven in The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, a Jedi trainee guidebook that was still in use during the Clone Wars almost a millennium later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Homonix Rectonia was first mentioned in The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, a reference book written by Daniel Wallace and published in 2010.
