Despite this, he openly endorsed the explosive destruction of a TIE/ln space superiority starfighter at the hands of the Mandalorian Sabine Wren, a member of the rebel Spectres group, which occurred after Tsoklo observed a Stormtrooper commander roughly remove another Lothal citizen from a restricted area in Capital City. Tsoklo later bumped into one of Wren's comrades, the Lasat Honor Guardsman Garazeb Orrelios, shortly before Orrelios destroyed a TIE fighter of his own. Later yet, Tsoklo was nearly ran over by the Lothal street urchin Ezra Bridger, who was piloting a stolen 614-AvA speeder bike while on the run from Orrelios and Jedi-in-exile Kanan Jarrus.

Bridger suggested buying the fruit from the first buyer, but Tsoklo pointed out that the fruit was in the Empire's possession. He bid them luck anyways.

Tseebo was an Imperial Information Office worker who had deserted after downloading numerous Imperial files onto his AJ^6 cyborg construct. Sometime before the Empire Day parade, Tsoklo had gone to a Lothal outpost known as Jhothal, and visited Old Jho's Pit Stop, a bar and eatery that was run by the Ithorian bartender Old Jho. Also visiting were Jarrus and the other rebels Tsoklo had encountered, who were looking for work and information on the heightened Imperial presence. Meanwhile, a trio of TIE fighter pilots entered the establishment and promptly apprehended Tsoklo while the Rodian was enjoying a cup of spicebrew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One pilot compared Tsoklo to a portrait of Tseebo, and once satisfied that Tsoklo was not their target, the pilots released the frightened Rodian before they harassed Old Jho, who had refused to air an Imperial broadcast in his cantina. Jho eventually complied, and one TIE pilot ordered Tsoklo and the other patrons to raise a toast to Emperor Sheev Palpatine, while holding them at gunpoint. The broadcast, however, was almost immediately hacked by the supposed senator-in-exile Gall Trayvis, who delivered a message of hope to other rebels. Tsoklo and the others watched the broadcast as the pilots angrily told Jho to turn it off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tsoklo later returned to Capital City to watch the Empire Day parade, which was showcasing a new kind of TIE fighter. While watching the parade, which consisted of various stormtrooper platoons and AT-DP walkers, Tsoklo was apprehended again by Imperials, this time the Imperial Security Bureau agent Kallus and several stormtroopers. Like the TIE pilots, Kallus compared Tsoklo to a picture of Tseebo. Kallus realized the Rodians were not the same, however, and reminded Tsoklo to enjoy the festivities. Although shaken, Tsoklo cheered when Wren and Orrelios launched fireworks into the nighttime sky, which appeared to be a part of the celebrations. Moments later, the rebels struck and destroyed the new TIE fighter, sending the citizens of Capital City scattering for cover."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A game of sabacc"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, Tsoklo returned to Old Jho's Pit Stop where he participated in a game of sabacc, a kind of card game.

As the game progressed, Calrissian ended up controlling the game, and Tsoklo found himself out of money to bet, forcing him to fold his last hand and leave the table in a fit of anger. Through the use of an Idiot's Array hand of cards, Calrissian ultimately won the card game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tsoklo later witnessed Orrelios' comrades evade Imperial patrols on speeder bikes, and witnessed Orrelios himself hijack an AT-DP walker alongside Bridger."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Siege of Lothal"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Enslaved by the Mining Guild"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the continued escapades of Orrelios and his rebel friends, the Empire eventually launched a full planetary blockade of Lothal.

Tsoklo was walking the streets of Capitol City when the Rebels, who had previously left Lothal, returned to the planet when they attempted to rescue Tua, who decided to defect from the Empire. The rescue attempt failed, and the Rebels' speeder was shot down and landed in the streets, nearly crushing Tsoklo and several other citizens. Tsoklo, mouth agape, watched as the Rebels evacuated their damaged craft and ran into the city's alleys."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, Tsoklo visited the planet Nixus, and was present at Nixus Hub 218 when Bridger and the pirate Hondo Ohnaka tried to conduct business with the kingpin Azmorigan.

Alongside several others, Tsoklo was eventually imprisoned by the Empire, and was forced into slavery under the Mining Guild, who was in charge of strip-mining Lothal of its resources.

Initially believing Jarrus to be with the Mining Guild, Tsoklo and the other slaves took cover when Jarrus drew his blaster pistol. When Jarrus revealed his true intentions, the slaves cautiously revealed themselves to the Jedi. Vizago thanked Jarrus for what he believed was a rescue effort moments before he was attacked by Proach. Orrelios joined the skirmish, and the fight eventually led outside of the boiler room. Tsoklo and the others followed the battle and cheered when Orrelios defeated Proach after a heated brawl."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, an Imperial patrol intercepted the crawler, forcing Vizago and Orrelios to act as captain and foreman, respectively. In order to keep up appearances, Orrelios had Tsoklo and the others return to work.

In addition, he was harassed by Imperial authorities during their hunt for Tseebo, which left him visibly shaken after each encounter. However, after his confrontation with Kallus, his mood was lifted after a series of fireworks lit up the Imperial parade on Empire Day, which also caused him to smile and applaud."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After losing a game of Sabacc to Calrissian and Orrelios, Tsoklo was visibly distraught, and after throwing his cards onto the table, he stormed off. When Bridger and Orrelios realized they would have to obtain a meiloorun fruit from the Empire, Tsoklo laughed at the possibility of them simply buying one of the fruits, but he wished them luck anyways."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tsoklo was a braggart and a bully, and tended to harass others with the fact he had an Imperial friend. However, Tsoklo's relationship with Supply Master Lyste was merely a mean of protecting himself.

He could also resort to a panicked flail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tsoklo's fear also peaked while enslaved by the Mining Guild. Upon believing the Jedi Jarrus to be a Mining Guild agent, Tsoklo cowered behind equipment in Crawler 413-24's boiler room and armed himself with a tool.

In the encounter, Tsoklo's constant bullying of his neighbors caused them to report to Lyste on their own, telling him that Tsoklo had been hoarding grain, which Tsoklo planned to sell on a black market. Lyste orders a surprise inspection of Tsoklo's home, discovers the grain, and then proceeds to arrest the Rodian. Although Tsoklo draws a utility vibroblade, he ultimately surrenders and pleads for mercy, only to find that the Empire does not have any. The book ranks Tsoklo high in agility, but low in courage. The match-ups presented in this book are purely theoretical."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
