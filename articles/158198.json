Designed to operate in large cities, the Urban Navigator was capable of operating at higher altitudes than many similar models. A sidecar allowed for a passenger, though this cut down on its maneuverability."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zayne Carrick's swoop was of this model. When Zayne finally caught his quarry, Marn Hierogryph, he had the Snivvian handcuffed to his passenger side and headed straight for the Jedi Tower for the Knighting ceremony instead of the authorities. Zayne quickly got to his swoop after his Masters killed his friends, but Raana Tey sliced the passenger compartment from the drive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taris Sector Constable Noana Sowrs also owned one until it was stolen by Brejik of the Hidden Beks swoop gang.
