It consists of 162 cards (81 Dark Side and 81 Light Side cards) and was introduced in November 1996. This set consists of 54 rare, 54 uncommon, and 54 common cards. This set introduced many of the classic characters from Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back that were involved with the Battle of Hoth. A complete list of the Hoth Limited set can be found on the players committee's page."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because this is an expansion set, it bears an expansion-set symbol, which is located near the top right corner of the card to the right of the lore and below the destiny number. The symbol for this set is the planet Hoth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This set was sold in 15-card expansion packs and 36-pack expansion boxes. Each pack include one rare card, four uncommon cards, and ten common cards. Although starter decks were never produced for this set, an The Empire Strikes Back Introductory Two-Player Game featuring cards from the Hoth expansion was released shortly after. The set went out of print in September of 1998 when the Hoth Revised Unlimited set came out (an almost identical set with some minor revisions to game text and with white borders instead of black). A Japanese-text set was released for this expansion set in Japan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Card List"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dark Side"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Light Side"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
