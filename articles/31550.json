The Clawdite Tunga Arpagion, who was impersonating Imperial Moff Tan Hubi, was offered crisped inferno weed by Queen Trios. Hubi thanked Trios for the food and ate it. While Queen Trios and Regent Urtya walked away, Urtya noted that the last time he offered the Moff the food, he spat it out. As Trios and Urtya returned to their seats, they came to the conclusion that Hubi had come to enjoy the acquired taste of the food. Crisped inferno weed was brown in color and had an acquired taste. It could be eaten by both humans and Clawdites."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crisped inferno weed appeared in the comic Star Wars 47, which was released on May 2, 2018 and written by Kieron Gillen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
