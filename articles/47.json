Leech brought it with him while trying to reclaim money owed to him by Han Solo, owner of the Baleen-class heavy freighter Eravana. He then used the weapon to defend himself from rathtars that attacked him and his men onboard Solo's vessel."

Its barrel was equipped with oversized amplifiers that increased the charge of blaster bolts within the barrel. A tusk belonging to a member of the planet Orto Plutonia's narglatch species was converted into a vibro-spike attached to the end of the \"Huttsplitter's\" barrel."

As with all of Kanjiklub's weapons, the \"Huttsplitter\" was maintained and upgraded by Leech's lieutenant and tech-expert Razoo Qin-Fee. Its name referred to the sentient Hutt species, who had controlled Leech's homeworld of Nar Kanji and enslaved its people before being overthrown in a revolt by the human colonists."

Onboard, he and his men were attacked by the rathtars and Leech managed to discourage one of the beasts from chasing him by firing upon it with the \"Huttsplitter\" before fleeing."

It then appeared in the film itself when it was released on December 18 later that year, and was further identified and detailed in the reference book Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released alongside Episode VII."
