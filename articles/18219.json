The hangar complex was protected by two massive blast doors. The Bloodstar was armed with at least ten cannons of various sizes and was propelled by one massive thruster at the stern.

When Boba Fett sought the bounty on Bar-Kooda, he enlisted the aid of Wim Magwit to infiltrate the ship and capture Bar-Kooda. Fett escaped aboard an escape pod he had used to board the ship and fought his way out of the docking bay\u2014using concussion missiles to blast open the hangar doors. As Fett and Magwit escaped, dozens of Bar-Kooda's men were sucked out into the vacuum and perished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
