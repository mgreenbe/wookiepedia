They moved around the desert, and ate plants and smaller animals. A slow-acting poison coated their claws and shell, used both to disable prey and to discourage predators. With medical treatment, the poison was generally non-fatal for Humans. The Sevari often hunted them, both for their nutritious meat, and for their large water sacs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During summer months, the crabs would bury themselves in the sand to avoid the intense heat. This made the spiky shells a hidden hazard for unwary animals and traveling beings. However, the hitcher crabs also had substantially reduced body functions, and were more vulnerable to hunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the mating season, a male and female crab would mate and form a pack. After three weeks of gestation, the female would lay four to eight eggs, which would hatch in nine months. After that, the female newborns would depart and be raised with the mother, while the father raised the males."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hitcher crabs became full-grown adults at 15 standard years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
