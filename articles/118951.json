The skin on their vines was highly resistant to lacerations, even from the blade of a lightsaber. Saava plants would slowly creep towards their prey by extending their vines until they were within reach of their target, but would quickly retract if they sensed potential danger despite their incredible durability. Upon contact with a potential host, they would latch onto and attach themselves to their still-living prey, which could supply them with nutrients for months or even years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY,[source?] during their mission to Kashyyyk, Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis and BD-1 encountered saava while travelling through the Kashyyykian Shadowlands in his search for Tarrful.
