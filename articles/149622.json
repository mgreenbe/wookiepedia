The creature's physiology links it to the wampa, to which it appeared to be a distant cousin. Despite its carnivorous urges, the beast did not prove to be a cunning hunter, and trompas randomly attacked whatever creature happened to be closest. The trompa was a very solitary creature, and was mildly intelligent, despite its hunting habits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
