It was there that Dooku and Moralo Eval invited several bounty hunters; Cad Bane, Bulduga, Derrown, Embo, Jakoli, Obi-Wan Kenobi (disguised as Rako Hardeen), Mantu, Onca, Sinrich, Sixtat, Kiera Swan, and Twazzi. Together, they would see who would survive the tournament. Only five survived the Box: Bane, Derrown, Embo, Hardeen and Twazzi, while the rest were killed. Dooku urged Hardeen to finish off Eval after he had beaten him in a fight, but Hardeen spared his life and said he was just there to do his job and get paid. The five who survived would work with Bane as part of his group along with Eval. Together, they would attempt to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
