Sometime after 3673 BBY, a Republic force under the command of Alderaanian General Bouris Ulgo engaged a battle group led the Imperial Moff Ceptor. Ceptor and the Imperial force were defeated when Ulgo himself performed a boarding action on the Moff's battle cruiser, thereby securing victory for the Republic. Years later, during the Alderaan Civil War, General-turned-King Bouris Ulgo believed that his heroism during the Battle of Rordak exempted him from Republic scrutiny in the bloody conflict on his homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Rordak's first and only appearance in Star Wars Legends thus far was a brief mention in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a LucasArts/BioWare massively multiplayer online role-playing video game released in 2011.
