But after Brejik and his followers took over, the gang was transformed into a group of violent thugs and the original Vulkars were demoted and ridiculed. This specific Twi'lek went from being one of the highest ranking members to a mere guard in a back room.

After a very brief skirmish, the gang member quickly surrendered and expressed his disgust with Brejik's rule of the gang. After telling Revan about the base's security systems, Revan spared the Twi'lek, allowing him to leave the gang for good."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The player can ask the Twi'lek about Bastila Shan and the prototype accelerator.
