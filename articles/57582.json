It was built by Baktoid Armor Workshop and, like many Separatist vehicles, the GAT was piloted by an integrated droid brain. While it was capable of performing a variety of tasks, the GAT excelled as a reconnaissance and fast-attack craft, due to its light armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The GAT received heavy use early on in the Clone Wars, especially in the Dark Reaper Crisis, serving alongside the larger Armored Assault Tank. It had light armor, and its high speed made it excellent for hit and run attacks. It was often used in conjunction with the Single Trooper Aerial Platform. They were deployed during the Battle of Tirahnn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, as the Clone Wars dragged on, the GAT fell prey to newer Republic vehicles. Individually, it was too lightly-armored to stand up to later AT-XTs and Saber-class tanks, and individually was not heavily armed enough to destroy them. Also, the GAT became unnecessary as the LM-432 crab droid and tri-droid became widely used, rendering the light tank droid obsolete. They were presumably being phased out of service by the time of the Mission to Mustafar.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the execution of the Separatist Council by Darth Sidious's new apprentice, Darth Vader, these units were de-activated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
