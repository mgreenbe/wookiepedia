Nyss Nenn infiltrated the ship, killing Runner and Hunter, and captured Khedryn Faal, demanding Jaden Korr to exit into space in a hardsuit and trade himself in for Faal. However, aboard the supply ship, Faal helped Soldier to defeat Nenn and retake control of the ship. Faal and Nenn then escaped from the ship aboard separate escape pods. Nyss Nenn's sister, Syll Nenn, tried to destroy Faal's pod, firing at it from her scout flyer but Korr reflected the shots with his lightsaber, killing her. Soldier, Seer, and Grace escaped aboard the medical supply ship to Mother, while Nyss Nenn and Korr pursued them on the scout flyer and Junker, respectively."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
