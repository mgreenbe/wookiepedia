Noble houses held a great deal of influence in this region and almost every interstellar company had offices or were headquartered in the Core Worlds.

Among many prominent galactic circles, it was believed that Humans originated in one of the Core Worlds. It was widely speculated that Coruscant was the birthplace of humanity though there was little to no archaeological evidence to support that theory. Around 1,000,000 BBY, the Celestials created the Corellian system by using the massive Centerpoint Station to tractor the five planets Corellia, Selonia, Drall, Talus and Tralus through hyperspace around the star Corell. The planets were then settled with Selonians, Dralls and humans from Coruscant; resulting in the system's multi-species population. The Celestials also used similar technology to construct the Vultar system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Millennia ago, war broke out on Coruscant between the near-Human Taungs and the 13 baseline Human nations of the Battalions of Zhell. A volcano decimated the Zhell, the ash filling the skies for two years, so the Taungs adopted the name Dha Werda Verda (Warriors of Shadow) for themselves. The Human Zhell eventually recovered and drove the Taungs offworld. Around 100,000 BBY, Coruscant and the Duros homeworld of Duro were surveyed by the Columi, who dismissed the native civilizations on these worlds as primitive disappointments. During this period, Coruscant's surface was gradually covered by the planet-spanning ecumenopolis of Galactic City. New buildings were built on the old. As a result, there was virtually no exposed land. In the forgotten underlevels of the city, there was darkness, pollution and crime. Higher up, there were government offices and penthouses owned by the elite."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35,000 BBY, the insectoid Killiks of Alderaan built the Castle Lands of Oroboro.

Under Rakatan domination, the Humans of Coruscant's colonization attempts were limited to sleeper ships, which ended up on Alderaan, in the Tion Cluster, Seoul 5, Kuat, Alsakan, Axum, Anaxes, Atrisia, Metellos, Corulag, Csilla and many other worlds. The Rakata were eventually decimated by a massive plague, leading to slave revolutions on their subject worlds in the Core."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next two centuries, Coruscant was linked to other Core Worlds including Corellia, Alderaan, New Plympto and Duro, by hyperspace cannons, via the Herglic Trade Empire. It was during this time that the Coruscant government peacefully absorbed the nearby Azure Imperium. During these pre-Republic years, the languages of Coruscant and its neighbors meshed to become Old Galactic Standard.

Its founders were a number of key Core Worlds known collectively as the Core Founders including Coruscant, Alderaan, Duro, Kuat and Humbarine. As an early founder of the Republic, Duro entered a golden age under the leadership of Queen Rana Mas Trehalt. Later, the monarchy was abolished in favor of a collection of ruling corporations administrated by the Duros High House which was led by a Chief Representative Officer. During that period, Human and Duros scientists reverse-engineered the Rakatan hyperdrive; inventing the modern hyperdrive. This led to vigorous colonization in a small patch of the Core known as the Tetrahedron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tetrahedron was based on the concepts of a Duros hyperspatial physicist who theorized that Coruscant, Alderaan, Corellia and the Ginn Jump were the four corners of a specific region of space. Due to its strategic location and heavy infrastructure, Coruscant was the capital of the Republic; thus bearing the coordinates 0-0-0 on hyperspace maps. The discovery of the Perlemian Trade Route linked Coruscant to the Outer Rim world of Ossus, which became the domain of the Jedi Order over the subsequent millennia and a fortress world blocking Tionese and Hutt expansion into the Core. Over the next millennia, the Corellian Run was mapped, linking Coruscant to Corellia and beyond. The wedge defined by the two trade routes became known as \"the Slice\". The Core Worlds' portion of the Slice was known as the Arrowhead, and soon the Republic expanded into the Colonies. Several Core Worlds like Anaxes, Basilisk and Ixtlar prospered from this territorial boom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 24,000 BBY, war broke out between the Republic and the Union; spreading both sides of the Perlemian.

By 23,900 BBY, the worlds of the former Honorable Union had all joined the Republic with the exception of Desevro which remained proudly isolationist. At first, the government on Coruscant wished for slow expansion, despite its promotion of hyperspace exploration.

Despite this, the Slice would remain the heart of navigable space. Eventually, the Republic expanded past the galactic-northern and -southern borders of the Slice, though most of the galaxy was still unknown, except for outposts such as Ord Mantell (12,000 BBY) and Malastare (8000 BBY). The space west of Coruscant still remained unexplored since analogues to the Perlemian Trade Route and the Corellian Run in that direction still had not been discovered. Worse, progress was limited to dangerous one- or two-light-year jumps into a stretch of hyperspatial anomalies. Consequently, the Republic government expanded eastward, instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this period, several key Core Worlds including Coruscant and Alsakan established holdings in the Expansion Region. However, this region suffered greatly as a result of Alsakan attempting to snatch control of the Republic from Coruscant. This resulted in seventeen Alsakan Conflicts, spanning from 17,000 BBY to 3017 BBY. However, most of the fighting took place between their holdings in the Expansion Region, rather than in the Core itself. Needless to say, Coruscant won every conflict it fought. In 15,500 BBY, after a disastrous first contact, Coruscant was assaulted by Star Dragons in the Duinuogwuin Contention. The conflict was peacefully resolved by Supreme Chancellor Fillorean and the Star Dragon philosopher Borz'Mat'oh, who together founded the University of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 12,000 BBY, the Core Worlds came under the influence of the theocratic and humanocentric Pius Dea sect which posited one of their own Contispex I as the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. Over the following centuries, his descendants sanctioned several crusades against some rival alien sects in the Outer Rim which fought back; leaving the galaxy in a never-ending state of alternating hot and cold wars. During this period, several military outposts known as Ordnance/Regional Depots were established to ostensibly protect Human settlers from hostile alien threats. This further deepened interspecies tensions with the anti-alien nature of the crusades forcing an exodus into Hutt Space and turning the Rimward Slice into a militarized zone dominated by war profiteers. Though Pius Dea rule came to an end in 11,000 BBY, the repercussions of these crusades would sour relations between the Core and the Outer Rim over the millennia."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Sith Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 9757 BBY, the Second Herglic Feud occurred.

Republic forces then invaded and devastated Sith Space, ending the Sith Empire. In 4250 BBY, the Third Great Schism was fought on Coruscant with the surviving Dark Jedi fleeing to the Vultar system.

This sparked rioting on Coruscant and there was talk in the Senate of complete surrender to the Sith. However, the Republic's situation was alleviated by the intervention of the Mirialan smuggler Hylo Visz who succeeded in breaking the Mandalorian blockade. The Sith then offered to negotiate a peace with the Republic on Alderaan in 3653 BBY. With the Republic and Jedi caught off guard, a Sith fleet invaded and rampaged the galactic capital; inflicting much damage to the Galactic Senate and Jedi Temple.

The Ruusan Reformation also attempted to reduce corruption and decentralize power away from a few powerful Coreward sectors that dominate representation by reorganizing the then-existing millions of sectors into only 1,024 sectors. Each of the new sectors was granted its own Senator, although a few exemptions were made for politically powerful core worlds to retain their individual representation.

In 470 BBY, Corellia attempted to secede from the Republic; although progressing far enough to close its sector's borders and withdraw from the Senate using Contemplanys Hermi, the plan ultimately failed and the system continued as a begrudging Republic member-state.

The Yuuzhan Vong were relocated to the sentient world of Zonama Sekot\u2014a seed of the original Yuuzhan'tar.

Within three years, much of the Core including Coruscant passed into the hands of the Fel Empire under Roan Fel which was usurped by Darth Krayt's Sith Empire in 130 ABY.
