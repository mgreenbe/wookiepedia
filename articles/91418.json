Working with Chief Rieekan and the agents of the SIS unit on the moon, the Knight followed Agent Galen's trail to the Nikto Sector, where the Jedi found the Power Guard recruitment center under the control of Imperial forces. Chasing Agent Galen and his captor Lord Sadic, the apprentice of the Sith Lord Darth Angral, across Nar Shaddaa, the Jedi fought through Imperial forces and Power Guards to finally catch up to Sadic in the Imperial prison district of Shadow Town. During the mission, Chief Rieekan and many of his agents were massacred by Power Guards in a raid on their safehouse, and Agent Galen was converted into a Power Guard against his will. The Knight eventually fought and killed Sadic in his laboratory, and the remnants of the Power Guard project was destroyed by the SIS and the commandos of the Republic's Blackstar Squad."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
