Although it was not much to look at, it was Bryce-Kelley's pride and joy as it was relatively fast and maneuverable, and was capable of carrying five hundred metric tons. To protect the ship, and possibly others as Bryce-Kelley seemed to do at every opportunity, Royal Mistress was fitted with a concealed quad laser cannon. Because the ship only required a crew of two, Bryce-Kelley and Rypka, it was very rare that they would take on hirelings. Because of Bryce-Kelley's actions in saving many of his fellow free-traders, Royal Mistress became a welcome sight to the Outer Rim smugglers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
