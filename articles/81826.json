Despite the apparent unreliability of such a contraption, it was surprisingly safe and efficient at carrying the Wookiees back and forth between their two destinations. These baskets were typically made from wroshyr-wood and used woven kshyy vines in their riggings. These vines, when healthy, were even stronger than durasteel cable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the time of the Galactic Civil War liftcars typically included repulsorlifts in case of emergency, although the strength of the vines made such situations quite rare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
