Around 31 BBY, the Pulas, a powerful and ancient Sith artifact, was discovered on the planet Almas by a team of Jedi researchers. The Believers, a Sith-worshipping cult that operated in the Cularin system, sought steal the artifact and Es'loma mastermined a scheme to help the cultists seize the relic from the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To prevent the Pulas from falling into the clutches of the Believers, the Jedi arranged for the artifact to be transported to the galactic capital world of Coruscant for safekeeping. The Jedi assembled a small fleet to convey the artifact; each starship in the fleet was to carry a Mandalorian iron box to Coruscant, of which one box contained the Pulas and the remainder were decoys. Es'Loma enlisted with the crew of a vessel in the armada that the Believers suspected was carrying the Pulas, joining the Wookiee Wojarra and the Human Force Adepts San Herrera and Nia Reston aboard the ship. The group collected their assigned box from the Almas Academy Jedi training institution on Almas and departed for Coruscant. Es'Loma planned to help the Believers steal the relic once the ship arrived on Coruscant and she kept her true intentions and her affiliation with the Wyrd secret from the rest of the crew. In truth, the Mandalorian iron box aboard the ship was one of the decoys and contained not the Pulas but a fragment of the dark side-imbued city Conkesta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Jedi fleet reached Coruscant, Es'Loma's ship docked on a landing platform and she and the rest of the crew were greeted by the Bothan Jedi Knight Nysis Belzara, who had come to escort them to a safe house. To cause a diversion, as part of a pre-arranged plan Es'Loma deliberately fell off edge of the platform and was caught by a speeder waiting below. While Belzara and Es'Loma's fellow crew members were distracted by the Tarasin witch's feigned plight, a team of Believer thugs assaulted the landing platform and stole the Mandalorian iron box."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterward, the Believers retreated back to their secret base in the Coruscant undercity with their prize.

The actions and decisions of the players affect the outcomes of their encounter with Es'Loma and the Believers at the secret undercity base. If the player characters apprehend a Believer guard posted to watch the entrance to the secret undercity base, Es'Loma is asleep and off-guard when the players arrive at the hideout. If the players fail to apprehend the guard, Es'Loma receives advance warning that the players are coming and sets an ambush by climbing on the ceiling and leaping down onto the player characters when they enter the base. If the player characters are significantly outmatched by Es'Loma and the Believers, the Tarasin witch crawls onto the ceiling and leaves the hideout in disgust at the poor odds. It is also possible for Es'Loma to be incapacitated or killed during the fight. If Es'Loma is immobilized, the Believers thugs start to flee the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
