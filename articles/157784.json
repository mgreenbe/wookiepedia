The pilot was the wingman of Lieutenant Blair during the battle. They were being attacked by TIE fighters, but they were piloting craft that were older than the TIEs and were considered to be ancient. All of the resistance pilots except for Blair and the wingman were killed by the TIEs on the first pass. The TIEs formed up into pakcs and came at them on a second pass, killing the wingman. Blair was the only survivor of the two-minute-long battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This wingman was first mentioned in the databank of the LucasArts video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, which was released on October 26, 2010."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
