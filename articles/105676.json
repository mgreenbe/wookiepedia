Contestants competed in unique, individually-made pit racers, gliders in which they descended the garbage pits to the lowest levels, where they collected scales from the backs of garbage worms. The sport was highly dangerous and subject to Judicial raids, since garbage canisters, regularly ejected from the pits into orbit, could kill the competitors. Pit racing had been practiced since approximately 129 BBY. Successful pit racers included Reymet Autem and Anakin Skywalker, who frequented the Wicko District garbage pits. Jahan Cross was also familiar with the sport, having done it in his youth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
