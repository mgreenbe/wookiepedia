He quickly rose through the ranks, gaining more skill every day. After a tragic accident where Gerlon's blaster overheated during a match and exploded and paralyzed three fingers on his right hand, he earned the name Gerlon Two-Fingers. Marl described this incident as a \"one in a million occurrence\". After the injury, he slowly lost his high standings in the ring, until the only person he was able to beat was Deadeye Duncan, the weakest duelist. Gerlon remained quite bitter about the accident and frequently claimed that he could have beaten most other duelists if he still had his digits. Ajuur, the owner of the arena, eventually began using him simply to soften up opponents for later battles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3956 BBY, Revan, under the alias of \"the Mysterious Stranger\", defeated him in a broadcast duel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gerlon's first canonical appearance is as a non-player character in the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic video game.
