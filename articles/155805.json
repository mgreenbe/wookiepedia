The blaster's body was a simple box shape, with a wooden grip lacking a trigger guard, and a long skinny barrel. The blaster pistol fired green lasers and was very accurate. The pistol was favored among Rodian bounty hunters and some Lumini Pirates. In addition, the weapon found it's way into the service of the officers of the Galactic Empire, as well as Imperial vehicle pilots and TIE pilots, and found some use in the hands of scout troopers. The weapon also found its way into the hands of New Republic officers by the year 10 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The blaster pistol model appeared in the video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II and its expansion pack Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith. The weapon would be dropped by pistol wielding enemies, but could not be used by the player. Picking up the weapon would result in the player adding ammunition to his stores. In Mysteries of the Sith the weapon would change into a DL-44 heavy blaster pistol upon being dropped, with the exception of walker pilots, who would drop an E-11 blaster rifle instead of their pistol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
