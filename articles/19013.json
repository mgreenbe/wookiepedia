The attack destroyed Plagueis' residence on the moon and wiped out his entire contingent of Sun Guard mercenaries. However, Plagueis himself\u2014to the great astonishment of the few who knew of the attack (especially Veruna)\u2014evaded death during the bombardment, having been forewarned of the attack, and then rescued, by the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jabba advised Veruna of Damask's survival, the Naboo monarch promptly abdicated his throne and fled with his loyal bodyguard to what he believed to be the protective fortress of his family's ancient castle in Naboo's Western Reaches.
