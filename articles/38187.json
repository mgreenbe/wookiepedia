A good example of this was Din Djarin, the man known to all as \"the Mandalorian\", who made a career as a bounty hunter and who would be involved in a rugged adventure when he agreed to recover a delicate merchandise that ended up turning out to be a living being. Years later, in the middle of the cold war between the First Order and the Resistance, these types of characters continued to proliferate everywhere and, in some cases, such as that of the ex-spice smuggler Zorii Bliss, they would play an important role in the events that eventually brought about the downfall of the Final Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
