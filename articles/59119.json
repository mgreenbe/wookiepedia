Reached by a causeway of exposed sand, the stone monastery was only accessible at low tide. Painted in a riot of primary colors, the monastery's remote nature and lack of landing platforms on the island meant that visitors were infrequent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike the rest of the Order, the Halsoun monks were ascetics, who removed themselves from the world to focus on meditation in complete solitude. Rarely seeing even other monks, a meditating Halsoun monk resided within a simple cell within the monastery, kept alive by a lay staff that supplied the monks with food, water, and medicine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
