He was eventually approached by Qui-Gon Jinn, who needed parts to repair Anakin Skywalker's podracer. He turned to the Important Merchant, who had a Mass coupler, one of the parts needed to fix the podracer, but he was cautious to deal with Jinn after hearing that he only carried Republic credits. Qui-Gon offered a trade, but he wasn't interested in anything the Jedi was carrying. Upon being prompted, though, he stated that he would accept two Fuel converters, or a Fusion coil and an Engine binder for the Mass coupler. They reached an agreement, and Jinn obtained the Mass coupler for Anakin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Important Merchant's podracer was eventually sold to Ratts Tyerell, who raced with it in the Boonta Eve Classic, but was killed after crashing it on the second lap."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Important Merchant made his first and only appearance in the Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game in the Mos Espa level, where he is voiced by Joe Alaskey.
