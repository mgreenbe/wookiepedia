Such toxic agents were employed by bounty hunters. Boba Fett carried darts with a nerve toxin, which he once used in a fight against Jodo Kast; Fett also kept the antidote for the toxin on his person. Rebel Alliance troops also used non-lethal gas that incapacitated an enemy for a limited duration of time. Natasi Daala used this to execute the Imperial warlords at Tsoss Beacon in 12 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
