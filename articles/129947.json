Named after a common Corellian breed of vermin-hunting housecat, the Spukami managed to pack an impressive stopping power for a holdout blaster. The pocket blaster also included a stun setting, which made it popular throughout the Corellian sector, and while it was technically effective out to thirty meters, in practice, the beam cohesion degraded after just a few meters, and caused a reduction in damage and accuracy at range."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
