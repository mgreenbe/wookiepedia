The items shipped were often considered contraband, and highly illegal.[source?] Smugglers would sort all kinds of illegal merchandise into forbidden areas, breaking any law that stood in their way regardless of who made it. They would then sell their cargo on the black market, deliver it to a client, or use it themselves. Notable smugglers included Han Solo, his partner Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
