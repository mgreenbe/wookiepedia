Typically, a generator provided energy for two turbolaser turrets and a robust shield system, rated at 200 SBD. No armor reinforcement was necessary, as the tough rock of the asteroid itself provided the equivalent of 95 RU hull plating."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally used around mining outposts for defensive purposes, where asteroid debris was common, these platforms provided a strong hidden defense capability wherever they were installed.
