During the events, the Imperial governor Everi Chalis punished the crew of the starship Mandible, which had suffered an accident while carrying volatile cargo under the command of a drunken captain. Rather than admit this act of incompetence on the part of one of its officers, the Galactic Empire instead credited the punishment to Chalis as to show the consequences for the accident. Chalis later mentioned the Belnar Insurrections to the crew of an Imperial heavy freighter in 3 ABY, using the punishment of the Mandible's crew as a threat to make the freighter change course."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Belnar Insurrections were mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
