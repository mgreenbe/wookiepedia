After the Falcon was lost from Imperial sensors, Captain Lorth Needa came to the Executor to personally apologize for the failure. Suba stood with Admiral Firmus Piett at a bank of monitors in one of the Executor's corridors while Vader choked Needa to death behind the pair.

Ultimately Vader and the Empire tracked down the Falcon on the planet Bespin, where they captured its captain, Han Solo. The rest of the freighter's crew managed to escape from the city in the Falcon, and Suba was on board the Executor's bridge as Piett gave the order to prepare the Star Destroyer's tractor beam to capture the rebel ship.

In the new Star Wars canon, Suba was first used in the mobile card game Star Wars: Force Collection, which initially launched in 2013. Although the launch of Force Collection predates the Star Wars canon reset of 2014, Lucasfilm Story Group member Leland Chee confirmed that the game was kept updated to fit with canon.
