A desolate world of featureless wastes and barren rocky flatlands, Apatros was small, moon-sized, and orbited a dim orange star. It was orbited by a single moon, had a thin atmosphere and some indigenous plant life, and a day that was twenty standard hours in length. Below the planet's surface was a large amount of very valuable material\u2014cortosis, a rare fibrous substance that was often used for starship hulls and armor, which was mined in underground tunnels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Apatros was located within the borders of the Galactic Republic. At some point, large quantities of cortosis were discovered underneath the planet's surface, prompting the Outer Rim Oreworks Company to take over Apatros. Outer Rim Oreworks established a colony on the desolate planet and began mining for cortosis, which it sold to the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1026 BBY, a man named Dessel was born on the planet, eventually going on to work in the cortosis mines for ten years.

Dessel joined the Sith army during the New Sith Wars, and, after serving with distinction, his Force-sensitivity was discovered.

The Apatros colony was primarily used as the home of the cortosis miners and only had two buildings of note: a cantina owned by the Neimoidian Groshik, which was the main retreat of off-duty miners and visiting Republic crews, and a market, once a barracks, which sold basic items at high prices. The colony and mines were connected by a shuttle for transport back and forth. The cortosis mines were maintained by the Outer Rim Oreworks Company, but the death toll for miners was high and their equipment outdated and substandard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Apatros was mostly inhabited by miners working in the cortosis mines, the majority of which were Humans.
