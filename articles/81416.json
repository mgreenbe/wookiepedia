Due to the rod's use as a weapon, after the Leveler was buried in the Shrine on Rystan and frozen in ice, the rod was split into two pieces by the Elders of the Path and hidden away, with the hope that it would never again resurface. However, one half of the rod found its way into the possession of Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro, who sought vengeance against the Jedi Order over perceived wrongs done to his ancestors. Wanting the entire rod, Ro tracked down the Elder Tromak and attempted to force him to reveal its location. Tromak refused, but his former ward Krix Kamerat betrayed him and gave the information to Ro. With both halves of the rod in his possession, Ro retrieved the Leveler from Rystan and reassembled the rod during an attack on the Nihil base on Grizal, testing the beast against the Jedi present."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rod was made of stone and metal, inscribed with screaming faces, fire, and chains. The holder of the rod could command the Great Leveler, a creature which preyed upon Force-users. Sections of the rod could be twisted to allow the owner to issue commands. When touched, the rod grew warm and glowed a sickly purple. Jedi in the proximity of the rod sensed something they found disturbing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rod was constructed long before 232 BBY, for the purpose of controlling the Great Leveler. Eventually, the members of the Elders of the Path, a religious sect which disliked use of the Force, came into possession of the rod. Recognizing the danger of the weapon, they broke the rod into two pieces and hid each piece on a different planet. One half was hidden in a cave in the Kharvashark Ruins on Vrant Tarnum in the Stygmarn system. The Leveler, meanwhile, was frozen in ice inside the Shrine on Rystan, where it was revered for generations by a group of adherents. The locations of the halves were kept secret to all but a select few, in the hope that the rod would never again see the light of day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, however, one half of the rod was removed from its hiding place, coming into the possession of Marchion Ro, whose family was connected to the hiding place of the Leveler. Ro held a grudge against the Jedi for something that had befallen his ancestors, and he believed the rod was almost as fully to blame as the Jedi Order. Having left his homeworld long before, Ro had become the Eye of the Nihil pirates, a group that had sprung from the Elders of the Path as a sickness. Ro intended to use the Nihil as one instrument of his revenge, as well as hoping to control the Great Leveler through the rod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 232 BBY, Ro engineered the Great Hyperspace Disaster, which disrupted hyperspace travel across the Outer Rim Territories. In the aftermath, Jedi Master Loden Greatstorm was captured by Nihil Tempest Runner Lourna Dee and her forces during a raid on the planet Elphrona. The Twi'lek Jedi was imprisoned aboard Ro's flagship, the Gaze Electric. When Ro visited his prisoner, he showed Greatstorm the artifact, leading the Jedi Master to narrow his eyes at what he sensed from it before the pirate leader stated that he did not fear the Jedi coming for him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During an Emergence that threatened the Trymant system in the aftermath, a group of Nihil led by Ro came to Trymant IV to collect Elder Tromak, who was one of the only people who knew where the rod's other half was hidden. As the pirates clashed with Jedi who had arrived to assist Trymant's residents, Jedi Grand Master Yoda boarded Ro's Spider Cruiser in an attempt to rescue Krix Kamerat, a young member of Tromak's sect who had been hustled onto the starship as the Gran's assistant. However, Kamerat, who was in mental turmoil over discovering that his friend Zeen Mrala was Force-sensitive \u2014 something strictly forbidden by the sect \u2014 refused to be rescued. While Yoda was sneaking off the ship, he came across a crate containing the rod and opened it. He was concerned by the object, but left it behind as he escaped the vessel. Upon his return to the Starlight Beacon, Yoda told other Jedi of the strange object on the Nihil ship and that it was imperative they find out what it was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to how sacred the knowledge was, Tromak refused to share the location of the other half of the rod with Ro, who subsequently forced him and Kamerat to participate in a dangerous gladiatorial match in the arena onboard the Gaze Electric. Fearing that he would be killed, Tromak confided the information to Kamerat, asking him to keep it secret. However, Kamerat betrayed Tromak after Ro found a holoprojector he had been given by Yoda which turned out to contain a homing beacon, claiming that the device belonged to the Gran Elder. Tromak managed to escape the Nihil on the junk moon Quantxi, taking with him a bogaranth which Ro had ordered him fed to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While escaping, Tromak encountered Yoda and two other Jedi Masters, Torban Buck and Kantam Sy, who were searching for the pirates and their Padawans, who had ventured to the moon in search of Mrala, who was chasing after Kamerat. Despite his dislike for Jedi, Tromak offered to lead them to the camp as they had a common enemy. In private, he asked Yoda to help him retrieve the relic on Vrant Tarnum, as he wished to keep it out of the Nihil's hands. Yoda recognized the relic as being connected to the artifact he had seen on the Squall Spider, and Tromak was horrified that it was already in the Nihil's hands. The Elder persuaded Yoda to help him, asking him to leave his comlink behind, by mentioning a previous encounter the two had had on Dalna. As the other Jedi dealt with the pirate forces, Tromak and Yoda slipped away, with the other Jedi not knowing where he had gone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Kamerat, whom Ro had taken a liking to, told him where the other half of the relic was located. As a result, when Yoda and Tromak arrived at Vrant Tarnum, their starship was shot down by drones left in orbit for security. Finding the artifact in the ruins, Ro declared it the \"missing piece\" and planned to set up a Nihil outpost there, placing Kamerat in charge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trying to find Yoda, Master Sy and their Padawan Lula Talisola later accompanied Mrala back to Trymant IV for answers about why the Nihil had wanted Tromak. Meeting with Elder Barbatash, they were informed of the artifact's status as a weapon and that it could change the galaxy forever. Ro travelled to Rystan to retrieve the Leveler, bringing along the Force-sensitive navigator Udi Dis to test the effects the creature would have. He brought the creature onto the Gaze Electric, where Doctor Kisma Uttersond implanted a camera into the creature's back so Ro could watch what it did."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ro reassembled the rod when the Jedi attacked the Nihil base on Grizal. This action woke the Leveler, which Ro commanded to attack Greatstorm, who had recently escaped captivity, and his Padawan Bell Zettifar. The apprentice was overwhelmed by the Leveler's power, being reduced to curling up into a ball, and Greatstorm was killed by petrification. Master Elzar Mann also crashed his Jedi Vector from the sensation, recognizing the Leveler's power as something he had experienced in a long-ago Force vision. However, none of the Jedi knew what they were dealing with, particularly as Yoda's whereabouts were still unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
