The Braha'tok was ninety meters long and was equipped with eight double turbolasers and eight concussion missiles. It possessed limited hangar space and lacked ground troop complement. The ship came equipped with fire control, maneuvering, and command capabilities, all of which were centralized in the bridge. The Braha'tok was also equipped with engines that were capable of making the jump to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Alliance Fleet asked Dornea\u2014which had been fighting its own private war against the Empire for years\u2014for battleships to assist them in their upcoming assault on the second Death Star, an Imperial superweapon that could destroy an entire planet, which was still under construction while orbiting the forest moon of Endor. The Dorneans decided to send the Braha'tok along with its sister ship, the Torktarak, under the command of Kiles L'toth and Etahn A'baht, respectively. Since the Braha'tok-class gunships had not been outside of the space surrounding Dornea before 4 ABY, and to avoid arousing the suspicion of Imperial Intelligence, the Dornean government claimed that the two ships were undergoing a \"shakedown cruise.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Braha'tok and the Torktarak met up with the Alliance Fleet orbiting Sullust, which was under the command of the Mon Calamarian Admiral Gial Ackbar. Both of the Braha'tok gunships left with the Alliance fleet for the Endor system. However, when the Alliance fleet came out of hyperspace over Endor, they were caught in a trap devised by Emperor Palpatine. The Alliance discovered that the shield protecting the second Death Star, which was supposed to have been taken down by a ground unit that had already landed on Endor, was still up. Also, the Alliance fleet was met by a large Imperial fleet under the command of Admiral Firmus Piett, which trapped them in the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance fleet engaged the Imperials, hoping the shield generator would be taken down by the ground strike team before the Imperial fleet defeated them. During the space battle, the MC80 Liberty type Star Cruiser Liberty was destroyed by the Death Star's superlaser, which the Alliance hadn't known was functional. In order to provide cover for the rescue shuttles picking up survivors, L'toth moved the Braha'tok into a defensive formation. While providing cover, the Braha'tok held off the Carrack\u2013class cruiser Eminence, which was more than three times the size of the Braha'tok. The ship took extensive damage while engaging the Eminence, but the Braha'tok and the Torktarak were able to destroy the Eminence after the Torktarak attacked the Imperial warship from behind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Eminence was destroyed, the Torktarak continued to provide cover for the damaged Braha'tok while it continued its search-and-rescue mission.

Originally, Ello137 intended the ship's name to be a mythical Dornean name, but was unable to fit it into the \"flow\" of his final entry.
