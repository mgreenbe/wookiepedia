The Kaminoans noted that their clone troopers began to show signs of individual characteristics, despite their genetics theoretically being physically, mentally, and emotionally identical. Puzzled and feeling that this ruined the theory of the perfect clone, they deemed this quirk a negative factor and attempted to terminate all their supposed failures. However, they were stopped when Jango Fett, with the support of senior research geneticist Hali Ke, suggested that such displays of individuality and unpredictability would make clone troopers more effective, not less."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
