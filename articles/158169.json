It commonly adorned their temples, such as the Sith Citadel on Exegol, and their obelisks, such as the ones found outside the Malachor Sith Temple. The writing was also in the tomb of Darth Bane  and the Lothal Jedi Temple. The language was also used in Sith rituals. However, by the time of the Galactic Republic and amidst an effort to quarantine Sith worlds and erase Sith history, ur-Kitt\u00e2t was considered a forbidden language, and the Senate passed legislation forbidding protocol droids from translating any texts from it. Despite this prohibition, Darth Bane's Sith Order continued to use both ur-Kitt\u00e2t and its Balc dialect.
