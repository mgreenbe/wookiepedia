Nestled deep within the Gallo Mountains, a short distance west of the city of Dee'ja Peak, the cave was used as a base of operations for the criminal organization known as the Mummers during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Circa 1 ABY, Tanoa Vills dispatched a spacer to the cave in order to get an XJ5 circuit board from Mummer scientists. This allowed Vills to build a sequencer that can be used in a Stonewall Labs security beacon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mummer Cave was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
