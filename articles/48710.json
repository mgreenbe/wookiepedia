She was one of the Human colonists who had fled a civil war on the Core World of Grizmallt and established a new civilization on the planet Naboo, a green haven located on the borders of the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While her people was engaged in bloody conflict with the native Gungans, that woman was chosen to lead the colonists, who took the name of their new homeworld and became known as \"the Naboo.\" Although she accepted both the title and the function of Queen, that woman refused to be the founder of a hereditary succession line. Instead, the newly elected Queen decreed that her successor would be selected based on their merits only. This started a tradition of meritocratic democracy on Naboo, which would still be used millennia later. However, the constitution of Naboo had a provision that allowed the monarchy to become hereditary for a worthy dynasty, and this happened at least once in history."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
