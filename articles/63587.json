It encompassed the Si'Klaata Cluster, and bordered on the Tion Hegemony. Hutt Space was named for the Hutt species, who dominated the region. Differing accounts attributed different numbers of planets in Hutt Space, but reasonable estimates ranged from a few hundred to a thousand inhabited worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early Beginnings"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Pre-Republic era, the Hutts originated on the world of Varl. It is unknown whether the Hutts developed interstellar technology or acquired it from another species due to conflicting historical accounts. An aggressive and expansionist warrior species, the Hutts invaded several outlying worlds and exterminated or enslaved hundreds of other species. Hutt Space was formed into the Hutt Empire sometime after 25,200 BBY and for approximately the next two centuries, they were the most powerful government in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25,102 BBY, the Hutts were challenged by the Human/Tionese warlord Xim who had carved up a substantial interstellar empire in the Tion Cluster. Following a devastating war, Xim's forces were routed by Kossak the Hutt at the Third Battle of Vontor in 25,096 BBY. The Hutts had assembled a sizable mercenary army of Nikto, Vodran and Klatooinian warriors whose leaders had ratified the Treaty of Vontor which bound the three species to a permanent state of servitude. With Xim eliminated, the Hutts then invaded and devastated much of the Tion Cluster. The Tionese were so debilitated militarily and economically that they did not pose a military threat for a long time. Meanwhile, the Hutts had ceased to be identified as an Empire within a century of Xim's defeat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 24,000 BBY, Hutt Space and the Tion Cluster were first encountered by the Core Worlds\u2014based Galactic Republic which had discovered the Perlemian Trade Route. Conflict between the Republic and the Honorable Union of Desevro & Tion led to the Tionese War which ended in the former's favor when Republic agents stirred up trouble in Hutt Space. The Hutts then invaded the Tion Cluster and exterminated many of the Tionese. The surviving Tionese appealed to their former Republic foes for protection and most of the Tionese worlds subsequently joined the Republic. With their human foes united, the Hutts prepared for war which did not occur."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Republic Entanglements"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 15,000 BBY, much of Hutt Space was devastated during the Hutt Cataclysms that rendered the Hutt homeworld of Varl and other colony worlds barren and incapable of sustaining life. The surviving Hutt clans relocated their capital to Evocar which they renamed Nal Hutta, having displaced and exiled the native Evocii to its moon Nar Shaddaa. Budhila Hestilic Amura established the Hutt Ruling Council to oversee the activities of the Hutt kajidics and to mitigate rivalries. He also developed the philosophy of kajidic which promoted fierce inter-clan rivalry and infiltration of institutions in favor of war and expansionism."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 12,000 BBY, the Republic came under the influence of the theocratic and Humanocentric Pius Dea sect which posited Contispex I as Supreme Chancellor. Taking advantage of the unpopularity of the Hutts among the Republic's citizens, Constipex sanctioned a crusade against the Hutts. Over the following centuries, his descendants sanctioned several crusades against some rival alien sects in the Outer Rim which fought back; leaving the galaxy in a never-ending state of alternating hot and cold wars. The anti-alien nature of the crusades precipitated an exodus into Hutt Space until the end of Pius Dea rule in 11,000 BBY. The repercussions of these crusades would sour relations between the Core and the outlying regions over the millennia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the following centuries, the Hutts and the Republic ratified treaties that established the boundaries between the Republic and Hutt Space. Spacers also discovered the Ootmian Pabol trade route that linked the Republic frontiers with Nal Hutta and Nar Shaddaa. Due to increasing trade with the Republic, its capital came to rival Coruscant as a center of interstellar trade. However trade along the Ootmian was disrupted by a supernova which destroyed the Kyyr system in 4000 BBY and created the Thornhedge Nebula. This coupled by the rise of the Corellian Run ended Nal Hutta and Nar Shaddaa's existence as a legitimate trade center and it devolved over the millennia into a crime haven. Despite the expansion of the Republic into the nearby Mid Rim and Outer Rim, the Hutts made little complaint but rather infiltrated and took over the economies of these colonies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Hutt Space remained neutral amidst the fighting and played both Republic and Separatists against each other. However, in 22 BBY, after rescuing and returning Rotta to Jabba on Tatooine at the neighboring Arkanis sector, they allowed the Republic to pass through the sector unlike the CIS."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Period"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the rule of the Galactic Empire, portions of Hutt Space were reorganized into various sectors governed by Moffs though their authority was weak at best and non-existent at worst. One such sector was the Baxel sector which was governed by Moff Sarn Shild, and later by Moff Yref Orgege. While the Empire cracked down on slavery to some extent, the Hutts and several corporations were immune from this ruling."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since the Hutt kajidics generated considerable taxes to support the greatly expanded Imperial Military, Hutt Space was left alone by the Empire though the latter established some manufacturing facilities in parts of Hutt Space. Still, the Empire used its military as a bargaining chip in relations with Hutt Space. In 1 BBY, Sriluur and its neighbors were annexed by the Empire while a token Imperial force unsuccessfully attempted to annihilate Nar Shaddaa shortly before the Battle of Yavin. Imperial forces also undertook police actions against individual kajidics that worked with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Following the fragmentation of the Empire, Hutt Space seemed to have remained largely autonomous even during the New Republic period. During the fighting between Republic and the Imperial Remnant, most Hutts remained neutral."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post-Imperial period"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War in 26 ABY, much of Hutt Space was devastated in retribution for the Hutts' double-dealings with the Yuuzhan Vong and the New Republic. Several prominent Hutt worlds including Nal Hutta, Nar Shaddaa and Ilos were devastated or \"Vongformed\" by the invaders. The surviving Hutt kajidics were forced to relocate to Tatooine and Hutt territory was laid waste in the process. However, the worlds in the heart of Hutt Space known as Bootana Hutta managed to resist the invaders since they were defended by Hutt warships, a rare sight in other regions. Additionally, the Hutt worlds mysteriously proved resistant to Yuuzhan Vong terraforming efforts. It was rumored among Galactic Alliance scientists and spacers alike that these secluded worlds were the source of a biotechnology which allowed the Hutts to resist \u201cVongforming\u201d."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Yuuzhan Vong's defeat in 29 ABY, the Hutts reasserted control over many of their worlds particularly Nal Hutta and Nar Shaddaa and sought to dominate regional reconstruction efforts, where the Bootana Hutta world of Mulatan, became the third at last known capital of the oversector. In 39 ABY, Hutt Space refused to join the Five Worlds and remained independent from both the Five Worlds and the Galactic Alliance. However in 40 ABY, when the Confederation was formed, Hutt Space joined the organization, and eventually the Hutts themselves joined the members of the Oversector during the great conflict with some kajidics, who only remained in the Bootana Hutta, contributed warships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 44 ABY, the Klatooinians began to resent their status of eternal servitude to the Hutts as decreed by the Treaty of Vontor in exchange for the Hutts protecting their sacred Fountain of the Ancients on their homeworld of Klatooine. Tensions reached their climax when the Lost Tribe of Sith led by Sarasu Taalon attacked the Fountain in an attempt to secure samples of wintrium. The Sith were quickly overpowered and sentenced to their death by the Klatooinians, whom then sought to liberate themselves from Hutt servitude by claiming that the Hutts violated the Treaty. Despite the mediation efforts of Lando Calrissian and Jedi Knight Jaina Solo, the Klatooinians began a full-scale uprising across Klatooine resulting in planet-wide skirmishes and firefights. The revolt rapidly gained galactic-wide attention particularly Chief of State Daala who was concerned by the chaos caused by many anti-slavery uprisings across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 137 ABY, a New Galactic Empire under the control of the Sith had usurped control of the Galaxy. For unknown reasons, Hutt Space provided covert help to the Galactic Alliance Remnant, one of the new Empire's major opponents. Later, the Sith's poisoning of Da Soocha and the destruction of the Hutt Temple Maya Armus on Napdu prompted the Hutts into entering the conflict against the Sith on the side of the Alliance and Imperials."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Politics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hutt Space was what remained of the ancient Hutt Empire, which existed in the times before Xim the Despot. The Hutt Ruling Council controlled the region by overseeing the activities of the Hutt clans (kajidics) and their criminal syndicates. It was considered a lawless expanse within the Outer Rim Territories that was controlled by the most powerful and corrupt of Hutt clans. This meant it held an infamous reputation due to the widespread smuggling, piracy and open criminal activity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The heart of the region contained the Bootana Hutta, the \"Garden of the Hutts\", an area containing the various Kajidic throneworlds. Even in the Empire's days, this area remained secretive to outsiders, who knew it only through rumors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Relations with the Galactic Republic were typically strained, as this area served as a base for much of the criminal enterprise in the galaxy. The economic and strategic benefits of their relationship often encouraged both sides to compromise however, notably the Hutts sided with the Republic during the Clone Wars and were prevented from siding with them in the Great Galactic War only by the hard fought actions of Imperial Intelligence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their relationship with the Jedi Order were less cordial, with Jedi Padawan Naat Reath stating that Hutts had no love for Jedi. This was mostly due to the nature of a Jedi's work. The criminals they hunted would often flee into Hutt Space and the Hutts would be forced to deal with the imposition of a law enforcement official in their territory who they could neither bribe nor kill without consequence. However in practice the Jedi normally tried hard to avoid antagonizing the Hutts any more than they had to, standard operating procedure was to keep their presence very quiet or announce their presence to the local Hutt leader before proceeding. Though Hutts did not like Jedi messing with their affairs, some would find their presence an amusement or an opportunity, and many were eager to help them finish their business quickly and leave."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
