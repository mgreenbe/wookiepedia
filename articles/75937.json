Like his Jedi colleagues, he led the Republic clone troopers against the Separatist Alliance forces in several battles across the galaxy, including the first and second campaign on Geonosis and the Outer Rim Sieges. In 19 BBY, the third and final year of the war, Mundi oversaw the Republic invasion of Mygeeto with the 21st Nova Corps under his command.

Qui-Gon Jinn approached the Jedi Council, describing a lightsaber duel he had on Tatooine with a Zabrak. Jinn believed the warrior to be a Sith, a claim that the Council, and Mundi in particular, met with skepticism. Jinn also brought Anakin Skywalker in front of the Jedi Council, the boy had a high Midi-chlorian count and had a good grasp on the Force, but the Council denied his and Jinn's wishes to train him as a Jedi, believing he was too old, and had much fear in him. Following the Battle of Naboo and the death of Jinn at the hands of the warrior Darth Maul, the Council reversed their decision to allow Skywalker to be trained.

Palpatine explained an alarming number of star systems were breaking away from the Galactic Republic to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a Separatist movement led by the former Jedi Master Count Dooku. The Senate was to consider a vote on the establishment through the Military Creation Act, a move Palpatine claimed he wished to avoid if possible, as some feared it could lead to war with the Separatists. As the meeting concluded, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo, who had just survived an assassination attempt, arrived and explained she believed Dooku was the one behind the attack. Windu reminded Amidala that Dooku had been a Jedi once, and Mundi reasoned that he was simply a political idealist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, when Obi-Wan Kenobi reported that the bounty hunter Jango Fett was behind the assassination attempts on Amidala, Mundi and the Council ordered Kenobi to track the bounty hunter down, and commanded Skywalker to bring Amidala safely back to Naboo.

Kenobi explained Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray was behind the attempts on Amidala's life. Kenobi's transmission was interrupted as he was attacked by a droidekas, prompting a meeting between Mundi, Yoda, Windu, Palpatine and Senators Bail Organa, Ask Aak, Jar Jar Binks and Mas Amedda.

The two of them discussed how so many Jedi were killed in the battle, and that those Jedi would be missed, but that it was good that they were one with the Force. The two old friends also discussed how the Clone Wars were upon the galaxy, with Windu stating he felt uneasy about leading the Clone Army, but stated that sometimes they must be offensive.

Mundi chastised Dibs for his actions, which were deemed both treasonous and heretical, but nevertheless gave him the chance to defend himself. Dibs refused to find fault in his actions, insisting that the Council were the ones in the wrong and they were twisting the Jedi Code for their own selfish gain.

The Jedi Council dispatched Mundi, Kenobi, and Unduli to lead a massive clone army fleet to retake Geonosis and destroy the droid foundries, the destruction of which was viewed as essential to the Republic war effort. Aboard the bridge of one of the Star Destroyers during the voyage, Mundi and Kenobi lamented at the Republic's failure to recognize how loyal the native Geonosians remained to the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, a hologram meeting session was held between Mundi, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Luminara Unduli, Ahsoka Tano, Sheev Palpatine, Yoda, and Mace Windu to discuss the battle plan. Mundi, Kenobi and Skywalker were to lead three separate fronts of a three-pronged attack on the ray shield generator that protected the primary droid foundry where Poggle had established his command post. Mundi and Jet were to lead a northern advance through the Geonosian defense lines to a staging area called Point Rain a short distance from the shield generator. The troops would establish a defensive perimeter around the staging area, where Mundi's forces would meet up with those of Kenobi and Skywalker, who would be coming in after leading their forces through central and southern advances, respectively. Once they rendezvoused, the three Jedi were to combine their forces on an attack against the shield generator. Mundi suggested if either of the three forces were met with heavy resistance that prevented them from reaching the staging area on time, the others should wait until they arrive before advancing on the shield generator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With their planning complete, the Jedi split up to mobilize forces for the upcoming battle. Shortly after Kenobi and Skywalker's men entered the battle, Mundi boarded an LAAT/i gunship and launched along with Jet and a company of clones aboard the Resolute, the flagship of Admiral Wullf Yularen. Mundi led several other gunships into the battle and were immediately met with extremely heavy anti-artillery batteries. Several of the ships among Mundi's forces were destroyed, and Mundi quickly lost contact with Skywalker after his own gunship was shot down. Many of the ships were carrying All Terrain Tactical Enforcers and Mundi ordered them to be dropped to the ground right away, before they were all destroyed all with the gunships. Immediately after issuing this order, the gunship was struck by enemy fire and crashed onto the planet surface below. Many of the clones aboard were killed but Jet and Mundi survived, although the Cerean was injured. Jet reported that only Kenobi's forces made it to the staging area, and that Skywalker and his men had crashed were caught in a firefight with the Geonosians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mundi ordered the injured among his men to be loaded onto the AT-TE walker, and then for the forces to move forward toward a nearby bridge, where Mundi hoped to meet up with Skywalker's forces on their way to Kenobi's position. As the forces traveled through a large caltrop field, Mundi went up ahead and used his lightsaber to cut down the giant caltrops so his walkers could pass them unharmed. Jet requested air support from Yularen, but the admiral denied the request, claiming all starfighters and other resources were engaged elsewhere in the planetary invasion. Upon arriving at a trail leading up to a clifftop cave, Mundi split up his forces, ordering the AT-TE walkers to take the longer route to Kenobi's position while the Jedi took a squad of 13 clones to investigate what Mundi believed was a shortcut through the cave. Mundi admitted to Jet he did not know for sure the cave would be a faster route, but could only trust his instincts. After entering the cave, which disrupted their communications, Mundi sensed an incoming presence and ordered his men to take defensive positions just as a swarm of winged Geonosian warriors attacked them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several of the clones were swept up and carried deeper into the cave to be killed, but Mundi ordered the men not to stop and continue pushing forward. Despite heavy casualties, Mundi's men cut their way through the cave, and upon reaching the other side, the Cerean ordered his clone flametroopers to fire their flamethrowers. Most of the remaining Geonosians were killed, allowing Mundi and his surviving troops to exit the cave. Afterward, Mundi made contact with Skywalker, who informed him the path to the staging area was now clear but that Kenobi's forces were being overwhelmed by the enemy there. Upon a request for air support from Skywalker, Yularen dispatched a BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber squadron, which bombed the advancing Separatist tanks just as Mundi, Skywalker and Tano arrived at Kenobi's position. The Jedi regrouped and determined that, despite their losses, their combined forces were still sufficient to destroy the shield generator. Skywalker took a small force through the shield barrier and jammed the Geonosians' scanners, which freed the AT-TE walkers to fire upon the shield generator without risk of being targeted. Once the generator was destroyed, Mundi led the rest of the clone troopers into the battle via gunships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After they landed, the remaining Geonosians at the ray shield generator were outnumbered by the clones and forced to surrender, marking the end of the initial phase of the battle. The injured Mundi and Kenobi were unable to continue with the rest of the attack, and were to be taken back to the fleet along with the other injured soldiers for bacta tank treatment. Skywalker was left in charge of the remaining Republic forces, which were to set out for Poggle's primary droid foundry. Before departing the planet, Mundi overheard Skywalker and Tano boasting about their number of kills during the battle, and the Cerean noted that his own kill total of 65, which was greater than that of either of the two other Jedi and thus earned Skywalker's respect.

Anxious to return to the mission at hand, Mundi reviewed strategic charts and maps to help continue the search for Poggle, who had escaped the primary droid foundry. Mundi and Kenobi were contacted via holocomm by Unduli, who had been tracking Poggle and believed he was hiding at the nearby the Progate Temple. Mundi felt that location was unlikely because little would have survived the first wave of Republic attacks there, which would leave Poggle to exposure at the temple. Unduli nevertheless decided to investigate, despite Mundi's warnings against it due to an incoming sandstorm.

Later, Mundi stayed behind while Kenobi and Skywalker led forces into the temple to rescue her.

Mundi informed the others, who decided to send Tano and Offee to pick up the supplies while Mundi, Kenobi and Unduli took Poggle back to Coruscant to be interrogated. Later, on the Venator-class Star Destroyer making the voyage back to Coruscant, Skywalker informed Mundi, Kenobi, Unduli and Captain Rex that the ship carrying Tano and Offee has been infected by Geonosian brain worms. Skywalker later interrogated Poggle alone and learned the brain worms were susceptible to cold temperatures.

In doing so, McCaig experimented by drawing some unusual parodies of the elderly Obi-Wan Kenobi, including one with whale-like features, and an elongated head with ridges along the back of the neck. While drawing early conceptual sketches of the Jedi characters for the final film in the trilogy, Revenge of the Sith (2005), concept artist Derek Thompson proposed a version of Mundi that had lost his left eye during the battles of the Clone Wars and now wore an eye patch along with a black and gold cape.

However, George Lucas screened a video of Silas' audition and was so impressed he encouraged the actor to accept the role of Mundi, which led him to play the other parts as well. In addition to appearing on-screen, Carson also performed Mundi's voice, mimicking that of an elderly man who speaks slowly and deliberately. During the filming of The Phantom Menace, executive producer George Lucas had not yet decided whether he would keep Carson's voice or dub in that of another actor, as he had done for several other characters, but Lucas found he liked Carson's vocal performance and decided to keep it. To create Mundi's movements, Carson spent time with elderly people and watched the ways they moved and spoke. In crafting Mundi's manner of speech, Carson said he spoke slowly not only because of the Jedi's age, but because he believed Mundi was wise and would not waste his words."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucas did not give Carson any backstory from which to build his performance as Mundi, but simply left it up to the actor to create. Once the shooting of each film was completed, Carson did not know right away whether he would be returning for the next film.

They included a prosthetic head, fake hair and two cheek pieces that were built and glued onto Carson's face so they would actually move along with his facial reactions. During the first film, it took about four hours to apply Mundi's make-up and prosthesis, but in the later films the process was narrowed down to three hours. However, while the process took longer to prepare for Mundi than it did for Nute Gunray or Lott Dod, Carson said the Mundi make-up was less hot and comfortable to wear than those other character and that he would often walk around off-set and forget he had the make-up on at all. During filming for Attack of the Clones (2002), the make-up artists used a different brand of make-up glues and removers, causing Silas' skin to break out due to allergies. Silas was trained by stunt coordinator Nick Gillard for his lightsaber scenes in Attack of the Clones. Upon learning Mundi would be fighting in that film, Carson worked out a great deal before filming began to get physically fit, and claimed he was even outrunning some of the stunt performers.

The character uses a blue-bladed lightsaber in every other shot in the film, including those that come immediately before and after that particular shot. A scene was partially filmed for Attack of the Clones in which Mundi and Plo Koon led a group of Jedi on a raid of a Trade Federation ship during the battle of Geonosis. This scene did not appear in the final version of the film, but the rough cut and animations later became available on the official website for registered Hyperspace customers. That rough cut was also included among the deleted scenes for Attack of the Clones in the Star Wars: The Complete Saga Blu-ray collection, which was released in September 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the illustrated screenplay of Revenge of the Sith, Mundi was intended to be blasted by Bacara and his troops before having the chance to defend himself during Order 66."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Other appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ki-Adi-Mundi was voiced by Brian George in the 2008 series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
