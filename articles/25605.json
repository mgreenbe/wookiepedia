With the assistance of Garazeb Orrelios, a member of the Ghost crew, Chava was able to help find the way to Lira San, the ancient homeworld of the Lasat spoken of in legend.

In 3 BBY,[source?] Chava and Gron embarked on a quest to find Lira San, a legendary planet that was regarded as a sanctuary for the Lasat species. Their travels led them to smuggle themselves in a cargo container on Nixus Hub 218 where they were discovered by Imperial forces, who had been tipped off by the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka. However, Ohnaka had also alerted his one-time \"business partner\" Ezra Bridger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chava and Gron were promptly detained by Imperial stormtroopers, who intended to ship them to a detention camp. However, Ezra and his rebel cell rescued the two Lasat and overpowered their Imperial captors. Chava and Gron were delighted to learn that one of their rescuers was Garazeb Orrelios, a former Captain in the Honor Guard. As the two Lasat and their rebel rescuers made their way back to the rebels' starship Ghost, Chava told her rescuers that she and Gron were searching for Lira San. On the way, they were ambushed by more stormtroopers but managed to escape due to assistance from Ohnaka.

In order to find it, Chava told her hosts that a prophesied \"child\" had to first save the \"warrior\" and the \"fool.\" When the astromech droid Chopper commented in Binary that she was \"weird,\" Chava issued an angry rebuke. With the help of Ezra, Chava and Gron began a ritual designed to help them find Lira San. While Zeb was initially unwilling to help due to his lingering guilt over his failure to safeguard the Lasat royal family and Lasan, Ezra managed to convince the former Captain to help his Lasat compatriots protect their people by finding Lira San."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zeb reluctantly agreed to participate in the ritual. As part of the ritual, Chopper had projected a holographic map of the galaxy. Zeb then activated his bo-rifle in the ancient Lasat style which interacted with Chava's staff, producing a surge of electricity that pinpointed Lira San's location to a set of coordinates in Wild Space, an uncharted region outside of the Outer Rim Territories. Using these coordinates, Chava and her rebel hosts traveled to Lira San but found their path obstructed by a collapsed star cluster. The rebels were also trapped by an Arquitens-class command cruiser led by Agent Kallus which had emerged from hyperspace to capture or destroy them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Agent Kallus issued his ultimatum, Chava identified Kallus as the warrior doing his part. Due to the long-time animosity between Zeb and Kallus (who had played a role in the Fall of Lasan), Zeb was initially dismissive of Chava's observation. Chava then explained that there were many warriors, fools, and children. According to the prophecy, a child saw things not as they are but how they could be while the fool denied his destiny, and the warrior created his own destiny. Chava said that no one was ever just one of them, but rather in time, assumed all of these roles. After listening Chava's words, Zeb realized that he had to forge both his own destiny and that of his people."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the bo-rifle, Zeb guided the Ghost through the collapsed star cluster.

When they awoke, they sighted Lira San in the horizon. Chava and Gron accompanied Zeb on the Phantom to Lira San. There, they discovered that the planet was the original Lasat homeworld and was home to millions of Lasat already.
