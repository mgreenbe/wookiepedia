The Snivvian was born to Garl and Glomkettle Hierogryph, and dabbled in various acts of larceny and felony at an early age. He eventually found himself on the ecumenopolis of Taris, where he was able to set up various black market enterprises. Soon, he fell afoul of the Jedi Order. The Human Padawan Zayne Carrick was assigned to hunt down Hierogryph, although the Snivvian was largely successful at evading him. Eventually, the young Padawan apprehended him, but in a twist of fate, Carrick himself was then hunted by the Jedi Covenant of Taris, who were convinced that the Human was destined to become a Sith Lord, based on a vision they had recently experienced. The Jedi Masters had murdered their own Padawans, but Carrick's tardiness had saved him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hierogryph and Carrick fled, picking up Arkanian companions Jarael and Gorman \"Camper\" Vandrayk along the way, as well as the droid T1-LB. The Covenant Masters, led by Carrick's own master, Lucien Draay, were in constant pursuit of them, however, and had spread word that it was he that had killed the Padawans, with the Snivvian as his accomplice. Trying to lay low as a result, Hierogryph and his companions found themselves caught up in the Mandalorian Wars themselves, in the midst of various confrontations at Vanquo, Flashpoint, and Serroco. Along the way, they picked up new members of their retinue, such as the Mandalorian Rohlan Dyre, and the Trandoshan Slyssk. On Serroco, however, Hierogryph and Slyssk were separated from Carrick, and only narrowly escaped the Mandalorian nuclear strike against that planet. In escaping, however, they inadvertently saved half a battalion of Republic soldiers. The Ministry of Defense, failing to recognize Hierogryph as a criminal and a fugitive, decided to build a propaganda story around the Snivvian and his Trandoshan, giving rise to the character of \"Captain Benegryph Goodvalor,\" who in turn inspired holovids, restaurant chains, and assorted merchandise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterwards, Hierogryph fought with the Taris Resistance against the new Mandalorian occupation. There, he was reunited with Carrick, and subsequently, the two of them set out to clear the young Jedi's name. Braving an onslaught of Covenant Jedi, Hierogryph and Carrick were able to accomplish their goal during the Vindication campaign on Coruscant. In the wake of that operation, Carrick eschewed the option of becoming a Jedi Knight in favor of becoming Hierogryph's partner. Hierogryph and his crew subsequently took on slavers, as well as the Crucible, freeing slaves and participating in various competitions. Eventually, with the onset of the trial of Demagol, Hierogryph and Carrick returned to Coruscant, where the young Human revealed that he had been \"borrowing\" funds for a private project of his, called the Rogue Moon Project\u2014an organization dedicated to aiding ordinary people as the Mandalorian Wars raged. Similarly, Hierogryph had his own project\u2014Goodvalor's Little Bivoli, a thriving restaurant which attracted the loftiest of clientele. Now in possession of the Goodvalor's franchise, the Snivvian settled down as host of the restaurant, while Carrick went his separate way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born to Garl and Glomkettle Hierogryph, Marn had a brother, who worked as an actor. Marn found himself in a career of larceny and felony at an early age. At school, he blackmailed his headmaster into giving him a perfect record of attendance. While this garnered attention, it was not until he auctioned off the school grounds to foreign buyers that he was expelled. As a result, Garl and Glomkettle had Marn home-schooled, but this proved fruitless as the young Snivvian framed his tutor for racketeering. Fed up, Marn's parents had him sent offworld. Marn soon found himself in the company of illustrious and well known criminals, such as Davik Kang and Loopy \"The Lip\" Leverby. But he seldom gained the respect of his peers, as he would constantly betray and swindle any partners he had. One of his more infamous scams involved adopting the guise of \"Remulus Horne,\" a folk balladeer. As Horne, he instigated a \"holo-thon,\" urging viewers to donate 384,000 credits to his fictional charity. In due course, the authorities pulled his feed from the air."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Operations on Taris"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While living on the ecumenopolis world of Taris, Hierogryph's black-market operations garnered the notice of the Tarisian constabulary. He took the young Twi'lek Griff Vao under his wing, but his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was almost arrested five times during con-operations. Hierogryph believed that this was due to the fact that Vao was far too obvious during his scams, and would tell the target that they had been \"conned\" immediately after doing so. During the Mandalorian Wars, he started a fleek eel scam, under the alias \"Baron Hieromarn.\" Using the Market Street Outdoor Exchange as a platform, he insisted that fleek eel would soon be considered a delicacy, and that any investments in the venture would prove profitable. Claiming to be selling the product, he referred buyers onto \"a family friend\" at Junavex Hotel, and insisted upon hard currency, as there was a \"delay\" in transferring his accounts from Cadomai Prime."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, Hierogryph was enlisted by Zovius Mendu to help him flee the planet. Mendu, on the run from Jedi Master Feln, hoped to escape to Corellia. Hierogryph contacted Gorman Vandrayk, better known as \"Camper,\" who was able to refit an old escape pod into a shipping container, allowing Mendu to escape amongst a crate of dried dreeka fish. While the operation was a success, Hierogryph neglected to pay Vandrayk for his assistance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sector Constable Noana Sowrs soon tired of Hierogryph's scams, and enlisted the services of the Jedi Order. In turn, the Jedi of Taris dispatched Padawan Zayne Carrick. Fortunately for Hierogryph, Carrick was not particularly adept at his role, and would make many unsuccessful arrest attempts. On his seventh attempt, he was able to lure Hierogryph to the Upper City. Hierogryph believed he was entering a deal in which he would receive military-grade blaster packs. His rationale for such a potentially anti-Republic deal was that he was \"doing [his] part for the planetary defense.\" The merchant selling the packs was in fact Carrick, and the Jedi swiftly grabbed the Snivvian black-marketeer. While Carrick was searching for restraining binders, however, Hierogryph activated the Jedi's vehicle, sending Carrick hurtling through the Upper City. The Snivvian then made his escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Hierogryph gained intelligence of a ryll and lum shipment bound for Coruscant. Making a deal with the Highport Stevedore Guild, he dispatched a group of bulk-loader droids to switch the shipment with a thousand kegs of sewage. Meanwhile, he had the ryll and lum stored in an Upper City warehouse. He was able to interest a pair of buyers with better prices than the Hidden Beks or the Black Vulkars, and was confident enough in the ineptitude of the constabulary to make the transaction in broad daylight. Little did Hierogryph know that Carrick had already infiltrated the Snivvian's warehouse, and had dismantled his droids. When Carrick revealed himself, Hierogryph's customers fled, despite his claims that Carrick was just a \"Jedi Intern.\" Buying himself some time, Hierogryph remotely dropped several barrels of lum on Carrick, while pursuing the customers. The customers were well and truly gone, however, and Carrick was almost able to apprehend Hierogryph. Despite this, Hierogryph was immune to the Jedi's mind tricks, and was able to once again elude Carrick."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By nightfall, Hierogryph was trying to sell the demolished LB-series bulk-loading droids, and the tarnished merchandise to an Upper City contact. The deal struck, he noticed a purse of credits on the ground. Reaching to grab them, he was apprehended, for the ninth and final time, by Zayne Carrick. At first protesting by crying of robbery and murder, Hierogryph staged a diversion by throwing the purse amongst the crowd. Just as he thought he had made his escape, Carrick used the Force to stop him in his tracks. Carrick was in fact late for what he thought to be his own knighting ceremony, so he left the captive Snivvian cuffed to a speeder outside the Jedi Tower. Shortly thereafter, the young Jedi came hurtling back out, with five Masters of the Jedi Covenant in hot pursuit. They believed that Carrick, or his fellow students, would bring about the destruction of the Republic, and so set about killing them. Carrick, having turned up late, discovered their scheme, and fled, with Hierogryph in tow."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fugitive"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two fugitives eventually found their way to the Lower City via a garbage chute. Safe, for a while, Carrick explained the situation to Hierogryph, who began to suspect that it was Carrick who had murdered the Padawans, not the Covenant. The young Jedi was able to convince Hierogryph, however, before the Snivvian destroyed a surveillance droid of the Taris Civil Authority. The two then spotted a \"wanted\" sign for Carrick in the SoroSuub Landing, accompanied by another one for Hierogryph. The signs claimed that Carrick had indeed killed the Padawans, and that Hierogryph had helped. The Snivvian was enraged at the fact that he was being portrayed as an accessory to Carrick's crime, rather than the mastermind, and had a smaller bounty. Entering a Kedorzhan public house, Hierogryph treated the depressed Carrick to a drink. They then both ducked to avoid being spotted by sentients who are not blind, Zayne breaks a glass with the Force in anger for how his Masters massacred his friends in cold blood. Gryph suggested that perhaps his master is Sith (he mistakenly suggests Bith before being corrected) but Zayne denied the thought, recalling that his masters have always voiced their hate for the Sith. It then occurred him that this hate is suppose to be forbidden by the Jedi Order. Zayne insists to Gryph that if they are going to have to survive, then they need to retrace their steps to the events before the massacre."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Realizing that they needed to escape the planet, Hierogryph devised a plan. He intended to contact Vandrayk at Junk Junction and obtain a method of escape, but he told Carrick that they would be journeying to the dangerous Undercity. He had hoped that by telling Carrick they were going to the Undercity, he could sway the telepathic Jedi into thinking that was their destination. While Hierogryph was skeptical the gambit had worked, the Masters had in fact entered the Undercity, buying the two fugitives more time. Hierogryph obtained passage through the Lower City by bartering with a Wookiee cart driver, who would take them to Junk Junction. Upon getting off the cart, they were confronted by a pair of Black Vulkars. Seeing that the Wookiee had let them off at the wrong stop, Hierogryph was able to convince the Vulkars that the Wookiee had sewn spice capsules into his cart harness, creating a disturbance and allowing the pair of fugitives to escape unnoticed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pair were able to make it to Junk Junction with a minimum of fuss, but upon reaching Vandrayk's home, dubbed \"The Last Resort,\" they were set upon by Jarael. Jarael and Vandrayk were Arkanian offshoots, with the former caring for the frail latter. Jarael had seen the \"wanted\" signs, and demanded that the pair leave immediately. Carrick's supposed \"actions\" had prompted several companies to leave Taris, effectively ruining honest Lower City employees. This angered Jarael, but Hierogryph was able to persist until Vandrayk had emerged. Vandrayk too was in a foul mood, due to the fact that Hierogryph had still neglected to pay him for the Mendu operation. Just as Carrick prepared to leave, Constable Sowrs and four masters of the Covenant arrived, demanding that the young Jedi surrender himself. Fleeing into the refuge of Vandrayk's home, the old junk dealer revealed that the \"Last Resort\" was in fact a spaceworthy junk hauler. Escaping their pursuers, the foursome were able to make it to orbit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, The Last Resort stalled, and was nearly destroyed by Civil Authority police cruisers. Vandrayk was able to make quick repairs, however, and the craft sped towards Taris's inner debris field. Hierogryph was horrified, believing that the ship would surely crash in the treacherous field, but Jarael was able to pull up just in time. Suddenly, the Snivvian's skepticism became confidence; a turn that riled Jarael. She threatened to throw Hierogryph and his Jedi accomplice out through the airlock, before Hierogryph reasoned that the Civil Authority would question them anyway. The group decided to spend the \"night\" in the field, with Hierogryph sleeping in a space suit. Meanwhile, Carrick decided to move The Last Resort out of the field, while he contacted Jedi Master Vandar Tokare for guidance. Tokare, however, did not believe Carrick. Jarael, frustrated, had to move The Last Resort once again, in case Carrick's transmission had alerted the Civil Authority. Carrick had decided that he needed to retrace the events leading up to the Padawan Massacre, and so the group set out for the \"Rogue moon,\" where the Padawans had completed a training exercise in days prior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Carrick and Jarael investigated the moon looking for clues as to what the Covenant's motives were, Vandrayk and Hierogryph took The Last Resort to the far side of the moon for shelter. During their absence, Carrick's master, Lucien Draay, and the Civil Authority caught up with the fugitive Jedi. Just as they closed in, Vandrayk fired on and destroyed their ship, while Hierogryph retrieved Carrick, Jarael, and the remains of T1-LB, a droid formerly in the employ of the Jedi Order. Safe aboard The Last Resort, Vandrayk was able to access the droid's holographic memory, revealing to Carrick that the Jedi Covenant had predicted the death of the Republic at the hands of one of the present Padawans. While debating this, The Last Resort was captured by the Oroko, a pirate ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon capture, Hierogryph put his bartering skills to good use on the Oroko's captain, Valius Ying. He offered Ying access to all of his Taris warehouses in exchange for his freedom, and that of the Arkanians. Carrick, however, was the non-negotiable element of Ying's deal, and Hierogryph was forced to abandon him. He explained that Carrick was a \"losing hand,\" and more than he had bargained for. The young Jedi understood, and despite initial trepidations, resigned himself to his fate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hierogryph, however, felt guilty over the trade, since no one had ever sacrificed themselves for his gain. With the Arkanians in agreement, he bribed the Oroko's first mate into releasing The Last Resort in Taris's orbit. From there, the Snivvian and the Arkanians hatched a scheme to rescue Carrick. Jarael burst into the Jedi Tower, where the young Jedi was being condemned by the Covenant, wearing a red space suit that the masters had prophesied about. Wielding Carrick's lightsaber, she fended off the Masters, and used the low-gravity booster jets on the space suit to escape the tower. Meanwhile, Vandrayk and Hierogryph brought The Last Resort in next to the tower, allowing for a swift getaway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cheerfully reunited with Carrick, Hierogryph offered the young Jedi a place in his \"organization,\" which, in fact, consisted of only Hierogryph. The Snivvian believed that his brains, and Carrick's destructive power would either lead them to own the galaxy or destroy it\u2014in which case, Hierogryph planned to sell the remains for salvage. Carrick agreed, though he intended to hunt down the members of the Taris Covenant, until one of them confessed to their actions.

Journeying to Vanquo with his new friends, he set up a scam to steal Republic supplies from a small frontier camp. The group had gone without food for days by the time the operation was ready to begin. Jarael, disguised as Q'Anilia, sent a holographic image into the Republic camp with the help of Vandrayk, warning them of an impending Mandalorian attack, while T1-LB and Hierogryph created the pyrotechnics to support the claim. The Republic force fled, allowing the group to reap the benefits of a fully stocked warehouse.

They descended on the planet, and while Hierogryph, Vandrayk and Carrick were able to find shelter, Jarael, still disguised as a Jedi, was apprehended. Realizing that they could not rescue her immediately, Carrick led the others deep into the Vanquo woods, with Mandalorians in hot pursuit. He requested that Hierogryph aid in fending off the attackers, but the Snivvian refused. They reached The Last Resort, only to find it being hijacked by a Mandalorian, Rohlan Dyre.

Releasing Dyre to question him, they learned that Jarael was being taken to Flashpoint Stellar Research Station, a Mandalorian-held installation. There, she was to be interrogated by Demagol, a leading Mandalorian biologist.

Hierogryph had T1-LB drop a bag of mines stolen from Vanquo into the Flashpoint compound, and Carrick used the Force to attach them to the Mandalorian emplacements. Then, Hierogryph, disguised as \"Admiral Hierogryph of the Republic Cruiser Glomkettle,\" sent a transmission to the Mandalorians, claiming that his ship was nearby, and would attack Flashpoint if the they did not retreat immediately.

Resolving to pay the Arkanians to help them on their way, Hierogryph and company went to Telerath, the banking world. Since Hierogryph's accounts were frozen following the Padawan Massacre, and he was a wanted Snivvian, he sent Vandrayk and Jarael to retrieve the funds, with Vandrayk using the Snivvian's old alias of \"Baron Hyro Margryph.\" Their story was that \"Margryph\" had been confused with Hierogryph, that it was nothing more than a simple confusion of names, and that \"Margryph\" had full rights to access his money. Hierogryph coordinated the operation from The Last Resort and was incensed when \"Margryph\" began insulting his character in front of the banker, Arvan Carrick.

Fretting, Hierogryph urged Jarael to stop Vandrayk, before realizing that the numbers were in fact the code. As Arvan led the Arkanians to the banquet pavilions, they were ambushed by the Moomo Brothers, a pair of incompetent Ithorian bounty hunters. They captured Arvan, while Zayne and Hierogryph raced to the scene, hoping to avert potential disaster.

He played to the Ithorian's vanity, and claimed that he was a far superior hunter to his brother, Del. Hierogryph claimed that Carrick wanted to surrender himself to the Brothers, in exchange for Arvan's freedom. Dob, inebriated due to Hierogryph's willingness to foot the drinks bill, accepted the deal. Meanwhile, Carrick infiltrated the Moomo Williwaw, and rescued his father. Hierogryph arrived, claiming that Vandrayk was in fact the Jedi, and demanded that the Moomo Brothers hand over custody of Arvan.

Heading to the Obohn Gallery of the Industrial Aesthetic, Hierogryph negotiated with the curators, Dremullar Obohn di Garthos, and a Rodian by the name of \"Father.\" Claiming that the machinery was the work of Ineas Tikartine, Hierogryph initially failed to convince his marks, but Carrick was able to use a Jedi mind trick on them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Hierogryph could collect the money, however, Vandrayk barged into the gallery, demanding that the Snivvian return his machinery. Di Garthos did not tolerate the rowdy arguing in his gallery, and so set his Wookiee guards after the trio. Luckily for Hierogryph, though, he incorrectly assumed that Vandrayk was Tikartine, and that the creator of the artworks was aware that his work was stolen, which made the pieces more valuable. He paid Hierogryph double the Snivvian's original price. Carrick was displeased with the fact that he had aided in conning an innocent Muun, but Hierogryph was now able to further his plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Carrick bade the Arkanians goodbye, Hierogryph enlisted the services of a Trandoshan thief called Slyssk. Meeting Carrick in one of the cities, Hierogryph explained that he intended to make the most out of the war, and that he planned to travel to the frontier, to exploit the locals and the combatants. Slyssk delivered the ship: a provisioning ship called the Little Bivoli. The Trandoshan, however, reneged on the initial deal, demanding more credits from Hierogryph. Tiring of the banter, Hierogryph asked Carrick to bring down a damaged structure on Slyssk, while the Snivvian saved the Trandoshan. Slyssk was now bound to a life-debt, called ghrakhowsk.

Posing as the \"Host\" of the Bivoli, Hierogryph relegated Carrick to cleanup duties; a fact that riled the young Jedi fugitive. Nevertheless, the Bivoli was thriving on profits, and while Carrick argued that he wanted to clear his name, and not sully it, Hierogryph explained that he had always clamored for \"wanted\" status. He kept the scam going, despite Carrick's objections. During this time, Hierogryph had seven bounties on his head, with the total number of credits coming to 24,000.

Slyssk, for whatever reason, countermanded Hierogryph's orders, and when the Snivvian tasted the Trandoshan's breakfast fare, he agreed to keep the shop open for a little longer. Klaxons began to blare, signifying the Mandalorian arrival, and the Republic troops quickly purchased whatever the Bivoli staff could wrap for what could potentially be a grueling campaign ahead. Meanwhile Slyssk informed Hierogryph that they would not have enough fuel to reach orbit, let alone hyperspace.

As it turned out, the troop ship's flight crew had been asleep, and so Slyssk and Hierogryph had inadvertently saved half a battalion of Republic troops. Traveling to Chandrila, Hierogryph and Slyssk were met by members from the Ministry of Defense, who failed to recognize the pair as fugitives.

Also inspired by the character was the Goodvalor's restaurant chain, which had a franchise on Coruscant, named Goodvalor's Little Bivoli.

In return, Thalien would get the Padawan Massacre charges dropped, and most of the bounties lifted. Thinking that he could get the charges on Carrick dropped as well, Hierogryph increased his price, and Thalien obliged. He set up a high-tech communication system with Thalien, allowing him to contact the Skrilling on Coruscant without having to worry about Fett's planet-wide jamming system. He then joined the Hidden Beks, hoping to gain access to Taris's primary resistance group. In reality, Gadon Thek, leader of the Beks, was having trouble gaining an audience with the resistance group, as Constable Sowrs's children had been kidnapped during the invasion, and she blamed the Beks. Thalien, using the codename \"Mastermind,\" paid Thek a significant amount in Republic Credits, but this was not enough to solve the problem. Realizing that Carrick would provide the political leverage needed to contact the main resistance, Hierogryph sent Slyssk and Dob Moomo to find Carrick and bring him back to Taris.

During the preparations, young Mission Vao, sister of Griff, discovered that her elder brother had been hiding Sowrs's children, who had been captured by Brejik. Thek was livid, but Carrick was no longer needed as leverage for admittance to the resistance. The group set out on their swoops, with Gryph and Carrick joining them. They cut their way through the Mandalorian front lines until they reached the resistance base.

In the ensuing confusion, Hierogryph pounced on Jelavan, knocking her away from the incapacitated Carrick. Goravvus revealed himself and reeled Tey in, while Hierogryph revived Carrick. Thek was able to convince both Goravvus and Sowrs that Carrick meant no ill intent, and reunited the children with the constable. When Tey had been adequately sedated, Hierogryph took Goravvus aside, and explained his mission to the Senator. Hierogryph watched on the Senator contacted Thalien with the high-tech communication system, but was shocked when Del Moomo grasped the Goravvus. The holographic image of Thalien explained that Goravvus had become too much of a liability, and ordered Moomo to finish off the Senator. The situation grew more complex again as Master Tey intervened, grappling with the Ithorian.

Bardron, the representative of the organization named Franchise that had complete control over the duels, responded by promising to arrange a series of tragic accidents in the arena.

This, however, proved to be unsuccessful, as the Snivvian already had himself and Jarael disguised in preparation for the next part of his confidence trick. Jarael, disguised as a blue-skinned species, flirted with the composer for the games and managed to switch his data cube containing a score for the finals with a cube that contained the full version of Goethar's speech as well as the conversation of Bardron and Thalien, which exposed the Franchise's slave dealings. While Bardron's attempts to kill Carrick, Dyre, Goethar Kleej and his son, Aubin, went wrong, the composer was forced to play the speech and Jervo's confession, thus exposing Jervo's crimes for the audience, much to the joy of Marn Hierogryph. Soon afterward, Carrick and his companions, including Hierogryph, traveled to Pantolomin spaceport, where the Snivvian once again expressed certainty that Thalien would have a hard time explaining the recent incident.

On the planet, the Jedi Knight approached Jarael, trying to recruit her into joining him in the crusade movement against the Mandalorians. Hierogryph unwittingly mentioned Jarael's recently discovered Force talents which overjoyed Malak although Jarael was still unwilling to go with him. While Malak continued to try and convince Jarael, Dyre returned and was enraged at the fact that Malak was attempting to take her away. The Mandalorian struck Malak and a brawl between the two ensued. Malak was only stopped when two of his own comrades, Telettoh and Ferroh, arrived and were forced to restrain him, along with Carrick, who accompanied them. In an attempt to get Malak to leave, Carrick kissed Jarael, claiming that they were in love and were going far away from the war. The ruse was successful and Malak, rejected again by Jarael, left along with Ferroh and Telettoh.

Suddenly, a massive ship called the Gladiator emerged from hyperspace and launched Skyreaper drones at the escapees. Carrick and Jarael got back aboard with Dyre's help after rescuing as many slaves as they could. Unfortunately, they were at a major disadvantage; the Hot Prospect's gun turret only pointed one way and the ship couldn't maneuver to point. However, they fired drills and hooks at the ship to cause the targeted, pressurized areas on board to decompress before launching xenoboric acid at it. Despite the fact that the Gladiator was blind, it had the Skyreapers attack the Hot Prospect. In a plan to escape, Carrick had everyone jam the centrifuge on board the Hot Prospect; much to Hierogryph's dismay for it was processing the crystals they had harvested. At the same time as doing this, Carrick had Slyssk, piloting the ship, shut down the inertial compensators to cause the ship to spin so Jarael could fire at their attackers.

Hierogryph, now in a foul mood, joined Carrick in watching the scientist brought to the Old Senate Hall, where the trial was to take place. While there, Carrick briefly talked with Malak, who was also brought in to testify. Once he was done, Hierogryph, Carrick, Slyssk, and T1-LB all walked to Goodvalor's Little Bivoli.

By the time he had finished, Hierogryph began discussing the prospect of settling down and working at the restaurant with Slyssk, now that Carrick had his \"special project.\" An offhand comment from the Snivvian, however, prompted T1-LB to mention that the Rohlan Dyre they had encountered initially on Vanquo was not the same one that had been traveling with them since their escapade on Flashpoint, due to a large discrepancy in their weight. Carrick slowly came to the realization that the man they thought to be Rohlan Dyre was in fact Demagol\u2014in turn, the Demagol on trial at the Senate Hall was in fact the true Rohlan Dyre.

They eventually reached a garage, which Carrick had purchased with his borrowed money. While inside, Dyre, at Carrick's request, explained what he knew of Demagol, namely that he was a Zeltron named Antos Wyrick who had attempted to genetically engineer a breed of Force-sensitive mutants and raise them to become Mandalorian Knights, to serve as a counter to the Jedi that had proved to be a formidable enemy to the Mandalorians in the past.

The Rogue Moon Project was in fact an initiative that Carrick and Jelevan had set up after Carrick's refusal to become a Jedi Knight in the wake of Vindication; their intent was to aid ordinary people displaced and affected by the war. It was also made up of the families of those lost in the Padawan Massacre of Taris.

Hierogryph inspected the microtag, and discovered that it had been attached to the lightsaber of a dead Sith Lord, Exar Kun. The Snivvian realized that it must have been one of the artifacts taken from the Odryn warehouse by the Moomo Brothers; Carrick was highly alarmed, mentioning that Kun had lived to corrupt others, and that anything he touched might have been tainted by his spirit. The Human turned his attention back to locating Osadia, which is where he believed Wyrick would take Jarael, as it was the Arkanian offshoot's place of birth. Dyre contested that there was no way to locate the planet, however. After some musing, Carrick struck upon an idea\u2014Captain Dace Golliard, a member of the Crucible that Carrick had encountered before, and the slaver who originally captured Jarael, would know where to find the planet.

Meanwhile, an anonymous tip was passed on to Karath, bringing his fleet into the area. As Carrick predicted, Golliard was lured by the prospect of a confrontation between the Republic and the Mandalorians, and brought his ship, the Gladiator into the area, laying in wait. Fett's fleet exited hyperspace and engaged Karath's briefly, before departing the area. Carrick then contacted Karath, and alerted him towards Golliard's presence.

Doing so, Hierogryph noted that it was quite far away, and that the Hot Propsect would likely not reach the planet in time. Carrick was able to convince Karath to provide them with transportation, and so they were transferred to the Testament, which was under the command of Captain Telletoh.
