It served many functions, primarily as Duchess Satine Kryze's throne room, but also as a council chamber. During the Clone Wars, it even housed a failed attempt at an accord between the leaders of the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems to end the conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the seat of Mandalorian power, the throne room was the location for a number of duels and skirmishes as various factions jostled for control of Mandalore. In 20 BBY, Duchess Satine was killed there by Maul in front of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Shortly after Satine's death, Darth Sidious arrived on Mandalore, when he engaged in a duel with Maul and Savage Opress, killing Opress then defeating and capturing his former apprentice. In 19 BBY, Maul returned to Mandalore after being freed from captivity by Mandalorian super commandos; however, he hid out in the Undercity and left puppet Prime Minister Almec to govern from the throne room. During the Siege of Mandalore, the Nite Owls infiltrated the throne room and captured Almec there. Maul and Ahsoka Tano dueled in the throne room, before continuing their fight in the rafters of the city dome."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
