Bultar and Tsui arrive, bringing the total number of Jedi in attendance to eight. The Jedi began to debate what should be done about the Empire and the purge of their order, and Koffi Arana proposes going to the dark side to stop Vader. As the Jedi ponder this, a dark presence is sensed arriving. It is none other than Lord Vader. Secretly, Shadday has \"invited\" the Sith Lord, by spreading rumors saying that Obi-Wan would be there, in hopes of the Jedi group being able to trap and overwhelm Vader. To help her do this, she also employs the use of a cortosis weaved blade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader quickly dispatches one of the Jedi, Sia-Lan Wezz, and while fighting the other Jedi, promptly disposes of another, Ma'kis'shaalas. Shadday is able to corner Vader and dispose of his lightsaber blade with the cortosis weapon, but then Vader uses the Force to grab Shadday. He conquers her weapon, then snaps her neck. Using the cortosis blade, Vader disables the lightsabers of Roblio Dart\u00e9 and Arana. The Aleena Choi manages to sever Vader's hand and, with help from the others, bring him to \"surrender\". Arana does not believe that Vader is sincere, and when Bultar protests and points out the Jedi do not take the lives of unarmed opponents, Arana takes Bultar's saber, kills her, and heads after Vader. However, he underestimates him and Vader sends the cortosis blade still held by his hand through Arana with a wave of the hand, and grabs a spare lightsaber dropped by one of the dead Jedi. The three remaining Jedi rally together, and use the Force to send debris hurling at Vader. Almost incapacitated, Tsui Choi finally decides that it is necessary to finish Vader off, when a contingent of stormtroopers show up, and begin firing. Jastus Farr is fired upon and falls to his death, while Choi distracts the troopers for a chance for Dart\u00e9 to escape. But due to unexpected interference from Vader it is useless, and the two remaining Jedi succumb to the barrage of blaster fire. Vader returns to Coruscant, where his purge of the Jedi conclave has been forged into a legendary rumor that states Vader tracked down a nest of fifty Jedi and destroyed them all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There are a number of coloring inconsistencies insofar as lightsabers are concerned.
