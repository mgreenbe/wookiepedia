The fighter pilot designated Red Wing was tasked with overseeing the individual units that comprised the starfighter wing. In 4 ABY, the Rebel Alliance learned of the existence of a second Death Star undergoing construction in the remote Endor system. The Alliance Fleet traveled to the system to destroy the battlestation, consequently falling into a trap carefully orchestrated by Emperor Palpatine, ruler of the Galactic Empire. Red Wing led the Red Squadron fighter units into combat during the subsequent engagement with the Imperial Fleet, a battle that culminated with the destruction of the Death Star and the death of the Emperor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Red Wing was first mentioned in A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, released in 1984. \"Red Wing\" is briefly mentioned in the 1983 novelization of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, but it is not clear if the reference is to the pilot or Red Squadron as a whole.
