The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Although not mentioned in the quest dialogue, examining Brytok (identified as Lt. Errad Brytok in the game) revealed him to also be a Sergeant Major. As Errad Brytok was repeatedly identified as a lieutenant of the Imperial Navy, this additional rank of sergeant major displayed in the examination window was likely a result of game mechanics, and may or may not be canon. It may not have been impossible, however, for Errad Brytok to have held the additional rank of sergeant major in another branch of the Military, such as the Imperial Army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
