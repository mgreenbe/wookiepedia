The poster was similar to that of the Imperial Recruitment Poster, but it instead featured a red \"X\" over the Aurebesh writing and the Rebel Starbird spray-painted over a stormtrooper's helmet. Several of these were done by Rebel sympathizers during Empire Day festivities, with most being sold by Rebel Celebration Organizers for their equivalent holiday, Remembrance Day, although some Imperial Celebration Organizers were known to sell the defaced posters during festivities as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The defaced posters could be bought from either a Rebel Organizer or an Imperial organizer with the respective holiday's tokens.
