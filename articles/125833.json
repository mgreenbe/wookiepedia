The outer shell of the mine was weak enough to break when stepped upon. When the shell was broken, the dovin basal inside would create a singularity, instantaneously crushing to the size of molecules any nearby matter\u2014sentient or otherwise\u2014within the singularity's two-meter diameter. Due to the mines' fragility and lethality, the Yuuzhan Vong only distributed them to the most experienced or expendable warriors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yuuzhan Vong warriors used singularity mines during the extra-galactic species' invasion of the galaxy, engaging such governments as the New Republic.
