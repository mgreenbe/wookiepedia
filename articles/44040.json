Heavily modified, it featured a cloaking device that rendered it invisible to all known forms of energy. Staffed with Royal Guards and heavily armed with five sets of laser cannons, the transport was easily identified by a grey stripe that ran down the front of its beak-like cockpit. In 4 ABY, the Emperor notably used his shuttle to reach the second Death Star in orbit over Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
