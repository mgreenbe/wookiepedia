The main point of the battle was to destroy Bitt Panith's secret base that was located on the moon. There were three divisions in the battle plan: one to lead the battle and destroy the deflector shield generator, one to infiltrate the base once the shield was down, set charges inside, and destroy it, and one person who would go to Trandosha and persuade the locals not to get mixed up in the conflict. In the end, the Galactic Republic won the battle and the base was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
