Shots fired from a weapon equipped with a beam splitter diffused into a weaker spread shot rather than forming the blaster bolt, subsequently giving a single shot the potential to connect with multiple targets. The cost of a beam splitter was 1,250 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Troopers were known to use beam splitters in order to transform weaponry into effective standoff weapons used to pin down enemy troops and hold chokepoints in narrow starship corridors. Beam splitters were also used on starfighters such as the Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor, where they were connected to the starfighter's resonator shaft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
