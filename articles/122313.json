The Select Committee was headed by Ishin-Il-Raz at its inception in 19 BBY, and had a variable number of members. The COMPNOR charter provided for electoral and honorary means of being named a member of the Select Committee. At its height, the Select Committee numbered over 25,000 members, but Emperor Palpatine took interest in the body, and the membership dropped dramatically. Estimates on the Committee's membership ranged from 15,000 to 150 depending on the rank of the estimator, but the Committee refused to clear up the confusion surrounding the matter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
