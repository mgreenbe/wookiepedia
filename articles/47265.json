In 3643 BBY, Fau-Kes led a group of SIS agents who were sent to the planet Taris by General Var Suthra. The agents were tasked with locating Doctor Nasan Godera, a former Republic scientist, and the young Jedi Knight who had been sent to track down Godera; however, when Fau-Kes's team arrived at the Godera laboratory that was the Jedi's last known location, the SIS agents found it in ruins and filled with dead Imperials. Fau-Kes returned to Olaris, the Republic's main settlement on Taris, and coordinated the search from the Olaris Spaceport.
