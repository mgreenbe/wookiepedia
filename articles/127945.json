While on a reconnaissance mission to investigate a rendezvous point where the pirate Xhaxin was ambushed, Snoop released twin sensor pods to collect data on the area. While collecting the data, the Rogues engaged and defeated coralskippers which appeared from the wrecked hulls of the pirate's ships, while Snoop stayed back in safety. After the brief dogfight, Rogue Leader Colonel Gavin Darklighter ordered Snoop to return to the Ralroost and present the collected data to Admiral Kre'fey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
