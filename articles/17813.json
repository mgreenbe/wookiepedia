Containing only a four round magazine, the weapon could be fired in the general direction of a target, the special repulsor driven rounds seeking out the ionized particles that clung to recently fired blasters. So long as the target was in the general area, as well as in direct line of sight, the round would seek out the blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
