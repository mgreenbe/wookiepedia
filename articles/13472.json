Identifying the subsequent hypermatter trail, Captain Tabor Seitaron and Prelate Verge of the Galactic Empire had Imperial officers aboard their Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, the Herald, to liaise with Imperial forces to attack the 61st. After the second attack, in the Enrivi system, the 61st personnel celebrated winning against their attackers, but the gunnery crew stayed at their stations in fear of another attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the nineteen hours after battle in the Enrivi system, the 61st's starships made two course changes to try and throw off Imperial forces.

In a meeting after, Lieutenant Sairgon reflected that the Imperial forces had merely harried the battle group. To repair the corvette's hyperdrive, the 61st raided an Imperial heavy freighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle in the Chonsetta system appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
