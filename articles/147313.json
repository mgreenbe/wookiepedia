It was built by the ancient Zeffo species as the resting place of the Zeffo Sage Eilram."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A vaulted, subterranean structure constructed by the Zeffo, the facility was originally constructed as a proving ground and training facility for Zeffo Sages studying the nature of the Life Wind. Carved from the natural stone of the planet, the facility was built to harness the natural electromagnetic forces of the region, while ornamental wind chimes hung from the high ceilings. While the Life Wind was elevated in every aspect of the facility's architecture, the place was eventually converted into a tomb for the honored remains of Sages that had passed on. Chief among the venerated dead was Eilram, a Sage who held a place of significant veneration in Zeffo culture. The final resting place of Eilram was a domed chamber, the walls of which were decorated with an ornate carving of a wroshyr tree. The tomb was guarded by several droid guardians, towering automaton charged with the defense of the sacred chambers and their unplumbed secrets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Long after the disappearance of the Zeffo and the abandonment of the tomb, Jedi Master Eno Cordova explored the facility with his droid, BD-1, building a laboratory in the lands surrounding the ancient edifice. Delving deep into the history of the Zeffo, Cordova would leave many clues to his studies for future explorers to discover after the Great Jedi Purge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis, who was on a mission to restore his fallen Order, entered the tomb. While inside, he experienced a vision from his past, where his master, Jaro Tapal, instructed him on how to push objects with the Force. With this renewed ability, Kestis was able to enter the chamber where Eilram was buried, where BD-1 showed Cal a recording of Cordova in that tomb. Cordova pointed out the wroshyr carving, which indicated the Zeffo once had ties to Kashyyyk. He finished by saying that if the Zeffo had been on Kashyyyk, Wookiee Chieftain Tarfful would know of it. This led Kestis and his crew to travel there to find him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
