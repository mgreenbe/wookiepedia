Lorteli prohibited the Twi'lek lawyer Nawara Ven from continuing to aid Veila in the case as he had in a previous trial. Ven's role was briefly filled by the Bith Mardek Mool. However, after Mool tried to act as an intermediary for Chief of State Natasi Daala, offering Veila a deal to drop the charges in exchange for her spying on the Jedi Order, Veila fired him."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Dissolution of the Jedi Court and return to Court of Justice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Veila's friend, Jedi Knight Jaina Solo, asked Imperial Remnant Head of State Jagged Fel to find her a decent lawyer, and he arranged for the Bothan Eramuth Bwua'tu, uncle of the Galactic Alliance Admiral Nek Bwua'tu, to assist Veila. The Chagrian lawyer Sul Dekkon represented the Galactic Alliance in the case, and after Lorteli was dismissed from duty by Daala, the Falleen Judge Mavari Zudan presided over the trial."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Bwua'tu as her lawyer, Veila began to make progress in the court. However, an audio recording was eventually recovered of her final conversation with Pellaeon right before she killed him, again turning the jury against her. Meanwhile, after an attack on Nek Bwua'tu left the Admiral in a coma, Veila began to fear that Eramuth was too distracted to properly carry out her defense, and, despite Eramuth's insistence to the contrary, took on the support of an additional lawyer, Sardonne Sardon. Bwua'tu attempted to withdraw from the case, but Judge Zudan denied him; Bwua'tu then became increasingly disinterested in the trial. However, Veila realized that she fared better in her case with just Bwua'tu supporting her than she did with Bwua'tu and Sardon, she eventually decided to fire the latter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon afterward, the Jedi Order ousted Daala from her position as Chief of State and a Triumvirate including Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne, Senator Haydnat Treen, and General Merratt Jaxton took control of the Galactic Alliance. Nevertheless, the Jedi's influence was not enough to drop the charges against Veila; to the contrary, suspecting that the Jedi were trying to permanently take over the Alliance, the jury became biased against Veila and found her guilty despite the revelation that practically all the prosecution's evidence had been tampered with in some form. Veila was sentenced to death, and she was stationed in the Armand Isard Correctional Facility, along with the deposed Daala. Before long, however, Veila escaped the prison with Daala when the former Chief of State arranged for bounty hunter Boba Fett to break her free."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
