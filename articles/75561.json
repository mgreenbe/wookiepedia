Shortly after this publication, the computer game Star Wars: Rebellion (1998) placed Kessel in the Calaron sector. Rebellion made a number of arbitrary placements of planets for game-play purposes; consequently, Leland Chee, Keeper of the Holocron, has stated that when its placements conflict with existing canon placements, they are overridden. Its placement of Kessel is one such example to which this ruling applies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
