The weapon required two hands to wield. Gamorrean warriors, especially those hired out to crime lords throughout Hutt Space and surrounding areas, favored these heavy and ungainly weapons. Measuring a meter and half in length, they required tremendous strength to properly wield in combat. In spite of the weapons' association with the Gamorreans, Arg'garoks were valued as prestige weapons and were often found in the hands of Barabel and Houk bodyguards in the employ of the Hutt kajidics. More physical and belligerent Hutts were thought to have brandished such weapons themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
