The system's star was a red dwarf, and the system contained the planet Latoma and the asteroid Brugga, which was the secret base that Ti'mere's InfoServices operated from. Several other asteroids and comets were also present in the system. Due to the system's remote location and the fact that Latoma was not considered to be a useful planet, the Latoma system was not considered for commercial development."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
