Amber is also the oldest foreign Star Wars novels publisher which keeps publishing up to date. While there has been much complaint on the translation errors; Amber has employed no less than seventeen Star Wars translators throughout the last 16 years, or primitive cover adaptations, Amber is generally viewed by Polish fans as one of the most important factors to the EU's ongoing popularity in Poland."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first Star Wars novel published by Amber was Heir to the Empire (Dziedzic Imperium) translated by Anna and Jan Mickiewicz in 1994.
