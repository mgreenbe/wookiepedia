In exchange, he would help install Rikkar-Du as leader of all of the world's clans. Instead, Rikkar-Du informed a group of other clan chiefs of Kruhl's plans and proposed that they unite in order to oppose the Sith\u2013Imperials. Jassar and Tassa met him outside of a temple afterward, where Tassa's support for her husband led to a romantic moment. Rikkar-Du resisted kissing his wife, however, so as not to embarrass Jassar, and told her to take their son back to their tent at camp while he gathered his thoughts inside the temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving home, Jassar decided he wanted to be with his father and left to join him in meditation.

Rikkar-Du's entire family had become targets of Kruhl following the clan chief's defiance, and Kassek-Ka killed Tassa. Meanwhile, Jassar entered the temple and found Kruhl about to kill Rikkar-Du with a lightsaber.
