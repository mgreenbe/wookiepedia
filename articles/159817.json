In 137 ABY, Cade Skywalker and the crew of the Mynock went to Atirue's headquarters upon the invitation of Jool. There, Skywalker was introduced to Vedo Anjiliac Atirue, the crime lord leader of the Anjiliac kajidic. Atirue hired Skywalker's services to kill One Sith scientist Vul Isen as retaliation for the destruction of Da Soocha and the death of Atirue's nephew Azzim Anjiliac Atirue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They also ran into Naxy Screeger there, who was serving as Vedo's gatekeeper. He successfully managed to separate Skywalker from Wolf Sazen, Jariah Syn, and Deliah Blue.
