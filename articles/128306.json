During the conflict, the Solidarity was damaged in a battle and while it was being repaired, a group of Republic agents traveled to the ship in a Theta-class T-2c shuttle. Elasra had been tasked with retaking the planet Tirahnn from the Confederacy of Independent Systems and he briefed the agents on a mission that he was going to send them on, to reactivate an ion cannon that was located on the planet. The agents then left the Solidarity in a LAAT/s, along with some clone troopers and clone commandos, to carry out their assignment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The agents activated the cannon and it opened fire on the Separatist fleet that was orbiting Tirahnn. Elasra immediately brought the Solidarity and the rest of his battlegroup out of hyperspace near to the world, beginning the Battle of Tirahnn. About thirty minutes into the battle, the crew of the Solidarity contacted the agents over a secure channel, commanding them to allow the cannon to be placed under the Star Destroyer's direct control. Elasra then spoke to the agents via a hologram and sent them to place some homing beacons on some CIS tanks, so that the Solidarity could fire on the vehicles, preventing the threat that the tanks posed to the Republic forces on the planet. Elasra also dispatched a team of clone troopers to transport the captured Separatist commander Zolghast to the Solidarity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
