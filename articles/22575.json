When Antilles received supplies from the Gran Garsa, Caibol helped to collect the cargo. After the astromech droid R2-D2 attempted to attack the probe droid PTZ-1K, who had been attempting to send a message to the Galactic Empire, Antilles sent Caibol and Bonipa to take both R2-D2 and C-3PO for a memory wipe. However, R2-D2 escaped and returned to Antilles, informing him of the droid spy. When PTZ-1K attempted to send a transmission to the Empire, it was tricked by C-3PO into using an incompatible binary language, Caibol and Bonipa captured the droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
