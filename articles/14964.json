Members of the Coruscant Aegis Squadron, supported by the Republic navy, attempted to destroy a Sith space station, which was defended by several ships of the Imperial Navy. The Empire had constructed an illegal hidden space station in the Balosar system to act as a staging point for covert assaults on Republic territories. However, the Republic learned of this and sent a member of the Coruscant Aegis Squadron, supported by at least three Thranta-class corvettes, to destroy the space station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
