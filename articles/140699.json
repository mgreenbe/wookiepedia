The dish drew moisture from the mushrooms' juices, which was fortunate, as Tatooine was a desert world and so water was hard to come by. The dish also contained various chopped vegetables mixed with the fungus in a brown broth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point following the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs included a recipe for Tatooine Terrine in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook. Struggs described the dish as hearty, but not quite a soup, and suggested it would re-hydrate those that ate it, even after a day of work under Tatooine's twin suns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tatooine Terrine was created as a recipe for the real-life cookbook Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which was written by Marc Sumerak and Chelsea Monroe-Cassel.
