Living on the small islands that littered the surface of Bal'demnic, the Kon'me divided themselves into two prominent social classes, an upper-class that resided in luxurious bubble-like structures on oceanside cliffs, and a lower-class that lived in simple, thatch, beachside dwellings. Known to be extremely distrustful of off-worlders, the Kon'me tried to keep from involving themselves in larger galactic affairs unless absolutely necessary, but they were unable to avoid being forced into the Clone Wars when it was discovered that Bal'demnic's cliffs contained the rare mineral cortosis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded Bal'demnic, seeking to mine the cortosis ore, with the higher-class Kon'me reluctantly allowing the Separatists' occupation. However, the beachfront Kon'me were less compliant, and rebelled against the Confederate battle droid army. During the resulting battle, the Galactic Republic sent a detachment of its clone army led by a number of Jedi Knights to assist the Kon'me insurrection. The Kon'me rebels, however, seeing all the off-worlders as tyrannical invaders, fought back against both Confederate and Republic armies, eventually forcing the two intruding factions to leave Bal'demnic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kon'me were a sentient reptilian species from the ocean world Bal'demnic, in the Bak'rofsen system of the Auril sector. Humanoid in appearance, the Kon'me were pink hued with dark spots on their bodies, and had a large neck that extended from their torsos to a pointed head. The Kon'me possessed hands with three digits each along with feet with two digits, with which they were able to operate heavy machinery and weaponry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kon'me lived in the small, tropical beach islands that dotted Bal'demnic's watery surface.

Bal'demnic would likely have become a popular tourist destination\u2014being considered very beautiful and attractive by many off-worlders\u2014were it not for the Kon'me's isolationist policies, and as a result the Kon'me were viewed as an annoying and noisome species by the rest of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During battle, the Kon'me wore armor that included a breastplate, shoulder plates, and a helmet with a horizontal slit for their eyes to see through.

Nonetheless, the species was conquered by Ak'ghal Usar, a Dashade Shadow Killer who ruled the nearby planet of Urkupp, sometime before the Cron Supernova wiped out Urkupp in 3996 BBY. In 19 BBY\u2014the final year of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems\u2014Confederate Commerce Guild scouts found trace amounts of the rare mineral cortosis sheltered in Bal'demnic's island cliffs. Wanting to mine the cortosis\u2014a metal so dense it could even block lightsaber attacks\u2014for their war efforts against the Republic, and coinciding with their goal of directing Republic forces away from the Core Worlds, the Confederacy approached the upper-class Kon'me with an ultimatum: either allow the mining operations on Bal'demnic to begin or be destroyed by the Confederacy's battle droid army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeing little choice in the matter, the Kon'me leaders reluctantly permitted Commerce Guild miners to start their cortosis operations on Bal'demnic. However, the lower-class Kon'me, viewing the off-world miners as invaders, rebelled against the Separatist occupation, using powerful weapons smuggled to them by war profiteers hoping to take advantage of the situation. The Kon'me insurrection set up military barracks in the upper-class' bubble homes on the island cliffs, mounting their new high-tech blasters to drive back the Separatists. In response to the rebellion, the Confederacy dispatched OG-9 homing spider droids to overrun the Kon'me's positions, pushing Bal'demnic into chaos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Separatist transmissions regarding the situation on Bal'demnic were intercepted by the Jedi Order and the Republic. Jedi Master Mace Windu, not wanting the Confederacy to obtain cortosis that could be used against Jedi in the war, dispatched a detachment of the Grand Army of the Republic\u2014led by a number of Jedi Knights including Sha Koon and Halagad Ventor\u2014to sabotage the Confederate invasion in any way possible. However, once the Republic task force landed on Bal'demnic, the Kon'me freedom fighters, seeing the clone soldiers and their Jedi leaders as just another army of off-world invaders, opened fire on the Republic army as well as the Separatists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Baldemnic's island terrain made it difficult for the Republic and Separatist armies to maneuver, forcing both off-world factions to retreat from the planet's surface.

The chapter first aired on March 22, 2005, as part of the show's third season. The name of and a brief backstory on the Kon'me were later established by Arthur Papadam, writing under the pseudonym \"Arf Maul,\" for Bal'demnic's entry in the Databank, as part of the What's The Story? feature on StarWars.com.

The name of their homeworld was derived from the word \"condemn,\" which Papadam hoped might give \"the impression that the planet and its inhabitants are not as innocent as they might appear.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
