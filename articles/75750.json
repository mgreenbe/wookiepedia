In an attempt to end the war by capturing the leaders of both the Dimok and the Ripoblus, Imperial forces, under the command of Admiral Harkov boarded shuttle Keydon, along with shuttle Phantele towards the end of the Sepan campaign. Following the boarding, Imperial forces did not discover the leaders of the Dimok but instead discovered the children of Dimok leaders aboard Keydon. After the ship was boarded the Keydon was destroyed. The Dimok intended to use the children as hostages to seal a treaty between the Ripoblus and Dimok factions to join forces against the Imperial intervention."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
