The book detailed the four phases of Alliance soldier training and set rules that rebels were supposed to follow. For example, the guide prohibited nearly all possession of intoxicants. The first two phases of training were the same for all recruits, the third being different depending on if the trainee was going to be joining space or ground combat, and the final being only for Rebel Alliance Special Forces. When giving his training speech to nineteen recruits from the planet Haidoral Prime, First Sergeant Hazram Namir asked the recruit Roach if she had read the book, and when she claimed she had he told her she had wasted her time, as it was written by Generals who acted as though they were running a government, not a rebellion. After the establishment of the New Republic, Chass na Chadic noted that the guide was seen as a joke by some rebels and an insulting attempt to impose Imperial order on the Rebellion by others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Republic eventually attempted to apply its own standards more rigorously than the White Book was applied."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The White Book was first mentioned in Battlefront: Twilight Company, a novel written by Alexander Freed and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
