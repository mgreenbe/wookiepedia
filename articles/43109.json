A moderately successfull bounty hunter hunter operating in Wild Space, she had a reputation for preferring her targets dead instead of alive. Around 3631 BBY she took control of the Crimson Fang gang, which following the death of Empress Vaylin and formation of the Eternal Alliance took over Port Nowhere by force, planning to use the mobile space station as their base of operations. The Alliance sent a strike team on a mission to liberate Port Nowhere, who systematically rid the station of Outer Rim's most notorious villains, eventually confronting The Red Huntress and killing her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elarea Aldraste appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne as the final boss during the \"Crimson Fang\" Uprising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
