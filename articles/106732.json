It contained many roleplaying articles, including a rules supplement for the West End Games Star Wars D6 system. The article was called \"Iron Hands, Captive Hearts\" and was written by Joe Littrell. Like all supplements printed in Polyhedron prior to 2002, the article is considered ambiguously canon."}]}
