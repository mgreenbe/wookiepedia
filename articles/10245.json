During the attack, the droid verbally assaulted a security guard working at the facility, before setting off an explosion that destroyed the factory. The attack was one of several that MI-726 made on Imperial facilities and contributed to a bounty being placed on its head. The security guard who the droid insulted survived the attack and described it to Imperial authorities, claiming that the droid might have had organic accomplices. The information provided by the guard was later included in an Imperial bounty posting for MI-726."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack was created as part of the \"Bounties to Die For\", a 2001 article in the sixth issue of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Gamer magazine series.
