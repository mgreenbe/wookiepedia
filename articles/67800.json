They formed during the reign of the Galactic Empire once they took control of the Wookiee homeworld and turned oversight of it to Trandoshan slavers. Isolationist Wookiees believed that offworlders were not to be trusted and were quick to judge them, as they saw them as being supporters of either the Empire or Trandoshans, or even both."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
