Aboard the gunship, Rodian Senator Onaconda Farr is informing Jedi Master and General Kit Fisto of the Republic army about the current situation on Rodia. According to Senator Farr, the reason Farr contacted the Republic for assistance was because Rodian scouts have reported sightings of Confederate battle droids at the previously abandoned station, with Master Fisto guessing that the droids might be remnants of the Confederacy's recently failed invasion of Rodia. As the gunship lands near the station, Farr tells Fisto that whatever is occupying the area is also killing off the local wildlife. Fisto and several of his specially trained clone SCUBA troopers disembark the vessel while Farr waits onboard, with the Jedi Master assures the Senator that he will find and eliminate this new menace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fisto and several of his clone troopers dive into the swamp water, searching for any signs of enemy activity, while B1-Series battle droid sentries spot the Republic soldiers, engaging them in battle. Fisto, in the meantime, finds a mysterious mechanical device built into the bottom of the station while his men destroy the enemy battle droids. One of Fisto's clones note to the squad's clone commander that these appear to have been modified by someone. As Fisto investigates the strange device, someone fires at him from behind the machinery, killing a pair of the General's clone troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The assailant, the Patrolian bounty hunter Robonino, swims away from the device, trying to escape Master Fisto. Fisto pursues the mercenary, but Robonino fires back at the Jedi with his blaster pistol. When Fisto deflects the laser fire with his lightsaber, Robonino counters by throwing several thermal detonators at the Jedi. General Fisto manages to redirect the detonators into the underwater device using his power over the Force, but Fisto loses Robonino in the resulting explosion. Fisto swimps back up to the surface of the swamp, where the clone commander informs his general that the enemy battle droids have been deactivated, because the device\u2014a droid controller\u2014was destroyed. Fisto replies that this is good news, but the Jedi Master is dismayed that he was unable to catch the person guilty of all this destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the station secure, Fisto goes to reveal the situation to Senator Farr. The general explains to Farr that the environmental damaging going on at the station was not by Separatists hands, but by the fugitive bounty hunter. When Robonino reactivated the Confederate battle droids and built the droid controller at the bottom fo the station, he unintentionally cuased all of the hardship to the surrounding wild life. Farr is surprised by this news when a native Kwazel Maw sea creature emerges from the swamp water. Fisto tells his men to hold their fire as the large beast spits out Robonino, dazed but uninjured. As the clone troopers apprehend the bounty hunter, Fisto remarks how if one is good to nature, it will return your kindness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Conception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Clone Wars: Hunting the Hunters (Part II) is an eight-page webcomic and the twenty-third issue in The Clone Wars webcomic series.
