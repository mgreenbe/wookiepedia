Her parents divorced when she was still a child, and Quee opted to stay with her mother, who started Quee on her career in astronomy. A prodigy herself, Quee decided to leave the crowded Core Worlds at the age of fifteen, joining the Extragalactic Society, an organization that searched for signs of life beyond the known galaxy.

Quee was enjoying the world and her work there, and the fifteen other members of the station looked up to her as their nominal leader. She had already shown initiative, killing a redcrested cougar and repairing a damaged orbiting telescope. She was the leader of the station, keeping it running well through measures such as forbidding excessive ryll spice use, though she did allow the other crewmembers some small vices. However, Quee was unaware that one of her crewmembers was Yomin Carr, an advance scout for the Yuuzhan Vong, an extra-galactic species, who were preparing to launch an invasion of Quee's galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quee was delighted when the equipment scanning the edges of the galaxy discovered that what appeared to be an asteroid had breached the galactic edges. Tracking the \"asteroid,\" Quee and her crew determined that it was on a collision course with the planet Helska IV.

After reclassifying the \"asteroid\" as a \"comet\" because they had discovered a tail on it, Quee rounded up two members of her team, Bensin Tomri and Cho Badeleg.

Quee watched in horror as Miko sacrificed himself along with two Yuuzhan Vong warriors in an attempt to cover their escape. The two blasted off the planet in Jacen's stylus ship, which he had used to get into the icy world, and met up with Jaina in the main iceborer, who docked with their ship and launched them into hyperspace, flanked by the starships Millennium Falcon and Jade Sabre. In the close quarters of the stylus ship, Quee's grief for Reglia and her co-workers on Belkadan overcame her resolve and hardened exterior, and Jacen comforted her as she wept, both ignoring their bedraggled appearances, injuries, and scanty Yuuzhan Vong garb. Later, she provided the information she had gleaned from her captivity to Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker and the Solos, leading to the successful resolution of the Battle of Helska IV.

As Leia and the entrepreneur Lando Calrissian prepared to evacuate Dubrillion, Quee was ferried out on the Bothan Assault Cruiser Ralroost to the planet Dantooine, where Jacen, Luke, Mara, and Anakin Solo, the youngest Solo child, were waiting, along with many refugees. However, Quee's tutelage under Jaina was cut short when Jaina transferred into Rogue Squadron. Instead, Quee spent some time with Jacen Solo, and though she felt some feelings for him, especially after his rescuing her from the Yuuzhan Vong, she told him that she thought he was better for her as a friend."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quee later utilized her fledgling Force skills to help Leia ferret out disguised Yuuzhan Vong infiltrators in the Dantooine refugee camp via use of the Force, at the same time as the raging Battle of Dantooine. While doing so, she helped defend Calrissian from an attack by the Yuuzhan Vong spies. One of the Yuuzhan Vong attempted to use a child as a hostage, holding a purloined blaster to the child's head, but Quee used telekinesis to slip the power pack out of the blaster and Leia killed the Vong warrior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leia and Quee then journeyed to the planet Bastion to meet with Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon regarding Imperial support against the Yuuzhan Vong.

While there, she began working with the Mon Calamari Cilghal on a way to track and identify the yammosk war coordinators in the hope of also finding means to counter them. Just before the Yuuzhan Vong attack on Coruscant, Quee was stationed with Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne and her Wild Knights squadron and assisted them in their skirmishes against the Yuuzhan Vong. During a battle over the world of Arkania, Quee determined the gravitic frequencies that the yammosks used to communicate, and she also helped the Wild Knights shoot down coralskippers and avoid enemy fire as they flew through the enemy fleet, gathering valuable sensor data on the way. A significant aid to her work came at the Battle of Talfaglio when they were able to capture an intact, albeit frozen, yammosk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Quee was angry upon learning of the Mission to Myrkr, both at the foolhardy nature of the mission and that she had not been asked to go along by Luke Skywalker. In response, Quee buried herself in her gravitic research, and she and Cilghal took the starship Jade Shadow on a trip to the planet Borleias to ferry equipment there. The pair returned to Eclipse just as the Battle of Eclipse started when the Yuuzhan Vong chased the Star Destroyer Errant Venture through the system. By this time, Quee had developed methods for detecting the yammosks, though not how to disrupt their gravitic communications. Quee flew on the Wild Knights' blastboat again but was disappointed when they failed to capture a live yammosk, which she felt was vital to any future breakthroughs they would have on countering the yammosks. Thankfully though, Luke Skywalker was later able to retrieve one for her and her team at the Battle of the Black Bantha, ferrying it back to Eclipse for research and examination."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quee was again thrust into action with the Wild Knights at the Battle of Coruscant, flying once more with the Wild Knights in the massive engagement. In the midst of the battle, Quee helped coordinate attacks on the Yuuzhan Vong yammosks and a transmission from Cilghal completed the puzzle of the gravitic communications. As the capital burned, Quee activated her yammosk jamming for the first time, effecting the escape of the Millennium Falcon from Coruscant in the process, and finally providing a countermeasure for the Yuuzhan Vong's coordinators. The jamming, which disrupted the communications paths from the yammosks to the ships they controlled, threw the Yuuzhan Vong forces into disarray when used, depriving them of the eerie synchronization they had used to great effect throughout the war. Skywalker congratulated her on her achievement, saying that although her success had come too late for Coruscant it gave him hope for the future."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Coruscant fell, Danni Quee accompanied the Wild Knights and General Wedge Antilles's Fleet Group Three to Borleias, where she participated in the defense of the planet, with Wedge placing her in charge of all captured Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology. During that battle, Quee continued to work with the Wild Knights and also created a sensing device to determine if the Yuuzhan Vong were tracking refugee ships via one of their creatures. Her life was placed in danger when Tam Elgrin, a holocam operator forcibly controlled by the Yuuzhan Vong, was assigned to spy on her as she was working on the Starlancer Project. Her efforts convinced the Yuuzhan Vong of the dangerous nature of the weapon, as planned. Elgrin was ordered to kill her, but he resisted the order, feeling that she did not deserve to die and because he was smitten with her. Eventually, Elgrin resisted his controllers, overcame his conditioning, and confessed his spying to Jaina Solo, ending the threat to Quee's life for the time being."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The tide turns"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Quee did not stay on Borleias for the duration of the battle. Instead, she accompanied Luke, Mara, Jedi trainee Tahiri Veila, and Wraith Squadron to occupied Coruscant. Disguised as a Yuuzhan Vong warrior, Quee and the others explored the planet, examining what the Vong had done during their occupation. The studies of Quee and Baljos Arnjak, a member of Wraith Squadron, revealed that Coruscant was a thoroughly changed world and that it would not be the same for many years. Another part of their mission was learning the origins of the deranged Dark Jedi Lord Nyax after they stumbled into a secret chamber where he had been augmented to make him more lethal. Though she was Force-sensitive, Quee did not join the three other Jedi in hunting down Nyax, as she was scarcely trained and did not have a lightsaber. Her Jedi training, which had never really been a main focus for her, was sporadic, and she was not considered a full-fledged knight. Instead, she focused on her studies until the team evacuated in the starship Ugly Truth. Her Force-sensitivity did allow her to experience the disturbances and influences that Nyax generated, distressing her as she felt the commands, negative emotions, and pain he released. Returning to Borleias, she once again served the garrison there with her array of gravitic sensors and jamming devices in the concluding stages of the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following their evacuation from Borleias to Mon Calamari after the Domain Hul worldship was destroyed, Quee continued to conduct her research on Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology. However, the formation of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances caused her team to be transferred from the Jedi to the government. Her part of the theoretical work was deemed complete, and she was given little else to do, despite her prior achievements. Instead of scientific research, she began training in setting up resistance cells and communications, determined to remain involved in the war effort. The lapse in activity also gave her some spare time to spend with friends such as fellow astrophysicist Thespar Trode and Jacen Solo, who had just escaped from Yuuzhan Vong torture and captivity. While out on a diving trip with Jacen, Quee told him about a group of geneticist friends of hers who were working with the Chiss on the Yuuzhan Vong genome. Quee would also later attend a reception thrown in honor of the young Jedi Knights, including Jacen, many of whom had just been knighted. Many of the Knights soon left for the planet Kashyyyk to join Admiral Traest Kre'fey's fleet though, and she continued her work and training on the provisional capital of Mon Calamari."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Into the Unknown"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the final months of the war, she accompanied Jacen, Mara Jade Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, Saba Sebatyne,\u2014whom Quee persuaded to join them\u2014the astromech droid R2-D2, and Jedi healer Tekli to the Unknown Regions in an attempt to locate the living planet, Zonama Sekot.

The Jade Shadow avoided most of the combat, retreating to Yaga Minor with the rest of the Imperial fleet, although their reception by the Empire was somewhat frosty prior to the return of Pellaeon from Bastion. After Pellaeon and Jacen planned a trap for the Yuuzhan Vong at Borosk, Quee's yammosk detecting and jamming equipment was given to the Empire, and she flew in the Jade Shadow with Mara in the Battle of Borosk. However, when Saba Sebatyne proposed using a ship as bait for the Vong in order to free the slaves imprisoned inside a Yuuzhan Vong vessel, Pellaeon provided the Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser Braxant Bonecrusher as a sacrificial vessel to get them close to the slave-carrier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quee, armored in a combat jumpsuit, huddled in the Jade Shadow, which was docked inside the Bonecrusher's hangar bay, until Jacen and the droid brains flew the ship past the slave carrier. Once the slave ship extended tentacles into the dreadnaught to search for victims to capture, Quee and Sebatyne were pulled through them into the Yuuzhan Vong vessel. Once inside, Quee launched miniature assassin droids to attack the Yuuzhan Vong crew. With the crew defeated, she and Sebatyne got the prisoners out and back into the Bonecrusher using a mass of blorash jelly, where they were cut out and the ship then jumped to safety. The Empire went on to win the battle, and the Yuuzhan Vong retreated. The stunt of Quee, Jacen, and Sebatyne also earned them the esteem of the Empire, and the frigate Widowmaker joined their mission as an escort as they left the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The expedition journeyed from planet to planet, looking for hints and traces of Zonama Sekot. Over Munlali Mafir, after Jacen, Luke, and a small team of Imperials narrowly escaped the natives, they were met by a group of Chiss, who instructed them to arrive at the capital world of Csilla to request authorization to pass through Chiss space. In spite of their compliance, the Chiss initially denied their request to pass through, but gave them access to their massive library of written books of data and surveys. Quee was aided in her search for the living planet through the records, which gave them some information about Zonama Sekot's movements. Quee's knowledge of astronomy also was valuable in narrowing the data search; she suggested they focus on surveys of stars that had captured planets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On their way back to the Jade Shadow for a rest, Quee, Mara, Luke, and Soontir Fel\u2014a Human member of the Chiss Ascendancy\u2014were attacked by a group of Fel's Chiss rivals. The group pretended to surrender, but before they disembarked from their ice barge, Fel's wife Syal Antilles Fel programmed its cannons to fire at their adversaries, and the distraction was enough to allow the Jedi to quickly overwhelm their would-be captors. The result was that the Chiss became much more amicable towards them and gave them permission to pass through their space, but they still had yet to find a trace of Zonama Sekot. While Quee was talking with Jacen in the library about their relationship, her use of the phrase \"wandering satellites\" gave him an epiphany, and he realized that Zonama Sekot might have been acting as a moon in its journeys, going into orbit around another planet instead of around a star, as they had previously thought and based their search on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their new search yielded results and they deduced that Zonama Sekot was hiding in the Klasse Ephemora system, though hyperspace disturbances kept blocking them from reaching the system.

Quee was still knocked out by the evening, having been carried by stretcher to Senshi's compound, and Jacen attempted to use the Force to heal her, as he was worried about her condition. Quee's life was particularly threatened by an angry boras plant cluster, but Jacen convinced the plant to retreat while Sebatyne stood guard over her. Later, they realized that the whole kidnapping had been a test of them by Sekot and Quee awoke once the test was complete, none the worse for wear.

As the world prepared to arrive in Vong-occupied space, Quee explained the discoveries she had pioneered such as yammosk jamming and decoy dovin basals to the world at its request, so it could prepare for a final confrontation with the Yuuzhan Vong.

Instead, as Quee informed the others, the living world wanted to welcome the Vong to their new home, as the two species were closely related. Zonama Sekot revealed that it was a seed of the long-destroyed Yuuzhan Vong homeworld from antiquity and that it wished to bring the Yuuzhan Vong to it for the purpose of re-shaping their culture from conquest and savagery. Those Yuuzhan Vong vessels not destroyed by the Galactic Alliance armada attacking Coruscant were drawn to Zonama Sekot or were withdrawn and later surrendered by Warmaster Nas Choka, and the Yuuzhan Vong War ended after five destructive years.
