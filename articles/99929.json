Although it was more heavily armed, Old Republic was unable to consistently hit the Imperial ship. Its drive was disabled, and the Old Republic could do nothing but stand by while the Imperial ship destroyed the sensor drones the Alliance had placed on the edges of the Endor system. The Old Republic exploded with its entire crew onboard, just as its reinforcements arrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
