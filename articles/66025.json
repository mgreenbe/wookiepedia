Using his portable scanner he traced the freighter to that base. He fought his way into the base to the hangar where the ship is and his portable scanner alerts the stormtroopers who are guarding the ship to his presence and he kills the first stormtrooper and the other stormtrooper fires at him but he misses and hits the wall behind him before he is then killed before he proceeds into the ship. After stealing the ship, he flew it towards the underground tunnels and flew out from an exhaust hole to the surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
