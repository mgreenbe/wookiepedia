Firesprays were used to guard and patrol the prison moon Oovo 4, while bounty hunters Jango Fett and Boba Fett piloted a customized Firespray named Slave I throughout their career, which Jango had stolen from Oovo IV. Another bounty hunter, Koshka Frost, also flew her own Firespray-31. Amid a stalemate during the Outer Rim Sieges of the Clone Wars, a Firespray-31 was flown by a pro-Confederacy of Independent Systems racketeer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
