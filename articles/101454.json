Dooku, however, felt that the treaty was worthless and decided to take over the city's tibanna operations himself. A Munificent-class star frigate under the command of Captain Canteval was sent to the planet and local Separatist supporters led by Rynert began to smuggle B1-Series battle droids and droidekas into the city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker arrived at Taloraan to ensure that the planet remained loyal to the Republic, accompanied by Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Denache realized that the Jedi would detect his lies with the Force, so he faked illness and sent his emissary Sech Govlinder to negotiate in his place. However, after Tano accidentally discovered battle droids stocked within the city, Canteval ordered the droids to attack her and the other Jedi, revealing the Separatist presence within the city. The Jedi were captured, but Govlinder urged to keep them alive. After feeling manipulated by Dooku, Govlinder subsequently freed the Jedi and assisted them in retaking the city. After the Separatist forces were destroyed in the ensuing skirmish, Denache faced a dead-end. Having double-dealt the Republic and Dooku alike, he had no future, and committed suicide by stepping off the edge of the city and falling into the core of the gas giant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
