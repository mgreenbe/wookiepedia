During the Battle of Jakku, the Unity and her sister ships Concord and Amity were used as part of a wedge strategy to try and penetrate the dense Imperial starship formation above the planet Jakku. The Unity flanked the starboard side of the Concord. Both her sisters ships were destroyed during the battle, when the Punishment's commanding officer, Captain Groff, lost his nerve, and sent his ship in a collision course towards the Concord and Amity. During the battle, the Unity requested starfighter support to fend off Imperial fighters. It later launched orbital strikes against Imperial walkers to aid Commander Iden Versio and Captain Lindsey whose positions were under attack. The battle eventually ended as a decisive victory for the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Unity first appeared in Chuck Wendig's 2017 novel Aftermath: Empire's End, the third installment in The Aftermath Trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
