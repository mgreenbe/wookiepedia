Both were manufactured by Baktoid Armor Workshop, and the homing spider droid consisted of a spherical body suspended between four mechanical legs. A powerful reactor was at the heart of the central body, and this center armored reactor core also contained a red photoreceptor optical array and two comlink antennae."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The OG-9 homing spider droid, or referred to simply as the spider droid, moved slowly on its long mechanical legs. The legs contained heavy-duty joints, were armored to hide the inner hydraulics, and could straighten to raise the core.

The homing spider droid also possessed a bottom-mounted short-range laser cannon for defense against ground attacks.

At one point, a large number of B1-series battle droids, which were the main infantry soldiers of the Separatists, and at least three homing spider droids were all located together near dark mountains. During the Battle of Mimban, homing spider droids were among Separatist forces fighting against the Republic. During the fighting, spider droids and other battle droids engaged the Republic's 501st Legion and Mud Jumpers. Clone Captain \"Rex\" ordered the 501st to advance and for the Mud Jumpers to back up Jedi General Laan Tik. While Tik instead believed they could take care of themself, the Jedi was struck and killed, making the chain of command fall to Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks, who had been brought to interface with the local Mimbanese. Binks was at Tik's corpse, telling the body that Tik had been bombad, as a homing spider droid fired nearby.
