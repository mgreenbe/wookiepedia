Despite its remoteness, the planet Nouane was home to an elegant civilization that maintained libraries which drew philosophers and artists from the Core Worlds. The planet was renowned for its statecraft, and its ministers held considerable power on various worlds throughout the Republic. During the Alsakan Conflicts between Coruscant and Alsakan, Nouane was located on a hyperlane under Alsakan control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3963 BBY, during the Mandalorian Wars, Nouane was besieged and conquered by the nomadic Mandalorian warriors, who had passed through the system as part of a Coreward advance halted at the asteroid\u2013ringed Omonoth system. The Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders devastated the world, having despised its society. It was because of the Mandalorians' oppression that Nouane and the rest of the region petitioned for Republic assistance. The Mandalorians were eventually defeated, and the region of Nouane became affiliated with the Republic as an Allied Region, a term used to describe the various mini-empires that were assimilated by the Republic over time. Like all other Allied Regions, Nouane's leader was granted the title of Moff or Grand Moff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thousands of years later, in 19 BBY, Republic Supreme Chancellor Palpatine reorganized the galactic government into the first Galactic Empire.
