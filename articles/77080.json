The smugglers attempted to escape an XQ3 Platform AZ 77 that was part of a salvage yard that was also harboring fugitives, including a Rebel spy. A TIE Defender equipped with a tractor beam was assigned to disable any transport that tried to escape the station, the fighter was escorted by TIE Avengers to provide support. After Lin was disabled the Ko was soon afterwards launched and it tried to jump to Hyperspace. The transport was disabled and an assault transport boarded the YT-1300 and captured it. The events surrounding AZ 77 were recorded and recreated to train future pilots such as Maarek Stele in the Combat chamber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
