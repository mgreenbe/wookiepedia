When Sloane objected to Rax's methods, her attache Adea Rite tried to assassinate her. After escaping Chandrila, Sloane joined forces with the former rebel Brentin Lore Wexley to hunt down and kill Rax. With the help of Brentin and the New Republic operative Norra Wexley, Sloane managed to stop Rax from destroying Jakku along with the Imperial and New Republic fleets.

Chamas told Sloane that he suspected that the Count had a temper; in fact, the Count had flown into a rage after learning from his rival Baron Lero Danthe that the Empire had doubled Gorse's thorilide quota.

When Lieutenant Deltic expressed her concerns that destroying the moon would cause the thorilide crystals to dissolve, Sloane demanded that Vidian conduct a test to prove the viability of the test since it would have severe repercussions for Gorse. However, Vidian was prepared for this and produced fake test results under the pseudonym Lemuel Tharsa which supported his arguments that destroying the moon would not damage Cynda's thorilide crystals.

Sloane consulted the ship's sentinel droid and discovered that these path coordinates had been transmitted to other Imperials deemed loyal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The journey through the Unknown Regions took several months and involved taking several hyperspace jumps through a maze of black holes and superstorms. Sloane also found that the blaster wound in her abdomen had not fully healed. During her solitude, Sloane resolved that she would build a new Empire that was not given to the backstabbing and incest of Palpatine's former Empire which Rax had destroyed. After months of flying through the Unknown Regions, the Imperialis rendezvoused with the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Eclipse.

Captain Cardinal recalled that at least ten years before the attack on Tuanul, Brendol Hux had been preparing for a big meeting with Sloane and the other leaders of the First Order. At some point after, Cardinal went to speak with Armitage Hux about Phasma, a First Order captain, killing Brendol. During the conversation, Cardinal mentioned Sloane, starting to say what she would do if she were there. The young Hux cut him off, responding that she wasn't. Though Sloane was seen as a potential candidate to lead the First Order, rule of the remaining Imperial forces eventually fell to Supreme Leader Snoke, a mysterious figure secretly being controlled by the reborn Emperor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rae Sloane was an ambitious and loyal Imperial Navy officer who was devoted to serving Emperor Palpatine and his Galactic Empire. She chose to center her life on the Empire instead of having a wife or husband or becoming a mother. She was a tall, muscular human woman with brown skin and black hair. A meritorious officer, Sloane joined the Imperial Navy in order to escape having to work in a shipyard or loading dock in her homeworld of Ganthel. While staunchly loyal, Sloane did not hesitate to question orders which she deemed treasonous and counterproductive to the Empire's interests. As an Imperial cadet at the Defiance Flight Training Institute, Sloane chafed under Commandant Pell Baylo, a harsh but effective instructor who constantly berated his cadets. Using her mathematical skills, Sloane foiled a plot by Baylo to assassinate the Emperor and Darth Vader during a visit to her ship-based academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sloane was a diligent Imperial officer who did not expect any favors. Recognizing her dutiful nature, Tarkin appointed her as the captain of Count Vidian's Star Destroyer. As Captain of the Ultimatum, Sloane saw herself as a servant of the Galactic Empire. She had a tenuous working relationship with her superior Count Denetrius Vidian, the Empire's efficiency expert. While sharing Vidian's belief in the Empire, Sloane was uncomfortable with his volatile and narcissistic personality, micromanagement, and also observed discrepancies in Vidian's official biography. Sloane confided her concerns about Vidian with her fellow officer Commander Nibiru Chamas, who was secretly working for Vidian's rival Baron Lero Danthe. While Sloane expressed concerns about the repercussions of Vidian destroying the planet Gorse's moon Cynda, she complied with his plan after Vidian produced fake results claiming that the moon's detonation would not affect thorilide yields.

Despite missing an opportunity to arrest him, Sloane was still able to forge an \"alliance of convenience\" with Kanan after he appealed to her loyalty to the Empire in order to sabotage Vidian's plan to destroy Cynda.

An intelligent and rational woman, Sloane was able to see the flaws in the Empire's policies and strategies. As a senior Navy officer, Sloane was well-versed in military tactics.
