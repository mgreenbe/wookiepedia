Their attack force comprised of their CR90 corvette Thunderstrike, its escort the Braha'tok-class gunship Apailana's Promise and two X-wing starfighters. The dockyards fell in less than a day and the 61st took no casualties leaving what was left of the dockyards with almost a hundred burning luxury transports."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twilight company had raided its first target, Mardona III, as a part of Operation Ringbreaker in 3 ABY.

No soldiers had been lost, but several troopers had been injured and exhaustion had taken a toll. This would affect the Company in the next battle. The transports had been produced on Corellia and stored on Mardona III. These transports were for high ranking Imperial officers on the Imperial Ruling Council. The loss of these would force Corellia to produce more and detract supplies from Kuat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on the dockyards of Najan-Rovi first appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
