It was a double-barreled gun that came equipped with a flashlight attachment to provide visibility in dark ocean depths. During the Battle of Mon Cala, a detachment of Clone SCUBA troopers were equipped with these rifles. DC-12Us were carried by the SCUBA troopers successors, the Imperial seatroopers, during the invasion of Mon Cala."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Designed by BlasTech Industries for the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic's clone dive troopers, the DC-12U beam rifle was a heavy, double-barreled weapon developed from an older BlasTech blaster rifle built for use in wet, humid, or swamp-like environments. Equipped with a collapsible stock and an integrated under-barrel mount, the DC-12U fired two low-output blaster bolts with one pull of the trigger and was devastating in the proper hands. The under-barrel mount could also typically be equipped with a high-powered flashlight that provided visibility in the darkest depths of the various aquatic planets' oceans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of its particular mix of blaster gases and its special focusing elements that were used to optimize underwater operations, the DC-12U fired blue-colored blaster bolts as opposed to the typical red bolts emitted by most weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
