Designed by the greatest of the Balinaka sculptors, they were a mixture of sweeping curves, sharp angles and motorized sculptures. Designed to be modular so that entire sections could be replaced to better suit the artistic needs of the artisans creating Garnib crystal, each crystal factory also contained crystal mills, rooms that held the sonic baths responsible for the final shaping of the crystal. Each factory was located near an active volcano, or a fissure on the ocean floor, and geothermal energy was used to power the factories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
