It was marketed to mercenary and planetary defense force units during the war and was offered with a package deal complete with a compliment of Corellian Engineering Corporation produced starfighters and speeders outsourced from other manufacturers, typically a squadron of BTL Y-wing starfighters and Invader AA-9 Assault Airspeeders, Rush Troop Transport Speeders, and Overwatch MC-2 Mobile Command Speeders. However a combination of reduced sales after the war and Imperial edicts restricting sales of military-grade vessels led to the class being discontinued. Many Starbolt-class vessels remained in service with system defense navies after the class was discontinued but by the time the Galactic Civil War began they rarely carried the compliment of craft and ground vehicles they had been sold with. Mercenary groups and pirate bands also salvaged Starbolts for use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
