However, Wicket has other plans and quickly runs off, and Leia is left with no choice but to follow him. Wicket leads Leia to where two of Wicket's Ewok friends are being held captive by stormtroopers. The pair watch from behind a tree as the stormtroopers terrorize the little creatures. Leia, seeing the stormtrooper roughly disarm one of the Ewoks, boldy declares that they have to help Wicket's friends. However, once again, Wicket is one step ahead and begins climbing a nearby tree, narrowly making it to the top. As the stormtroopers continue to terrorize the Ewoks, Wicket springs a trap, dropping a rope ring around the two stormtroopers and jumping back off of the tree, keeping ahold of the rope. The force of Wicket's drop ties the rope around the troopers and pulls them up to the treetop. Once Wicket is back on the ground, though, he cannot withhold the weight of the troopers. Leia looks on as the rope pulls Wicket back up the tree and drops the troopers. The rope stops and leaves both Wicket and the troopers hanging midway up the tree. As the troopers fire on Wicket, Leia leaps up and grabs ahold of Wicket using her weight to pull the troopers back up to the top. The troopers hit the top of the tree and fall back to the ground with one of Wicket's friends catching the trooper's blaster. The three Ewoks then bring Leia to their village and as repayment for her heroics they gift her a garb dress. Leia dresses herself in the Ewok garb, and the Ewoks admire her new look. Leia jokingly asks if the dress comes with a spear and to her surprise, the Ewoks hand one over."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This episode reveals how Princess Leia gets the dress that she wears during Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi seen first during the Ewok banquet for C-3PO."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
