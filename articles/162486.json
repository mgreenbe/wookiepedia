This was a public ceremony in which a clan honored and respected its laws. These laws included not only particular expectations within the clan, but also shared with observers the laws and beliefs of the society in which the clan resided and in the case of off world clans, the laws of the homeworld of Ryloth. Tales stated that the ceremony was presided over by a crystal skull carved from the crystallized ashes of the Jedi Lord Newar Forrth, ruler and protector of Ryloth during the New Sith Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
