He served under Heget, a respected combat commander, and Danthe followed his superior to the remote Kathol sector when Heget requested a transfer. During Danthe's time in the sector, the local ruler, Moff Kentor Sarne, withdrew the region from the Empire in 4 ABY, and had established himself as a warlord. By 8 ABY, Danthe held the rank of Major, and was Heget's second-in-command at Imperial Depot 4290-1 on the planet Shintel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 8 ABY, Moff Sarne's capital of Kal'Shebbol was attacked by New Republic forces, forcing him to retreat with his forces. Falling back to Shintel, Sarne began uploading the arsenal supplies from the depot and transferring loyal personnel from the base to his fleet, and dumping those he considered \"traitors\" on the planet. Sarne also arranged for the destruction of all hyperdrive units on ships stationed on Shintel, along with all hyperspace-capable courier droids. Finally, he placed an ion minefield in orbit. Sarne left the outpost with orders to hold the depot and construct a landing field suitable for Skipray Blastboats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The introduction of new personnel to the depot fractured the harmony that Heget's command had instilled, and the base split into factions. Heget's faction saw Sarne's actions as a betrayal, and wanted to disregard his commands and seek to contact Imperial authorities. Danthe and his followers, however, believed that Sarne would return and that his extreme measures were meant to preserve the security of the outpost. However, Danthe also contended that their duty was to re-establish contact with Imperial command to inform them of Sarne's actions so they could either stop him, or at least prevent from returning to Imperial-controlled space. Out of respect for Heget's authority, he was careful to not voice his opinion in front of the men, so as not to undermine the Colonel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A week after Sarne's departure, the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar arrived in orbit. Heget invited the corvette to land, which they did after clearing a path through the ion minefield. Danthe joined Heget in greeting the command crew of the FarStar, and was present when Heget offered a deal to the New Republic delegation; information on Sarne's whereabouts in exchange for passage to the Tanquilla Beach shadowport to contact Imperial command. Unlike his commander, Danthe saw no reason to ally with the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Danthe was a young officer who had suntanned skin and close-cropped blond hair, and was noted for his ready smile.
