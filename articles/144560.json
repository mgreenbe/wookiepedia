This period allowed Wookiees to resolve their personal aggression before they were ready to return to Kashyyyk and serve their villages and clans, and was considered a wise policy that avoided the confinement of brash young Wookiees in their small homes. The Wookiee Chewbacca began his rising path at fifty years old in 150 BBY, likely motivated by a need to break free from his father Attichitcuk's shadow. Chewbacca would only occasionally return to Kashyyyk rather than settle down permanently."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"The Rising Path\" was mentioned in Chewbacca's DataBank entry in the 2001 LucasArts Video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
