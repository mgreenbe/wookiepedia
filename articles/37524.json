The famed Rendaran-class assault shuttle Lucky Lancer, carrying a payload of short-range torpedoes improvised from hundreds of thermal detonators and transparisteel tubing, broke through a screen of Imperial starfighters amidst the fighting and launched its payload directly into the flagship's engines from a distance of just over a kilometer, destroying the vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
