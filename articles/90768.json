After Mira's husband, the former Jedi Master Eeth Koth, was confronted by Darth Vader, Mira took her newborn baby and met her father, who told her to board a Star Commuter 2000 shuttle. Before Mira could, her path was blocked by an Inquisitor. Mira begged the Inquisitor to let her go, which she did, being helped aboard the shuttle by her father. As the shuttle began to leave, the Inquisitor used the Force to pull Mira's baby out of the craft and back down onto the ground. While Mira wept for her lost child, her father consoled her, telling her that there was a chance that her baby would be kept alive because she didn't kill the baby and that someday they might meet her again. However, Mira grabbed him and asked what they wanted her for."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mira's father had light brown eyes and light tan skin.
