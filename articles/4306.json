At the time that Obi-Wan Kenobi was imprisoned there, Agruss was an obese man confined to a hover chair.

He oversaw the Kadavo slave processing facility, the center of slaving operations on the planet Kadavo. Around 21 BBY, the captured Togruta population of the planet Kiros was sent to Kadavo to undergo processing under Agruss's supervision. However, the disappearance of Kiros's residents had not escaped the notice of the Galactic Republic, and an investigation led three Jedi\u2014Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano\u2014and Clone Captain CT-7567, \"Rex,\" to the Zygerrian homeworld, where all were captured by Zygerrian forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Skywalker and Tano remained captive on Zygerria, Kenobi, Rex, and Kiros Governor Roshti were sent to the processing hub on Kadavo. Agruss was on hand to greet Kenobi when he and his fellow captives arrived on the planet. While the Keeper expressed his excitement at having a Jedi at the processing facility, he immediately demonstrated his authority in an attempt to force Kenobi into submission\u2014without warning, Agruss had several Togruta slaves dropped into the volcano above which the processing hub rested. He proclaimed that any attempt at disobedience on Kenobi's part would only result in the further suffering of others. Even Kenobi's attempts at helping the Togruta slaves backfired, causing them to avoid the Jedi or risk further pain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Agruss, under the order of Count Dooku, prepared to execute Obi-Wan and Rex, but the men of the Republic overpowered the guards while Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano led an assault by clone forces to liberate the slaves. Under threat of capture or worse, Arguss tortured Togruta slaves to force the Republic troops to stop, then destroyed the control panels that would have enabled their rescue. At this moment, Obi-Wan took possession of his lightsaber and pointed it at the slavemaster, who scoffed and claimed that the moralistic Jedi would not kill an unarmed man. Rex, enraged by the treatment of his men, the slaves and the Jedi at the hands of Arguss, quipped that he was no Jedi and threw an electrostaff taken from a guard. Arguss was impaled by the weapon and, in distress and agony, he flew his repulsorchair into a bank of monitors and was electrocuted. He died almost immediately, and his corpse was incinerated when the labor processing hub was destroyed by Republic forces after their personnel were evacuated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character who would later be named Agruss was originally created by Henry Gilroy for the first story arc of The Clone Wars comic series, Slaves of the Republic.

Because the three episodes\u2014\"Kidnapped,\" \"Slaves of the Republic,\" and \"Escape from Kadavo\"\u2014were not direct adaptations of the comic arc, many differences existed between the two versions of the story. While the basic plot remained the same, the Keeper and several other characters underwent significant transformations for their TV appearances. Voiced by Victor Brandt, the Keeper appeared in \"Slaves of the Republic\" and \"Escape from Kadavo,\" first receiving the name Agruss in the former's online guide on StarWars.com."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Escape from Kadavo\" introduced a continuity error involving Agruss's fate. In the comic conclusion to the story arc, the Keeper is arrested for his slaving activities; in the TV conclusion to the story he is killed by Captain Rex. As The Clone Wars TV series constitutes a higher form of canon than the comic series, the events of the TV series take precedence, indicating that death is Agruss's canonical fate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
