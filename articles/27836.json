Kenobi orders his troops to mount up, and an army of clones jump onto their speeder bikes to intercept the droids. The two bands of swoop riders enter into a mass joust, both clone and droid alike being impaled or thrown aside. During the joust, Obi-Wan and Durge both slay many of their respective enemies. During a time in which both sides have great casualties, the two commanders engage in personal combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they fight, Durge deprives Kenobi of his lance, so Kenobi brandishes his lightsaber and destroys Durge's swoop bike with it. The swoop explodes, but the bounty hunter walks unharmed from the inferno. Kenobi charges in to skewer Durge, but in a display of speed, strength and coordination, the bounty hunter catches Kenobi's swoop by the steering vanes and flips the Jedi off. Durge then charges Kenobi, wielding the swoop as a club, but Kenobi slices it to pieces and stabs Durge through the chest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his being a Gen'Dai, Durge easily survives the stabbing, and proceeds to laugh and beat Kenobi with his fists. Kenobi, with his saber still lodged in Durge's chest, can't retaliate, and is lifted bodily off the ground by a solid punch in the gut. Durge proceeds to fire at Kenobi with a small rapid projectile launcher, but the Jedi deflects the slugs with the Force. Switching to a flame thrower, Durge's attacks are again deflected and Kenobi crushes the flame thrower with the Force. Brandishing a massive flail, Durge attempts to finish off Kenobi, but Kenobi uses the Force to summon his lightsaber and severs the flails chain. Brandishing his two blaster pistols, Durge is disarmed before he can use them. Switching on energy shields in his gauntlets, he deflects Kenobi's lightsaber slashes, but is unable to adequately counter-attack. Kenobi presses his advantage, with Durge barely blocking, until finally, Kenobi slices off Durge's arm and bisects him through the middle. After seemingly defeating Durge, he proceeds to join the ARC troopers. Captain Fordo reports that his troopers are in position. Taking off on his speeder bike, he leaves Durge's remains, which, unknown to the Jedi, begin to rejoin and heal themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}]}
