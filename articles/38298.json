Two weeks after the rescue of a Sullustan tech staff by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, leaders of the Sullustan resistance movement agreed to open diplomatic talks on the planet Sullust to discuss entrance into the Alliance. However, the summit was attacked by the Imperial Star Destroyer Invincible, as part of Operation Strike Fear. Rebel pilots Hamo Blastwell and Keyan Farlander, flying R-22 Spearheads, held off the Imperial starfighters until the meeting was concluded and all ships fled into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
