As a Jedi Knight, he took Qui-Gon Jinn as his Padawan and later trained Komari Vosa.

Before he became a Padawan, Dooku studied diplomacy and signed up for special tutorials in Senate procedure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 89 BBY, Jedi Master Thame Cerulian chose Dooku as his apprentice as soon as Dooku turned thirteen. Cerulian sat on the Jedi High Council, and was renowned as a historian. Dooku had several friends when he was younger, including fellow Initiate Lorian Nod and alien senatorial aide Eero Iridian. However, Lorian Nod was jealous of Dooku being chosen as a Padawan before him. Insecure about his future as a Jedi, Nod stole the Dark Holocron from the Jedi Archives, trying to gain an edge over other prospective Padawans. Dooku visited Nod's room to try and talk his friend into returning the holocron. However, the pair were interrupted by Master Oppo Rancisis, who discovered the stolen item.

The next day, the two were on opposite sides in an urban tracking exercise and ended up brawling with each other. After Yoda broke up the fight, Dooku and Nod were examined individually before the Jedi Council. Dooku told the truth about the theft of the holocron, and Nod was cast out of the Jedi Order. The pair became bitter enemies. This experience made Dooku wary of friendship and attachment, and he became paranoid about the possibility of betrayal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even though he studied under Cerulian, Yoda took a particular interest in the young Dooku and was frequently his adviser and confidant. The Jedi Master, however, was equally quick to point out Dooku's flaws when necessary. He also assisted in Dooku's lightsaber training as a Padawan. Building from this foundation, Dooku became an accomplished duelist with the weapon. In his later years, few Jedi Masters were considered equal to Dooku's skill with a lightsaber. Under Cerulian's tutelage, Dooku became a powerful Jedi. He was the most gifted Padawan Cerulian had ever seen, and Dooku learned much from his Master.

The two were quite close in age, with only ten years separating them. When only ten, Jinn had impressed Dooku with his potential. Even though Dooku was still a Padawan himself at the time, he succeeded in convincing Yoda that he and Jinn would be a good match. Three years into Jinn's apprenticeship, Dooku and his Padawan were assigned to protect Senator Blix Annon from pirates who were kidnapping senators for ransom. On the senator's ship, Dooku met up with his old friend, Eero Iridian, who was now serving as Blix's aide. Pirates attacked the vessel, exploiting weaknesses in the design, and Blix Annon was kidnapped despite the actions of the two Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the raid, Dooku recognized one of the pirates as his old friend Lorian Nod and became obsessed with not allowing Nod to win. He neither told his apprentice that he knew the kidnapper nor did he inform the Jedi Council of his failure to protect Senator Annon. Dooku suspected that the security weaknesses and malfunctions on the senator's craft during the battle has been deliberate sabotage, since the craft had recently undergone a security retrofit. He traced the sabotage of the senator's ship back to the responsible factory on the polluted ice world of Von-Alai."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Jinn's help, Dooku discovered that the factory was owned by Caravan, a corporation belonging to Nod that used child labor on its assembly lines. While they were investigating further, Eero Iridian arrived. Telling the Jedi that he'd found a worker willing to talk to them, he lured the pair into an ambush. There, Colicoid Eradicator droids suddenly appeared and threatened the two Jedi. Iridian had betrayed his early friendship with Dooku and was now working for Lorian Nod. Dooku and Jinn were forced to surrender in order to avoid collateral damage to the factory's numerous child workers. They were injected with toxins that paralyzed them and rendered them unconscious. The incapacitated Jedi were subsequently transported to Lorian Nod's headquarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Jedi woke up in an unfamiliar room some time later, restrained by stun cuffs. They had been captured by Nod, who spoke to them and said he planned to hold them until Senator Annon was ransomed. Unfortunately for Nod, the senator died from a sudden heart attack. This panicked Iridian, who rushed into the room where the Jedi were held and began to argue with the pirate leader. During their quarrel, Dooku broke free from his restraints and used the Force to summon his lightsaber through the door Iridian had opened. Dooku then dueled with Nod, intending to kill him. Only Jinn's objection stopped him from slaying his overmatched foe. Instead, Dooku arrested the two pirates and returned to Coruscant with his apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After further service with the Jedi Order, including a final mission that lasted two years, Jinn was ready to face the Jedi Trials. Before the pair parted, Dooku advised Jinn that his need for connection with other beings was dangerous, and betrayal should never catch him by surprise. Jinn passed the Jedi Trials, and became a Jedi Knight. Having successfully trained an apprentice, Dooku was promoted to a Jedi Master. While Dooku and Jinn had been an effective team, their relationship after Jinn's Knighting was distant. However, Dooku was a great influence on his Padawan. Jinn followed Dooku's moral teachings as opposed to Yoda's in later life. He heeded all of Dooku's lessons except his last one, concerning the inevitability of betrayal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Jedi Master, Dooku was one of the most highly regarded lightsaber instructors in the Jedi Order. Recordings of Dooku demonstrating lightsaber techniques were recorded on the Great Holocron and became mandatory viewing for two generations of Padawans. In addition, a lecture by Dooku on telekinesis was recorded by Jedi Master Asli Krimsan and preserved in her holocron. In the recording, Dooku described an encounter he had with Master Yoda when he was seven, in which Yoda asked him to move a pot with the Force. While Dooku thought the pot was light, and successfully moved it, it was actually massively heavy. During his time as an instructor within the Jedi Temple, Dooku's teachings on methods for conquering arrogance were also particularly well received."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku was offered a place on the Jedi Council, but he turned it down so that he could remain more independent as a proactive peacekeeper. The Council agreed that his skills made him well suited for such field work. Despite this prior refusal, he was later offered another seat and accepted. Dooku was known as a political idealist and was skilled at resolving disputes throughout the galaxy. One such intervention was in the Sevarcos Dispute of 52 BBY. Dooku became friends with many younger Jedi, such as Mace Windu and Sifo-Dyas, and was considered part of the \"Old Guard\" of potential, current, and former Jedi Council members. Some time after the mission to Sevarcos he took a new apprentice, a young woman named Komari Vosa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, Dooku was part of a diplomatic envoy aboard a consular ship.

An emergency call for aid by Galidraan's governor against a Mandalorian invasion prompted a swift but ill-prepared Jedi response.

However, the governor was secretly working with Vizsla and had no intention of letting Fett live after the task was completed. He decided to use the Jedi to destroy the True Mandalorians, and enlisted their aid by claiming the Mandalorians had invaded and were slaughtering political dissidents. The Death Watch impersonated Fett's forces and murdered noncombatants to further incriminate the True Mandalorians in the eyes of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku was aware of the Mandalorians' reputation as warriors and requested reinforcements from the Jedi Council. The urgency of the situation, however, required him to use only his initial task force. The Jedi were given the coordinates of Fett's camp and surrounded it; Dooku demanded their surrender. Instead, Fett ordered the Mandalorians to open fire. The encounter decimated both sides. The battle concluded after the deaths of eleven Jedi and the near-complete destruction of Fett's forces. Fett was captured alive after killing several Jedi with his bare hands. Upon orders from the Jedi Council, Dooku turned Fett over to the planet's governor without further investigation. The governor took Fett's armor and sold him into slavery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While he was at the time unaware of the extent by which the Jedi had been manipulated, Dooku learned shortly thereafter how the Council and the Jedi had been used to further the governor's personal motives.

Dooku took a particular interest in the fate of Jango Fett, who had earned his respect as a warrior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku's apprentice Komari Vosa was one of the survivors at Galidraan and was said to have killed twenty Mandalorians personally. While Dooku praised her skills with a lightsaber, he was not convinced she was worthy of becoming a Jedi Knight.

Shortly thereafter, Dooku resigned from the Jedi Order, retired to Serenno, and claimed his family title of Count, left vacant by the death of his brother, while his nephew, Adan, and his sister in law went into self-exile on Alderaan.

In addition, Dooku had inadvertently foiled a number of plans envisioned by Plagueis's former master to create intersystem dissent in the Expansion Region. Though Plagueis had no plans to replace Palpatine as his apprentice, Palpatine's reckless assassination of Senator Vidar Kim had brought to Plagueis's attention the possibility of Palpatine getting himself killed or exposed. As such, he viewed Dooku as a potential apprentice should Palpatine succumb to such a fate. He had also toyed with the idea of indirectly turning Dooku to the dark side and using him to create a schism within the Jedi Order.

To Palpatine's surprise however, Dooku revealed that his line of thought had quickly changed, and that he now sought a potential alliance with the Sith, as he believed that they shared his aim to reforge the galaxy. In addition, he revealed that he thought of the Jedi Council as being at least as responsible for Qui-Gon's death as the Sith who had killed him, and that it was their perceived short-sightedness and obstinacy which had truly lead him to leave the Order. Palpatine did not reveal himself at that point, unsure of Dooku's true allegiances.

Their influence in the galactic underworld was strong enough that Sidious considered them a threat to the plans of the Sith. This \"threat\" had grown because of their new leader, Komari Vosa, Dooku's former apprentice.

In addition, he appreciated the lack of acrobatics that the style possessed, and was fairly disdainful of combat styles that utilized extensive acrobatics like Ataru.

His bladework was outstandingly elegant and precise, displaying a pin-point accurate and unpredictable offense reinforced by an almost effortless defense that were so thoroughly practiced to the point that he could do it on instinct. Dooku's style was fluidly defensive, using his superior mobility and balance as well as feints to entrap his opponents, and footwork to outmaneuver, basing himself on balance, back-and-forth charges and sudden retreats, to work his way around opponents, aptly deflecting and evading their attacks rather than trying to meet them head-to-head first with ease, allowing him to effectively conserve his energy in order to later unleash rapid and devastating counters.

Dooku was also able to completely dodge many of Kenobi's parries and blocks from interfering with his bladework, forcing him to retreat. Eventually, Dooku swiftly brought down by guiding the final bladelock into Kenobi's leg and then soundly inflicting another light, though damaging cut in his left arm. Dooku also matched Anakin's use of his Force powers with his precision and when Anakin, having quickly tired, left a slight opening, Dooku was able to slice his hand off and defeat him due to his far more energy efficient Makashi proving to win over Anakin's use of the Force to augment himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His skill in Form II was so great that he was capable of effectively overcoming the weaknesses of the form, as shown by how he could hold his own against up to three opponents with little difficulty, despite the fact that Makashi was not suited for combat against multiple opponents, and was also extremely competent at deflecting blaster bolts, despite Makashi's weakness against projectile weapons, and although Dooku had a great deal of difficulty producing any kinetic energy in his attacks just like any other Makashi user, he showed the ability to compromise this flaw to a remarkable degree by repeatedly defeating power duelists and his constant ability to outfight Anakin Skywalker, a master of Djem So. However, Dooku ultimately proved still susceptible to the aforementioned flaw, as shown by how Savage Opress, having acquired a considerable amount of skill with a lighstaber after only a few training sessions with Dooku and possessed juggernaut-like strength, managed to disarm him when fighting alongside Ventress, and most prominently was with Anakin whenever Skywalker tapped upon his rage, as on all occasions Dooku was overwhelmed and eventually in their final duel this culminated in Anakin striking him down without much effort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Dooku's primary specialization was Makashi, he was still highly knowledgeable of the other forms, being considered one of the Temple's best lightsaber instructors.

It also seems that Dooku at times applied the forms to a degree and combined them with his usage of Makashi to overcome it's weaknesses, implying he also had decent practical skills but simply chose not to use them. His ability to make short work of blaster-wielding foes can be attributed to his ability in either Shien or Soresu, while his proficiency in combining Force attacks clearly showed his competence in Niman.

Also, although he disliked using Ataru's acrobatics, he had showed the ability to perform them with outstanding skill on one occasion when he dominated both Anakin and Kenobi. From his spars with Qui-Gon Jinn, Dooku managed to see through all of the weaknesses of Ataru, hence knowing how to counter it's acrobatic attacks.
