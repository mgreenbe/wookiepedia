They were responsible for performing cybernetic surgeries and training many espionage agents who stole data from the Corporate Alliance, one of the commerce guilds. When one of the base's agents, Denlace Sachoore, was arrested for stealing data from the Alliance, the base was discovered. The Alliance decided to eliminate the organization, and a raid was launched on the asteroid. Several NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcers proceeded to attack the center, destroying it and killing every slicer inside the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Separatist Crisis in 22 BBY, a cyborg slicer team funded by shadowy parties worked in a secret compound located on a remote asteroid named Yirt-4138-Grek-12 in the Fakir sector, which was controlled by the Corporate Alliance, one of the many commerce guilds. In the compound, the team trained espionage agents, supplying them by building starships for them and performing cybernetic surgeries on them to aid in their theft of valuable data from the data stores of the Corporate Alliance. However, one of the facility's agents, Denlace Sachoore\u2014who had received a cranium-implanted vessel drive through surgery\u2014was caught embezzling Alliance data in the vessel drive while working as a clerk for the Alliance. The Alliance's expeditors interrogated her, and, approximately a month later, her espionage origins were traced to Yirt-4138-Grek-12."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The facility now discovered, the Corporate Alliance Directorate\u2014headed by Magistrate Passel Argente\u2014decided to neutralize the base and the team as a threat to their revenues. Several NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcers were transported to the asteroid, where they attacked the base with their laser and missile weaponry. The structure was breached and de-pressurized, and twenty-five cyborgs perished inside it. Their deaths were later reported in Magistrate Argente's holomessage to shareholders of the Alliance, and in an article of HoloNet News."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The team consisted of individuals with knowledge of slicing who had undergone surgery that enhanced them with cybernetics. Their compound on Yirt-4138-Grek-12 contained several suites that were used to produce starships and perform surgeries, as well as train agents. These unauthorized operations were illegal according to the laws of the Galactic Republic, the ruling government of the galaxy, and the organization was kept hidden by its financiers. While the team showed creativity with their cybernetics, such as the vessel drive, Denlace Sachoore's capture led to the downfall of the whole group. As they were located in Alliance space, the raid which claimed their lives fell within legal boundaries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The team was first mentioned in the in-universe HoloNet News Vol. 531 48 article Corporate Alliance Attacks Slicer Compound, part of the HoloNet News volume released on March 21, 2002.
