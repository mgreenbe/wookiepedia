In the meantime Greyshade, tired of being upstaged by Luke Skywalker's noble actions, decides to allow Luke and Leia to leave with their droids on his ship while he stays behind to cover their escape. After they depart, Strom confronts the wounded Greyshade, intent on carrying out some revenge. Greyshade foils that as well by tossing a proton grenade in Strom's direction, killing him but also fatally wounding himself and critically damaging his droid Master-Com. In the meantime, Chewbacca is leaving the main event of The Big Game with his partner Han Solo, who, although seemingly getting killed in the event, now reveals himself to be perfectly healthy. The two make their way to the Millennium Falcon and leave The Wheel just in time to confront Darth Vader's battlecruiser. But Luke, while piloting the space yacht, stuns Vader through the use of the Force for just long enough for both Rebel craft to escape into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
