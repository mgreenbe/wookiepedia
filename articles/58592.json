Produced by the Arakyd Industries, the attachment could only be used with blaster rifles or heavy blaster rifles and was sold for 1750. The barrel gave greater damage output and armor penetration but meant the barrel and frame of the weapon were under more stress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The HH780 was first mentioned in the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
