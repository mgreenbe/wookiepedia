Earlier in his life, he was an adventurer and discovered two star systems. A few years after the Clone Wars ended which resulted the birth of the Galactic Empire, the Imperials launched a military offensive to suppress the influence of the separatists on Ostor. Keen and the other separatist leaders helped set up a defense strategy. This allowed the separatist general Atticus Farstar to almost completely wipe out a first wave of the empire. However, the defense did not stand up to a second wave of attacks, and Keen and the other leaders perished during the course of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
