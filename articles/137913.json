Similar in form to the Muur Talisman and Dreypa Talisman, the Syn Talisman was intended to be the most powerful of the three Sith amulets created by Syn. Though mentioned in passing in the pages of the Chronicle of Sorzus Syn, the details surrounding the Syn Talisman were largely unknown to later generations of Force users, with Luke Skywalker expressing hope that it and other such talismans had not survived the passage of the millennia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
