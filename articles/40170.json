In 21 BBY, the second year of the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic dispatched a fleet to the planet Kothlis in order to thwart a Confederate planetary invasion led by General Grievous, who was intent on eliminating the Bothan Spynet. Drayk was subsequently assigned to the battle group bound for Kothlis. When the Republic fleet arrived near Kothlis, Grievous made use of a computer virus that jammed the communication systems of the Republic starships. Although their mission was complicated because of the virus, Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker ordered a counterattack. The Republic's clone trooper forces landed on Kothlis' surface and fought against the Confederacy's battle droids, suffering heavy losses due to the unexpectedly large number of droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, the Republic fleet restored their communication systems and forced Grievous to withdraw from the system. Skywalker subsequently led squadrons of Republic starfighters to support the ground troops on Kothlis, and the Republic forces eventually defeated the remaining battle droids. Because Kenobi had been injured during the battle and Skywalker was needed elsewhere, Captain Drayk received orders to conclude the work on Kothlis, since the Confederate attack had left heavy damages. Clone Sergeants Ven and Ando also remained on Kothlis to help coordinate the troops."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Drayk was raised and trained on the planet Kamino.
