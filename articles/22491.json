The story told by the family about him was that he had stolen Caden's starship and stranded him on a minor moon. After Caden's escape, he tracked the man all the way to Orondia to take his revenge. By the time of Caden's great-granddaughter Avon, the family did not know whether the legend was actually true, but in the immediate aftermath of the destruction of the Steady Wing as a result of sabotage, Avon believed that the tale of revenge told in the story was more logical than sitting around and doing nothing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
