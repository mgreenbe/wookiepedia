His ship, the Zorba Express, was impounded. Prime Justice Doori-Doori sentenced the Hutt to forty-five standard years in prison for the crime, and alerted local security forces to be vigilant of breakout attempts. Zorba's lawyer, Bequin Fobas, attempted to appeal the sentence but was reminded that the Kips had no such process. The Hutt Grand Council then attempted to extradite Zorba to Nal Hutta, but the Kips would not allow this either. Republic Judiciaries were called in as a third party and supported the Kips' decisions. The illegally mined gemstones were not recovered; Zorba had hidden them away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zorba's plight made galactic news, and the case was featured in an edition of HoloNet News.

Zorba dug up his hidden gemstones and fled the world, retaking the Zorba Express, which the Kips had been unable to operate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
