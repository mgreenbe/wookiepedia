It is perhaps most significant for establishing that the Tonnika sisters seen in A New Hope were in fact Shada D'ukal and Karoly D'ulin in disguise.

In jail, a guard named Riij Winward knows they're impersonators and as proof tells them he knew about the crash-landed Strike cruiser, and where the real Tonnika sisters are. He frees them in exchange for leading him to the crash site before the sand conceals the entrance to the already half-buried cruiser. They go to the Dune Sea, and Riij tells them what the Hammertong really is: part of the Death Star II's superlaser. He reveals also he is member of the Rebel Alliance, asks for the weapon, and gives them an offer to join the Alliance. They refuse to give him Hammertong and are ready to return to their home planet, until they learn Riij took their droid with the blueprints of Hammertong inside it. They decide not to go after him, and Shada seriously considers joining the Rebels on her own if Karoly refuses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This short story erroneously refers to Docking Bay 94 on Tatooine as Docking Bay 97."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
