It resisted blaster bolts and helped the wearer avoid sweat stains when worn as a bottom layer. In 32 BBY, Karlini silk was one of the principal agricultural exports of Karlinus (along with its tea), and its sector neighbor, Naboo, imported it in bulk. It was common once for artists and students from Naboo to spend a season monitoring the droids that harvested the silk; this typically earned them enough money to set themselves up well. By the time of Queen Amidala's reign, the practice had become so uncommon that mentioning that her sister had participated might be enough to reveal Amidala's civilian identity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several gowns worn by Amidala and her handmaidens were made of Karlini silk. During the Invasion of Naboo, Sab\u00e9, one of Amidala's handmaidens, wore a large black dress made out of Karlini silk when she was acting as the decoy Queen. The flame-colored robes the handmaidens wore to complement that gown also included under-robes made of Karlini silk; Yan\u00e9 later tore the robes belonging to herself and Sach\u00e9 into shreds in order to weave coded messages."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
