The outpost was often empty and unused, serving only as a temporary refuge for desert travelers, or a meeting site for illicit bargains and criminal deals. Occasionally, Imperial sandtroopers would use the Outpost as a base of operations during long desert patrol operations. Sunfire Outpost was watched by the Tusken Raiders, who would attack any parties who stayed there for too long."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
