Tukalda took a dislike to Wexley after the two found political differences during a community dinner party. When Resistance X-wings were landed outside Wexley's home, Tukalda reported the sighting to the First Order, but, when things escalated and Wedge and Norra fought the guards, Norra instantly knocked Tukalda out with a punch to the head.
