While needing to stall for time when posing as the Imperial Moff Tan Hubi at the Moncaladrome, Tunga Arpagion decided to perform the unabridged version of Amon Daak with the protocol droid C-3PO. Arpagion took the role of Arthoni, while C-3PO played Panai. Their performance was interrupted midway by stormtroopers, who had been alerted that the Moff was an impersonator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
