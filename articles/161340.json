It was located northeast of the city of Parrlay and a short distance west of New Centrif. The eastern side of the city was bordered by a lake filled with fish. Vis had two entrances, one from the northern side of New Centrif and another from the south. The other borders of the city were covered by trees. The ground in the city was covered in paved paths with some grassy patches. The buildings and uniforms of the people in Vis were decorated with purple patterns. Two flags adorned the northern entrance, and near them was a troop center and a power core."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Above those structures were three residential buildings on a raised stretch of land, two were square shaped while the other was a taller apartment block. In another raised area in the northeast corner of the city there was a transmitter that relayed offworld communications, which was protected by a rectangular light wall. Another circular residential building was placed next to the lake and near a flower bed. South of the transmitter there was a power core and another circular building, which was surrounded by trees on its northern side. The center of the town held a small obelisk monument, two prefab shelters were placed on each side of the path leading to it from the south. Many of the buildings in Vis were similar in style to those used in Theed, Naboo's capital. A body of water called Lake Vis was located west of the city of Harte Secur The surrounding area of the city was called the Vis district, which contained skybridges."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An individual with the title of Earl of Vis was a noted historical figure on Naboo and cousin of an ancient king. The earl built a large banqueting rotunda in Theed and owned a castle on the planet's Western Reaches. Vis was an early target of the Trade Federation during the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY. The company wished to prevent word of their invasion from reaching the Galactic Republic, and on the personal orders of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious they targeted the transmitters at Vis, New Centrif, and Parrlay. At the time of the invasion, Vis was defended by eight royal trooper recruits, four royal troopers, three Tuskcat Troopers, and a V-19 landspeeder. A strike force of the Droid Army led by the B1-Series battle droid OOM-9 that included two Single Trooper Aerial Platforms, four heavy beetle droids, and eight B1 battle droids landed on Naboo in a C-9979 landing craft and initially approached New Centrif."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOM-9 deemed that he needed reinforcements to take the city, choosing instead to attack Vis first. Another C-9979 landing craft landing in a clearing south of Vis and unloaded droids commanded by the droid EEK-176, which included four droidekas, four B1 battle droids, and four heavy beetle droids. Both groups flanked the people of Vis, killing its defenders and razing it completely, with the beetle droids burning down the transmitter. Afterwards, the Droid Army attacked New Centrif with their reinforcements, destroying the transmitter there along with the one in Parrlay. Later in the invasion, the Sith apprentice Darth Maul speculated that Queen Amidala would return to Theed Royal Palace through the skybridges of the Vis district."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vis was first mentioned in the 2000 reference book, Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Episode I. It appeared in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds as a target in the first level of the Trade Federation campaign, entitled \"Beachhead.\" The player has the option of attacking New Centrif first, but the Prima Games strategy guide states that the player will lose almost all of their battle droids and should destroy Vis first. The strategy guide also described a spaceport as the target of the player's attack, rather than a single transmitter. The four royal troopers and the V-19 landspeeder are only present in Vis if the player attempts the level on hard difficulty, being absent from the easy and moderate difficulties. The Naboo mounted troopers in the game originally rode kaadu, which were replaced with tusk cats in the 2002 expansion Clone Campaigns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
