The durasteel heavy arms were capped with restraining forks, and kept cargo secure. The upper, jointed arms were used for precise work, such as basic maintenance and clearing production lines of obstructions. The droid's repulsor drive was housed in its tail unit, and was capable of supporting up to ten times the droid's own weight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SRT droids were utilized around the clock in brutal factory environments, and most burned out their original components in less than a year. Aside from cargo hauling, these droids operated as factory overseers, keeping lookout on production through their heat-shielded photoreceptors. The SRTs were in constant communication with factory central computers, though their artificial intelligence was low enough that they focused solely on the job in hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Created by Baktoid Combat Automata, SRT droids saw use in the very factories in which they were constructed. Many variations on the design arose among dozens of competing companies, including a Publictechnic model that utilized a large, bin-like holder instead of the Baktoid model's flat pallet. The GoCorp/Utilitech collaboration included a fully enclosed, boxcar-like carrying area. Many such droids found work as garbage collectors across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SRT droids were employed in the droid factories on Geonosis. C-3PO encountered one prior to the First Battle of Geonosis, though the SRT saw the protocol droid as little more than an obstruction and deftly removed him from the vicinity\u2014causing C-3PO to fall unceremoniously onto a conveyor belt below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Criminals were known to use SRT droids to their advantage, intercepting the transports' flight paths to smuggle contraband into their cargo. Inspired by such tactics, a squadron of Advanced Recon Commandos hijacked a work crew of SRT droids during a stealth operation across enemy lines in the lead-up to the Battle of Byblos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some SRT droids were utilized in the construction of the first Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
