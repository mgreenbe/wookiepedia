About the size of a Human thumb, the insects were capable of flight and buzzed as they did so. They also possessed stingers, which made them dangerous to other large animals if the bugs were in a swarm. The bugs would flee if faced with smoke, meaning smoking them out was an effective strategy to combat the insects. By the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a group of hundreds of the bugs had made their home in escape pod 34 Besh, a pod from the Confederacy of Independent Systems Munificent-class star frigate Sa Nalaor, which crashed on Cholganna at the end of the Clone Wars, a previous galactic conflict. The group swarmed anything which approached the pod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War a group of spacers attempting to locate the Sa Nalaor investigated escape pod 34 Besh and were swarmed by the insects living inside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The insects first appeared in 2013 in Beyond the Rim an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
