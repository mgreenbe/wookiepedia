Leia is irritated that they have been diverted from their search for Han Solo, but Luke assures her that Alliance High Command have other people continuing the search. As the group descends into the depths of the city of Pavillion, they meet with the School's leader, Primor, his son, Mone, and Mone's wife, Kendle. After questioning the locals about the whereabouts of Tay Vanis, Kendle mentions Vanis' droid, K-3PX, who apparently contains all the information Vanis had gathered on the Empire's secret plans. The last known whereabouts of the droid was at the Gamandar Citadel, a huge structure erected by the Empire on the planet of Gamandar. The Rebels decide to split up, with Lando, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 going to Gamandar to search for the droid, while Leia and Luke stay on Iskalon, as they are too likely to be recognized. Mone decides to go with Lando's team, despite the objections of his father and wife."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Millennium Falcon departs Iskalon, Primor decides to entertain Luke and Leia, equipping them with rebreathers and showing them the beauty of his world. Primor teaches Luke to swim, and shows them the Iskalonians' primary weapon, the Stinger. As Primor decides to lead the two Rebels to Tay Vanis' favorite grottoes, Luke spies a struggle taking place inside Pavillion. As the group moves closer to the windows of the city, they see Kendle sprawled on the floor suffocating, her water tank smashed. Luke scrambles to the surface to enter the city and save the struggling woman. Meanwhile, on Gamandar, Admiral Griggor Tower has received word from his spy on Iskalon. In an attempt to destroy the Rebels, Tower fires an interplanetary missile at the city of Pavillion. The Millennium Falcon narrowly dodges the missile but continues towards Gamandar. Back on Iskalon, Luke and Leia are able to reach Kendle but believe it may be too late to get her back into the water and save her. However, the missile strikes the planet, near Pavillion, creating a large tidal wave, which smashes into Pavillion and floods the city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This issue was originally intended to feature the story Hoth Stuff!, which eventually appeared in issue 78."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Essential Chronology placed the search for Tay Vanis (continuing here and concluded in issue #80) after Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
