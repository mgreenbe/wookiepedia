All manner of freighters visited its landing pads where they brought goods either legal or otherwise. As a result, Coronet Shipping made millions of credits worth of commerce that occurred every day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All this changed in the Cold War era when the Sith Empire invaded Corellia. After the Galactic Republic established a beachhead at the Blastfield Shipyards, the Sith were quick in securing Coronet Shipping as a rapid response staging area for themselves. The main ground approach to these landing pads were destroyed by Imperial forces which made the area inaccessible to infantry or walker units. Aerial patrols also keep Republic assault shuttles from approaching the site and protected the Empire's elite troops."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
