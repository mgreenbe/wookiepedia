During this time the bulk of a house's navy were limited to intrasystem patrols, as only ten percent of a houses navy was allowed to be jump-capable. Ships in service in the house navies included Victory II-class Star Destroyers, Nebulon-B Frigates and modified Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers. Others pooled their resources together to commission new designs from the Tallaani Shipyards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The House Fleets"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both male and female citizens of a house were admitted into a house navy, as well as aliens.
