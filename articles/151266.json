At some point before the Freedon Nadd Uprising of 3998 BBY, a group of several Jedi arbitrated a treaty on Ulda Frav. At that time, Crown Prince Qrrrl Toq of the isolated Mid Rim planet Nazzri also visited Ulda Frav as part of his self-imposed exile known as boqeri. The Nazzar approached the Jedi mediators and began to question them, but the latter cut the crown prince short, instead announcing to Toq that he possessed the potential to become a Jedi himself. In response, the Nazzar surprised the Jedi by stating that he had never heard of the Jedi Order. The Jedi requested that Toq join them on their return journey to the planet Ossus, the Outer Rim Territories headquarters of the Jedi Order, after which the crown prince became a Jedi himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of the Krath Holy Crusade during the Great Sith War of 3996 BBY, the military forces of the Krath cult passed through the Ulda Frav system before confronting the forces of the Republic in the Attahox system.
