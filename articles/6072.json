Back on the planet, the two missing troopers wave desperately at the leaving gunships, but to no avail. They are alone until a group of battle droids arrives. Hiding behind a large crate, the two overhear the droids discussing their secret weapon. Determined to find the weapon, the clones create a plan. They open the crate and construct a fighter tank. Using the tank, the clones set to find the weapon, leaving a trail of destroyed droids in their wake. Finding the weapon to be a large tower, the troopers fire the tank's weapons at the top of it, bringing it down. As the two look over the wreckage, a Republic gunship comes down to pick them up."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
