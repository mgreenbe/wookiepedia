Following the Battle of Naalol, captured Imperial soldiers were bound in magnacuffs. Following a failed recon mission to Akiva, the New Republic starfighter pilot Captain Wedge Antilles was restrained in magnacuffs while being detained by Imperial forces at the Satrap's Palace in Myrra. When the Satrap's Palace suffered a power blackout due to an attack by the New Republic pilot Norra Wexley, Antilles' magnacuffs were disabled, allowing him to escape temporarily before being subdued and recaptured."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
