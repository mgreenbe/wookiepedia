After his first Padawan, the Kaleesh Saes Rrogon, turned to the dark side, Druur and his second apprentice, Drev Hassin, began tracking Rrogon. They discovered that Rrogon had become a Lord in the Sith Empire and tracked him to the Phaegon system, where he was mining the dark side ore Lignan. The Jedi ambushed Rrogon with the purpose of disabling his ship, the Harbinger, to prevent the ore from being delivered to the Sith fleet. Druur fought with Rrogon aboard the Harbinger, losing his left arm in the duel before charges that he had placed on the hyperdrive exploded, damaging the hyperdrive and incapacitating the Sith Lord. Druur fled to an escape pod, but Hassin, in the Jedi's Infiltrator starfighter, saw that the Harbinger was still preparing to jump into hyperspace and sacrificed himself, flying the Infiltrator into the Harbinger's bridge in hopes of preventing it from escaping the system.

He entered the ship, Junker, where he met Jedi Knight Jaden Korr and the ship's pilot, Khedryn Faal. Korr revealed to Druur that the Sith Empire had been defeated millennia ago and concluded that he must have traveled through time during the Harbinger's misjump. After they evaded two squadrons of starfighters deployed by Rrogon to destroy Junker, Korr continued his own task with the assistance of Faal, while Druur and Marr Idi-Shael, Faal's first mate, embarked on a mission to destroy the Lignan aboard the Harbinger. After Idi-Shael helped Druur to fight off a wave of Massassi warriors, Druur convinced him to flee the ship. Druur then fully embraced the dark side and found the Lignan in the Harbinger's cargo hold, where he was confronted by Rrogon. The two engaged in a duel of Force powers, and Rrogon soon gained the upper hand. Druur, however, used his despair at his failures in life to draw on the power of the Lignan, defeating Rrogon and killing him with the Sith Lord's own lightsaber.

At some point prior to the war, he took on the Kaleesh Saes Rrogon as his Padawan, although Rrogon eventually turned to the dark side of the Force. Druur later took on a second Padawan, the Askajian Drev Hassin. Around 5000 BBY, the Sith Empire, which Rrogon had since joined as a Sith Lord, was discovered to be in the process of preparing to invade the galaxy. Druur believed that the planet Kirrek would be attacked, as well as the capital world Coruscant. In the meantime, however, he and Hassin began to track down Rrogon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Jedi, flying an Infiltrator starfighter, eventually found the Sith Lord at Primus Goluud, where they also found the Sith fleet preparing to strike the Galactic Republic. There, the Jedi saw Rrogon's dreadnaught, the Harbinger, alongside another ship, the Omen, leaving the present armada. After Druur reported his findings to Kirrek and the Jedi Order on Coruscant, he received an order to follow Rrogon in the hopes of discovering the Sith Lord's purpose. They tracked Rrogon as the Harbinger and Omen traveled to several remote systems. At each stop, the dreadnaughts released recon droids for scanning, before quickly moving to another system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Jedi still had no clue as to what Rrogon's goal was, several agents managed to place a homing beacon on the Harbinger. Following the beacon, Druur and Hassin jumped through hyperspace from the Remmon Nebula to the Phaegon system. As they prepared to exit hyperspace, Druur quickly masked their presences in the Force so that Rrogon would not be able to sense them. Upon entering the system, the two Jedi were instantly affected by a strong wave of dark side energy. They quickly recovered and flew the Infiltrator into the system's asteroid belt, from where they saw the Harbinger and the Omen over the largest moon of Phaegon III. The Sith ships were mining for Lignan\u2014an ore that was immensely powerful in the dark side of the Force\u2014and Druur and Hassin found that, in this act, the Sith had completely destroyed the outer crust of the moon, eliminating all of its life."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Skirmish over Phaegon III"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Jedi realized that the Lignan ore was the source of the powerful dark side energy that they had felt upon their arrival, and that it must have been what Rrogon had been searching for. Druur also believed that the Sith were gathering the ore for use during the upcoming Battle of Kirrek. Deciding that they could not allow the Sith to deliver the ore to the main fleet, Druur and Hassin resolved to ambush Rrogon's forces. Using the Infiltrator's scrambler and baffler to keep them temporarily hidden from the Sith ships' sensors, Hassin flew Druur over one of the Sith cargo transports that was carrying Lignan ore from the surface of the moon to the Harbinger.

However, he failed to do so in time to escape the notice of one Massassi, Drophan, who then attacked the Jedi Master. Druur was forced to kill him, and the Massassi's body was soon discovered, alerting Rrogon to the presence of a Jedi on board.

He then used an overrider to open the hyperdrive chamber and quickly incapacitated two Human engineers. As the ship prepared to jump into hyperspace, deadly radiation filled the room, giving Druur severe radiation poisoning; the Jedi Master realized that he would need treatment for it once he had completed his mission. He quickly attached three mag-grenades on timers to the hyperdrive and ordered his apprentice to flee into hyperspace. Hassin, however, declined his order, refusing to leave without Druur despite the Jedi Master's protests.

The Jedi Master recovered from the lightning, and the two squared off once more, but Druur became distracted as Hassin suddenly reported through his comlink that his Infiltrator had been hit.

Despite the destructive effects of the grenades' explosion, the Harbinger continued its jump sequence; Druur insisted that he had destroyed the drive, but Hassin replied in turn that his scanners still read an active hyperdrive aboard the ship. As Hassin's Infiltrator suffered more damage, Druur entered an escape pod and attempted to launch from the Harbinger. Hassin, however, knew that the Harbinger would still jump and, knowing that they could not risk allowing the ship to meet up with the Sith fleet at Kirrek, crashed the Infiltrator into the Harbinger's bridge, sacrificing himself to stop the ship from entering hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Travel through time"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Through the escape pod's viewport, Druur witnessed the death of his Padawan, causing him great anger and despair.

Druur and the pod were also pulled out of hyperspace, and the Jedi Master found himself in a system he did not recognize, containing a blue gas giant with an icy moon.

However, Korr revealed that the Battle of Kirrek had been fought thousands of years previously, and that Sadow had been dead for millennia. Korr went on to suggest that Druur's misjump had taken him through time as well as space, to which Druur replied that the Jedi was mad. Korr, however, added that lightsaber technology had evolved since Druur's time\u2014Druur's lightsaber was connected to a power pack which he wore, as opposed to Korr's newer lightsaber, which contained a power cell in the hilt.

Korr quickly piloted the freighter into the gas giant's rings while Druur took up position at the controls of the freighter's tractor beam. During the ensuing chase, Druur used the tractor beam to briefly ensnare chunks of rock before letting them go, flinging them into the path of the pursuing Blade starfighters and destroying several of the fighters. In a plan formulated by Faal, Korr suddenly steered the freighter down and out of the rings, getting out of their pursuers' line of sight for a moment as Idi-Shael vented the ship's cargo.

Korr then revealed that Idi-Shael was slightly Force-sensitive, and asserted\u2014with the support of Druur\u2014that it was the Force that had brought them all together there for a purpose. Druur then insisted that he needed to get to the Harbinger quickly, reiterating the danger that the Lignan presented to the galaxy, although he refused Korr's help when the Jedi Knight offered it, stating that Korr's presence would be too powerful for him to mask from Rrogon.

Korr then confronted Druur about his anger and expressed concern for Idi-Shael, insisting that the Cerean was Druur's responsibility during the upcoming mission and requesting that Druur give his word that he would return Idi-Shael safely.

As Idi-Shael began piloting Junker out of the planetary rings and toward the Harbinger, however, they found that the dreadnaught had moved into orbit around the moon. Druur realized that the distance between Junker and the Harbinger was too great for the freighter to cover without the Harbinger noticing them and scrambling its fighters.

Idi-Shael powered down Junker, shifting power to the freighter's power crystal and firing it at the Harbinger's shields, boring a hole in them. Druur realized that Idi-Shael was having trouble repelling the effects of the Lignan and taught him a technique to resist it.

As Druur killed the rest of the Massassi, he realized that he was enjoying the fight, smiling and laughing as he slaughtered the warriors. Idi-Shael again urged Druur to allow him to stay and help, but Druur quickly grew angry and refused the Cerean's assistance, claiming that this was something he had to do alone. The Jedi Master finally managed to convince Idi-Shael to go, and also urged him to give one final message to Korr\u2014that nothing was certain, that there was only the search for certainty, and that things became precarious only when one thought that the hunt for certainty had ended.

Druur's second apprentice, Drev Hassin, was lighthearted and was often able to get Druur to smile, although the Jedi Master still usually remained grave and serious in his mannerisms.
