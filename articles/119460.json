An economic powerhouse and major trading center in the Outer Rim, Saleucami was politically powerful during the Great Galactic War and a strategically held world within the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Controlled by the Techno Union throughout the Separatist Crisis, the world was liberated by the Grand Army of the Republic before the rise of the Galactic Empire and was spared the retribution demanded of other former Separatist worlds. Located between Kegan and Handooine along the Talcene Transit, the planet was supplied by cargo ships off of the Perlemian Trade Route that were headed to the Kuthic Worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saleucami was a dim, arid world with scattered oases of plant growth. Its name, Saleucami, meant \"oasis\" in Pantoran; a word which was fitting for the only habitable planet within a system filled with dead, uninhabitable worlds and meteors. These meteors would frequently cross paths with the planet's orbit and would bombard its surface creating huge craters and calderas. Overtime, geothermal vents and subterranean water opened up within these craters, creating circular seas and turning some calderas into life-filled pockets on the planet's surface. Ranging from desert to wetlands, the terrain on Saleucami was as diverse as its colonists. Saleucami had no indigenous sentient species, but with its pleasant climate for most of the year outside of the scorching hot equatorial regions, many settlers came to find their own oasis. Among the most prominent species were the Pantoran, Weequay, Gran, and Twi'lek. These colonists lived in tiny townships within the mineral-rich, fertile craters of the world. Establishing Taleucema as the planet's major spaceport and capital, the location was chosen for its system of subterranean magma streams and geothermal vents. Harnessing the natural power of these features, the city-dwellers used the vents to power the city and provide warmth during the freezing desert nights. Diversity among the ecosystems created in these craters was marveled at by the local Saleucamians and visitors alike. Vast tracts of woodland would be broken up by deserts and swamps, while thick jungles filled with predators appeared elsewhere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The culture on Saleucami primarily developed out of the Pantoran heritage, as they were the first settlers on the world. Based around the tenants of freedom of expression, the pursuit of happiness, and an explorer's spirit, the world blossomed on the Outer Rim, attracting many diverse species to its crater cities. As more and more cultures arrived, Saleucami's welcoming stance allowed for and encouraged full, cultural assimilation of different viewpoints. The Gran and Twi'lek settlers brought much influence to the world, and had the greatest impact on Saleucami's cultural practices. The more insular Weequays differed in that they kept to their own self-contained neighborhoods and were not as culturally present as other species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because the summer months saw dramatic temperature increases, most settlers did their business at night, choosing to remain indoors during the day. This period of the evening was known as Eventide, and became a holiday of sorts for the first Pantoran settlers. Serving midday meals at midnight, the Pantorans reversed their schedules for the three months of summer and were highly active in the evenings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saleucami was originally colonized by Pantorans in 6100 BBY, dwelling within the fertile calderas outside of the equatorial zones. As more and more settlers heard of the original colonists' successes, members of other species flocked to the world to establish thriving enclaves there as well. Overtime, the Saleucamians had developed defense systems which prevented meteor impact by blasting incoming space debris to dust before it entered the atmosphere. Having found much success at developing an economic hub on the Outer Rim, Saleucami's government enjoyed strong political clout within the Galactic Republic. During the Great Galactic War, the planet was often spoken of as the Outer Rim's most prosperous trading hub. Repeated Republic losses, including a devastating orbital battle caused the planet's government to doubt the Republic's ability to defend its allies, and Saleucami became one of the founding members of the Rift Alliance, with the blunt-spoken Senator Alauni as its representative. The actions of the third Jedi Barsen'thor convinced the Rift Alliance worlds, including Saleucami, to remain allied to the Republic, with Alauni as one of three possible candidates to represent the alliance in the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a thriving world, Saleucami attracted all sorts of visitors seeking solitude an anonymity. Around 67 BBY, a Force-sensitive Iktotchi female had a cult following on Saleucami. Possessing an innate gift for prophecy, the Iktotchi predicted the fall of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order, as well as the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. Following information stolen from Darth Venamis, the Muun Sith Darth Plagueis came to Saleucami and listened to the prophet. Concerned that the prophet would prematurely reveal his plans, Plagueis electrocuted her with Force lightning and killed her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite its best efforts to remain a peaceful oasis, Saleucami came under direct control of the Techno Union three years before the Battle of Naboo. When the Clone Wars began, its ties to the Techno Union placed it squarely under the control of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. As a result, the planet was named by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine as part of a \"Triad of Evil,\" alongside Felucia and Mygeeto. Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Adi Gallia once led a mission to rescue Eeth Koth from General Grievous, who was in orbit around Saleucami at the time. When the ship was destroyed the Jedi searched for Grievous in a forested area of the planet. This led to a small skirmish during which Clone Captain CT-7567, nicknamed \"Rex,\" was injured. While healing, Rex also discovered a clone deserter living as a farmer with his adopted family. Rex then helped the deserter and his family with an abandoned pod containing droid commandos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the population's desire to remain out of the war, the Confederacy used the planet as a staging area during the Outer Rim Sieges. Unbeknownst to the Saleucamian government, Count Dooku's Dark Acolytes had begun to convert several of the worlds underground caverns into cloning facilities for their own clone army\u2014Morgukai clones trained by Anzat assassins. Despite their efforts at secrecy, this plot was discovered by the Jedi Master Tholme and Aayla Secura. As a result, the Jedi High Council sent Jedi Generals Oppo Rancisis and his second-in-command Quinlan Vos along with a task force to destroy the cloning operations on Saleucami. This would start a massive five month-long siege between the Republic and the Separatist forces on the planet. First, the Republic captured Saleucami's main city and then fought their way inward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the conflict, Jedi Master Rancisis was murdered by his former friend, Sora Bulq, after being distracted by Anzat assassins. Sora Bulq and Tol Skorr were later killed by Quinlan Vos and Bok was slain by Aayla Secura. The Republic forces also flooded Saleucami's magma tunnels to kill the Separatist Morgukai clones. Despite heavy losses on both sides, Saleucami's infrastructure was not heavily damaged, as most of the fighting occurred in the unpopulated desert regions. Maintaining a strong economy after the Republic established an interim government to lead the planet through post-battle clean-up and recovery efforts, the Saleucamians embraced the Grand Army's presence and lauded them as saviors. Leading Republic clean-up efforts was Jedi Master Stass Allie and Commander Neyo. While patrolling the battlefield for remaining Confederate forces in a unit of BARC troopers, Neyo received Order 66 over a secure comm channel. Neyo and his lieutenant fired upon Allie's 74-Z speeder bike, destroying the vehicle and killing the Jedi Master instantly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Republic transformed into the Galactic Empire, Saleucami's place within the galaxy remained unchanged. An Imperial Governor was installed in the region to ensure the planet's loyalty to Coruscant; though the governor came to be on the payroll of the Zann Consortium. During the Galactic Civil War, Jabba Desilijic Tiure had some holdings and a secret communications outpost on Saleucami, which were captured and eventually forcibly handed over to Tyber Zann shortly after the Battle of Yavin. Around the same time, the space above the planet was also the site of a skirmish between the Rebel forces of Renegade Squadron, led by Commander Gial Ackbar, and Imperial troops, led by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, which led to the capture of most of the Rebels on the mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Saleucami was conquered by the invaders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pronunciation is somewhat in dispute, depending on what one considers canon. In Revenge of the Sith, Obi-Wan Kenobi pronounces /s\u028c'luk\u0259\u02ccma\u026a/, while in Forces of Corruption characters pronounce /\u02c8s\u00e6l.j\u028a\u02cck\u0251.mi/. Col Serra pronounces is /\u02c8se\u026a.li\u02ccu\u02d0k\u0251.mi/ in Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron. The difference could be attributed to Ewan McGregor's Scottish accent. Characters in The Clone Wars also use the /s\u028c'luk\u0259\u02ccma\u026a/ pronunciation, indicating that it is likely the correct pronunciation. In Star Wars The Old Republic, however, Master Satele Shan pronounces it /\u02ccsu\u02d0l.j\u028a.k\u0251\u02c8mi\u02d0/.\nIn The Essential Atlas, Saleucami is pictured as having a light purple surface. This is most likely an error because all other sources show Saleucami as a brownish-green planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During pre-production of Revenge of the Sith, Saleucami was given to a concept called \"bridge planet,\" a world made up of arcing parabolic bridges with upside-down skylines extending from the curving frames. This planet was to be a major stronghold of the Techno Union, when a Clone Wars montage was to portray the engagement of the Confederacy founders on their respective homeworlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bridge world concept evolved and became Cato Neimoidia in the finished film.
