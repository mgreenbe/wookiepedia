However, due to the power requirements, the F9-TZ could not use its cloaking device and deflector shield at the same time. The cloaking device was fully integrated into the transport, preventing it from being installed on any other vehicles without a complete overhaul. At full charge, this device could operate for 15 minutes before it had to be shut down and recharged, an operation that lasted 30 minutes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The F9-TZ had room to carry four squads and their gear, but could not carry any other vehicles. In addition, unlike contemporaries such as the HAVt B5 Juggernaut, the F9-TZ was unarmed, making it vulnerable to heavy fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The F9-TZ was based in part on the design of Baktoid Armor Workshop's RHTT-6 transport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
