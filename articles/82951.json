He lived on Tatooine during the Infinite Empire's rule, when the planet was conquered by the Rakata and his city burned. Brought out onto a cliff on the outskirts of the ruined city with his father and another young boy, Lonai knelt shackled before Predor Tul'kar as the Force Hound Xesh determined who among them was Forceful. Determining the other boy to be capable of touching the Force, the Rakatan guards killed Lonai and his father, who were deemed worthless, before escorting the other boy to a ship which would take him offworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
