Loro and her partner, Sixtus Quin, targeted Empire-controlled worlds and helped local planetary resistance movements overthrow their Imperial governments. They trained the local citizens to stage successful uprisings and participated directly in the fighting themselves, but only if the native population were willing to fight. Loro claimed that her team had helped liberate dozens of worlds. The group was recruited by Commander Wedge Antilles to overthrow Ysanne Isard's control of the bacta-producing world Thyferra during the Bacta War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
