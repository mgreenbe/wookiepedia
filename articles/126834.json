Eventually, the Galactic Empire's Task Force 99 tracked the rebels to the moon after capturing and interrogating their accomplice Sana Starros. They arrived at Markona's village and demanded that he turn over the rebels he was harboring. When Sergeant Kreel, the leader of the Imperial forces, threatened to destroy Markona's village, Markona revealed that he had numerous warrios that outnumbered them. He then told Kreel that they would attack him if he did not submit to a trial by combat, as was traditional. Kreel and Skywalker both agreed to the proposition and prepared to duel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
