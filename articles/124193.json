Her skin was so light that it was almost white and she wore a necklace made of bones. Hissest led a group of Rebels who crash-landed on her home planet of Marca to the tribe to convince She-Who-Speaks to let them help the tribe fight the Imperials devastating the planet. She-Who-Speaks was offended by Hissest's belief that the Rebels were some sort of divine aid, and arranged for a \"trial by challenge\" as a way to rid herself of Hissest. However, the outcome of the duel meant that Hissest rose in standing and became de facto chief of the tribe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If Hissest ends up the duels victor, then she becomes the tribe's She-Who-Speaks.
