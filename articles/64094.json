Unlike the reactor system on the older Venator-class, the reactor on board Imperial-class vessels was large enough relative to the rest of the ship to protrude with a ventral bulb. It also forced the troop and crew compartments to be located on the upper half of the superstructure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like other heavy warships, it was the size of the power-plant which in turn dictated the size of the Imperator-class.

There is no known official explanation for this, and while it is possible that SFS produced multiple sizes of the reactor model, this is a considerable stretch of logic. The far more likely explanation is that the model listed in the TIE Bomber's entry was an error."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
