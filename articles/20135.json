The taskforce was detected by the Separatist upon landing, in which a landing craft promptly appeared and began to deploy multiple craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Heavy Artillery Guns opened fire on the assault ship, numerous Ground Armored Tanks and Hailfire droids began to enter the area, engaging Skywalker and his squadron. With enemy artillery posing a serious threat to the hull integrity of the ship, Skywalker moved to engage them\u2014including their escorts of AATs and Spider walkers. When the area was cleared, a convoy of Republic Troop Transports disembarked with a contingent of clone engineers en route to the generator complex."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now piloting an AT-XT, Skywalker mobilized his Squadron to escort the convoy. The group encountered additional waves of spider walkers, tanks, and STAPs before one of the transports succumbed to artillery fire from a distance. Bravo 4 held his position to defend the remaining transports while Skywalker moved to eliminate the enemy units ahead. Now on the move, the group engaged additional units before the convoy approached the perimeter of the complex. With the complex breached, Bravo 4 remained outside to guard against possible attacks from the rear while Skywalker assaulted the compound. Thanks to Bravo 4's efforts, Skywalker was successful in lowering the shield, completing the first phase of the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
