In addition to Atrivis Day, the convoy was composed of the Container transport group Kempman, the Modular conveyor group Altar Moon, the freighter group Rimrunner and eight other container ships.

However, upon reverting from hyperspace, they found the Organarms facility destroyed, the target of a lone Imperial Missile Boat, still in-system. This enemy craft was joined shortly after by the Imperial Strike-class medium cruiser Arjun. As the small Imperial craft moved to engage the four freighters, the rest of the convoy began to arrive in-system, beginning with a number of Y-wing starfighters and Z-95 Headhunters from Red Squadron, who moved to attack the Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The role of the Atrivis Day group at this battle was later included in an Imperial simulation used to train pilots for the Missile Boat.

There, they appeared in the first simulator mission, training the player in the use of the Missile Boat. These simulator missions were based on in-universe historical missions. Consequently, the actual existence of Atrivis Day in canon is confirmed, but the specific outcome of the original engagement is not. Instead, the simulation allows the player to accomplish the mission to varying degrees of completeness. As the destruction of the Atrivis Day group is only a secondary goal for the player, the mission can be accomplished with or without their destruction, leaving uncertainty as to their final in-universe fate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The name of this freighter group is likely a nod to the Atrivis sector, a sector of the Outer Rim Territories known to be an early hotbed of Rebel activity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
