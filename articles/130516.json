Star Forge Robes can be created at one of the computer rooms on the Star Forge for a large number of computer spikes. The robe gave the wearer an increase in their wisdom and saves. In the non-canonical dark side storyline of the game, these robes cannot be created. Instead, a different set of robes would be created, mimicking but not matching Revan's original Sith robes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
