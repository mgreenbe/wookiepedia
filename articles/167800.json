Julia's combined energy of the fallen Dagoyan Masters was to then be transferred to Talzin. As Julia's beloved Jar Jar Binks with the Jedi Master Mace Windu came to liberate Julia, they were hindered by the stone guardians defending the temple but were able to defeat them, then went to rescue Julia. Shortly before the ritual could be completed by the sun's rays, Binks saved the queen, while Windu fought against Talzin. The wrong sacrifice was given in the form of the Frangawl Cult leader, causing the sphere with the trapped Force essence to explode. The three escaped while Talzin disappeared in a cloud of green mist."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
