Ringed by an asteroid belt, the Hellhoop was said to have an evil reputation, as many ships that entered the area disappeared and were never seen again. In truth, the ships were captured by a group called the Five. When Han Solo, Chewbacca and Leia Organa were captured by the Five, Chewbacca was able to free the captive Wutzek, who rampaged through the Five's warship to kill his former tormentors. Wutzek then allowed the Rebels to escape and destroyed the warship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Five's warship was a large triangular ship which captured other ships and destroyed them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia mistakenly states that Wutzek (misspelled Wuzzek) destroyed the Hellhoop.
