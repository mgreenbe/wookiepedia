He was assigned to the rebel outpost, Karinda Outpost, on the planet Karinda. While there, he was assigned as the pilot of their skiff, as the base was very undermanned. Even though they came under attack, he managed to get a group of rebels who had arrived on the planet with much needed supplies to the base without any major damage to the skiff."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
