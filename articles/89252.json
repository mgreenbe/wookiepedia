It notably produced the 773 Firepuncher, the versatile MPL-57 grenade launcher, which was developed by the corporation in an effort to widen its market share, the B22 blaster pistol, the Power 5 blaster,, the ELG-3A blaster pistol with SoroSuub Corporation, and the RPS-6 rocket launcher with Sienar Fleet Systems. Merr-Sonn also produced numerous explosive devices, including the Class-A thermal detonator, the C-25 and C-35 fragmentation grenades, and the LX-4 proton mine. In order to avoid treaty restrictions that prevented major galactic corporations from selling arms to the First Order, Merr-Sonn and BlasTech Industries cynically spun off a subsidiary called Sonn-Blas Corporation, which operated within the Unknown Regions and manufactured the majority of the First Order's weapons, building on classic templates that dated back to the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon in Rebel Journal by Ezra Bridger, a young readers book written by Daniel Wallace as the in-universe journal of Ezra Bridger and released on October 21, 2014.
