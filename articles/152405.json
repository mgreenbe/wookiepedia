He donned Daimanate military armor with a specialized helmet that left his face exposed. His forces were overwhelmed by the Hutt crime lord Zodoh during the Battle of Capital Cay. Realizing that his garrison was outnumbered and outgunned by the Hutt invaders, he ordered his men to rally and repel the invaders.
