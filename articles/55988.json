He fought for the Galactic Republic in the Great Galactic War, becoming an elite commando with best assignments. However, he was dissatisfied with the pay and eventually left, joining the White Maw pirate gang. He was made a captain of Reneget Vause after pushing both Republic and the Empire out of the White Maw Territory on Hoth and was put in charge of the underground smelting operations. Ungan was especially cruel to slaves, often leading them without heat-resisting shields. In 3642 BBY he was confronted and killed by a bounty hunter, who sought to draw Vause out of hiding."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gradak Ungan appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Bounty Hunter class mission on Hoth.
