Several bombers were destroyed by TIE fighters and debris, leaving only the Cobalt Hammer to drop bombs in the last hope to destroy the Dreadnaught, the Fulminatrix. However, Nix Jerd, the bombardier, was knocked unconscious. This meant Paige Tico, a gunner, had to activate the bombs. She climbed up the ladder and was preparing to activate them when a TIE fighter blew up the cockpit, killing the pilot, Finch Dallow, and the flight engineer. The resulting explosion threw Tico off the ladder and down to a catwalk. After kicking the access ladder several times the detonator fell down. She caught it and dropped the bombs on the Dreadnaught. The resulting explosion destroyed both the Dreadnaught and the Cobalt Hammer, killing all aboard the two doomed ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
