A chef must have spent at least two years learning the technique from a Master Moonglow Chef before they could obtain a license to prepare it themselves. Restaurants which chose to serve moonglow had to display their own license, which indicated to patrons that the chefs who worked there had been trained in the preparation. All of this licensing and training was necessary because, if one step was omitted or performed in error, the entire process was forfeited. Improperly prepared moonglow might lead to anything from a mild stomachache to a hallucinatory coma, followed by death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "As a status symbol"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of its rarity and copious preparation, moonglow cost a thousand credits per fruit.
