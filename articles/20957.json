During the war, the greed of the Sith eventually resulted in infighting, allowing the Jedi and the Galactic Republic to defeat the Empire, becoming the last empire of the Sith at the time. The inhabitants who lived on Auratera coordinated with the Jedi to secretly alter official Republic records to misclassify the system as uninhabitable. As such, the inhabitants and the planet became nearly closed off to the rest of the galaxy, and eventually cut ties with the few remaining trading partners that they had when the Sith Empire fell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Bane was the sole survivor of the Brotherhood, and established the Rule of Two which served as a doctrine for the surviving Sith for the next thousand years.
