Originated from the magazine's early days as The Lucasfilm Fan Club Magazine, it listed a wide variety of Star Wars merchandise available to order over the course of a half dozen or more pages. It was later succeeded by departments such as Jawa's Corner and Blaster, which dealt with upcoming and new merchandise and broke the section up into topics such as comics and books."}]}
