In competition with Freia Kallea, he and Thoax extended parts of the Hydian Way. However, her tenacity forced the Osaax to hire Duros Banu Hydia to eliminate her, which did not go as planned. The Neimoidians crippled Kallea's ship and it crash-landed on Nuvar, where she spent six years in captivity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twenty-two-hundred years later, the Osaaxs and Kallea's explorations were immortalized in The Kallea Cycle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
