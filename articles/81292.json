Some of the ships have found their way into the hands of crime lords and smugglers, but most were acquired by its target group: the wealthy families such as Sandral family from Dantooine, who kept their ship docked atop their estate. More than 30 ships were sold at significant discount to Exchange crime bosses by a group of Arakyd employees, who were later sent to the spice Mines of Kessel for that crime, including the Sector Executive of the Raioballo sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This ship was first seen parked on top of the Sandral estate in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.
