Intensely loyal to the commander who had pulled them through so many battles, they were shocked when he was imprisoned on Kalaan after refusing an order to kill civilians. In what turned out to be a catastrophic error, Grand General Malcor Brashin assigned them to guard Tantor in his outdoor cell. Gana Lant, one of the stormtroopers, convinced the nine others to free Tantor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Tantor freed, the stormtroopers stole the TR-MB prototype and stormed the prison, freeing Luke Skywalker. The group trekked through Kalaan's canyons, picking up support from the Kalaanite resistance until they arrived at a Rebel base set up by Tyr Taskeen. From there, they were taken to Taskeen's fleet, where would presumably have been imprisoned temporarily along with their general. When released, they most likely continued serving the Rebellion as infantry under Tantor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Members"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
