Moff Yittreas was installed as the ruler of the world. The Ghost Base was built in the forests of Krant to organize all those operations, and the native Krantians started a resistance force. The Imperials established two military camps, Sagol and Kaxol, near the cities of Peche and Theenes. The Empire also established a research facility in the orbiting asteroid Geddes. The Empire also discovered the ancient and powerful Jedi artifact Vor'Na'Tu and shipped it to the Sith Temple on Geddes. Around 0.5 ABY, Bothan spy Utric Sandov arranged a meeting with Rebel leader Leia Organa to discuss information that could be vital to the Rebel Alliance\u2014that the Vor'Na'Tu had been discovered. However, Organa's ship, the Cretacian, was intercepted by the Galactic Empire and crashed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Defense of the two cities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After her crash on Krant, Princess Leia gathered her surviving escort\u2014eight Rebel troopers and the protocol droid C-3PO, and headed away from the crash. They were ambushed by a squad of stormtroopers from Camp Sagol in a village. The Rebels were rescued by the Jedi Master Echuu Shen-Jon, who was hiding there since the Jedi Massacre. C-3PO translated for the Krantians, who gave control of the village and its R2-D5 labor droids to Leia Organa. The nearby towns of Pech and Theenes were threatened with extermination at the hands of the two Imperial camps, whose forces set out to destroy Rebel operations in the Krantian cities. Organa and Shen-Jon agreed to help the Krantians defend the three bridges that connected the cities against Imperial assaults. The Imperials forces abandoned the attack after the Rebels destroyed one of the camps. Afterward, Peche and Theenes agreed to join the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Capture of Ghost Base"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moff Yittreas launched a campaign against the Rebel presence on Krant.

After moving out, the Rebel strike force freed a group of captured labor droids and recruited additional forces to attack the defenses the Imperials had placed in Ghost Base. The strike force succeeded in eliminating the Imperial presence in Ghost Base. Afterward, Sandov contacted them, and the Krantian Leader sent two Transport Ships to bring Organa to the base.
