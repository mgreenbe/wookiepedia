When they arrived in the system, however, they were met with a Rebel ship and soon sent Customs Inspector Buudro to board the ship with two stormtrooper guards. The Rebels managed to convince Buudro that they had not seen any ship enter the system, and so 517 left the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
