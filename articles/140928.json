Skywalker knocks one of Tano's lightsabers out of her right hand and tells her not to forget that she has two lightsabers. Tano replies that she will try and remember that. Skywalker reassures Tano that she is doing fine and that it will take time to learn how to wield two blades. Tano turns to pick up her lightsaber just as Jedi Master Yoda enters the chamber and announces that he would like to see the progress of Skywalker's Padawan with the lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano accepts Yoda's challenge and activates both her lightsabers. Yoda reminds her that she needs to bow before a sparring session and Tano apologizes. Yoda comments that she is very much like her master. Tano activates only one lightsaber but Yoda insists that she wields two lightsabers. After the two have activated their lightsabers, Yoda charges at Tano. She tries to block him by crossing her blades but he manages to use his speed to knock her to the floor. Yoda likens the two blades to a master and apprentice and explains that one sharpens and improves the other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Goaded, Tano charges at Yoda a second time in a twirling motion but he leaps out of the way and trips. Yoda tells her that \"what makes her unique also makes her strong.\" He tells her to be herself. Tano realizes that she needs to fight like herself and parries with Yoda in a twirling motion a third time. Yoda tries to attack her from behind but she intercepts his blade with her two blades. Realizing that Tano has learnt how to fight with two blades, Yoda abandons the attack and compliments Tano for learning well. He tells her to learn from her master and to make his skills her own."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
