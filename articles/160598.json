In 1 BBY, he was assigned to Jerec's Vengeance Imperial-class Star Destroyer and ferried Brazack's Ghost Battalion onto Sulon in their mission to bring to Jerec Morgan Katarn alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vester piloted a Corellian light freighter camouflaged as an Rebel ship. He used its weapons to kill the Danga family, then moved on against the Katarn homestead. He delivered Brazack's commandoes to storm into the house, and continued his flight northward to inflict even more damage, with orders to provide cover if needed. He then picked up the team back to the Vengeance, covered by a flight of 5 TIE fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The commandoes failed to locate Katarn and Jerec organized a more severe attack. Imperial forces attacked the G-Tap defended by the Rebels on Sulon and Vester carried the commandoes to that place. Trol attempted to hit the ship with a SLM but Vester had raised the angle of the ship so that the missile hit only the underside, and Vester managed to steady it again. The Rebels didn't have time to fire a second missile, and soon Vester unloaded Brazack and his commandoes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
