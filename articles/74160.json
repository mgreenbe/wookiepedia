When Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi tracked Luminara down to Karina herself, Obi-Wan wanted to negotiate with her and find out how the brain worms worked. However, Queen Karina was presumably killed by the clone troopers who had shot down the structure of the temple while saving the three Jedi, allowing it to topple over her and trap her under the rubble."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karina was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who also voices all of the clone troopers in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
