Its surface was encased by a layer of glass-like sand hundreds of meters in depth. The razor-sharp sand particles gave rise to monstrous storms in the planet's atmosphere. Sunlight reflected from the sand on Ianane III's surface resulted in the planet appearing white from space and being nearly as bright as its star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The brightness of Ianane III's surface caused the Wild Space world to be misidentified for ages as a second star in its system. Travel to the Ianane system was made difficult by its location amidst a maze of hyperspatial anomalies, but for a long time those scientists who returned alive from a visit to Ianane III nevertheless became fascinated by the unusual world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ianane III was orbited by fragments of the ring-like structure known as the Ianane Ring.
