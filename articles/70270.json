The agreement allowed the Ordu to continue their controversial research on immortality in their citadel, while at the same time giving the Jedi a right of inspection. The Ordu, however, ended up violating the treaty during one such inspection, when Rur took control of the citadel's droids and started killing everyone inside, visiting Jedi and Ordu members alike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
