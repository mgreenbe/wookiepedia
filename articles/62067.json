Queue lines for the Anywhere Room, which once held thousands of tourists, were reduced to, at some points, less than four hundred. This fluctuation was apparently due to a general unwillingness of vacationers to travel long distances. Since the vast majority of HFW's clients came from beyond the Core Worlds, this caused a huge dip in profits. Income rose once again, though, with the coming of the mid-year and the leveling-out of the industry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 ABY, HFW was the secret site of one of the Galactic Empire's Project Starscream experiments.
