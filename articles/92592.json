In addition, Mondress, its partner systems, and the Malarian Alliance\u2014also affiliated with the planet Ansion\u2014all had treaties of their own with other worlds, which led to the seemingly insignificant Ansion lying at the center of a network of approximately forty politically connected star systems.
