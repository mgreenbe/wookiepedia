The miners mostly traded their goods with pharmaceutical companies. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, they would often engage in turf wars with their less than honorable Kobola rivals. They were also in conflict with the extremist Rorgungans as well as with the Narmle Militia. They went by many names and aliases and wore bright green outfits labeled 'Moon Patrol'."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
