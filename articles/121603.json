The conflict began when the Corellian system seceded from the Alliance over local defense limitations and increased taxes to pay for reconstruction in the aftermath of the Yuuzhan Vong War, and gained allies such as Bothawui, Bespin, and Fondor, forming the Confederation. As the conflict quickly escalated, the New Jedi Order battled the rebels alongside the Alliance. Many who had once been allies during the First Galactic Civil War and Yuuzhan Vong War found themselves on opposing sides during the conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, many events in the war became uncontrollable, with a decisive fleet victory proving impossible. Amid months of desultory naval skirmishing, the Galactic Alliance Guard was formed in the name of state security, and under Jacen Solo's command committed acts such as the internment and assassination of dissidents that were increasingly viewed as dictatorial. In a coup, Admiral Cha Niathal and Colonel Jacen Solo ousted Chief of State Cal Omas and took his place on Coruscant. Corrupted by and apprenticed to the Sith Lady Lumiya, Jacen secretly became Darth Caedus, the new Dark Lord of the Sith after killing Mara Jade Skywalker. An attempt by the Confederation to push into the Core Worlds was halted at the Battles of Kuat and Balmorra, but the increasing authoritarianism of the GA's government led the New Jedi Order to withdraw from the Alliance, and in the aftermath of Caedus's actions at the Battle of Kashyyyk, they formed the Jedi Coalition. Following this battle, the war became a three-way conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The war continued with the Galactic Alliance now facing two rebellious factions. The Jedi destroyed Centerpoint Station to prevent it from falling into Alliance hands but failed to capture Caedus. The latter allied himself with the Imperial Remnant, and a major battle occurred at Fondor, the Confederation's largest shipyard. During the Second Battle of Fondor, Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon was executed after refusing to obey Caedus's orders, and Niathal and her allies joined the Jedi Coalition as the Alliance-in-exile after refusing to bombard civilian population centers. Concurrently, Jedi Knight Jaina Solo trained under Boba Fett, leader of the Mandalorians, in order to take down her brother, who was by this time completely consumed by the dark side. As Caedus, Niathal, and the Confederation's forces continued to fight, Luke Skywalker planned to create a trap that would allow Jaina to kill her brother. In a climactic duel, Jaina defeated Darth Caedus as well as his New Sith Order. With Niathal's faction of the Galactic Alliance, the Jedi retook control of Coruscant and defeated Caedus' Alliance and Imperial faction, placing Jagged Fel as the leader of the Imperial Remnant. Tense relations between the Alliance and the Jedi resulting from the war continued in its aftermath, and the Confederation refused to formally rejoin the Galactic Alliance. To make things worse, Darth Caedus' actions had accidentally awoken Abeloth, the Mother of Chaos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Second Galactic Civil War was just the first of several galactic wars that disturbed the peace in the cosmos for a hundred years (40 ABY-140 ABY).

Corellia began to chafe under the Galactic Alliance as it previously had under the New Republic and Galactic Republic: Corellian money and Corellian Defense Force ships were being used by the Galactic Alliance for reconstruction across the galaxy, with apparently little in return for Corellia except for restrictions on its fleet and its ability to strike trade agreements with other systems."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Swarm War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35 ABY, the Galactic Alliance was caught up in the Swarm War between the Killiks and the Chiss. The conflict revealed that the Galactic Alliance Defense Force was ill-prepared for a major war, and the Galactic Alliance Senate passed measures requiring more reconstruction taxes and military resources from the GA's member states. Some systems and sectors balked at the idea of handing over more money and warships to centralized control, and this was compounded by the Sector Defense Limits of 37 ABY. The galaxy's various Planetary Security Forces were being dramatically expanded by governments that feared piracy, threats from the Unknown Regions, or other conflicts in the destabilized galaxy. The Sector Defense Limits put ceilings on military forces and their capabilities, but enforcement proved difficult and little could be done to stop determined sectors from re-arming."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Swarm War coincided with the return of Jacen Solo to the New Jedi Order. Solo had left the Jedi after being exposed to the philosophy of the Jedi mystic Vergere during the Yuuzhan Vong War, who held that the dark side of the Force was not inherently corrupting or evil, as the Jedi believed. While making a five-year odyssey learning from various different Force traditions throughout the galaxy, Solo experienced a terrible vision of a dark, armored figure ruling the galaxy. Determined to alter this future, he came to believe that any level of sacrifice was justified in the name of the greater good. During the Swarm War, he even advocated for the extermination of the Killiks in the name of preserving galactic peace.

At the edge of the shield sphere, there was a half-constructed building which had enough open area for a fighter to fly through it. This building also provided a gap in the Alliance's shields. Wedge's plan was for two of the new YT-5100 Shriek bombers to fly through the building and destroying the building, removing the GA's beachhead on Tralus completely.
