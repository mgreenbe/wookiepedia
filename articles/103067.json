He used the shuttle to escape when the Zilllo Beast attacked him. However, the beast grabbed the shuttle before it could fly to safety and forced Anakin Skywalker, one of the passengers, to cut it in half with his lightsaber in order to affect a rather risky escape plan. The remnants of the shuttle were then crushed by the beast in pursuit of Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
