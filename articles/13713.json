Narrated by Wolam Tser and recorded by Tam Elgrin, the holo portrayed the forces under General Wedge Antilles\u2014and the rest of the New Republic Defense Force in general\u2014in a positive manner, boosting the sagging morale that the New Republic had experienced during the Battle of Coruscant. The holo was a huge success, and helped increase enlistment in the Defense Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
