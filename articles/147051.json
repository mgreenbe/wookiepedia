Their bodies were covered in short, thick fur that could be brown, white, orange or red with stripes, and their eyes could be yellow or green with a yellow hue. Togorians had retractable claws, and were a proud race. They moved with grace and spoke with a sibilant voice. H'sishi, owner of the Amon Yinchom Dojo, was a female Togorian. The male Jedi Knight Jak'zin, who encountered Count Dooku on Sullust, was a Togorian. Togorians were few and far between, and were thus seldomly encountered. Most resided on their home planet Togoria."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
