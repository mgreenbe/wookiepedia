The ryll smugglers transported the spice onto Corellia on small ships and unloaded it at a bunker in the Vella plains. The ryll smuggling ring was led by the underboss Ubis Reendorr. Ladonna Poe served as the contact of the ryll smuggling ring with Vuul Sarlin and his group of spice dealers in the city of Kor Vella. For security reasons, the spice dealers ignored that Ladonna Poe and the ryll smugglers were part of the Chirq Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force started an investigation against the ryll smuggling ring following the increase of spice traffic in Kor Vella. A spacer working for Lieutenant Cope questioned a local spice addict known as Menchi Lerann. The man revealed that he bought his ryll from Vuul Sarlin. The spacer later interrogated Sarlin who was forced to reveal everything he knew about the ryll smuggling ring, including the involvement of Ladonna Poe. The CorSec later targeted the Ryll Smuggler Bunker. Poe, who was outside the bunker when the raid started, was the first one to be killed. A CorSec agent later used her access card and enter the hideout. The CorSec forces then eliminated many ryll smugglers and destroyed several crates of spice. They also discovered the existence of the Red Circle Gang from the smuggler's mainframe. The CorSec investigation eventually led to the disbandment of the Chirq Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ladonna Poe was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
