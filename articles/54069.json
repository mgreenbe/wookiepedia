He became the prince of the planet Doan, and sometime after the end of the war in 1000 BBY Gerran contracted a mysterious illness. His father hired the healer Serra to cure him, and she instantly recognized Gerran's symptoms, diagnosing him with Idolian fever. Serra nursed the prince back to health over the course of the next three months, and Gerran began to fall in love with her. When at last he was completely cured, Gerran proposed marriage to Serra, who accepted on the condition that her loyal friend and bodyguard, Lucia, would be allowed to remain at her side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gerran's father initially disapproved of the marriage, and his efforts to discover anything about Serra's past were unsuccessful due to the actions of Serra's father, Caleb. Caleb was a healer who had refused to take sides during the New Sith Wars, but after a Sith Lord threatened to kill Serra if Caleb didn't heal him, Caleb forced his daughter to change her name and move offworld so that she couldn't be tracked down and used as leverage again. Serra kept her past a secret, even from Gerran, although he accepted that her past was unimportant. Eventually, Gerran's father reluctantly consented to Serra's request, allowing Gerran to marry her and permitting Lucia to became a member of the Doan Royal Guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around that time, however, the Royal House came into conflict with the planet's lower-class mining caste, and the miners began to rise up against the powerful Royal Family.
