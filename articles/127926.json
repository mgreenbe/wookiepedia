Most Snivvians were fluent in both Snivvian and Basic, although they were only literate in their own language, and they had a nasal accent when speaking Basic. Snivvians were fascinated by galactic culture, and thus were happy to speak Basic with non-Snivvians. However, there were some Snivvians who refused to use Basic because of their personal philosophy. In any case, all Snivvians were delighted to encounter members of other species trying to communicate in Snivvian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Common words and phrases"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Counting in Snivvian"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Discussing Art"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
