Grazers lived together in massive herds, migrating at a ponderous pace across Ammuud, eating grass, scrub and lichen. The shaggy beasts were extremely large\u2014the smallest adult grazer weighed at least four times that of a full-grown Wookiee\u2014and were sometimes preyed upon by Ammuud's native pterosaurs, who attacked the slowest and weakest in a grazer herd from above. The grazers were quick to stampede when startled by a loud noise or a pterosaur attack, turning their plodding march into something swift and dangerous. One such stampede nearly trampled the Wookiee smuggler Chewbacca on a visit to Ammuud in 2 BBY, although he narrowly managed to escape using a glider crudely fashioned out of a pterosaur's corpse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grazers first appeared in Han Solo's Revenge, a novel written by Brian Daley and released in 1979."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
