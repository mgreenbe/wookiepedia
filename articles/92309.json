It served in the Imperial Starfleet, and patrolled the Mid Rim during the height of the Empire. Savrip was later captured by the Rebel Alliance and renamed Molator. The Rebels used this cruiser as an armed diplomatic vessel, sending it throughout the Outer Rim in search of more support for the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
