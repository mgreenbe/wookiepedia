Having written Secrets of the Jedi from Luke Skywalker's perspective, Sumerak was forced to write Secrets of the Sith from Emperor Palpatine's perspective. Sumerak was helped by his editor Chris Prince in writing how the Emperor transforms from a reserved public face during his days as a politician to the cunning strategist and despot he later turns out as Emperor, taking into account the Emperor's over-the-top personality. Chronicling character biographies, reflections on the Force's nature and histories consisted in diving deep into the Star Wars lore and refocusing all those events from Palpatine's point of view, a character with specific beliefs in the dark side of the Force, allowing the reader to go back and see all those pieces of media with Palpatine in their mind's forefront, paying specific attention to his actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In illustrating the book, like he did with Secrets of the Jedi, Sergio G\u00f3mez Silv\u00e1n tried to capture a mythic feel in his illustrations, drawing the galaxy's technology with ancient elements like medieval knights and saints, Art Nouveau and Japanese parchments of the Feudal Japan. Silv\u00e1n usually worked from the lightsabers to compose the image of color based on them. To depict an illustration of Darth Vader particularly, G\u00f3mez tried to show Anakin Skywalker's evolution, from the yellowish tones of Tatooine's desert back when he first met Obi-Wan Kenobi through the reddish center of the Jedi Temple where he murders the Jedi younglings which inevitably led to his fate as a Sith to Mustafar's orange fires, to complete Darth Vader's metamorphosis. G\u00f3mez put this combination in contrast of the lightsaber's blue color to give Obi-Wan prominence as Anakin's connection to the light side of the Force with a wide palette of color."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
