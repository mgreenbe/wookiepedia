Through the use of magick, a Nightsister spirit could inhabit and control the body of another individual. The victim's eyes would glow bright green while he or she was possessed, and the spirit's voice would be heard in place of the victim's. Nightsister leader Mother Talzin possessed Count Dooku during part of the Second Battle of Dathomir in order to drain his life energy and restore her physical body. The spirits of dead Nightsisters also possessed Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus and the Mandalorian Sabine Wren during their mission to Dathomir so they could use the pair's flesh and blood to restore the Nightsister clan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
