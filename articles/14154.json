When the prisoners had been killed, he'd counterattacked and left the littered corpses of the Nagai on the platform for Luke to find. Kiro revealed himself when Skywalker, Calrissian and Mone came under attack from a squad of Nagai. Although he was able to protect Luke and Lando, Kiro was unable to stop Mone, Dania Francis, and their school of Iskalonians from being captured by the Nagai.
