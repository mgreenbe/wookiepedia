By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Darknon Beacon was a darkened hulk of machinery. Hovering in a station position relative to Darknon Station, the Beacon's power plant had run out many years previously. The interior of the beacon had a pressurized command center and crew quarters but they have long been abandoned and de-pressurized."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
