Each member was chosen for their ability to listen and interpret the intentions of others. Members of the council were retained until the sahhs decided that a new vote should be held to determine the membership of the Council. The Council of Gordek listened to disputes between sahhs, although they had no power to mediate; rather they provided observation and insight that led to solutions. They also mediated disputes between the High City of Refuge, Orfa City, and other parties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
