It was named after the galaar, a common bird of prey that was native to the planet Mandalore. It was a sleek, short-barreled rifle constructed from high-quality materials and was covered in shock-resistant polycarbonate. And while relatively rare, the GALAAR-15 was a frequent item that appeared on the black market, and due to its high-quality design, the rifle became a popular weapon among bounty hunters and other professional killers, which allowed arms dealers to charge a premium for the GALAAR-15, with even used weapons going above their standard value."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Death Watch splinter group used GALAAR-15s. Cad Bane also used one such blaster after escaping from Republic prison along with Moralo Eval and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was disguised as Rako Hardeen. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the GALAAR-15 was still in production and was used by the Mandalorian Kad Solus from the Old Mandalorian Clan Awaud."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
