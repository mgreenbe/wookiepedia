Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, Coggins played at the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata alongside Taybin Ralorsa, Ubert Quaril and Sudswater Dillifay Glon. While the four performed, Kanata spotted the smuggler Han Solo entering the establishment, and yelled to him, causing the band to fall silent. They then resumed their playing, but were soon disturbed again when many of the castle's residents rushed out to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon. The castle was then attacked and destroyed by the forces of the First Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Infrablue Zedbeddy Coggins was created for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015.
