Hailing from the southern part of the planet Nentan, he served as a commando for the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire before eventually leaving the profession. Burs was a crack shot who liked to be on his own and an on-and-off partner of Debnoli, an expert marksman. By the time Bron Burs left the commando profession, he was covered with ugly scars. He relied on his intuition to survive. Burs also possessed a degree of Force-attunement. He had white eyes and green skin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bron Burs's origins date back to the production stages of the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. A number of alien maquettes were designed for the sequences in Jabba the Hutt's desert palace. Among those scrapped before the film's release was a maquette described as \"a possible rhino/elephant head.\" In 1998, the Decipher, Inc. Star Wars Customizable Card Game's Special Edition Limited expansion set released a card that named the alien as Bron Burs, thus bringing the maquette into Star Wars Legends canon. According to a Star Wars CCG fan site, the Bron Burs name is an anagram of Decipher artist Rob Burns, and Burs's story references the character \"The Ugly\" from the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
