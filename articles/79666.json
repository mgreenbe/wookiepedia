In 1995, Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens established the species' name as Florn Lamproid and the cantina character as Dice Ibegon, in the Star Wars Legends short story \"One Last Night in the Mos Eisley Cantina: The Tale of the Wolfman and the Lamproid,\" part of the anthology Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina. They were later identified in Star Wars: Alien Archive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character was a hand puppet created by Rick Baker's special effects team. Phil Tippett designed the puppet because many of the other characters in the sequence were humans with masks. Tippett originally intended for the Lamproid puppet to simulate breathing through its mouth parts. It was known as \"drooling arm\" during production because it was able to emit red slime through an internal tube. In preparation for shooting the close-up featuring the character, Tippett rushed to get the tube fitted into the puppet when producer Gary Kurtz questioned the effect. The blood-like drool was at first approved by George Lucas, though he initially filmed the scene without it. On another take, Tippett's assistant, Laine Liska, worked the mechanism because Lucas called for the goo for the puppet. However, the slime shot further and with more force than intended. Lucas ultimately decided against using the effect in the film due to the mess it caused. During shooting, the character gained the name \"Snake Head\", but was later officially dubbed \"Nake\". This became non-canon when One Last Night in the Mos Eisley Cantina: The Tale of the Wolfman and the Lamproid was released."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
