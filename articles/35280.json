Its power was held to be so great that only the sacrifice of sentient beings was required to calm it otherwise its rage would spiral out of control whereupon it would consume the entire Dathomir system and, eventually, the entire galaxy. To prevent this disaster, the sisterhood of the Dark Veil Order ambushed starships moving through the system and sacrificed the captured beings to Dathomir's Vitality."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
