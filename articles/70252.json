They usually consisted of the Jedi's lightsaber, which was traditionally worn on the left, survival rations in the form of capsules, a Hush-98 comlink, a fibercord grappling hook and/or a grappling spike launcher, a holoprojector, such as an Imagecaster, a holomap, an A99 aquata breather, a Jedi beacon transceiver, a glowrod, and lightsaber repair tools. Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker wore a dark-colored Jedi utility belt in the days leading up to his transformation into the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader. Other mission-specific equipment may be added, as assigned by the High Council or Jedi quartermaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
