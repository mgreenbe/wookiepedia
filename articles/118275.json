He and Kabak were both initially disturbed by the yelling of one of the academy's tougher sergeants, Currahee, not realizing that it was largely for show, as the academy's weakest cadets had already been weeded out. Zare Leonis, a cadet who was secretly hoping to rescue his sister, immediately noted Rykoff's calm temperament in comparison with Kabak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both Kabak and Rykoff were witnesses to a confrontation between Leonis and Nazhros Oleg in which Oleg insinuated that Leonis was a traitor and the two then nearly came to blows. The entire group was then punished collectively by Currahee, given three demerits each and forced to run laps at 0400 in the morning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rykoff later participated in a group exercise with Unit Aurek involving the acquisition of \"high-priority targets\", namely droids that were being decommissioned by the Empire due to their advanced age. He watched as Oleg destroyed one of the droids, criticizing Leonis's softness, and was then praised for eliminating something that the Empire would have had to disassemble anyway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rykoff was present for a conversation in which it was discussed that the Empire was conducting interrogations and seeking out traitors in its ranks. He seemed reassured by Leonis's insistence that some of the more outrageous things the cadets had heard were simply rumors.

Finally, as the cadets were tasked to take part in a crackdown on corruption on Lothal, he was paired together with Kabak, leaving Leonis paired with Oleg."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rykoff was a minor character introduced in Jason Fry's 2015 Servants of the Empire: Imperial Justice as a cadet replacement for Jai Kell, who had fled into hiding in the previous installment of the series.
