Through distillation, the native Wookiees could transform it into a slightly sweet-tasting sapwater, which they preferred to rainwater. Distilled wroshyr sap was also used in conjunction with wroshyr leaves to produce chemicals and oils. After the Galactic Empire took hold of Kashyyyk, they too started refining wroshyr sap to distill a volatile chemical compound at an Imperial Refinery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
