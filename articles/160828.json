When the Spice Runners' leader Zorii Bliss confronted former member Poe Dameron, an operative of the Resistance who returned to the planet on a mission, Vicii and Vibbo accompanied her, but were knocked unconscious by Dameron's associate Rey. Their unconscious bodies were returned to the den of the Spice Runners, where they later awoke. Following the Resistance mission, the First Order became aware of the gang, whose members were forced to escape. Vicii planned to escape aboard the starship of the bounty hunter Carib Diss as a return for helping him with a bounty sometime prior. Kijimi was later destroyed by the Xyston-class Star Destroyer Derriphan of the Final Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
