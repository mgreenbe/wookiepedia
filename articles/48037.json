Cassus Fett, to show his support for the movement was amongst the first to give up his individualism and started wearing the golden suit of armor. Many however refused to adopt the standardized look, such as the scientist Demagol, and the status symbol of the Marshals quickly diminished in value. Mandalore began to issue the position to members of his vanguard and soon to those who wished to differentiate from the Rally Masters, such as Demagol's aides. Rewarding the suit soon became his preferred solution to various problems. Seeing the position devalued to the extreme, Cassus argued that the truly distinguished such as himself should again have a different suit to separate themselves from the generic Marshals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of this, the average Marshal, just like the average Neo-Crusader, diminished in quality when the numbers of Mandalorians grew.
