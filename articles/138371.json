However, it did have deflector shields, which allowed some lasting power while under enemy fire. It countered infantry very well because its shield was strong enough to deflect the majority of small blaster fire, and its rapid fire cannons could make short work of the majority of infantry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tank, along with many of their vehicles and manufacturing systems, found their way into the hands of the Alliance after the board of directors of Yutrane-Trackata granted sole use of their products to the Galactic Empire, rebel leaders had exploited the company's reluctance to support the new order by bribing high ranking members to leave shipments of their vehicle vulnerable to being stolen in a well planned raid. The tanks also made their way into the hands of the Chubbits when the Empire took control of the mining facilities on Aridus. The Rebellion only had a limited number of these tanks, so large field formations were rarely used before the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
