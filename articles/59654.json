The Galactic Empire was aware of this rebellious undercurrent, and placed a garrison on the world in an attempt to maintain peace and quiet. By 1 ABY, the Imperial complement was led by Major Stafuv Rahz, a Gektl whom that year received orders from the Sith Lord Darth Vader to kidnap a Harix schoolteacher named Myoris Lin, along with her class of children, in order to draw out several key Rebel leaders. Although Rahz and his stormtroopers captured most of their targets, Lin's young son Berd managed to escape and rally the support of Rebels Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. Skywalker and Solo rescued Lin and her classmates, and Rahz was killed in the ensuing firefight when young Berd rewired his sonic projector to explode. With Vader himself launching TIE fighters on their tail, the Rebels, Lin, and the children fled Harix for good."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harix first appeared in Bring Me the Children, a comic strip story arc written by Don Christensen and released in 1980.
