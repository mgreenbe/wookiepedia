They would survive by consuming materials such as space dust and mineral matter or even pure energy. Such organisms were usually non sentient but there were the occasional sentient beings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most notably were the Verpine[source?] as well as the Oswaft, Blixus, Mynocks, Space slugs, Starweird and Duinuogwuin. Givin might not be considered true vacuumbreathers, but could survive for a day in vacuum conditions due to the peculiarity of their planet. The skin of a Kel Dor allowed them to be in a vacuum for a short time (albeit, only with their breathing masks on.) Kadri'Ra could also survive the vacuum of space for a few days."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
