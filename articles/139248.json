For those heading outwards toward the galactic periphery, the planet was seen as a last taste of civilization, while those heading Corewards saw it a last grasp of frontier living. Travelers found the planet's neutrality and distance from galactic politics appealing, and as a result Takodana became a haven for fugitives, smugglers, and explorers. Takodana was known as the longtime home of Takodana Castle that served as an open port to spies and dubious travelers alike. The world was connected to the Ring of Kafrene mining colony by the Biox Detour hyperspace route."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thousands of years prior to the conflict between the First Order and the Resistance, a battle between the Jedi and Sith occurred on the planet.

While at the castle, Rey uncovered Skywalker's lightsaber, which called out to her in the Force. Not long afterward, their presence was reported to the First Order by Bazine Netal and a battle ensued between the Order and the Resistance, who had earlier been alerted to the presence of BB-8 by the undercover droid GA-97.
