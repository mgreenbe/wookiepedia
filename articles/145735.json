It was not used as a method of torture and was only used by top Yuuzhan Vong officers for the purpose of \"embracing\" pain. The user would sit upon the chair and the thorns in the chair would protrude into and suck blood from the back and buttocks. This was how the chair received energy. Tsavong Lah owned a thorn seat, and gave it as a gift to Nom Anor shortly before the Battle of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
