Although large chunks of the city were ultimately rebuilt, in which the ruling elite resided, much of it remained a wasteland, polluted by the fallout that the devastation left behind. Wrecked starships littered the surface, and ruined buildings sprawled across the landscape of regions such as the Talinn district. Over time, the devastated landscape became overgrown with three-fingered vines and slime-slick fungus. Those who resettled the planet later on made makeshift homes out of old shipping containers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The devastation of Taris was first mentioned in Star Wars canon in the novel Aftermath.
