She was called as a witness by the prosecution Sul Dekkon during the Trial of Tahiri Veila, but her testimony was false and was discredited by defense attorney Eramuth Bwua'tu by crossreference with surveillance videorecording and she was requested by her own prosecution to remand and wait for her own Trial. At the end of the trial she remained on Coruscant until Abeloth's takeover and she was chosen as one of Abeloth's host bodies, being absorbed by her. Abeloth used her body and slipped past Jagged Fel's blockade against Natasi Daala. She helped Daala in the Imperial Remnant general election using the force. Abeloth in Pagorski's body captured Tahiri Veila, but Boba Fett freed her, both fighting her and Veila managed to use Thermal detonators to kill Pagorski."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
