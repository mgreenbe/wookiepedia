It originated on the homeworld of the Chadra-Fan species, the planet Chad. Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs was introduced to the condiment when a Chadra-Fan outlaw requested a taste of home during the time that Tuggs managed the kitchen at Maz Kanata's castle on Takodana. Tuggs was impressed that such a simple sauce was so flavorful and that beings of diverse occupations and temperaments enjoyed it. Bottles of the dressing were available for use by patrons dining at the castle. Sometime after the castle was destroyed during the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, Tuggs published a cookbook which included a recipe for the dressing and used it as an ingredient in Xizor Salad."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chadian dressing first appeared as a prop in the 2015 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.
