In the early years of the Galactic Empire's reign, she and her older brother lived with their father and mother, who maintained an air scrubber farm. Shortly after Xea turned eight, a band of rebels raided the farm and attempted to steal scrubbers by tugging them with a starship. One of the machines, however, fell on the roof and into the room where Xea slept, crushing the eight-year-old to death. Because of that tragic incident, Xea's brother developed a deep hatred for rebels, which prompted him to enlist in the Imperial Academy to become a stormtrooper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
