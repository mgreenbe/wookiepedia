The conflict began when the Killiks, having been driven off their homeworld and sequestered in rather diminutive settlements, expanded their territory onto the borders of Chiss space. This unexpected move by the insectoid beings angered the Chiss Ascendancy, who began to fear that their presence would disrupt their peaceful existence. When the Killiks refused to relent on their advances, the Chiss enlisted the aid of the Galactic Alliance and the New Jedi Order to help mediate the dispute; however, when the Killiks moved to Qoribu, threateningly near their territory, attempts at reconciliation failed, and the Chiss Ascendancy declared war on the Killik hives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To compensate for their lack of military strength, the Killiks, with the aid of former Jedi Raynar Thul, enlisted the aid of several Jedi Knights who had once known and fought with Thul during the Yuuzhan Vong War. However, despite their best efforts, both sides were unable to overcome the other, resulting in a stalemate and many casualties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
