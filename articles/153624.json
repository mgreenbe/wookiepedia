After flying their uvak into the jet stream above the Sessal Spire in an attempt to kill the valuable beasts, Vaal and the rest expected to die, but instead awoke on the island, finding little vegetation and only a single ancient Keshiri corpse. Although she believed prospects to be grim, Vaal eventually escaped the island, making her way to the heavily populated continent of Alanciar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
