However, the knockoff lightfoils apparently did not require any connection to the Force to create, and were fully usable by non-Force sensitives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original or \"archaic\" lightfoils were popular in the years leading up to the Great Sith War.
