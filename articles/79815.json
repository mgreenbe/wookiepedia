A landline was typically used to increase the security of communications, as it can't be intercepted by a receiver without physical access to the line. The term landline was also used to describe a connection between two or more points that consisted of a dedicated physical cable, as opposed to an always-available private link that was actually implemented as a circuit in a wider switched system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
