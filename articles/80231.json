Though the laser knife was much smaller than a lightsaber, it functioned almost exactly the same, being able to cut through matter. The technical layouts of this weapon are unknown. There are records of this weapon being used in the criminal underworld of Coruscant around 32 BBY and some time during the reign of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
