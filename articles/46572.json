Thousands of years later, it was discovered by Centran governor Duttes Mer and by a Sorcerer of Tund, Rokur Gepta, both of whom wanted to acquire the Mindharp and unlock its secrets. Not wanting to risk their own lives, however, and mindful of a local prophecy, they forcibly enlisted the roguish gambler Lando Calrissian and his droid Vuffi Raa to do it for them. After several adventures and misadventures on Rafa V, Lando used the Key to operate the Great Lock on a Sharu pyramid. Calrissian and his companions were transported inside the pyramid, while the Key sunk into the surface of the lock and became irretrievable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
