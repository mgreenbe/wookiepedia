Its coarse and short fur was mostly tan, except for the white hair on the underbelly and around the mouth (the latter of which acted as a mane), and its flesh, when exposed, had a pinkish hue. The creature had a small mouth with four protruding tusks, two of which protruded upward. It also had a white mane on the ridge of the head, as well as small eyes with golden irises. It also had cloved hooves, as well as equestrian-like legs. The body of such animals released a stong odor that some meat-eating species found appealing. The Wookiees, a race of furry giants from the planet Kashyyyk, were very receptive to the smell of that Endorian tusked creature, which made their senses go wild, in some sort of \"olfactory delirium.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, a dead member of this tusked species was used as the bait of an Ewok trap in which Rebel Alliance members Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 were caught in. Chewbacca had detected the animal's odor through the trees. At the center of a glade, a tall stake was planted in the ground, from which the bait hung. The scent of raw meat was very appealing to the hungry Wookiee, who was unable to resist and rushed to the stake. The moment Chewbacca tried to remove a piece of flesh from the carcass, a huge net sprang up all around the adventurers, instantly scooping them up high above the ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Endorian tusked creature was first seen in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, the third installment of the original Star Wars trilogy, which was released in 1983.
