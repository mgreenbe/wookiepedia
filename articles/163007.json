The ships were modified under the supervision of Gunthar and Qesya Vth'naar. The vessels were armed with a navigational deflector designed to clear space dust while travelling through the Kathol Rift but which could be employed as a makeshift weapon when needed. Under Vth'naar's direction, primitive quad laser cannons were fitted to the ship, alongside a single tactical fusion missile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A fleet of ten Waryl's Fangs were deployed to assist the FarStar during the Battle of Kathol System against the forces of Moff Kentor Sarne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
