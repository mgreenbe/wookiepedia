It was a form of liquor. The human Imperial officer Rae Sloane was given a ceremonial bottle of Lothalian currant wine upon her promotion to the rank of Admiral. She kept it undrunk for many years but then sometime following the Battle of Endor smashed it in rage onboard the Star Destroyer Vigilance after learning from her subordinate Nils Tothwin that an unknown vessel had made it past her ship to the surface of the planet Akiva. Tothwin was forced to nervously step over the shattered bottle as a puddle formed around it while receiving further orders from Sloane."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lothalian currant wine first appeared in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
