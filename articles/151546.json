He claimed to have been working on their design for years. The glasses had a wooden frame held together with cord. The left lens was red and the right lens was blue. Umwak claimed that the eyewear could show him the way through the Arbo Maze. However, in reality, Umwak couldn't see a thing in them. The glasses were broken when Umwak fell after stepping on a rock."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
