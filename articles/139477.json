In 10 BBY, the Talisman was stolen by Han Solo and Bria Tharen in their escape from Ylesia, and sold to \"Truthful\" Toryl, a Duros who maintained a used starship lot and dealt mainly in stolen ships. Toryl was only willing to offer 5,000 credits for the yacht, as it was too high-profile to sell safely. Instead, the Duros reluctantly scrapped the luxurious and valuable vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
