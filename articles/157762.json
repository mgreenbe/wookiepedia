The company targeted Nakadia's plastic factories, unaware of the bioweapons being stored on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Twilight Company deployed its forces under the cover of night, the Empire deployed airspeeders armed with bioweapons from the warehouse. Spraying these toxins at the enemy soldiers, the speeders accounted for at least seventeen rebel kills, including rebel trooper Maediyu. The rebels' first symptoms of poison included rashes, fever, and hallucinations were followed by the soldier's organs slowly liquefying, killing them within days. In response, First Sergeant Hazram Namir, the tentative leader and assumed captain of Twilight Company, led a group of other aliens, who were known to show higher resistance to the bioweapons than humans, to destroy the warehouse. Namir, being the sole human on the mission, wore an extensive kit of protective equipment himself. The rebels burned the warehouse to the ground, completely eliminating its stock."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The warehouse first appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
