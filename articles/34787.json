The journals came to be located within the bowels of Rivan's fortress on the planet of Almas and during the Clone Wars, the books were recovered from the fortress by a team of Jedi researchers. The researchers turned the tomes over to the Jedi Council, the governing body of the Jedi Order, and a section of the journals that detailed Rivan's thoughts on the Darkstaff, a powerful Sith artifact, was published on the HoloNet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
