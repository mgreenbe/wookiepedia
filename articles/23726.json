When the Hutt Riboga seized control of the crime in the Cularin system from the Oblee Nirama, Carlin and the Gundarks refused to submit to the Hutt's authority. However, Carlin soon began to realize that the Gundarks might not have made a wise decision, and he expected that the Gundarks would come under attack from Riboga's minions.
