Due to the conflict, Siliu's mother sought passage off world to anywhere that she and her daughter could be safe; however, in the year 0 BBY, the pair were still on the moon in Jedha City. During an attack on an Imperial patrol in the city streets by the insurgents, Siliu was separated from her mother and began crying out for her in fear. The Alliance to Restore the Republic agent Jyn Erso spotted the child crying in the chaos and ran to her from cover, holding her and shielding her from the fighting until her mother spotted the two of them and rushed over to drag Siliu away to safety. Jedha City was destroyed a short time later by the Empire's Death Star superweapon and Pendra died in her father's arms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pendra Siliu first appeared in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 16, 2016.
