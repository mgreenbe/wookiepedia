The cavern was over three kilometers long and around 200 meters high. The cavern got its name from the enormous stalactites and stalagmites littered throughout. A pilot could not fly straight through the cavern, having instead to dodge around the pillars. Sometimes pilot shot the stalactites, to make them fall on their rivals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, Blood Raptors member Gael Kinner's G-59 Cannibalizer and intimidated Rodian entrepreneur Teeloo's YT-1210 light freighter Neeva-Beelo raced through Eskaron, passing through this area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
