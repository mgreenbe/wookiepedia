He became a quick-draw artist and notorious smuggling captain, earning a bounty on his head after he robbed fifteen Imperial Military pay stations belonging to the Sith Empire. In 3643 BBY, during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Empire, Vexx spent time on the planet Nal Hutta, where he owned a safehouse in the bad part of the town of Jiguuna. While searching for the nastiest, most brutal, untouchable scum in the area, the slicer Mako came across Vexx's bounty and brought it to the attention of the bounty hunter Braden and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, who were looking for an impressive local target that could cement the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e's reputation on Hutta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On that same day, Vexx had booked a ticket for a shuttle leaving from Jiguuna Spaceport, leaving a receipt for the purchase amongst the detailed records he kept on an encrypted datapad at his safehouse. The Corellian then traveled to one of the spaceport's hangars with a bodyguard and a crew of twelve Human mercenaries and six Zabrak thugs. As he prepared to board the shuttle, Vexx was confronted by Braden's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, who had learned of the smuggler's location after discovering the datapad in a raid on Vexx's safehouse. Vexx was surprised to find himself cornered, but was confident that he could defeat his opponent; however, the bounty hunter killed Vexx in the ensuing fight. The hunter then took the Corellian's ID tags as proof of his death and returned to Braden, only to discover that both Braden and his associate Jory had been killed on the orders of the Mandalorian Tarro Blood. Mako then used the credits from Vexx's bounty to give Braden and Jory a decent burial."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounty hunter who had killed Vexx went on to compete against Blood in the Great Hunt competition, and during the event the Mandalorian contacted Vexx's siblings and inaccurately informed them that the hunter had killed Vexx by shooting the smuggler in the back.
