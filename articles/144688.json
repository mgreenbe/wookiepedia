The tip of the Slice was known as the Arrowhead, where modern civilization had been founded. It was roughly bounded on either side by the Perlemian Trade Route and the Corellian Run. After these two major trade routes were established, the systems of the Slice were rapidly developed as colonists followed the two routes and migrated into the Slice in search of habitable worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Major planets"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This list includes those planets directly on a superhyperroute bordering either end of the Slice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Jedi Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Jedi Civil War which started in 3959 BBY with the surprise attack on Foerost.
