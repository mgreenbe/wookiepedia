Shortly after the conflict began, the forces of the Trade Federation launched an attack on the village he and his people were inhabiting and demanded the village's surrender. The traders fled deeper into the swamps in their houseboats, but came under fire from gunboats when they refused to surrender. Wayside and his people were rescued by Captain Kael and Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes of the Naboo Resistance. In gratitude, Wayside sent his best pilot, Vedd Deviss, to lead the Naboo resistance to an influential smuggler. The information provided helped the Royal Naboo Security Forces eventually end the invasion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rohan Wayside's first appeared in the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo.
