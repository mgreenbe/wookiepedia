Banned in virtually all star systems, the L70 fired a stream of xenoboric acid capable of penetrating most materials. The inert component chemicals were held within two separate reservoirs, and mixed when the weapon was fired. It was often sold to crime lords, who used it for interrogations or to dispose of bodies. The cost of the L70 acid projector was 1,250 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The L70 acid projector was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon in Gadgets and Gear, a 2019 supplement to Fantasy Flight Games' series of Star Wars Roleplaying products.
