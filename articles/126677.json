After Lovas used the CZ-series secretary/business communications droid CZ-1G5 to fake the robbery of his own banking starship, CZ-1G5 escaped into the Jakku desert and rendezvoused with other droids. Zuvio was led away from Niima as he tracked the droid in a bid to learn the truth about the robbery. Zuvio ended up destroying several of the droids, including CZ-1G5, and then returned to Niima to arrest Lovas before the banker could murder two other Niima deputies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
