In 3631 BBY, he was partnered with a fellow Knight named Novo, and they were among the Zakuulan forces that attempted to stop the escape of the criminal known as the Outlander from the Spire on Zakuul. Tanek met his end as a result of the encounter. Novo later blamed the Outlander for Tanek's death, even though it was not the Outlander who struck the killing blow. Years later in 3626 BBY, Tanek was among the spirits that were summoned to help the Outlander to defeat Tenebrae. Once Tenebrae was defeated, he became one with the Force, finding peace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Players have two options: let Tanek be killed by Lana Beniko for dark side points and influence with Beniko, or set him free for light side points and lose influence with Beniko.
