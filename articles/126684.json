Four Jedi\u2014Master Luminara Unduli, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and their Padawans Barriss Offee and Anakin Skywalker\u2014were dispatched to Ansion to ensure it remained in the Republic. After finding the ruling Borokii, the Jedi agreed to help them deal with their traditional enemies, the Januul overclan. After both the Borokii and Januul armies had assembled outside the Januul camp, Kenobi attempted to get both sides to sit down and talk, though this initially failed and fighting broke out. During the skirmish, which was brief (lasting only minutes), the Jedi fought both sides. Once both overclans realized the Jedi had destroyed their finest weapons while avoiding killing anyone, they ceased all insult and assault and agreed to hear the Jedi out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the growing Separatist Crisis in 22 BBY, in which many star systems seceded from the Galactic Republic to form the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the planet Ansion became a target in a plot led by the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus and Shu Mai, Presidente of the Commerce Guild."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ansion lay at the heart of several treaties, meaning that if it seceded from the Republic, this would in turn cause the secession of many other worlds. To prevent this, the Jedi Order dispatched Jedi Masters Luminara Unduli and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and their Padawans Barriss Offee and Anakin Skywalker, on a diplomatic mission to convince the Unity of Community, the government of Ansion which was based in the capital city of Cuipernam, to stay within the Republic. To achieve this, the Jedi hoped to negotiate an arrangement between the Alwari nomads and the Unity, in which the Alwari would share dominion over the prairie lands that they currently controlled and allow the Unity to develop the resources that lay within half or more of those lands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after encountering the Qulun, a non-traditional Alwari trading clan, the Jedi and their companions managed to find the Borokii, the leading Alwari overclan. In order to be granted an audience with the Borokii council, the Jedi had to collect a tuft of fur from a rare albino surepp, one of only two among the camp's thousands. After Unduli, with the assistance of her Jedi companions, managed to achieve this dangerous, astonishing feat, delivering the white fur to the council, the Jedi were granted an audience with the Borokii elders. The council agreed that it would submit to the proposal set forth by the High Council of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Senate if the Jedi, in turn, would help them to \"deal\" once and for all with their traditional enemy, the Januul, with whom, for many generations, they'd fought and disputed. Kenobi agreed that they would help\u2014albeit to the great surprise and consternation of his fellow Jedi, who knew that martial involvement in internal planetary affairs was strictly forbidden by the Jedi Order. But Kenobi assuaged for the moment their concerns by saying there was more than one way\u2014apart from afflicting hurt and death\u2014to \"deal with\" opposing forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After agreeing to help deal with the Januul, the Jedi, along with many Borokii warriors, marched for several days towards the Januul camp. Despite attempting to arrive undetected, the Januul spotted the Borokii and both sides lined up in preparation for battle. Unduli, Kenobi, Skywalker and Offee walked out and stood in the center of the battlefield. Kenobi then asked the Januul to sit down with the Borokii to discuss matters that were far more important and far-reaching than the parochial conflict between them. When one Januul warrior broke ranks and attempted to charge forward, Kenobi used the Force to stop his sadain, a large riding animal, sending him flying. Once the warrior hit the ground, however, both sides attacked. The Jedi deflected anything that came near them, carefully avoiding maiming or killing anyone. And after only minutes of fighting had passed, both sides ceased their assault, realizing that the Jedi had destroyed their finest weapons while avoiding injuring or killing anyone. Elders from both the Borokii and the Januul overclans then came forward, agreeing to hear the Jedi out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the skirmish concluded, the Jedi spoke with the presiding-council elders of both the Borokii and Januul overclans, deciding that a new building would be built where they stood, so that negotiations could be conducted without either overclan having any perceived advantage. At first, the Borokii elders were angry, claiming that the Jedi broke their word to help them deal once and for all with their sworn enemy, but they soon realized that the Jedi had treated both overclans equally and, in fact, made good on their promise, albeit differently from what they'd envisioned. The negotiations concluded with both sides agreeing to everything the Jedi asked. The Coruscanti diplomats then returned to Cuipernam and, despite being attacked by forces sent by Soergg the Hutt, were able to convince the Unity of Community to stay within the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The skirmish between the Borokii and the Januul first appeared in the 2002 novel, The Approaching Storm, written by Alan Dean Foster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
