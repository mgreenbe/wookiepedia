Upon returning, Marlon Brando had achieved success in 1951 playing in A Streetcar Named Desire. \"Marlon Brando's influence had changed everything,\" Throne recalled with some amusement. \"The actors who mumbled got the lead roles.\" However, having a deep, classically trained voice, Throne was cast in the parts of characters much older than his actual age.

Producer Gene Roddenberry, who had offered him the role of \"Bones\" McCoy, was not offended by Throne turning him down, and cast him as \"Commodore Jose Mendez\" in two-part episode \"The Menagerie\" of the original 1966 Star Trek, which included most of the original pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throne was a popular guest star on many television shows of the 1960s and 1970s, including The Defenders, Naked City, Ben Casey, The Untouchables, and also co-starring, with Robert Wagner, on the ABC TV show It Takes a Thief."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He made two appearances in the CBS TV series Mission: Impossible, in seasons 1 and 4, in the late 1960s.
