By departure time, that flight was nearly fully booked, but a conflict suddenly broke out when a Jedi and a Stormtrooper started fighting for the last ticket. Stormtrooper reinforcements soon arrived, and the brawl degenerated under the helpless gaze of the spokesperson. However, when a group of other lightsaber-wielding individuals joined the Jedi in his fight against the Imperials, the desk lady armed herself with a blaster. She attempted to shoot one of the swordsmen, but was quickly disarmed. The turmoil attracted the attraction of Sith Lord Darth Vader and of a hooded Jedi Master, who started dueling. The spokesperson ducked behind her desk during the whole duel, and she only emerged when Vader chose to retreat, putting an end to the conflict. With a look of intense relief, the woman gave the last available flight ticket to the hooded Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A female Human with a dark complexion, the spokesperson sported a very distinctive hairdo, which consisted in one single bun on the right side of her head.
