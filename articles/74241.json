The old Gozzo flock that had lived on the planet encountered the dragons while drilling to the deep core, and left behind warnings and legends to their descendants about never drilling that far deep, lest the dragons be released. Flanx, the owner of a fuel refinery on the planet, disregarded the legends and released several dragons while drilling for fuel, before being assisted by his cousin Flix and Kazuda Xiono in driving the dragons back underground and sealing them away again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
