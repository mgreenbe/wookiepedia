It was much faster than the older T-65, with a sublight speed comparable to that of the RZ-1 A-wing interceptor. It was also capable of withstanding and causing significant damage, much more so than previous designs. It was equipped with heavy laser cannons and more advanced proton torpedoes as well as an increased torpedo complement of eight compared to the six carried by older models. The T-65AC4 was also easier to fly thanks to a new cockpit layout and improved flight capabilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Incom Corporation designed the T-65AC4 in response to newer starfighters entering service, such as the E-wing escort starfighter and the A-9 Vigilance interceptor. Rather than allow the X-wing to fall into obsolescence, Incom decided to look at existing X-wing designs in order to find ways to upgrade many of the craft's systems. With all of the changes made, the new design was said to have very little in common with the X-wings of the Battle of Yavin. The new starfighter remained popular with some of the galaxy's best pilots even during the Yuuzhan Vong War and was still considered a dangerous craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
