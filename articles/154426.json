When \"the Client\" met with Greef Karga, Cara Dune, and Din Djarin, who was pretending to have been captured by the two, the droid was inside the cantina alongside at least eight stormtrooper guards. When the three companions sprung their trap, they fired on the stormtroopers and the Client. The droid was destroyed soon after when Moff Gideon's death troopers open fired in the cantina, killing everyone inside except for Djarin, Dune, and Karga, who took cover as Gideon's forces surrounded the building and trapped them inside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
