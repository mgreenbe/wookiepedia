This route connected the planets Sorella, Dorella, and Pernella, which were all ore mining worlds located in the Freeworlds Territory. The route was connected to the Procopian Shipping Lane by a small hyperlane between Sorella and the planet Tanya, which was part of the lane. Another minor hyperlane branched off of the run at Dorella, connecting it to the planet Doris. Like all hyperlanes in the Tapani sector, the hyperlane was difficult to navigate due to space debris which drifted into it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Three Ellas Run was first mentioned in Lords of the Expanse, a supplement written by Paul Sudlow and Chris Doyle and released by West End Games in 1997 for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
