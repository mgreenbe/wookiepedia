During these skirmishes, the New Republic pilots of Riot and Hound Squadrons labeled Nasli with the nickname \"Puke\" as a reference to the enemy pilot's favored tactic of repeatedly spraying laser cannon fire. The New Republic pilots also brought up Puke and the other Imperial pilots during conversations at their berths. However, after at least half a dozen engagements, Nasli was killed by the A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter pilot Chass na Chadic of Hound Squadron."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nasli's death was celebrated aboard the Hellion's Dare as the first kill by the New Republic pilots. Fadime, the acting leader of Hound Squadron, remarked that the fallen TIE fighter pilot was never going to spray cannon fire childishly again and moved the name of \"Puke\" to the bottom of the list of Imperial pilots on a tactical board. The Aerie's TIE fighters continued to pursue the Hellion's Dare and its escort until the frigate was destroyed. Only Chadic and another pilot named Wyl Lark escaped the Imperial forces, both of which remembered the fighting numerous times after."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on a reconnaissance mission aboard a UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft at the planet Troithe at least a month later, Chadic recalled in her mind the Imperial pilots she had encountered in the Oridol Cluster, including Nasli, flying through the cluster's clouds. In 5 ABY, Lark engaged in a dogfight with Colonel Soran Keize, the 204th's commanding officer at the time. During the fight, Keize's firing patterns reminded his opponent of Nasli's favored tactic. In the midst of the Battle of Jakku that year, Lark was confronted by one of Nasli's old wingmates, Lieutenant Palal Seedia. After the pair scuffled, Seedia recited Nasli's name to her adversary, blaming him for the late pilot's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hirodin Nasli was first mentioned as \"Puke\" in the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, the first volume in the Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron series, written by Alexander Freed.
