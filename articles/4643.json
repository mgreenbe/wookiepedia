It was then appropriated by a small-time crime syndicate based on Lothal known as the Gray Syndicate. A filthy alley leading to a metal door at the rear of the kitchen that served as the Syndicate's entrance. While the exterior was unnoticeable, the interior was crowded with network terminals from which criminal business was conducted, as well places for playing sabacc. Up a narrow stairway, the Sydnicate's boss, Yahenna Laxo, ruled from behind a stolen Imperial officer's desk, with a sleek black network terminal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
