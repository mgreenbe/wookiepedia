Planets such as Coruscant stopped rain and storms, so that it only rained once a month. On the planet Bonadan, weather control was used to create sweeper storms. On Mustafar, the lava flow was controlled by weather systems in order to prevent them from flooding, and to protect the citizens from explosions. The Ionic Ring Ship, Pasarian Memorial Atmospheric Reclamation Complex Project, and atmospheric dampeners were other examples of weather control technology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
