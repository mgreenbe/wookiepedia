A fierce and individualistic people, they had a culture of hunters and stonemasons, and they based their planetary economy on hunting tourism. In 22 BBY, when the Clone Wars broke out between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, their planet became part of the Confederacy, although much of the populace had a great respect for the Jedi, the devoted protectors of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, a Null Imperial Intelligence agent was employed by the Church of the Dark Side as an imitator of the Emperor's Mage Jedgar, an imposingly tall Human who matched Nulls in height."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nulls closely resembled baseline Humans, with four limbs, a bipedal stance and a relatively hairless body. However, the Nulls could be easily identified by their towering stature. Some individuals were known to be a meter taller than the Human Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose respective adult heights were 1.88 and 1.82 meters. Humans with abnormally high linear growth could easily pass as Nulls, and vice-versa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like Humans, the Nulls had hair covering their scalp. Male members of the species also grew long and heavy beards on their chins, which they usually braided for aesthetical reasons. At least one male individual, a professional impersonator, was known to have light skin, a prominent chin, hooded eyes and a large, hooked nose. That one Null also had his hands roughly the size of a grown Human's head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On their eponymous homeworld, the Nulls lived in small individualistic communities with a strong sense of privacy. The planet had no large cities, and although there existed a planetary government with its system of laws, criminality was normally handled among villagers through fierce retaliation. The Null villages had narrow streets, cluttered with low buildings made of stone and wood. At the time of the Clone Wars, the villagers would seldom use speeders and usually relied on the bellocks for transportation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Individuals of both sexes dressed in thigh-length boots and animal skins. Hunting was an important activity on Null, since the planet's mountains were full of wild beasts prized for their skins\u2014such as the wily laroon.

However, the common people went on with welcoming tourists from other worlds.

The former Director of the Imperial Intelligence Cronal helped acting-Emperor Sate Pestage set up a mock religion known as the \"Church of the Dark Side\" on Coruscant, establishing a body of false Prophets of the Dark Side. Cronal recruited a Null Imperial agent named Heingort Giddis, instructing him to impersonate Jedgar, the real High Prophet of the dark side, who was believed dead. The impostor served along with Rajah Ubooki, a Bimm impersonator posing as the Supreme Prophet Kadann, and they sought to seize the secrets of an ancient Jedi Library on Yavin 4.
