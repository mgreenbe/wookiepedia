The Irizi were disproportionately represented among the Ascendancy's Defense Force and had a reputation for knowledge of warfare. Admiral Ar'alani was born Irizi'ar'alani, a blood of the Irizi family who was also known by the core name Ziara, before she was promoted within the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet and was no longer considered part of any family. At one point, Mitth'raw'nuruodo was offered a place in the Irizi family as a Trial-born, but he declined. The Irizi family was allied with the Coduyo family and the Xodlak family of the Great Families, and sought an alliance with their fellow Ruling Chaf family. The Irizi family was also rivaled with fellow Ruling Mitth family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grysk Jixtus and his Agbui agent Haplif hoped to cause a civil war in the Chiss Ascendancy by drawing the Irizi's allied Xodlak family into armed conflict with two rivaling Great Families. Each of the Great families of the plot were aligned with a separate Ruling family. Conflict between the Great Families would spread to their allied Ruling Families, and then the entire Ascendancy. The alliances the Grysk hoped to exploit were the Erighal family allied with the Dasklo family, the Pommrio family and the Plikh family, and the Xodlak family that was in an alliance with the Irizi family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
