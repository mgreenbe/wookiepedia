Its three large moons produced tidal forces so extreme that often the planet's water and atmosphere were drawn to different parts of the planet, leaving the rest of the world in vacuum.

In 22 BBY, shortly before the Clone Wars, the Body Calculus developed a model of the Galactic Republic's current political situation, which indicated a bleak future for both the Republic and Yag'Dhul specifically. Consequently, the planet seceded, and the native Givin later served as mathematicians for the Confederacy of Independent Systems, discovering new hyperlanes for the war effort and contributing Wavecrest-class frigates from their well-regarded shipyards. The planet served as the base for the First Fleet of the Confederate Navy. Its shipbuilding capabilities were apparently destroyed during or after the Clone Wars, but the industrious Givin rebuilt them by the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet's politics were complex, but certain factions in the government-supported resistance against the Galactic Empire.
