There were few tactics, save for the Fake, that heavily relied on the experience and instinct of fleet commanders. The Slash saw the capital ship line turn and make a hard run against a point in an enemy fleet group. If the commander had timed the turn correctly, then the line of their ships would pass between the enemy vessels in such a way that they could fire upon one or two key targets, one after the other, all without much effective return fire. It was rare that any starship's shields could withstand such firepower, and a successful Slash would almost guarantee an opponent lost two ships. If the attacking ships were able to wheel to port or starboard upon passing through the enemy line, it was also possible for them to make a devastating attack on the rear of the enemy line."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amid the approach, however, all vessels were required to completely commit themselves to the tactic's employment. If the lead ship was slowed or disabled by oncoming fire, collisions and disorder of the line was likely. No tactic was without risk, but the Slash carried more than most. Variations of the Slash included a staggered and even overlapping deployment, with vessels above and below the line of attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War at the Battle of Endor, Ackbar employed the Slash to a devastating effect against the Galactic Empire's fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
