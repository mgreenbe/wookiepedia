During the First Order's occupation of the planet Batuu in around 34 ABY, AD-2508 was stationed in Black Spire Outpost on the Batuu. The trooper conversed via datapad with fellow stormtrooper CF-8011, who questioned what Supreme Leader Kylo Ren meant when he claimed to sense something. As a response, AD-2508 complained that Ren needed to get a sense of humor.
