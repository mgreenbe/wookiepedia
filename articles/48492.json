When activated, the firespray module emitted a fan of green flame which could burn anything it its path. Like most DarkStryder technology, though, the firespray module was only usable in the Kathol sector. Any attempt to remove it from the sector and use it would result in the destruction of the module."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
