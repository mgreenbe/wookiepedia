Although sluggish, it was remarkably durable and could navigate almost any terrain. The MR/RV could store two speeder bikes, enabling the crew to perform long-range preliminary patrols. As the Republic gave way to the Empire, MR/RVs fell out of favor because of their civilian-grade armament, particularly in light of the speed and firepower of the AT-ST, but independent scout teams still found the MR/RV worth the cost of purchase."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
