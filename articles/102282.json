After external fertilization by a male's sperm, an ovum would give rise to an offspring. Sometimes,\nthe mating process could produce several offsprings at a time. In cases where a single fertilized ovum split, several genetically identical children were produced. When separate ova were fertilized at the same time, it gave rise to ordinary siblings who happened to be born at the same time, but were genetically dissimilar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
