They had two horn-like protrusions on their heads and five distinct genders. Members of the species shifted between these genders throughout their lifetime and their native language used complex pronoun cases to indicate both their current and past genders. Some individuals also used these pronouns to indicate the gender they expected to be their next. Because equivalents to these terms did not exist in Galactic Basic Standard, \"you\" or \"they\" were uniformly used in their stead. A proud people, Chalhuddans did not readily accept charity from \"dry ones,\" only willing to accept something if spoken to honestly and allowed to provide something in return."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
