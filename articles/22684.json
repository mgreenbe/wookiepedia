It was entirely covered by an ocean made out of chromyl chloride, which gave the planet its blood red color, mixed with several other acids, making it uninhabitable. However, substances in both the planetary ocean and the ocean floor had uses in manufacturing, resulting in the construction of multiple space stations in Calcoraan's orbit. Count Denetrius Vidian had a storage facility orbiting this planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
