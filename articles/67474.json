They had spiny ridges which extended down from the back of the head to the tip of the prehensile tail, from which a spike could be extended. This spike could be used in personal combat to deadly effect. Their skin was naturally gray, but they could change its color to match their surroundings. Their faces had elongated snouts, large slanted pupils and rows of sharp teeth. It was a custom of the Ipharian-Da'Lor to cover their faces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A notable member of this species was the bounty hunter Vallikor En-Vahdi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
