It was a X-shaped platform that stood upright, to which the prisoner was strapped with restraints which delivered electrical shocks through restraints on the victim's feet and hands. If you abuse this torture device, however, it can result in death quickly. During the Clone Wars, the Muun Overseer Juhm used shocker sticks on Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, along with Anakin's Padawan Ahsoka Tano and clone trooper Captain Rex, after the four were captured during an attempt to free Juhm's slaves on Gwori."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
