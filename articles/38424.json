After Dyspeth was located by the Republic, the members of the tradition that moved throughout the galaxy found that they were capable of using their Force powers to a greater extent, since most worlds were brighter than their own. The Disciples of Twilight shared powers comparable to the Fallanassi, who also possessed the ability of bending light. However, the group's members used other Force abilities that were unheard of anywhere else in the galaxy. Members used the Force to manipulate both light and darkness; the Disciples were capable of using the powers Cloak of Shadow and Shadow Armor to bend light so that they could render themselves invisible. They used the Force to gain low-light vision and to locate enemies that concealed themselves. The adepts could also utilize the Force to create illusory phantoms around an enemy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Disciples of Twilight were first introduced in the Legacy Era Campaign Guide, which was published by Wizards of the Coast for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game and released on March 17, 2009.
