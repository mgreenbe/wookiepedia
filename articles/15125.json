The Republic, however, sent a fleet together with the famous Coruscant Aegis squadron to repel the Imperials. While the Republic's Thranta-class corvettes attacked the Imperial capital ships, Coruscant Aegis destroyed the Imperial Mark VI Supremacy-class starfighters, preventing them from bombing the station. Afterwards Aegis squadron attacked the capital ships and the Imperial fleet, now overwhelmed and suffering heavy damage, retreated to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
