While on Corellia, Shrike had discovered Han as a street urchin and took him in to use as an actor in scams. By sending Solo and other children into the streets on various worlds to beg for money, Shrike made a fortune. Life aboard Trader's Luck is hard and cruel, but a young Solo finds solace and care from the Wookiee cook Dewlanna. From her, he learns to understand Shyriiwook and that not everyone in the galaxy is as vile as Shrike. Solo decides he has had enough with Shrike and makes plans to escape the Luck. Solo carefully plans to stowaway aboard a droid freighter bound for Ylesia, where he had heard about a need for skilled pilots. However, his plan is discovered by Shrike during his farewell to Dewlanna. Shrike is furious, and violence ensues; Dewlanna defends the boy and injures Shrike, but not before she suffers a mortal injury. Stricken with grief, Solo is reluctant to leave her.

The atmosphere on the planet is particularly turbulent, and he manages to land the freighter with minimal damage. The t'landa Til priests were impressed with Solo's skills and interview him, who uses the alias \"Vykk Draygo.\" Ylesia is a tropical world with a few large islands amidst a vast ocean home to massive predators. As part of an elaborate scheme orchestrated by the Besadii Hutt clan, t'landa Til \"priests\" had set up a religious sanctuary that attracted thousands of Pilgrims to experience the \"Exultation.\" Soon enough, Solo is hired as a pilot for transporting spice to and from Ylesia. Not only is Ylesia a religious sanctuary; it serves as the heart of the Besadii clan's spice refinement operations. Massive factories refine raw spice shipped from Ryloth and Kessel into a consumable form bound for Nar Shaddaa and other worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To supposedly \"protect\" the new pilot, Teroenza, the High Priest, assigns him a Togorian bodyguard named Muuurgh.

Before he can begin flying, Solo becomes well-practiced in the simulator and begins to learn the lay of the land of Colony One. With Muuurgh, he tours the spice refineries and meets Pilgrim 921.

Solo actively resists the intense waves of pleasure and ecstasy produced by the t'landa Til. Around him, the slaves writhe in pleasure on the ground and are barely able to return to their dormitories. This jolt of pleasure, a natural t'landa Til ability used to attract females, becomes an addiction the slaves cannot refuse.
