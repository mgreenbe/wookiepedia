Certain Republic Senators, such as Bail Organa and Padm\u00e9 Amidala, were in favor of the proposal, but a number of factors ultimately resulted in the proposal not being passed and the war continuing, mainly the bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Republic Senator Gume Saam of the Techno Union brought forth the Republic financial reform bill to negotiate more funds from the InterGalactic Banking Clan to allow for the production of more clone troopers, the discussion was tabled when Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala pleaded with the Senate to begin peace talks with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, starting the peace initiative. When her proposal was met with support from multiple senators, Amidala was sent to Raxus Secundus to meet with her friend and now-Separatist Senator Mina Bonteri. Meanwhile, Senator Saam and Senators Lott Dod of the Trade Federation and Nix Card of the Banking Clan proposed a way to stop the peace talks in order for their companies to continue profiting from the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidala was accompanied by Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano as she met with Senator Bonteri. After the two Senators were able to convince the Separatist Council to pursue the initiative, Count Dooku plans to sabotage the peace talks, tasking General Grievous with orchestrating a bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid. Demolition droids infiltrated the power grid as the initiative was being voted on. When the attack was successful, the Republic Senate overwhelmingly agreed to end the initiative, not willing to deal with the Separatists who backstabbed them during peace talks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
