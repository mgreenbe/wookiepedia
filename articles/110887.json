One Tusken war clan rode into the town on Banthas shooting and trampling things. While the citizens fought them off, another Tusken group composed of around a dozen clans rode in from the north. They killed six militiamen, set fire to the armory, smashed the central moisture vaporator, and stole some water before fleeing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
