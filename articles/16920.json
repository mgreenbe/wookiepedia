Like Humans, members of the species had the standard humanoid frame and facial features. Members of the species wore loose-fitting attire made of cloth which usually revealed their midsections.

Their architecture was simple and they were not very industrious as only few buildings and structures dotted their mostly untouched green valleys. They were also very friendly and welcoming to off-worlders. However, due to their peaceful nature, they were defenseless against powerful armed foes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 15 BBY, the Biituians were enjoying their peaceful existence until the arrival of the tyrannical Great Heep, who, with the aid of the Galactic Empire, was able to conquer Biitu and deplete its water supply.
