After sneaking in and killing several clone troopers, the droids hard-wired the \"all-clear\" signal.

When Hevy alerted the clone officers with a droid attack flare, Rex shot and destroyed the disguised commando droid. They were subsequently ambushed and driven off the platform, with the Separatist droids believing that they were pulverized. Afterwards, 08 and two other droids, Unit 07 and 09, guarded the entrance to the base when Rex tricked them into opening the doors for Unit 26, a droid that was previously destroyed. When the doors opened, 08 and the other droids were destroyed, and the clones succeeded in recapturing the base, but not before a fleet of Separatist warships arrived overhead and deployed reinforcements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "08 first appeared in \"Rookies,\" a 2008 episode of the first season of the TV-series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. 08 was identified in the episode guide released at that time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Soures"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
