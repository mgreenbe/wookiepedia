Though many were killed, the data gathered by their efforts helped their fellow colonists determine patterns in the interference, allowing later generations to exploit the patterns and safely transport passengers and cargo in small shuttles through the atmosphere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
