Koth had been banished from the Jedi High Council and had avoided Order 66 and the initial onslaught of the Great Jedi Purge. Vader confronted Koth shortly after his wife Mira had given birth to their baby, and Koth pleaded to be spared as he was now only a priest for the Church of the Ganthic Enlightenment. When Koth was unable to persuade Vader, he told Mira and the newborn baby to escape as he dueled Vader. During the lightsaber duel, Vader ordered the three Inquisitors to recover the baby for Project Harvester."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To cover more ground while searching the city, the three Inquisitors decided to split up. While this Inquisitor and Fifth Brother were unsuccessful, their companion used the Force to detect ripples and locate the child. Just as Mira was about to board her father's shuttle, the red-skinned Inquisitor cornered her. Mira begged the Inquisitor to let her escape, and was allowed to board the shuttle as the Fifth Brother and the Twi'lek Inquisitor arrived. The Inquisitor asked why Mira and the child had been allowed to escape, commenting that Vader would find out. As the Twi'lek watched, the red-skinned Inquisitor used the Force to move the baby out of the shuttle, letting Mira live so that she could suffer from the loss of her child and not trust in anyone."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Going rogue and death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three Inquisitors returned to find Vader still dueling Koth, and informed him that the baby had been captured, showing him the baby. Distracted by the Inquisitors and seeing his child, Koth was stabbed in the back and killed by Vader, who then took the baby from the Inquisitors. Vader and the Inquisitors left the planet, and returned to the Inquisitorius Headquarters on a Zeta-class shuttle. To celebrate the success of their mission, the Twi'lek and red-skinned Inquisitors toasted to the death of Koth by drinking Dust Juice, a local beverage which they both found to be unappealing. Together they wondered what Vader would do once there were no Jedi left to kill, to which the the Inquisitor replied that he was sure that Vader would find someone else to kill. As the Inquisitor drank more Dust Juice, his companion turned around to see Vader's shadow looming over their table igniting his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon witnessing Vader's action against the two Inquisitors, The Grand Inquisitor asked his master if what he was doing was a test or an indication of more training, to which Vader denied. Seeing Vader's blade, the Twi'lek Inquisitor ordered his fellow Inquisitor to run as he used his double-bladed spinning lightsaber to defend himself from his master's wrath, who was furious upon sensing their camaraderie, a weakness the Inquisitor believed supplied strength while expressing that Koth's death should have served as a lesson about attachments. As such lesson was apparently unsuccesful, Vader used the Force to slam the Inquisitor against the wall. Fearful of what Vader was going to do, the Inquisitor ran for his life along with his partner. Politely declining the help of the Grand Inquisitor and the other Inquisitorius, Vader started to chase the two Inquisitors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After asking his fellow Inquisitor if she knew why Vader was attacking them, the Twi'lek replied that he told her how he felt when she said that she couldn't believe that he got in Vader's way to save her, having rejected his offer to remain in the Inquisitorius, leading the Inquisitor to respond that he guessed that he had proven it to the Dark Lord of the Sith, to which his fellow said that it was a stupid idea as Vader would now come to take them out. With not other options, the two Inquisitors resolved to murder Vader and then escape from the Empire. Meanwhile, Vader and two Imperial shock troopers followed them aboard an EasyRide passenger airspeeder. The Inquisitors managed to destroy the airspeed, leading Vader to jump to another to then fall from it as the Inquisitors' blades destroyed it into another airspeeder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard another airspeeder accompanied by a droid, the Twi'lek told his fellow that Vader was still coming for them, so his partner promised him to kill Vader together. The Sith Lord launched them an airspeeder, but missed. The Inquisitors then performed the same attack and succeeded, knocking Vader into a building just as he jumped from his vehicle to kill them. Jumping into the building to kill their former master, after his partner verified that Vader was still alive, the Inquisitor expressed his surprise that both of them had actually managed to beat the Emperor's enforcer. As his partner prepared to kill Vader assuring him that he deserved to die, Vader used the Force to make the Inquisitors kill themselves. As his partner told him that she was sorry, he replied that it was all right as no one of them expected to die on bed after the choices they made, telling her that at least they would be finally free. After saying this, both Inquisitors used their respective lightsabers to fatally stab each other, becoming free at least in death."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the chase, Vader reported the actions of the two Inquisitors to the Emperor in the Imperial Palace. When Palpatine asked him about evidence of the red-skinned Inquisitor's treachery, Vader told him that she ensnared the Twi'lek Inquisitor as part of her \"plan\" to build a coalition against them. The Emperor, however, was furious with Vader as during the chase, one of the airspeeder crushed a Gran senator of the Imperial Senate, leading him to relocate the headquarters of the Inquisitorius off-world in Fortress Inquisitorius on the moon Nur."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inquisitor was a male black-skinned Twi'lek with orange eyes. Like most Inquisitors, he was cruel, showing no hesitation over kidnapping a child and celebrated the death of Koth. He appeared to have a friendly relationship with other Inquisitors, but was still fearful of Darth Vader; especially since he had developed feelings for the red-skinned Inquisitor. The Twi'lek Inquisitor's feelings for her prompted him to protect her when Vader tried to cut her down. His act subsequently made him an enemy of Vader but he worked around it and, with the red-skinned Inquisitor, he plotted to kill the Sith Lord so they could be free."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inquisitor wore a standard gray and black outfit, with the Imperial crest on his shoulder plates.
