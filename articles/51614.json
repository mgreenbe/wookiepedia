A turret-mounted Atgar twin blaster cannon able to hit targets 1,500 meters distant and forward grenade mortar with a range of 300 meters provided covering fire as Espo troops quickly disembarked out of side folding hatches. Front and rear-mounted rotating spotlights and nosepiece infrared sensor allowed for effective targeting during low-visibility conditions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hovervan's passenger compartment had room for 16 troops along with a medic and 2-1B surgical droid. Both pilot and gunners sat in the forward cabin, which featured a retractable transparisteel canopy. There was no room to accommodate prisoners however, requiring a JX40 Jailspeeder to accompany the hovervan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
