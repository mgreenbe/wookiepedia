As a Special Projects Consultant, Chawkroft received a message from Ilm Vaz-Weplinn, an Assistant-Deputy Viceprex of the Corporate Sector Authority's Security Division. Vaz-Weplinn proposed the joint development of an advanced prison facility in the Corporate Sector. Chawcroft was pleased with this proposal: her ministry welcomed the chance to share costs of prison development with the CSA, and Grand Vizier Sate Pestage had blocked the budget requests of the Admiralty for their own prison facilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after she signed on, Viceprex Mirkovig Hirken took control of the project, code-named \"Stars' End.\" Hirken and Chawkroft continued working together on Stars' End, corresponding and visiting frequently.

While working on the project, Chawcroft's career prospered.
