After the Imperial and loyalist forces successfully defeated the rebellious ore-dukes, the captain accompanied Vader as the Sith boarded his Lambda-class T-4a shuttle to leave the world. Before they left however, Vader assigned the officer to remain on Shu-Torun as a military advisor to the loyalist Queen Trios while the other Imperial forces left the world. After the shuttle took off, the captain and Trios left the landing pad together. As they did so, the queen asked if the captain could dance and informed the stormtrooper that in Shu-Torun's courtly culture, everyone must dance. The captain wore stormtrooper armor with an orange pauldron to denote rank."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The captain first appeared in the 2016 comic book Darth Vader 19, which was written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Salvador Larroca. The captain's name, operating number, or gender were not given in the comic book. While a stormtrooper captain was depicted on Shu-Torun several times throughout the third arc of the Star Wars: Darth Vader series, it is unclear if any of the other appearances were meant to be this same individual, and so this article does not assume as such."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
