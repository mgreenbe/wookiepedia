A passenger compartment of the starship emerged from hyperspace in a deserted section of space and was successfully retrieved by a Galactic Republic and Jedi Order team which included four Longbeams, including Joss and Pikka Adren's Aurora III, and two Jedi Vectors piloted by Mikkel Sutmani and Te'Ami."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The operation was spied upon by the Nihil Tempest Runner Lourna Dee in her cruiser, as both the Republic's droid array and Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro had predicted that the Legacy Run's flight recorder might be recovered in the Emergence. However, it did not appear, so most of the rescue team moved on to the imminent fortieth Emergence, as did Dee, while one Longbeam stayed behind to tend to the rescued passengers. At that subsequent Emergence, the flight recorder appeared, prompting a skirmish which resulted in the device being retrieved by the Republic, but the deaths of Te'Ami and the crew of one Longbeam."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
