Her audition was recorded on camera and sent off to director Gareth Edwards. While she auditioned, fellow Rogue One actor Angus Wright was also there for his meeting. Impressed with his work in the stage plays Orestia and 1984, the actress introduced herself and complimented him on his acting skills. Not long after that, she was given the good news that she had been cast as a Rebel pilot, and was booked for a day of costume and helmet fitting, and a two days shoot. While shooting her scenes, fellow Rogue One actor Richard Glover was also there and they \"spent a great day together\". Wong recorded dialogue as well, but because of the final sequencing of the battle, the lines she had recorded didn't quite fit and she was asked to come back during post-production for ADR. In the end, however, her voice was not used and the character ended up dubbed by Vanessa Marshall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
