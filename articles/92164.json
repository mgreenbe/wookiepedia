It also included imaging chips that allowed use during bright days or dark nights. Another component was the automated dampener filter that provided protection against blaster flashes, flash grenades or other sudden bursts of light. The TD2.3 could focus on targets up to 600 kilometers away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The main components of the TD2.3 were the telescope lenses which allowed up to 500 times magnification and the instant focus, which constantly adapted to provide continuous high resolution imagery. Also, the binoculars included a rangefinder and other instruments that detailed information such as range, size, and elevation. Thankfully, all this data was processed and controlled by an internal computer, which also controlled the instant focus and was capable of recording data holographically. The unit's power cells charged themselves and lasted approximately six months."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All of these features were operated by simple controls, which allowed the user to change magnification, light compensation, and focus, among other settings. The TD2.3's control dials were the primary control system, but it also featured a telescopic magnification for precision zooming, a calibration switch and a less powerful secondary lens. Military models of TD2.3 could be linked to blaster rifles to increase the potency of long range shots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Components of the TD2.3 included the electronic lens, the viewing scope, hologram recording port, mode setting, power cell recharge port, zoom control, computer imaging, and carry strap fastener."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its sequel, Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns, the Model TD2.3 was depicted as the symbol for the integrated rangefinder, with an AT-AT in its field of view, which increased infantry range to its final level."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
