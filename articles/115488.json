It was used mainly for mining rhydonium, a volatile fuel used by the CIS for stocking on a stolen Republic ship so as to destroy the Valor Station, a space station located in the Carida system that was hosting a Republic strategy conference. Around 20 BBY, the Republic D-Squad's ship crash-landed on Abafar, and later, with the help of a clone commando named Gregor, who suffered from amnesia, they managed to steal a heavily guarded ship from the facility, and return the encryption module to Coruscant, which they got from their previous mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
