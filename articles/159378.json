The system used electromagnetic and holographic transmitters to make the ship blend into the background of realspace. The system was extremely effective, but was also expensive to apply to an entire vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vanish 2 worked like most sensor masks - when activated, the device monitored the sensor conditions around the ship such as radiation, communications signals, and visible light, and then re-emitted these signals instantly on the other side of the ship. This fooled sensor scans into seeing a single and uninterrupted section of space - and allowed ships to operate extremely close to sensors and scanners without being detected."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
