By the time following the Battle of Yavin, Zek was captured by the Corellian slavers and enslaved in the Corellian Slaver Bunker near Tyrena. Circa 1 ABY, a spacer infiltrated the bunker to find evidence of the slaver operations for the Corellian Security Force. Gordo Zek agreed to help the spacer in the search of Neeka Z'all, a little girl lost by her parent, Zorgom and Norith Z'all, when they escaped the bunker. Thanks to the assistance of Gordo Zek, the spacer was able to rescue Neeka Z'all and the child eventually returned to her parents. The spacer also broadcasted the slavers' records on the CorSec emergency request channels, leading dozens of CorSec agents to quickly move to the slaver bunker and free all the slaves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gordo Zek was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
