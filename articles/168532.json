Prior to election, he had been President of Gravlex Med. He was of a younger generation than Horox Ryyder, and Ryyder hoped Howler could achieve peace where he felt he had failed, due to the Separatist Crisis. Howler and his aide, Fo Kuna, attended Horox's retirement ceremony. Thus Howler was later part of the Loyalist Committee that Palpatine saw as a key cabinet in the fight against the Separatists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
