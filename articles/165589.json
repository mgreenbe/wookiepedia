While there they seen that the world was on the brink of civil war. Xanatos's father, Crion was the governor of the planet. Qui-Gon and Xanatos were faced with hard decisions to make. After Xanatos's sister was killed, Crion started a civil war on the planet. Xanatos would join his father and betray his master.

Xanatos had become the leader of the Offworld Corporation and had a plan to destroy the planet. Xanatos tricked Obi-Wan Kenobi into thinking he would not make it as Jinn's Padawan. He then sent him off to a mining platform through a trap door. With the help of Kenobi, Jinn thwarted his plans by disabling the charges. The planet was safe."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Incident at the Jedi Temple"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, several robberies took place at the Jedi Temple. The Jedi High Council ordered Masters Qui-Gon Jinn and Tahl to uncover the thief and present him before the council for judgment. Master Jinn began to compile a list of the items that had been stolen. At first, it was random useless items: a tool box, holo-files of students with names A- H, a teacher's robe, and a sports activity kit. Tahl looked into the missing records, interviewing the two volunteers that helped Curator of Records T'un. As the masters hit a stand still in their investigation, all of the lightsabers had been stolen from the training room used by the senior apprentices. Among the torn tunics and rubble, the two Jedi found in red paint upon the wall: COME, YOUR TIME WILL. BEWARE YOU MUST, TROUBLE I AM. Deciding to alert the rest of the Temple about the intrusion, the entire complex was put on lock down. Yoda was attacked, the temple was shut down and it was Xanatos that was behind the whole thing. Jinn dueled Xanatos in the Mediation Station. The Jedi would come to learn that Xanatos rigged the Temple fusion furnace to explode upon Daroon's restart of the air circulation system; only due to Xanatos' arrogance in revealing his plans. Kenobi met up with his master who had allowed Xanatos to escape in order to save the Temple. They raced down through a food transport tube until they made it to the Tech Room. Daroon directed Jinn to the reactor core of the furnace, where Jinn retrieved the Healing Crystals of Fire, which were the key to destroying the Temple. That key removed, the crisis was over."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Second Mission to Telos IV"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Xanatos' failed attempt to destroy the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in 44 BBY, the Dark Jedi fled to Telos IV after having successfully convinced the citizens that he and his father Crion had been innocent of instigating the Telosian Civil War years earlier. Xanatos was lauded as Telos's number one citizen for his philanthropic contributions, such as the Xanatos Institute for Healing in the capital city of Thani."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qui-Gon Jinn and his former Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi traveled to Telos to confront Xanatos, though their mission was not approved by the Jedi High Council. Both of the Jedi were dumbfounded about what had transpired on the planet. Jinn and Kenobi were further perplexed by the attitude of the populace. The once-peaceful citizens had become obsessed with a violent spectator game called Katharsis. During their investigation of Xanatos's activities, the two Jedi met Andra, the leader and sole member of POWER, a political organization opposed to the exploitation of Telos's national parks, and her comrade Denetrus, a small-time criminal. With the help of the two Telosians, Jinn and Kenobi uncovered Katharsis was controlled by UniFy, a front for the Offworld Mining Corporation, owned by Xanatos. In addition, the quartet gathered evidence that Telos's Sacred Places had in fact been violated by extensive Offworld mining operations. Jinn and Kenobi exposed Xanatos to the citizens of Telos and rather than face justice for his crimes, Xanatos chose to commit suicide by jumping into a pool of acid. With his death, the citizens removed corrupt government officials and reclaimed their national treasures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
