As it happened, this was the one location where any sort of resistance was put up against the rampaging Imperials. Although Cronus utterly obliterated the shipyards and their surrounding infrastructure, it came at the cost of two of his own vessels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving the chaos and destruction that had been wrought at Chardaan behind, Crimson Command went on to attack several more New Republic-aligned planets, including Porus Vida. Cronus then split his fleet, sending twenty of his Victory-class Destroyers to link up with Daala's force at Yavin Prime's fourth moon, with the remainder continuing their scattered raiding. Of all the attacks carried out by Cronus, Chardaan remained the only one where a battle could be said to have taken place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
