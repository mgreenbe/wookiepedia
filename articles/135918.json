Designed to resemble decorative statues, these machines could be placed throughout many different sites, either freestanding or as support pillars. Equipped with passive sensors, the guardian is triggered by intruders or malignant forces intent on doing harm. Their construction was made of a material that made them resistant to lightsabers and they were capable of surviving blaster fire as well as explosives without suffering significant damage. The droid was programmed to be single minded in its mission at eliminating any intruders which it did by attacking with its limbs to crush its enemies. A mechanism was present in the torso of most droids that was a vital component of its operation. This addition was done so as a fail-safe for any Jedi that fought the droid to use the Force to simply twist the mechanism to deactivate the guard droid. Such a tactic was designed with specific focus on Jedi as Sith were believed incapable of thinking of such a manner in defeating the droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Order used these droids throughout their facilities, including the temple on Draay 2 and within the Chamber of Antiquities, the lower levels of the Great Library on Ossus. The guardian of the Draay 2 Temple was tasked with attacking any intruders that sought to acquire the Sith artifact known as Gauntlet of Kressh the Younger. An activation trigger for the droid was present on the floor on a single stone piece. In time, the temple itself would become lost and it became abandoned in time. It was only rediscovered by the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars who learnt of the Gauntlet within. To prevent it from falling in the hands of Count Dooku or the Separatists, a clone squad was dispatched under the command of Jedi Master B'ink Utrila. They managed to enter into the temple where the clone trooper Glitch accidentally activated the guard droid. Despite Master Utrila and her Padawan Rennax Omani assistance, they were unable to stop the droid. However, Master Utrila realized the test of the guard droid where she and Omani used the Force to deactivate the droid through the mechanism on its torso."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid, as a result, deactivated and returned to its statue-like pose where the Jedi marked the stone activation trigger. Afterwards, the expedition came under attack from Pre Vizsla and the Death Watch who desired the Gauntlet of Kressh the Younger for themselves. They were overwhelmed and nearly defeated by the Death Watch until Glitch reactivated the guard droid that began attacking everyone in its path. This distraction later allowed Glitch to destroy the temple by intentionally failing one of the tests which led to a trap that brought the structure down along with the guard droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several stone guardians guarded the Zardossa Stix Pyramid on Zardossa Stix. Their heavy energy projectors were more powerful than any other weapon on Zardossa. Representative Jar Jar Binks clumsily activated them, but by throwing him around, Jedi Master Mace Windu was able to get them to destroy each other using their own weapons. Jar Jar used one of the weapons against several Frangawl Cult members in a successful attempt to rescue the Bardottan Queen Julia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
