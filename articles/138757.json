TK329 was being very open about his experiences with the Empire while he was perpetuating Imperial propaganda."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TK329 was stationed on board the Star Destroyer Vector. At one point in his career, he was under the command of Commander Tallos, but sometimes joined Commander Gorrister and his squad during training activities. TK329 has a wife named Mera and a son named Gareth. When TK329 trained at the Academy of Carida, he finished at the top of his class. During his time at the academy, he became friends with a man named Davin. The first time TK329 encountered the Rebel Alliance was when a group of them ambushed his squad on a peacekeeping mission to the planet Ryloth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During TK329's service aboard the Vector, he and the rest of the crew had some R&R while a small team was deployed planetside on Meglumine. After their stop, TK329 started hearing rumors that a group of troops had mishandled special cargo and some of it got contaminated. After that they started having problems with the engines. The crew had to switch to backup power two times in three days to keep the engines going. The engines eventually stalled and the communications started to malfunction. Suddenly, a lot more men than usual were checking in to the sickbays. The infection would start to show as the training sessions were canceled because there were not enough men to participate. TK329 would get himself checked out at the infirmary and saw that the earliest victims of the illness did not make it. The death toll would number in the hundreds. The effects of the illness were horrific. The crew of the Vector lost all power and had to rely on the back-up generators for the most minimal of life support functions. The troopers that hadn't been infected were talking about making an escape. The halls were stained with blood and decay started to fill the air. TK329 sent a message to his wife and child telling them he was sorry and he loved them. Commander Gorrister and his team planned an escape, and TK329 decided to try to go with them. He finally started to feel the death coursing through his body. He knew his time would come sooner or later. TK329 died wondering what killed him and the rest of his friends and allies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TK329 thought that the BlasTech E-11 blaster rifle was one of the best weapons on the market. TK329 thought that the Vector was a marvel of engineering and that one does not know the size of a vessel until you are forced to run the length of the halls for morning drills. He also thought that stormtroopers were better than clones because they had to fight and train their whole lives for the opportunity to serve. TK329 believed that the Rebel way is one of cowardice and selfishness and that they will not rest until the galaxy is torn apart in civil unrest. TK329 said that to be in the 501st Legion, you should think yourself lucky. TK329 eventually wished to finish his service and become one of the Emperor's Royal Guards. He also wished that his son would follow in his footsteps. TK329 expressed that even if you were weak, you could still be of use to the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
