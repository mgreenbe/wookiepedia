Affiliated with the Hutt Cartel, the Rath Cartel was in the business of smuggling weapons, and hired mercenaries in their efforts to compete with the rival Vandelhelm Combine in a clash that later became known as the Syndicate Wars. However, sometime between 3667 BBY and 3661 BBY, the fighting spilled over into a trade corridor controlled by the notorious gangster Nok Drayen, who swiftly retaliated against both groups in order to protect his profits; Drayen called in favors from Gank mercenaries, Hutts, and officials from the Sith Empire to destroy them. The Syndicate Wars ultimately ended when Drayen had the leader of the Rath Cartel assassinated while simultaneously storming the Combine's headquarters, and Drayen took all of their profits for himself in the aftermath."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rath Cartel was first mentioned in several companion conversations in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, and the Syndicate Wars were expanded on in one of the Galactic History Codex entries added in the 2014 Digital Expansion Shadow of Revan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
