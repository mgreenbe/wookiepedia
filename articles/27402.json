The container was used to store cargo during transit in both realspace and hyperspace. Class-D containers were considered standard equipment to transport dry goods in bulk. Aside from storage capabilities, they have also been utilized as stationary targets during training simulations for TIE pilots piloting the TIE/LN starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
