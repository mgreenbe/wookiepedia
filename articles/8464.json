He was conned out of 25,000 credits by the Tonnika sisters and vowed to track them down no matter where they hid in the galaxy. Agents loyal to Argon were deployed during the search for the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 on the planet Tatooine after the theft of the Death Star plans, including Colonel Parq. During the search, Parq arrested two women who he believed to be the Tonnika sisters in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina; in reality, they were the Mistryl Shadow Guards Shada D'ukal and Karoly D'ulin who had disguised themselves as Brea and Senni Tonnika while on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
