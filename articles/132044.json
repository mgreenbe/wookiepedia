Using the Force, Anakin is able to break free from his cell, along with Bera. After freeing the other prisoners they escape on stolen Single Trooper Aerial Platforms. Moments later, the Harvester becomes fully charged and begins absorbing power from the moon's forest. Anakin and Bera navigate through the terrain to escape from the Harvester's blast radius.

Shortly afterwards, the CIS attack the single remaining Wookiee village on the moon. With the use of traps, Anakin and Bera are able to block enemy reinforcements coming in through the canyons. However, they are unable to set up traps north of the village where the bulk of the enemy's army is entering. They are forced to hold off the enemy until the Republic fleet arrives. During the battle, Republic forces (with Obi-Wan in charge of the attack) arrive and are able to chase off the CIS army. Anakin and Obi-Wan trace the army back to its source: a Separatist dropship called the Harbinger. Together they destroy the Harbinger, severing the endless flow of CIS war machines.

Windu reveals to Anakin and Obi-Wan that during the Great Sith War, the Sith constructed a weapon so powerful that no one could withstand it. It was called the Dark Reaper, and it required tremendous amounts of energy to function. The Force Harvester gathered the required energy for the Reaper, allowing it to work. Mace also reveals that one Jedi, Master Ulic Qel-Droma (who would later fall to the Dark Side but eventually return to the Light Side), learned how to withstand the Reaper's effects. He taught others how to do it also, and the Jedi were able to defeat the Dark Reaper. After the war, the Jedi scattered the remaining pieces of the Dark Reaper to the far corners of the Galaxy and Anakin quickly works out that Dooku has now found those pieces; Windu tells them that if Dooku successfully reactivates the Dark Reaper, then they won't stand a chance against it. He also says that, after the war, Qel-Droma sought refuge on Rhen Var, which is also where his tomb is located. Knowing that's the one place they need to go in order to learn how to defeat the Dark Reaper, Obi-Wan and Anakin prepare a strike force to retake Rhen Var."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Return to Rhen Var"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan and Anakin launch a massive assault on Rhen Var with Anakin fighting in the air and Obi-Wan on the ground.

Based on the information Anakin has given them, they prepare their attack. Anakin and his strike force take out the planetary shield on the Thule moon, Sivvi. This allows Obi-Wan to perform an aerial attack on significant strategic locations across Thule in a Low Altitude Assault Transport. He destroys the Command Installation to cripple the Separatists' communications. Windu then commands the ground forces around Thule's capital city of Kessiak. Upon his arrival, Cydon Prax destroys Windu's TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank. Windu is forced to travel on foot to open the gates to the Sith Temple. Finally, Anakin and his strike force enter the Sith Temple. Anakin then kills Cydon Prax, allowing him to press forward. Because Anakin is the only commander who is immune to the effects of the Dark Reaper, he then defeats it with Qel-Droma's guidance. However, the knowledge he gained from Qel-Droma causes him to act more arrogantly towards Obi-Wan. He takes another indirect step towards the path to the Dark Side of the Force. Meanwhile, Dooku is nowhere to be found and Windu remarks to Yoda that the victory on Thule will turn the tide of the war. Yoda replies \"The battle we have won.
