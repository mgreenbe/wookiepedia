However, Fett duped his assailants into believing he was transporting Solo's carbonite slab into Jabba's Palace aboard a hoversled, which was a diversion that allowed him to sneak into the palace unmolested. In the aftermath of that chase, after Bossk had downed the runaway speeder bike with a blaster shot, this hunter pointed out that \"Fett,\" whom Bossk was prepared to kill, was actually a decoy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
