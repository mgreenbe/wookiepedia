The \"stock\" YT-1300 light freighter was equipped with an Avatar-10 hyperdrive as standard. The drive weighed 15 metric tons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An innovative development in hyperdrive technology, the Avatar-10 was designed to be a \"universal\" hyperdrive system that was compatible with any type of spacecraft. Although critics noted that the bulky hyperdrive was too large for vessels that, by design, were too small to accommodate its weight even with industrial repulsorlifts, the Avatar-10 became a popular choice for upgrading older freighters and transports."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because the Avatar-10 was developed before the rise of the Galactic Empire, its fast Class 2.0 speed, normally restricted to military vessels, remained legal. Modifying the drive for faster speeds was a strict violation of Imperial law, however. The Millennium Falcon was originally equipped with an Avatar-10, though it had been replaced by an illegally-upgraded Isu-Sim SSP05 hyperdrive generator long before it came into the ownership of Lando Calrissian. In 12 ABY, Fenig Nabon ordered an Avatar-10 as a replacement for the Star Lady's damaged drive on Prishardia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
