Disney CEO Robert Iger first announced it at the D23 Expo on August 15, 2015 that the company would be building a Star Wars\u2013themed land in Disneyland Park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California and in Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The announcement stated that these lands would be fourteen acres, making them the largest single land expansions in company history.

Daniel Jenkins, a former Disney Imagineer who helped design Galaxy's Edge, an early concept for the park would have set it in select locations from Episodes I\u2013VI. This evolved into the original planet Batuu once Iger viewed the first footage from The Force Awakens and became confident in the prospects of the sequel trilogy. Fellow Imagineer Scott Trowbridge explained the reasoning: \"The answer really is we know those places and we know those stories that happen there and we know that we're not in them. Black Spire Outpost is an opportunity that's designed from the very get go to be a place that invites exploration and discovery. A place that invites us to become a character in the world of Star Wars. And to the extent that we want to, to participate in the stories of Star Wars.\" At one point, the Imagineers also considered building two entirely different Star Wars lands instead of two of the same concept."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the \"Star Wars and Disney Parks: A Galaxy in the Making\" panel at Celebration Orlando, Imagineer Asa Kalama stated that what they were building would be canonical.

On December 16, 2017, during the parks' Galactic Nights event, more information about the ride and its development process was unveiled to the public via Lucasfilm vice president Doug Chiang as well as Imagineers Chris Beatty, Robin Reardon, and Scott Trowbridge. In particular, it was revealed via construction photos that development had recently \"topped out\" after the highest construction point was in place. It was also revealed that, among other things, there would be a toy shop with concept art unveiled, with Beatty explaining that the inspiration for its design was from marketplaces in Morocco, and that, fitting with its design inspiration, all the wares are handmade arts and crafts similar to those found in Moroccan marketplaces. In addition, the water fountains would have a unique design. (He later revealed that the overall look of the park was inspired by Petrified Forest National Park.)
