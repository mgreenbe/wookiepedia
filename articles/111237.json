The Jedi, having previously broken with the Galactic Alliance due to Solo's status as a Sith, planned to launch a mission to weaken Solo's position in order to eventually overthrow him, and Rakehell Squadron was the key to their plans. Led by Wedge Antilles, Rakehell Squadron consisted of both Jedi and non-Jedi members, most of whom were veteran fighter pilots, even though one of its members, General Tycho Celchu, was still obligated by duty to the Galactic Alliance, as he had originally been sent to the Jedi as a diplomatic Galactic Alliance envoy without the permission of Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rakehell Squadron flew in the Jedi attack on the Centerpoint Station superweapon and the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Anakin Solo, chasing the shuttle Reveille to the Anakin Solo, which contained a Jedi infiltration team attempting to rescue the Hapan Chume'da Allana, whom Solo was using as political leverage over the Hapes Consortium. After the infiltration team successfully penetrated the Anakin Solo's defenses, Rakehell Squadron was assigned to draw off Galactic Alliance fighters and provide cover for the infiltration of another Jedi strike team onto Centerpoint Station aboard a second shuttle, Broadside. This second team's objective was to destroy the station. Rakehell Squadron proved very effective in battle, managing to shoot down two members of the elite Galactic Alliance unit Rogue Squadron and successfully completed all of its objectives, albeit at significant attrition rates. After covering the exfiltration of the intrusion team and Allana on the Millennium Falcon, Rakehell Squadron withdrew to a space station near Gyndine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Formation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rakehell Squadron was an impromptu unit formed by Wedge Antilles in response to a planned Jedi strike on Centerpoint Station. After the Jedi Order had split from the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances over Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side of the Force and Sith status, Galactic Alliance co-Chief of State Cha Niathal had seen the Confederation achieve near-parity with the Galactic Alliance militarily. While the balance of power in the war had been against the separatist Confederation early in the war, several losses and the departure of the Jedi Order had weakened the Galactic Alliance. Niathal had grown less and less confident in the abilities and judgment of Solo and wanted to hasten the end of the Second Galactic Civil War. Knowing that returning the Jedi Order to the fold would greatly enhance her ability to end the war and also knowing that co-Chief of State Jacen Solo had broken the ties with and set the Galactic Alliance against the Jedi in the first place, Niathal discreetly dispatched General Tycho Celchu to make contact with the Jedi Order in exile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Celchu, accompanied by his aides, scientist Toval Seyah and starfighter pilot Syal Antilles, made contact with the Jedi Order and their affiliates, including Han Solo and Celchu's old squadron leader and Syal's father, Wedge Antilles, on their refuge on the Forest Moon of Endor. Celchu discussed Niathal's request with the head of the Jedi Order, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, after being granted an audience, phrasing his statements in such a way that Niathal's involvement could not be traced back to her should Celchu's mission be compromised, as per Niathal's instructions. Skywalker refused Celchu's request, on the grounds that he refused to place the Jedi subject to Jacen Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Instead, Skywalker stated that the immediate goals of the Jedi were to find a new location for their refuge\u2014Celchu's presence and eventual report would compromise their presence on Endor's moon\u2014recover the kidnapped Allana, the heir of the Hapes Cluster, who was being held prisoner as political and personal leverage over Hapan Queen Mother Tenel Ka, and to destroy Centerpoint Station with the aid of Toval Seyah, an expert on the station, to prevent its use by either the Confederation or Galactic Alliance. The station had been used decades earlier to destroy several stars, and Skywalker wanted it disabled, to prevent it being used as a weapon of war. To gain a team of Jedi entrance to Solo's personal ship, the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Anakin Solo, Skywalker planned on commandeering Celchu's shuttle for use as an infiltration vehicle\u2014it contained the necessary codes to grant clearance to land in the hangar of the Anakin Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To say the least, Celchu was displeased by this idea, as his duty was first to the Galactic Alliance and he saw little that the Galactic Alliance would gain from the Jedi plan, despite his own personal feelings in favor of the Jedi. However, Wedge Antilles was able to secure his cooperation by pointing an imaginary blaster at Celchu. As Celchu could now justifiably say he was coerced if questioned by his superiors, he agreed to Skywalker's plan. His long ties with many members of the Jedi Order and friendship with Jedi supporters, including Antilles, Solo, and the family of old Rogue Squadron pilot and Jedi Master Corran Horn influenced his decision as well. Celchu furthermore managed to persuade Antilles to let him accompany the Jedi strike team in a starfighter as a means of returning him to the Galactic Alliance. Also, Celchu appointed Syal Antilles as the official diplomatic liaison from the Galactic Alliance to the Jedi Order, allowing her freedom from the same oaths of duty that constrained him from fully working with Antilles and the Jedi. With that matter settled, Skywalker planned to have Antilles raise a squadron of starfighters to chase Celchu's shuttle and the infiltration team it would contain into the Anakin Solo and then provide assistance in the mission to destroy Centerpoint Station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antilles carried out his orders, forming Rakehell Squadron out of a combination of personal friends, members of the Jedi Order, and his own daughter Syal Antilles. The squadron, supplied with T-65 X-Wing starfighters by the Jedi Order, was initially stationed on the pleasure ship and converted Imperial-class Star Destroyer Errant Venture until word came that Jacen Solo was leading an assault fleet to the Corellian system. The time had come for Skywalker and Antilles to make their play."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Launching from a point two light-years outside of the Corellian system, Rakehell Squadron made a short jump through hyperspace, escorting a pair of shuttles. The first, Reveille, was to be chased into the Galactic Alliance fleet by the Rakehells to allow its passengers, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo, Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne, Ben Skywalker, Iella Wessiri Antilles, and R2-D2 to infiltrate Jacen Solo's flagship and rescue Allana. The second shuttle, Broadside, would carry another force of Jedi including Kyp Durron, Jaden Korr, Valin Horn, and Doctor Seyah, all disguised as Galactic Alliance Guard troopers, to Centerpoint Station for their attempt to destroy the superweapon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Centerpoint Station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they approached the scene of the battle, where Confederation forces were already engaging the Galactic Alliance, the members of Rakehell Squadron, or \"Rakes,\" began pursuing Reveille, but were firing to barely miss the craft, creating an illusion of pursuit to reinforce the idea that Reveille was friendly to Galactic Alliance forces. Flying as Rakehell Three, Tycho Celchu agreed to fly on the run towards the Anakin Solo as part of the squadron, but refrained from firing. Also, his communications board was slaved to Antilles', preventing him from providing the Galactic Alliance with information on the squadron's plans. Furthermore, Reveille was broadcasting its proper registration as a Galactic Alliance vessel, as Iella Wessiri Antilles had already sliced the password out of its computer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the shuttle and the starfighters harrowing it approached the Anakin Solo, the Galactic Alliance Star Destroyer opened fire on them. The members of Rakehell Squadron went defensive, evading the fire, but Tycho Celchu took advantage of the confusion to discreetly inform Syal Antilles that he was going to make a break for the Star Destroyer's hangar bay. He also ordered her not to follow him. Following Reveille in as the other Rakehells broke off, Celchu was able to evade the Galactic Alliance fire and land safely inside its hangar, intent on alerting the security forces gathered there of the danger posed by the Jedi inside Reveille. However, as he was exiting his cockpit, he was shot by a trigger-happy security guard, allowing the Jedi to exit their vessel with the element of surprise intact. Celchu would later recover and continue in Galactic Alliance service, despite his own personal misgivings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following their successful mock pursuit of Reveille, Wedge Antilles directed Rakehell Squadron to commence a similar routine, this time on Broadside. However, while they were chasing Broadside, Rakehell Squadron found itself opposed by Galactic Alliance starfighters, and not just any unit. As they approached Centerpoint Station, the Rakehells found themselves entangled with Rogue Squadron, the elite starfighter squadron dating back to the Galactic Civil War that had also been founded and commanded by Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles. The two squadrons clashed in a duel prolonged by the high levels of skill present in the members of both squadrons. Initially, the Rakehells, particularly Wedge and Syal Antilles, tried to avoid destroying the starfighters of their opponents, but as the engagement continued, they had no choice. Even glancing shots intended to damage the Rogues were insufficient to stop the famous squadron and Rakehell casualties were mounting. In the midst of battle, the senior Antilles noted that while at least two Rogues, including Rogue Leader, a Duros named Lensi, had been killed, the Rakehells had suffered losses of their own. Rakehell Six, Twool, had been killed and Rakehell Eight, Cheriss ke Hanadi, was either dead or extravehicular. Additionally, Sanola Ti, flying as Rakehell Two, had also sustained damage to her starfighter and Antilles ordered her to withdraw from the engagement zone. With Celchu having returned to the Galactic Alliance, the Rakehells had only eight pilots remaining in the engagement zone. However, Broadside had safely docked with Centerpoint Station and disembarked its group of saboteurs, who were successful in initiating the destruction of the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The arrival of a Commenori task force to the battle in support of the Corellians had diverted the attention of the Galactic Alliance and drew the Rogues and other starfighter units away from the Rakehells, whose intentions the Galactic Alliance forces had been unable to ascertain. Seyah, Durron, and the other Centerpoint saboteurs withdrew on Broadside from the doomed station. Meanwhile, the Jedi aboard the Anakin Solo had successfully retrieved Allana. Knowing that they could not retreat back on Reveille, Luke Skywalker had arranged for Jagged Fel, Kyle Katarn, and C-3PO aboard the Millennium Falcon to provide extraction for the intrusion team aboard the Anakin Solo. As the Millennium Falcon approached the Anakin Solo, the Rakehells were tasked with providing cover for the freighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Opening fire with laser cannons and proton torpedoes, the Rakehells were successful in diverting the Anakin Solo's fire from the Millennium Falcon and the intrusion team was successfully evacuated, one step ahead of an enraged Jacen Solo, who ordered his gunners to use tractor beams to capture the freighter. However, they were unable to do so in time and the Millennium Falcon, Broadside, and the Rakehells escaped to hyperspace. Just before they left, the Rakehells observed the detonation of Centerpoint Station, which obliterated both the Corellian/Commenori fleets and the Galactic Alliance flotilla, except the Anakin Solo, and brought the battle to an abrupt halt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving the Corellian system, the Rakehells and the ships they were escorting next stopped at an orbital station near Gyndine owned by Tendrando Arms. As the owners of Tendrando, Lando Calrissian and Tendra Risant Calrissian were sympathetic to the Jedi, there was no issue with the use of the facility.

With kills numbering in the dozens, Antilles was described as the best starfighter pilot alive and was also a formidable trainer, having trained at least three of the pilots in Rakehell Squadron personally. By the end of his service with the Galactic Alliance, Antilles had attained the rank of general. Although retired at the start of the Confederation-Galactic Alliance War, Antilles soon found himself embroiled in the hostilities after escaping Galactic Alliance custody.
