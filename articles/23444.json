It occupied the third orbit between the planets of Bacrana and Tomik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The denseness of the asteroid belt made navigation through it very difficult. Collisions between rocks were frequent and often hard enough to throw one or the other out of the belt into normal system space. The Galactic Empire and Bacrana System Defense Force often swept the area to keep these rogue asteroids from drifting into space traffic lanes. In spite of this regular surveillance of the belt, the Rebel Alliance kept two observation posts built into two of the larger asteroids: Outpost C-1 and Outpost C-2."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
