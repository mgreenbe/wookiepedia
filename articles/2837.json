He's a scoundrel with a mercenary's sensibility and the heart of a hero. Together they help topple an Empire and restore order to the galaxy\u2026And if they stop fighting long enough, they just might realize that they're in love! Set during the days leading up to The Empire Strikes Back, Han Solo and Princess Leia find themselves trapped together on a downed starship, lost in the frozen wastelands of Hoth as a storm rages around them. And while the snow flies outside the ship, the sparks fly inside. No matter how hard they fight it, there's more going on between them than just friendship!"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Rebel Alliance works to establish a base on the planet Hoth, sparks fly between Princess Leia and Han Solo. A Rebel Alliance general suggests Han flies down to the base to bring much-needed supplies to the workers. Leia volunteers to accompany Han along in one of the two transports, while Chewie flies in the second. Much to Han's chagrin, Leia is permitted to join in as well. As the two transports fly down to Hoth's surface, a massive blizzard hits at the same time. Both transports crash-land on the surface and, to make matters worse, Chewie's transponder wasn't activated; in this, Chewie cannot easily be located. Han tries valiantly at first to rescue Chewie on foot, but is knocked out by the powerful winds. Leia brings Han back in to chastise him on his reckless actions, but Han's fierce loyalty to his co-pilot makes Leia sympathize with the rogue smuggler. The blizzard worsens, forcing the two to huddle together for body heat in the night. As the night passes, Han shares stories of his exploits to Leia, which allows the two to bond together. Just when they are about to kiss, a Rebel scout party locates them with Chewie alive and well. The Millennium Falcon's pilots are happily reunited and, later at the new base, Leia commends Han for being a better man than she originally thought."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collected in"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
