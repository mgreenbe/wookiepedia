It was a variant design of the earlier Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor, with the Delta-7B featuring a relocated astromech droid slot and a slightly enlarged hull. The Delta-7B also had a set of pop-out S-foils that could be extended for certain flight maneuvers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars canon, there was initially some confusion as to the difference between the Delta-7B and the Delta-7, which had remained separate in the Star Wars Legends continuity. The canon Databank stated that both models were the same, designating it as the Delta-7. However, Ultimate Star Wars made the distinction between the Delta-7 and the Delta-7B, stating that the latter was the model seen throughout the majority of events in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, in accordance with Legends source material. In the non-canon LEGO animated TV series Droid Tales and The Resistance Rises, Admiral Ackbar owns a blue Delta-7B interceptor called the Daisy Mae."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
