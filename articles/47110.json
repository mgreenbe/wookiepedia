He met with various other senior members of the group aboard a hovertrain that served as their interim headquarters, to discuss how the Whiplash would react to the recent capture of their leader, Thi Xon Yimmon, by the Empire. At the suggestion of the Sakiyan Tuden Sal, leadership of the Whiplash passed to the Whiplash Council, and Sil-at served as a member of the council. Under Sal's influence, the Whiplash launched an ill-fated attack on the Emperor's Villa near the Western Sea, and Sil-at perished as a result of the debacle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
