They, along with Mazur and Lumin, two BFF-1 bulk freighter groups, were part of a troop convoy passing through the Mylok system. The cargo of Bira was both troops and technicians. Bira and Assault Gunboats were escorting the freighter groups. The convoy itself was part of a three wave group, meaning that both Lumin and Mazur had four ships from their group at a time with five corvettes from Bira. An Rebel Alliance strike force consisting of X-wings, A-wings, and B-wings arrived attempting to destroy at least half of the entire convoy. The Nebulon-B2 frigate Blue Ruin arrived to assist the convoy, the frigate contained TIE Avengers from Avenger Squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The outcome depends on which side the player takes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
