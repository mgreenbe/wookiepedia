The CC-7700 was an Interdictor vessel, due to its ability to emit an interdiction field, which prevented other ships from entering hyperspace and could be used to maroon vessels traveling at lightspeed. In 14 BBY, one CC-7700 formed part of a task force commanded by Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and was used in conjunction with other Interdictor vessels in a failed attempt to capture the rebel corvette Carrion Spike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CC-7700 frigate was a type of Interdictor vessel. Like its predecessor, the Detainer CC-2200, the CC-7700 featured thick armor, a downsloping bow, and stubby winglike lateral projections that housed quartets of gravity well projectors. These allowed the ship to emit an interdiction field. The frigate also had sublight engines and could communicate with nearby Imperial ships via a battle net."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an Interdictor vessel, the CC-7700 frigate utilized its gravity well projectors to generate an interdiction field, which could be used to pull enemy ships out of hyperspace or to prevent them from entering it in the first place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 14 BBY, the CC-7700 frigate was used by the Imperial Navy. At this time, a rebel cell was able to steal the Carrion Spike, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's prized corvette, and use it in a series of attacks on Imperial facilities. In an attempt to stop the campaign, Tarkin assembled a task force to capture the vessel, which consisted of the Imperial-class star destroyer Executrix, an Immobilizer 418 cruiser, a Detainer CC-2200, a CC-7700 frigate, and several other pickets, frigates, and gunboats. Based on fake coordinates transmitted by the rebels, the Imperial group traveled to the Obroa-skai system in the Inner Rim, where Tarkin hoped to intercept the rogue corvette."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarkin contacted the task-force liaison officer aboard the CC-7700 by battle net just before the Carrion Spike's estimated arrival time. The officer informed Tarkin that the Interdictor vessels' gravity well projectors were powering up to high gain and that the field would be disabled soon after it was initiated, so that civilian vessels would not be pulled out of hyperspace too. However, the commander also explained that such a result may be unavoidable, due to the high traffic in the system and because the Carrion Spike's speed meant that the gravity well projectors had to be set at a higher power setting. Regardless, just as the corvette was expected to arrive, the Immobilizer 418 malfunctioned, causing the interdiction field to fluctuate and pull several civilian ships from hyperspace. The Detainer and a luxury liner then collided, causing chaos and branding the mission as a failure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CC-7700 frigate appeared in the new Star Wars canon in the 2014 novel Tarkin, by James Luceno.
