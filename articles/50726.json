The traditional preparation of tip-yip by Ewoks was oven-roasted. Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs created his own version which was breaded and fried. He covered the fried tip-yip with Gurreck Gravy, which was created by Ewoks and made with Endorian herbs, and served it with a side of mixed vegetables and mashed chokeroot stirred together. The dish could be consumed by Artiodacs, humans, and Togrutas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 9 ABY, the Mandalorian warrior Din Djarin travelled to a desert world as he sought help from fellow Mandalorians Bo-Katan Kryze and Koska Reeves to rescue his foundling, Grogu.

He also began his mobile restaurant, Tuggs' Grub, which he operated out of a modified transport shuttle. In 34 ABY, he brought Tuggs' Grub to Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu and worked at Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo, a building where rotating guest chefs brought mobile restaurants. On Batuu, he served Fried Endorian Tip-Yip in portions sized for adults or for younglings. Explorer and author Eloc Throno wrote in his guidebook Traveler's Guide to Batuu that the hearty dish, which he referred to as Endorian Fried Chicken, was the best preparation of tip-yip he had eaten outside of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 34 ABY, Resistance spy Vi Moradi ate Fried Endorian Tip-Yip at Tuggs' Grub during its monthly week-long visit to Batuu. In that same year, Tuggs served the farmer Julen Rakab and the smuggler Izal Garsea his dish along with a fiery red sauce and Moof Juice. After Garsea left, the musician Neelo came to their table and ate from Rakab's dish. When Garsea returned, Tuggs prompted her to eat by questioning why she had not eaten her tip-yip yet; she enjoyed it even though it had grown cold. Rakab later gave a morsel of the tip-yip to a feral tooka cat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fried Endorian Tip-Yip was first made available to guests in the restaurant Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo at Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, a themed attraction that opened at Disneyland Park on May 31, 2019.

In the past, the entr\u00e9e's menu description read, \"Crispy chicken, roasted vegetable potato mash, herb gravy.\" The entr\u00e9e has since added another side option that originated with the youngling meal, becoming \"Crispy chicken with choice of vegetable mashed potatoes with herb gravy or macaroni and cheese and roasted vegetables.\" Since its debut, the dish has been renamed more than once, including to Endorian Fried Chicken Tip-Yip and to Endorian Fried Chicken."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Recipes for the dish and its components are included in the 2019 recipe book Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, written by Marc Sumerak and Chelsea Monroe-Cassel.
