Coming in a variety of shapes, sizes and colors, Marker Signs could be used to warn beings to not step in certain places, or to warn them about dangerous machinery and equipment. Starships were equipped with them as standard, but over the course of a ship's operational life, the signage inevitability wore away and had to be replaced. Smugglers would also intentionally mislabel parts of their ships in an effort to warn customs officials away from areas of the ship they did not want to be searched. SoroSuub Corporation produced replacement signage at a cost of ten credits apiece."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
