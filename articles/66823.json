This piece of paper would then be ejected from the camera. A flash of light was also released simultaneously with the recording, presumably to provide additional brightness to the captured image."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A device of this type was used by an unknown Wookiee in an unknown cantina, to take a picture of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and fellow Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.
