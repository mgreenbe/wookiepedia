Instead of patching into the HoloNet for long-distance communication, the megacaster projected its user's voice and image nearby, but magnified to greater volumes and size. A typical model was capable of projecting images that ranged from centimeters up to ten meters in height. The volume controls were similarly adjustable, suitable for addresses to small, private audiences or vast populist rallies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Holo-Megacaster was mentioned in Rise of the Separatists, a roleplaying supplementary sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying series that was published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
