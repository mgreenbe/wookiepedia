It was capped by the Galactic Great Seal, a fanned spear that was used as the sigil of the Republic. Valorum's staff had a brown handle with dark blue joints at each end. The seal was set on a tan, circular base with two brown markings on the bottom, six smaller brown markings on the upper side, and two small blue dots below the center of the seal. The seal was brown and had three tips that extended past the circular base. At its center was a blue circle with a tan outline. Part of the top tip of the seal was tan colored, and the whole tip was surrounded by a thick, blue point."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ceremonial Staff was released as an accessory for Chancellor Valorum's action figure in Hasbro's Star Wars: Episode I toy line, launched in 1999."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
