Eventually, four weeks after the start of D-127X's mission, the Oplovis Sector Fleet left Harrod's Planet in order to attack the Alliance army located on the Atrivis sector planet Mantooine but was defeated in the Atrivis system by an Alliance battle line. A decade later, between 12 ABY and 13 ABY, the Harrod's Planet system was situated within the borders of the Galactic Empire's successor state, the Imperial Remnant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Harrod's Planet system was first mentioned in the 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas, authored by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry, which placed it in grid square M-5."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
