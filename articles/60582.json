Sometimes found inside of nebulae, it quickly bonded to a starship's sublight drives. Ships passing through heglum clouds need to undergo regular drive scrubbing in order to remain at optimal performance. The planet Stroiketcy had heglum, malsarr, and iridium suspended in its surface oceans. The Kathol Rift was thick with both heglum and iridium."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
