The gang consisted of male and female human hoodlums and thugs armed with blaster pistols and swords who were known to get involved in housing block shootouts. After an incident involving speeders, the Nexu Claws came to hold a grudge against the criminal Riley and her sibling, a smuggler."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group placed an open bounty on the smuggler's head, which remained active for some time until the Ivax Syndicate tracked down the location of the Nexu Claws for the smuggler. The smuggler then attacked the gang and defeated a large number of its enforcers before confronting Red Adder. The gang leader initially claimed he should kill the smuggler and Riley, but relented and agreed to remove the bounty once the smuggler claimed to have powerful allies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nexu Claws first appeared in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
