The simulation would then give the pilot a target, a small asteroid. The \"asteroid\" would gain speed, and use its dovin basal to strip the X-wing of its shields. The dovin basal would also absorb any laser fire into a black hole, and would end the simulation by destroying the X-wing with plasma fired from its Yaret-Kor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even experienced pilots had a difficult time lasting in the simulation.
