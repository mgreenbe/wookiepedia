It could be found on the Common Paths level of the Rryatt Trail. It was a level 54 Gold Chevron elite, which meant that it was much stronger and tougher than normal wallugas and even posed a threat to players with higher levels. It was not involved in any quest, though players have to cross the small area with Wallugget and a group of other wallugas to reach the next level of the Rryatt trail."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
