During the High Republic Era, the moon had an estimated population of 1.2 billion. One of the Emergences of the Great Hyperspace Disaster saw three fragments of the freighter Legacy Run enter the Eriadu system. Tempest Runner Kassav Milliko of the Nihil marauder group, having received the locations of future Emergences from Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro, intended to use the knowledge of the imminent Emergence at Eriadu to extort the planet's governor, Mural Veen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After two fragments entered the system, one destroying a group of lommite transports, Veen eventually agreed to Milliko's demands in return for the prevention of the Emergence. A third fragment headed toward the moon, but Milliko's corvette New Elite failed to microjump to the correct location in order to shoot it down, causing the fragment to strike the surface of the moon. Following the impact, a debris cloud rose from moon, and shock waves rolled across its surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
