She saved Zannah's life, despite dreaming of her growing to become a powerful Dark Jedi. Laa viewed that all life was worth saving, and tried to teach her convictions to Zannah. However, the Bouncer's lessons were to no avail. When she was killed by the Jedi Petja, who thought Zannah was being attacked, the girl retaliated in anger, snapping the Jedi's neck with the dark side of the Force. This brutal killing led Darth Bane to decide to take her as his first apprentice under his Rule of Two."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
