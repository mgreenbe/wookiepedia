In the Bardottan faith, there was a demon called Malmourral, whom the Frangawl Cult worshiped as a god. In certain mythologies, demons were said to have red eyes. When someone wrestled with a temptation, it was said metaphorically that he or she had an angel and a demon on his or her shoulders. Male Devaronians were thought to look like devils. The devil was an individual demon used in the phrase \"speak of the devil,\" which referred to something happening right after one considered it. Commodore Karyn Faro thought the phrase when, after pondering if she had unwittingly done something to annoy the Chiss Ascendancy, Admiral Ar'alani appeared behind her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
