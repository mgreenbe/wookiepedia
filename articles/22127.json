Afraid that he would be executed, the Resistance created a group with the sole purpose of locating Ackbar.

On their way back to the Resistance base, the group's ship crashed on Taul and the only survivors were CO-34, O-MR1, a protocol droid named C-3PO, a medical droid named 2MED2, and two security droids called PZ-99 and VL-44."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droids, led by C-3PO, picked up a signal from a First Order vessel.
