After being startled by the Count's sudden appearance, he told him his ship was ready. The Count boarded and the droid saw him off. As Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the hangar, he saw Dooku leaving aboard his Solar Sailer, and quickly made his way to a Sheathipede-class transport shuttle. Outside the shuttle were the commander and a B1-Series battle droid, presumably going to make their escape. Obi-Wan ignited his lightsaber and destroyed the commander with one stroke before sending the B1's blaster fire back at him. Kenobi started the shuttle, Anakin Skywalker boarding shortly after. Kenobi managed to shoot down Dooku, before their ship was hit by a Vulture Droid. Both ships crashed on the surface of Vanqor, which would lead to a mission on Florrum."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This droid, like all battle droids, was voiced by Matthew Wood."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
