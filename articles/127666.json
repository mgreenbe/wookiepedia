Slyder decided to accompany Dol Donar II and his men on Dol Donar's yacht, when chasing the Rebel vessel Truly Sorry, rather than using his own craft, since the yacht was bigger, faster and better armed than his own. Slyder's shuttle was left behind on the Star, when Slyder perished in an explosion destroying Donar's yach. The fate of Slyder's space shuttle remains unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
