Usma was training a Padawan in the later years of the war, and the two were on the Republic capital of Coruscant when the Empire attacked the planet in 3653 BBY. During the fighting, Usma engaged a Sith Pureblood by the name of Praven in a intense duel, and despite the Master's skill, Usma was struck down and killed by the Sith Lord in front of the Jedi's student. Praven spared Usma's Padawan, telling her to seek him out after she had finished her training, and he dispatched her as well when the Jedi tracked him down years later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Usma was first mentioned in a codex entry in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
