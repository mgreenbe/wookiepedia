Though Hextrophon's researchers had tight time constraints and found it difficult to contacting primary sources directly due to security restrictions, they spent thousands of hours studying reports from Alliance personnel, and the finished report was 168,000 data screen units long, taking over 700 hours to read at an average of fifteen seconds per screen. Hextrophon had his assistant, Voren Na'al, prepare a condensed version for use as a briefing manual for new Rebel officers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
