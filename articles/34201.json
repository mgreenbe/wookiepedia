The droid informs Grievous that a Dark Jedi who had recently been on board Grievous' ship had stolen the cyborg's collection of Sith lightsabers. Obviously aware of the Dark Jedi's destination, Grievous pilots his personal craft to the acidic world of Dica. After landing his ship, Grievous spots the Dark Jedi on top of a sharp embankment and confronts her. After commanding the Dark Jedi to reveal her name, a second woman steps out from behind the first. The Dark Jedi are apparently twins and are not ready to give up their prize. In a tandem attack, the twins are able to sever a part of Grievous' mask and take the upper hand. However, Grievous remains confident and is able to knock the twins' lightsabers out of their hands with one hard strike. The weapons twirl in the air and land in a lake of acid. Disarmed and outgunned, the sisters quickly retreat as Grievous hollers after them. With Grievous' lightsaber collection now destroyed, he resolves to restart the collection, but this time it will be with Jedi lightsabers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally published in Japan, the stories from Tokyopop's Star Wars Manga were considered to be of \"fuzzy\" continuity by Lucasfilm.
