After several complications in his defection, Madine became a valuable part of the Rebellion, advising and leading commando operations. He also planned the successful commando raid on the second Death Star's shield generator. After the Battle of Endor, Madine continued to serve in the New Republic.

He rose quickly through the ranks after establishing himself as an innovative tactician and effective leader. He was engaged to a woman named Karreio. When the Imperial Military identified a need for a surgical strike force to counter the Alliance's guerrilla tactics, Madine was selected to form the unit. The result was the Storm commandos, which Madine hand picked from the stormtrooper ranks and trained himself. He led the unit on a number of missions, but found the missions he and his men were called on to perform were increasingly questionable."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Defection complications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He attempted to defect to the Alliance prior to the Battle of Yavin, and, to prove his loyalty, Madine provided essential guidance for the sabotage of Operation Strike Fear and the destruction of the Star Destroyer Invincible.
