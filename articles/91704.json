When rumors of the Empire testing biological weapons in the Kessel Bunker, a laboratory off of Kessel, spread across the galaxy, the Spectres travelled to the lab to steal some crates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Ghost neared the Kessel Bunker, Hera Syndulla navigated around the debris. When Hera went to go prepare the frozen cargo, she asked the C-series astromech droid Chopper to take over navigation. After Chopper succesfully navigated through the debris, he dropped down from the Ghost to the Kessel Bunker. Chopper grabbed a crate, and flew back up to the ship. However, the crate was damaged and began to leak mutant bacteria. Chopper sealed the crate with a welding torch before the bacteria became harmful to any of the crew members. Soon after, the Ghost was spotted by Imperial forces. While Hera fixed the Ghost's radar array, Chopper was once again ordered to steer the Ghost. Then,  Chopper helped fellow crew member Garazeb Orrelios shoot down the remaining TIE fighters. The engagement however, caused the cargo hold to break, and Chopper was tasked with keeping the freezing crate in."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The freezing crate was then brought to one of Kanan Jarrus' contacts on the planet Felucia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
