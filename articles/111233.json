During the Battle of Anx Minor in 17 ABY, the EX-F, known at this time as the Rakehell, was destroyed when her antimatter containment was breached, wiping out several other Star Destroyers in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
