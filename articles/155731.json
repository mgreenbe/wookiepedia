They had a tribal civilization, inhabiting caves in the high peaks of their world, and believed that it was not natural for intelligent beings to fight one another. During the Galactic Civil War, they encountered a group of spacers who had stumbled across their planet. While getting to know the new arrivals, an ice and snow storm hit. The avians took shelter, but one of their young was injured in the storm. The spacers assisted the youngster and saved him from certain death. In gratitude, the avians gave the spacers sacks of hezar stones worth thousands of credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
