After the first set of negotiations C9 accompanied Skywalker's padawan, Ahsoka Tano, during her walk through the city and answered her questions about the planet's native fauna. After Ahsoka became interested in a warehouse guarded by armed men, she decided to investigate it. Once she left C9 to get a better look on the warehouse, the droid decided to simply ask the guards about its contents. He approached a man named Rynert and asked him the question directly. Little did the droid know that Rynert was in league with the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the warehouse contained multiple stocked B1-Series battle droids. Rynert destroyed the droid, but not before he learned from him the whereabouts of Ahsoka Tano, whom he and the other guards proceeded to attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
