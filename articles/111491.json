After the former stormtrooper Corlac and his comrade Terex relocated to Kaddak, Corlac re-established contacts with Wenda and Bett. He convinced Terex to help the gang gain access to the Rothana Imperial Shipyards.

Despite Dameron being stunned, C-3PO activated the Resistance spy droid network and forced the gangsters to surrender the BX-series droid commando N1-ZX, who was purportedly carrying a trove of information on the First Order. Terex then placed a bounty on Dameron's head but deliberately allowed Dameron and the droids to escape with N1-ZX and the data.
