In a quest for revenge in a personal feud against the Jedi Order, Najus desired an item that would interact with the dark side of the Force, increasing the power of the darksider wielding it. This led him to create the elaborately-adorned Bracers of Najus, which increased the wielder's dark side power whenever such power was used against an adherent of the light side; however, if the target of an attack resorted to the dark side of the Force, the Bracers would benefit the target rather than the wielder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bracers of Najus were lost when a Sith starship crash-landed on the planet Leritor. The Sith crew survived the accident and attempted to rule the native Sauvax species. The Sith, however, did not thrive on Leritor, while the Bracers were lost in the remains of the ship, partially buried in the local mountain range known as the Bleaks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Centuries later, a Human dark side adept and scholar, Profex Rynalla, discovered a trail to the Bracers leading her to Leritor. She secretly traveled there with an entourage of Klatooinians to recover the Sith treasure. On Leritor, Rynalla kidnapped and enslaved several Sauvax and Human settlers to perform the mining. She found the Bracers, but was defeated soon afterward by some people who were investigating the disappearance of her slaves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
