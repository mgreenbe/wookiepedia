Seizing the opportunity, the RA-7 attacked the two droids. The RA-7 immobilized R2-D2 with an ion blaster and threatened C-3PO to remove his memory banks with a vibroblade. Realizing that the Galactic Empire could learn the locations of Luke and Leia, C-3PO willingly wiped his own memory, taking the RA-7 along with him.

The RA-7 could wield a ion blaster and a vibroblade, but was caught by surprise when C-3PO grabbed him and wiped both of their memories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This RA-7 protocol droid first appeared in Memory Loss, a comic written by Christopher Cooper and illustrated by Andres Ponce, which was published in 2014 in Star Wars Comic 13."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
