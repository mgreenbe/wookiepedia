These changes would stay as long as the Force-sensitive kept the power up, but would be dropped whenever the Force-user fell unconscious or simply lost concentration. However, other Force-sensitives skilled in receptive telepathy had a chance to see through this disguise which resulted in a contest of skills between the two Force-users. The power became more difficult to use the less the Force-user knew about the person being imitated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
