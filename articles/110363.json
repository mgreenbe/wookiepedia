It was small enough to be carried in a backpack, and it was designed to self-protect itself, avoiding dangers while it performed scout duties. It lacked a vocabulator and, while it could analyze the environment, it was not intelligent enough to obtain conclusions or to know what it was that it had seen. As such, REM-02 only sent the results of its survey to an enviro-analyzer. Deeve, of the Bureau of Scouting and Exploration Services, carried REM-02 in his backpack to complement the resource remote scan he did on planets with the rest of his gear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
