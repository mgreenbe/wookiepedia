Circa 1 ABY, Kazic Pendre stole Durron's design notes and her schematic for the benefit of his own company. Kazic Durron later hired a spacer to recover her power cell schematic from Pendre. The spacer thus entered the Pendretronics headquarters and sliced Kazic Pendre's data terminal, successfully recovering the data."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the same time, the Corellian Security Force started an investigation against the Chirq Council following the increase of ryll traffic on Corellia.
