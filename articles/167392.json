In 34 ABY, the pirate-turned-spy and scavenger Synara San was scavenging on the planet Castilon's ocean when she pulled up wreckage from a Z-95 Headhunter and presented it to Team Fireball, a group of mechanics based on the planet's supertanker fuel depot Colossus. The mechanic Neeku Vozo believed the wreckage may have originated from a Z-96, but fellow team member Kazuda Xiono recognized it as a Z-95 due to the ship bearing the markings of Reaper Squadron. Xiono then further stated that the Z-96 was never used in the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Z-96 was first mentioned in the Star Wars Resistance episode \"Bibo,\" which aired on January 13, 2019.
