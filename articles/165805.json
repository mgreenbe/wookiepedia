Xil was the son of King Xer of the Kingdom of Argai, and the brother of Xic, Xim, Xom and Xuc. According to the play The Pirate Prince, which was made by the Lisst'n dramatist Lyechusas, the existence of Xil, Xic, Xom and Xuc was kept secret from Xim. When Xer eventually introduced Xim to his brothers while on Argai, Xim killed Xil, Xic, Xom and Xuc, so that he wouldn't have to share Xer's wealth with them. Xer was overcome with grief, so Xim killed his father as well and then made himself the new king."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
