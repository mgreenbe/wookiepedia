Using massive ship-mounted robotic arms and onboard tractor beams, the Spinward could latch on to a damaged starship and immediately begin repairs. The ship carried zero-g repair crews equipped with EVA suits or repair pods, various types of astromech droids or repair droids, and standard technicians. Each Spinward carried numerous repair materials, including spare parts and hull plating. While not as effective as a shipyard or spacedock, the Spinward was critical for organizations that lack the necessary infrastructure, like the Galactic Alliance Remnant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Spinward-class tenders were stationed at the Black Redoubt, a secret deep space repair and maintenance facility operated by the Galactic Alliance Remnant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
