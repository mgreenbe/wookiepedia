When the Clone Wars broke out, the Zabrak Jedi took up a role as a Jedi General in command of the clone soldiers that made up the Grand Army of the Republic. While leading clone troops in battle on a desert world in 19 BBY, the Jedi General's LAAT/i gunship came under enemy fire. During the attack, a clone trooper was struck and fell from the gunship's open crew bay; the Zabrak General made no move to rescue the wounded trooper, who was abandoned for dead after the battle and left to fend for himself in the desert expanse. Because of the General's inaction, the clone soldier developed a hatred for the Jedi he had once served which remained for years after."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The unnamed Zabrak Jedi General first appeared in Star Wars in the first issue of the comic book series Star Wars: Darth Vader and the Cry of Shadows, authored by Tim Siedell and published December 18, 2012."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
