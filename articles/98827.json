Karen says \"I mentioned a test that the German SS (or it might have been the Gestapo) used: trainees were each given a puppy\u2014a German Sheperd, I think\u2014and were encouraged to bond with the dog, compete it against other cadets' dogs, and generally love it. Then, once they were totally devoted to the dog, they were told to strangle it. If they couldn't obey that order, they were out. I said that would be a typical Sith test\u2014to be so loyal to the Sith ideal that you'd obey orders and kill someone you loved to prove you could put the job first. There's even an allusion to that in Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice, where Jacen thinks about the nosito[Sic] pups.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
