Eventually, the Galactic Republic was able to drive the Mandalorians from the world and the Jedi Order established the Culu Memorial Center on the world in order to train the Force-sensitive inhabitants. It was presumably named after Shoaneb Culu, a Miraluka Jedi killed during the Great Sith War, who had wanted to build a Jedi Academy on her homeworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several Jedi of this era came from Alpheridies, including Jedi Masters Q'Anilia and Noab Hulis. Despite the Jedi presence however, the world fell into territory held by the Sith Empire during the Jedi Civil War and remained within contested space until the defeat of the Sith during the New Sith Wars. Following the Ruusan Reformation, the academy was renowned for its deep studies of the Force, and held promise for those who hoped to follow the path of the Jedi Seer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Darth Sidious's notes in his stolen copy of The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, the Alpheridies academy was one of many that he had destroyed during the Great Jedi Purge.
