Bank fences were built into an existing natural formation that had either an ascending or descending slope, or sometimes even both. Individual Bank fences had an additional obstacle added to it, forcing the riders to either accelerate or decelerate as they approached. Specific types of Bank fences included the Grand Moff Bank, the Gravity Well, the Pop'N'Drop and the Suicide Peak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
