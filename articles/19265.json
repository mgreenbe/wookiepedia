The Ascendant who used this spell could boost the range and effectiveness of one of their normal senses such as sight or smell. The limitation of the spell was that the caster could not detect anything beyond their usual capabilities; Humans could not detect ultrasonic frequencies since it was beyond their normal ranging of hearing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
