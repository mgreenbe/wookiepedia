He was born on the planet Kamino to fight for the Galactic Republic. During the Clone Wars, the commander served in the Republic's Green Company. Around 21 BBY, Geonosian forces invaded the planet Rishi. They took control of the exonium mines on the planet, since they needed to obtain exonium minerals for their sonic weaponry. The clone commander and his unit were dispatched to protect the native Rishii and were ordered not to attack until a Jedi General arrived. However, Rishii Chieftain Gwarrk took command and led the clone troopers in an attack on the exonium mines because his people needed the minerals to prepare their food in frost times."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the well-prepared defense of the Geonosians, the attack was unsuccessful, and Jedi Master Kit Fisto ordered a retreat when he arrived on Rishi. Fisto informed the chieftain that the troops were only there for the Rishii's protection from the Confederacy and stated that no attack should have been made before his arrival. The clone commander informed Fisto that the Geonosians had prepared a well-entrenched defense, but Gwarrk insisted on another attack. Fisto, however, formulated another plan and asked the commander for the company's best sniper, and the commander directed him to trooper 2242, nicknamed \"Cooker.\" Soon, Fisto went to the entrance of the mines without informing the commander or Gwarrk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Gwarrk asked the clone commander where the Jedi was, the commander told him that Fisto had apparently begun an attack, as he was seeing the Jedi through his electrobinoculars.

When the clone commander saw Fisto fighting, he rallied his troops and departed in Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunships to assist the Jedi General. By this time, however, the Geonosians had suffered heavy casualties as a result of Fisto and Cooker's combined efforts. The Republic forces\u2014along with some of the Rishii warriors\u2014then arrived and attacked the mines, forcing the remaining Geonosians stationed there to flee.
