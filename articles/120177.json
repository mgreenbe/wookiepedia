The engineer Redy ordered Naboo sardine fritters with lava sauce alongside a triple shot with extra bubbles and a heap of blue milk powder while in the Dande Donjon bar on Xu'hu. The Moncaladrome opera house on the planet Mon Cala served Mon Cala Sardine Fritters as canap\u00e9s during intermissions and during a performance of the Faluvian cycle, the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs was served one.
