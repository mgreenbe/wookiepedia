The yacht only required a small crew and Padm\u00e9 could pilot the ship on her own from the cockpit in the central area of the yacht's upper section. Below the cockpit were maintenance consoles, the Class 0.9 Nubian 150 hyperdrive core and stores to contain supplies and astromech droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lower and upper levels were connected by a turbolift platform, situated before the lounge and crew bunks on the upper level. At the front section of the lower level was Padm\u00e9's bedroom which could serve as a portable throne room. The ship featured a powerful shield system, an array of electronic countermeasures, a slim, narrow profile and sheltered engines giving a small sensor signature for evading pursuits. It also featured a breakaway escape pod."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though originally constructed for the Royal House, the yacht was not assigned to a member of Naboo's royalty.

Skywalker was compelled to leave Naboo to return to his home planet of Tatooine, and Padm\u00e9 joined him, both traveling in a Naboo Yacht. Following his mother's death and his retaliation against the Sand People, R2-D2 received a distress signal from Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidala and Skywalker traveled in the yacht to Geonosis in a failed attempt to rescue Kenobi.

Captain Gregar Typho, Yoda, and the Senator journeyed there to rescue two Jedi from the crystal temple and prevent a Confederacy conspiracy at the Ambush on Ilum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After going to see Ziro the Hutt to try to reopen communication with Jabba the Hutt, Amidala was captured by Ziro to sell to Viceroy Nute Gunray. Amidala tricked a battle droid into answering a call on her comlink from C-3PO. She informed C-3PO of her capture and told him to get help. C-3PO arrived at Ziro's Palace in the Royal Yacht with members of the Coruscant Guard to free the senator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several of Senator Amidala's H-type yachts suffered misfortunes. After being led into a trap near the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center by Darth Sidious, the Senator and the yacht she was traveling in were captured by the Malevolence.

The ship exploded, although Grievous escaped unscathed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The senator used another H-type yacht to travel to Rodia to assist in a food crisis on the planet.
