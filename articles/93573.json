It would typically consist of simple attacks lashing out at grounded enemy units. Such attacks were normally low lunges with the lightsaber of a diagonal semi-circular nature, as the Jedi and Sith \u2014being on a mount\u2014would naturally be elevated in relation to the target. Thus there were some common features between mounted lightsaber combat and the airborne Trispzest lightsaber combat system, the difference being that in mounted lightsaber combat, the Jedi had much less freedom of movement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi could also use the lightsaber to incapacitate other mounted units, by lashing out at either the mount, which was efficient especially if the enemy unit was riding a swoop bike, or the rider himself. Finally, the Jedi could use the lightsaber to deflect blaster shots and the like, thus protecting himself or herself while riding the mount."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Applications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tott Doneeta and Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma ignited their lightsabers while charging on bomas into Oron Kira's citadel, but never got to use them upon finding out that that Princess Galia was marrying Kira willingly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Bane, while riding a drexl from Dxun to Onderon, encountered a band of Beast Riders from the Skelda clan.
