Willingly submitting to a procedure that rendered him more mechanical than organic, he became a living weapon, granting him lightning-quick reflexes and devastating strength. Although he was neither Jedi or Sith, nor even sensitive to the power of the Force, Grievous was a skilled lightsaber duelist, having trained in the art of the lightsaber under the fallen Jedi Master-turned-Sith Lord Count Dooku. Known for his hatred of the Jedi Order, Grievous killed Jedi over the course of the war, and would claim their lightsabers both as trophies and weapons to be used against other opponents, be they Jedi or clone troopers. The cyborg, nicknamed the \"head clanker\" by the Republic clones due to his cybernetics and role as Confederate Supreme Commander, became one of the Republic's priority targets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to his combat skills, Grievous was a brilliant military strategist who oversaw multiple campaigns throughout the Clone Wars\u2014from the Battle of Kamino, where he failed to halt the production line of clone troopers; to the Battle of Dathomir, where his battle droids massacred the Nightsisters led by the witch Mother Talzin. In 19 BBY, Grievous launched a daring raid on Coruscant, the Republic capital world, resulting in the abduction of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. However, the Jedi succeeded in rescuing the Chancellor while driving back the Separatist invaders. Following the loss of Dooku, Grievous and his army went into hiding in the Outer Rim Territories. Unknown to Grievous, his master, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, betrayed the general's location to the Jedi Order, allowing them to invade the planet Utapau in an effort to bring a swift and decisive conclusion to the war. As a result, Grievous was ultimately slain by his nemesis, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose 212th Attack Battalion went on to secure Utapau even as Order 66 went into effect, marking the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The son of his mother and father, Grievous, then known as Qymaen jai Sheelal, was a male Kaleesh from the planet Kalee. Since his childhood, he worshiped the warlords of Kalee, watching them return home with spoils of war from conquered peoples. In time, he, experiencing a rapid rise to the rank, became a feared warlord and warrior. Grievous learned battle tactics and warfare during the Kalee's war against the Yam'rii of Huk, and eventually developed a personal vendetta against the Galactic Republic, as the government had supported the Yam'rii. After becoming a warlord, the Kaleesh warrior embarked on conquests throughout space, but he came to realize the protectors of the Republic, the Jedi Order, were nearly undefeatable in duels, holding supernatural abilities through the energy field known as the Force. He developed a hate towards the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grievous chose to become a cyborg, receiving his enhancements over time, after the Sith, the ancient enemies of the Jedi, offered them to him, as they had been researching into cybernetically enhanced individuals.

Following a gruesome shuttle crash that almost killed him and destroyed most of his original body, he was nearly entirely rebuilt with cybernetics. With his living Kaleesh flesh traded for cyborg implants, Grievous claimed that his changes were improvements. As recounted in one legend, when Grievous's transformation was occurring over time, he initially only made simple enhancements before moving onto more extreme changes. The legend said Grievous transformed himself because he admired the logic of droids and wanted to mirror their infallibility, strength, and power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Grievous claimed his old form was no more than weak flesh, Grievous had several reminders of his past life. As a cyborg, Grievous wore a Kaleesh cloak, which was a vestige of his past identity, as well as a fearsome mask that was often worn by Kaleesh warriors. By the time he owned his fortress on Vassek 3, Grievous had several statues that depicted his progression from his organic life into that of a cyborg. After Grievous's reconstruction, all that remained of his original body were his brain, eyes, several vital organs, spinal cord,[source?] and a small amount of red Kaleesh flesh that could still be seen around his eyes and extended upward somewhat beneath the forehead of his faceplate. Grievous's armor and synthskin gut-sack protected his remaining vital organs, but his organic lungs were irritated by their implants.

While it was entirely by accident, the now-cyborg Grievous's first clash against members of the Jedi Order came during the battle. He was in the Geonosian Stalgasin hive's catacombs when the battle began, and the cyborg fought a number of Jedi during his retreat. Grievous left none of the Force-sensitives he encountered alive, meaning his involvement in the war's opening battle was not discovered until much later. The war proceeded to spread throughout the galaxy, so Grievous and his forces engaged the Grand Army of the Republic, and, under his command, the Separatist Droid Army attacked Republic planets. As the Separatist Army's leader, Grievous would cause fear throughout the Republic, although the Confederate populace were not told the stories of the General's onslaughts.

Grievous admitted that he would have liked to do so himself, but could not as he had the entire Separatist Droid Army to command. AD-W4 was skeptical, but after seeing the payment left to fulfill its job. AD-W4 served as commander of the droid forces on the planet, and battled with Jedi Master Mace Windu and his Jedi squadron. Grievous later checked in via hologram to see the progress of AD-W4, and the droid claimed to have killed Windu, however Grievous demanded the Jedi's lightsaber as evidence. Ultimately, the droid was defeated and Hissrich was lost to the Republic. Around the time of the Battle of Christophsis, Grievous had already spread Republic forces thin.

Jedi Anakin Skywalker considered him a monster that needed to be stopped, but Skywalker and Grievous would not meet face-to-face until the war had nearly reached its conclusion. However, Grievous did encounter the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the two fought each other numerous times throughout the war. During the war, Grievous and Jedi Knight Pablo-Jill had a duel over the world of Duro in a collapsing satellite city. Jill was ultimately left injured and lost his lightsaber to Grievous.

From the Malevolence's bridge, Grievous could command millions of battle droids, and he used his new warship in the Malevolence campaign, where he executed attacks on Republic fleets that left no survivors. While stationed in the Abregado system with Count Dooku aboard, a Republic fleet led by Jedi Master Plo Koon and Clone Commander \"Wolffe\" aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Triumphant arrived in the system to engage the warship. The mega-ion cannons of the Malevolence disabled the Republic fleet's deflector shields, and fired on the defenseless ships, leading to the destruction of the entire fleet, although a few individuals managed to survive by launching away from the vessels inside escape pods, but Dooku ordered a pod hunter to go out and destroy the pods, which held signs of living witnesses of the Malevolence. Plo Koon, Commander Wolffe, and the two clone troopers sergeant Sinker and Boost, were the only survivors.

After Senator Amidala's ship was captured, the Republic fleet stopped firing, and a team was sent to board the Malevolence led by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Grievous fought Obi-Wan Kenobi briefly and overpowered him, but the two Jedi managed to escape with Padm\u00e9 and C-3PO. Grievous pursued the Twilight in his personal starfighter, the Soulless One, but Skywalker had sabotaged the navigation system of the Malevolence so that when the ship engaged its hyperdrive, it crashed directly into the nearby Dead Moon of Antar.

These two Clone Officers soon discovered the outpost had been taken. They then met with the survivors and retook the station from the commando droids. When communication with the droids was abruptly cut off, Grievous sent a battalion of droids to inspect the station. He was then informed that there were clones in the station. One of the clone troopers, \"Hevy,\" sacrificed himself to destroy the base, which angered Grievous as he believed that the droids had blown it up instead.
