However, in a surprising move, the Separatists attacked the remote world of Rhen Var. As the Jedi soon discovered, it was the first step in a Confederacy plot to assemble the Dark Reaper, an ancient Sith weapon of mass annihilation that absorbed its power from the life energies of the beings it killed. In an attempt to foil Count Dooku's scheme, Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker led their forces on the scattered battlefronts of Rhen Var, Raxus Prime, Alaris Prime, and Thule. They succeeded, but, as Yoda pointed out, the war was far from over."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Battles"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
