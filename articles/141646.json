At some point during the conflict, Vought and the Twi'lek bounty hunter Caranna met with a droid, who sought to hire the pair to attack a star liner. Caranna was impressed by the way Vought negotiated with the droid, but she suspected that he planned to betray her, so she used a drug patch to incapacitate Vought. She then offered to complete the droid's job by herself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
