Were it not for the fact that some moisture farmers found the town appealing, Wayfar would have been nothing more than an abandoned settlement. It was also not uncommon to see hermits visit the town occasionally for much needed supplies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Kaimer was the mayor of Wayfar. At about the same time the hunt for Adar Tallon was underway on Tatooine, Wayfar was the site of a battle between local farmers and Tusken Raiders who wished to claim the town's water supplies for their own; the Tuskens were defeated with the aid of a Jawa sandcrawler. Following the Battle of Yavin, Porgryn of the Azure Cabal operated out of this town. Around this time, Wayfar chose to host a Life Day celebration. During the celebration, a very rare snow blizzard covered the town in snow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, Wayfar is one of many cities on Tatooine. When the game was first released, the town lacked a shuttleport. This forced players to walk or drive to Wayfar from another city. However, the developers eventually added a shuttleport to the town to make transportation to Wayfar more convenient."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Life Day live event from December 16, 2008 to January 12, 2009, players could visit Wayfar for a variety of Life Day activities. For the event, Wayfar had a blizzard which covered the town in snow. It is unclear how this could be viewed from an in-universe perspective. It can be presumed that the town used some sort of snow machine, or it was a very rare weather phenomena."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
