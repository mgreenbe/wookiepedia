During that time, a member of the species attained the post of senator in the Galactic Senate. During the Senator's tenure, his son, Eero Iridian, became a senatorial aide with the goal of following in his father's footsteps. Around 90 BBY, Iridian presented a paper on the political history of the Corellian system but was publicly corrected by the Jedi Initiate Dooku. The pair became friends, trading favors during their careers. The Senator eventually retired from politics, having depleted his family's wealth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iridian twice ran unsuccessfully for election as his homeworld's senator but became stymied by a lack of funds. He dropped out of public life, eventually taking a position as aide for Blix Annon, an important senator with strong support within the Jedi Order. Frustrated at his lackluster career, Iridian collaborated with the pirate Lorian Nod, arranging the kidnappings of numerous senators. The funds from the ransoms were to be used to fund another election campaign. Iridian ultimately arranged for the capture of Annon, and a successful kidnapping attempt was made while Iridian accompanied the Senator on a cruise to Annon's homeworld. Iridian feigned injury to his Jedi escorts\u2014Dooku and his Padawan apprentice, Qui-Gon Jinn. He later set them up on the planet Von-Alai, leading to their capture by Nod. The kidnapping attempt went awry when Annon died of a heart attack. Iridian panicked, providing an opportunity for Dooku to turn the tables on Nod. Iridian was eventually handed over to the Coruscant Security Force to stand trial for murder and conspiracy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eero Iridian's species was created by Jude Watson, author of the novel Legacy of the Jedi, which was published in 2003.
