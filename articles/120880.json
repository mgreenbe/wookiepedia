Originally a separate entity under COMPNOR, Science ended up under the Coalition for Progress after a reshuffle. Science groups reported on the scientific activity within their assigned sectors, and also actively encouraged and coordinated research and development with an eye towards enhancing scientific endeavors in support of the New Order. Much of Science's personnel were themselves scientists of good conscience who had resisted efforts by COMPNOR to concentrate on products with military applications. The Imperial Security Bureau watched Science closely, but reprisals for scientists who refused to work on research for military projects were rare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
