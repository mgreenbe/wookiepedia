The plates were magnetically encoded with the wearer's rank and security clearance which allowed them access to restricted areas via security door scanners. If personnel without proper clearance attempted to pass through a security door, access was denied and, in some cases, an alarm was sounded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
