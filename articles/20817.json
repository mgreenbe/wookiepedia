The Broken Columns Clan was the only clan of men that did not attack the Raining Leaves Clan, a tribe of Dathomiri witches, shortly after the massacre that befell the Raining Leaves Clan. The two clans formed a new custom in which they convened every year near Redgill Lake, then formed marriages that lasted a year. The male children would be handed over to their fathers while the female children would be kept in the Raining Leaves Clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 43.5 ABY, during the year's annual conclave, Dest married Kaminne Sihn, the leader of the Raining Leaves Clan.
