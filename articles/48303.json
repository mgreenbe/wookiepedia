He eventually became the lead bartender and main enforcer of Rik's Cantina, a bar in the underworld of the galactic capital Coruscant operated by the Hutt Queen Jool. He defended Rik's Cantina from troublemakers using subtle and efficient methods, such as placing tranquilizers in a drink and offering it to a disruptive patron. During this period, he became familiar with the bounty hunter Cade Skywalker, who frequented the cantina with his friends Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 137 ABY, during the Second Imperial Civil War, Finn was working in Rik's Cantina when Skywalker came to the bar in order to visit Jool. Skywalker asked the Sakiyan to pour him both a Corellian whiskey and an ale, and Finn was informed by the Hutt that the cantina would cover the cost of the drinks. Finn gave the drinks to Skywalker and continued managing the bar as Skywalker and Jool conversed with each other."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sakiyan male Finn was a jaded and distant individual, and was unsurprised by any actions performed in Rik's Cantina. However, his demeanor belied his abilities both in unarmed combat and with a blaster. When in a difficult situation, Finn remained calm and would maintain his composure. Finn owned a heavy blaster pistol, a comlink, and tranquilizer drops that he placed in unruly patrons' drinks. He did not question Queen Jool when she told him that the cantina would cover the cost of Cade Skywalker's drinks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finn was created by John Ostrander, the writer of the Star Wars: Legacy comic series.
