Circa 1 ABY, Ji'Ni Sil was approached by a spacer who was looking for a body casing from a R2 unit that once belonged to Peggin Dulin and was later salvaged by Jawas. The droid was actually wanted by both Imperial Commander Barrezz and Rebel Captain Bastra. Ji'Ni Sil informed the spacer that the droid casing was already sold to a robonium miner.
