This set also introduced Ewoks, speeder bikes, and Scout Troopers to game play. Some of the notable cards included Daughter of Skywalker, Wicket, and Wokling."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This set was sold in 9-card expansion packs and 30-pack expansion boxes. Each pack included one rare card, three uncommon cards, and five common cards. Starter decks were never produced for this set. This set was unique in that it included an 18-card foil subset, consisting of 8 common foils, 6 uncommon foils, and 4 rare foils. Foil sets were difficult to complete, as the foils were scarce. Common foils averaged about three per box, uncommon about one in every two boxes, and rare foils only one in every three boxes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Card list"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dark Side"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Light Side"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
