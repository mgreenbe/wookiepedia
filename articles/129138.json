On the ends of each pylon were heavy capital ship turrets, with smaller anti-starfighter laser cannons located along the length of the defense pylons. A droid starfighter hangar bay was located towards the top of the station, though larger starships were accommodated with docking tubes on the outer pylons. On the flat surfaces of the pylons were also a pair of airlock doors, which connected to the inner corridors of the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pirate chief Nym and his Revenant forces staged an assault against Station 1138 to save Captain Orsai and his men.
