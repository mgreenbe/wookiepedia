Essentially a weapons platform, the M102 consisted of a slow moving heavily armored repulsorlift chassis, a large bore artillery cannon, and a Tana Ire GroundSweeper-3 sensor dome (for accuracy at short ranges), the M102 was capable of firing a projectile over great distances - including against targets far out of its line of sight - up to a distance of 20 kilometers. Operated by a crew of 4, the M102 had a twenty shell capacity, with each shell consisting of a fragmenting shell capable of producing a twenty meter blast. While powerful, the fragmenting nature of these shells meant they weren't very durable; because of this, precision laser fire - with great difficulty - is capable of shooting down shells in transit to their target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
