They were generally united in common cause, against a common enemy in the form of the Galactic Empire. In order to achieve their primary goal in restoring the former Galactic Republic, the Alliance aimed to remove Emperor Palpatine from power, and his hegemonic New Order from the galaxy. Members of the Rebellion were known as \"Rebels,\" \"Rebs,\" or \"Rebel scum\" by stormtroopers and other Imperials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The origins of the overall anti-Imperial movement dated back to 19 BBY, shortly before the Galactic Republic's transformation into the Empire. Some of the Alliance's core founders, such as senators Bail Prestor Organa and Mon Mothma of the Loyalist Committee, joined the Delegation of 2000 in its opposition against the authoritarian leadership of then-Chancellor Palpatine. In 18 BBY, barely a year into the Empire's existence, military resistance had already been formed in opposition to the new regime; one of which was a group of insurgents known as The Eleven, joined by the fugitive Jedi Ferus Olin. By 2 BBY, several resistance groups were unified into a single rebellion, thus creating the Rebel Alliance. Ironically, the Rebel Alliance's formation was secretly instigated by the Order of the Sith Lords. In what was supposed to be a plot for drawing the Emperor's enemies out from hiding, the Sith Lord Darth Vader ordered his secret apprentice, Starkiller, to organize various rebels and dissidents into a large resistance movement. After Starkiller was betrayed by his Master, however, the former apprentice sacrificed himself to ensure the survival of the Rebel leaders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hence, the Galactic Civil War erupted with the fledgling Alliance challenging the Empire for control of the galaxy. Rather than challenging the Empire directly, the rebels fought a war of attrition, destroying key Imperial targets and liberating numerous worlds. Though vastly outnumbered in manpower, starships, weapons and various other resources, the Rebels themselves possessed a strong will to fight. By and large, the Alliance was composed of well-trained soldiers and brilliant commanders, some of whom dedicated their lives to the Rebellion after defecting from the Empire due to the atrocities that were committed by the Imperial regime. After securing early victories against the Empire on Kamino and Toprawa, the Rebels achieved one of their most significant triumphs at the Battle of Yavin, in which a Rebel pilot named Luke Skywalker destroyed the Imperial battlestation code-named Death Star. In 4 ABY, roughly four years after the destruction of the first Death Star, Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader both perished during the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of their victory at Endor, the Rebel Alliance reorganized itself into a more formal state that was originally known as the Alliance of Free Planets before its reorganization into the New Republic. Ultimately, the New Republic was later remade into the Galactic Alliance, a democratic union that united much of the galaxy under a republican form of government, just as the Old Republic had done in its time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early foundations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebellion against the Galactic Empire began as a peaceful movement by a political minority, known as the Delegation of 2000, within the Galactic Senate. Certain senators, such as Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo, Bail Organa of Alderaan and Mon Mothma of Chandrila grew increasingly concerned over the constitutional amendments that weakened the legislature and empowered the executive branch with near dictatorial authority. Although a majority of the Senate supported such alterations to the government's overall structure because of the Separatist Crisis and subsequent Clone Wars, both of which threatened to divide the galaxy in half between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist insurrection, the members of the Delegation of 2000 felt that the amendments were too radical, unconstitutional, and generally detrimental to the future of the Republic. Despite the fact that the Separatists were on the verge of defeat in 19 BBY, the final year of the Clone Wars, most senators continued to invest even greater authority within Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Fearing that the Republic would inevitably drift into an authoritarian regime, the Delegation of 2000 formally presented their concerns to the Chancellor with the request for the relinquishing of his emergency powers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to the Delegation of 2000, however, Chancellor Palpatine was secretly a Sith Lord named Darth Sidious. For a thousand years, the Order of the Sith Lords waited and plotted for the time when they would reassert their dominance over the galaxy, specifically by overthrowing the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order. As Palpatine, Sidious spent decades infiltrating the political hierarchy of the Republic. His election as chancellor, the creation of the Kamino clone army, the escalation of the Separatist movement and the outbreak of the Clone Wars were all factors in the Sith's plot to seize control of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three years of galactic warfare strengthened Chancellor Palpatine's position as a public figure. Public support for his leadership in the Clone Wars remained strong throughout the conflict; he was immensely popular with the Republic citizenry, and the Senate majority remained firmly committed to its leader in regard to his policy-making decisions. Yet the systematic suppression of thousands of years of Republic traditions and democratic ideals convinced Amidala, Organa, and a group of like-minded senators that the Republic was in danger of losing its core principles for the sake of security. The passing of the Sector Governance Decree all but made the Senate obsolete; entire sectors would be controlled by a cabal of military governors\u2014otherwise known as Moffs\u2014hand-picked by Chancellor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thus, the Delegation responded with a petition of two thousand signatures from members of the Senate who objected to the Moffs' virtual usurpation of the Senate's responsibilities. They also hoped that their collective opposition would force Chancellor Palpatine to restore the Republic to its pre-war state. The Delegation's cause to prevent further amendments to the Constitution was ultimately lost when Palpatine issued Order 66, a contingency directive that caused the Republic clone soldiers to betray and murder their Jedi officers. Palpatine then called for a special session of congress, in which he presented a fabricated recollection of a Jedi assassination attempt on his life. The invention of a \"Jedi rebellion\" presented Palpatine with the justification for his ultimate modification to the Republic; he declared himself Emperor of the first Galactic Empire. Amidala and Organa, two of the leading members in the Delegation of 2000, watched in abject shock as their colleagues cheered the end of democracy with thunderous applause."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the earliest orders of business for the Emperor's new regime was the targeting of the Delegation of 2000. Charged with sedition and high treason, many who had signed the petition in opposition to Palpatine's policies were imprisoned, executed or forced into exile. After the Empire conquered and razed the Wookiee home planet of Kashyyyk, many more members of the Delegation withdrew their support out of fear for their lives. However, Organa and Mothma were both able to avoid persecution for a time. Prior to Amidala's death, the Naboo senator advised her political allies to oppose the Emperor in secret while feigning obedience."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Armed resistance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Emperor Palpatine's strategy for the enforcement of the New Order was based on brutal tactics, such as the implementation of the fear of military force in order to discourage ideas of insurrection. The rise of the Galactic Empire was not supported by all member worlds. One of the first planets that attempted to resist Imperialization was the Emperor's own homeworld of Naboo, ruled by Queen Apailana at the time. Under Apailana's leadership, the Naboo continued to celebrate the memory of the Republic, rather than acknowledging the Empire's rule over the galaxy. The Queen also began considering military options that involved sheltering Jedi fugitives. Such actions were discovered and interpreted as signs of rebellion by Imperial Intelligence, and thus the Empire retaliated with the deployment of armed forces to Naboo. The 501st Legion, an elite division of clone stormtroopers under the command of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, assaulted the capital city of Theed in 18 BBY. Although the Queen's security detail was augmented by the Jedi, they were ultimately unable to repel the 501st. The city fell to the Imperials, its garrison was destroyed, and Apailana was assassinated during the battle. In the following years, the Empire repeatedly overthrew disloyal governments through force, often relying on Vader's 501st Legion for enforcing the Emperor's rule where ever it was opposed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the same year, a group of disillusioned civilians publicly protested against the Empire's despotic policies, including its high taxation of Ghorman. They staged their protest on the landing platform where Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's ship was set to arrive. Their attempt to block Tarkin's arrival did not succeed; in what became known as the Ghorman Massacre, the Governor simply landed his vessel on the platform, killing hundreds of activists in the process. This event was interpreted as a tragedy by outraged sympathizers who also disagreed with the direction of the Empire. Jan Dodonna and other career officers whose service records dated back to the Republic either resigned or retired from Imperial service. The incident also convinced Bail Organa that the Empire was a malevolent government. Yet with so many disorganized and uncoordinated rebel cells, Organa remained convinced that the time was not right for open rebellion. He continued to meet in secret with his closest political allies, senators Mon Mothma and Garm Bel Iblis of Corellia in the Cantham House on Coruscant in order to discuss options for creating their own rebellion against Palpatine. Mothma, however, was forced to flee into exile after being labeled a traitor to the Empire due to her outspoken criticism of the New Order. Iblis's failure to hide his own discontent with the Empire also drove him underground in order to escape persecution."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Further incidents of armed resistance against Imperial rule involved remnants of the fallen Separatist movement. Gizor Dellso, a Geonosian war criminal who survived the Clone Wars, fled into hiding on Mustafar. Utilizing an abandoned droid factory, Dellso constructed his own private army of battle droids for the sole purpose of reviving the Separatist cause. Before his plot could be carried out, the 501st Legion attacked Mustafar and destroyed his army; Dellso died during the fighting shortly before his factory was destroyed by Imperial Star Destroyers via orbital bombardment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another insurrectionist plot against the Galactic Empire was later discovered on Kamino, the world that was responsible for the creation of the Republic clone army. A rogue group of Kaminoan cloners resented the Empire's control of their homeworld. Throughout the first decade of the Empire, they secretly engineered and trained an army of rebel clone troopers, all of whom were programmed with absolute loyalty to Kamino. After Darth Vader uncovered the scheme, he dispatched the 501st\u2014under the leadership of the bounty hunter Boba Fett\u2014to the planet. The subsequent battle resulted in the destruction of the rogue clones and their creators, as well as the fall of Tipoca City and all of Kamino. The incident was classified and kept hidden from public records, but Palpatine decided that an army of clones from one genetic template was too susceptible to corruption. Hence, both the Imperial Army and Stormtrooper Corps were heavily diversified with the introduction of new clone soldiers who were based on a variety of different templates. The Empire later redirected the clone program to pursue other projects, and thus the military was compensated with an increase in the recruitment of birth-born Humans as enlisted troopers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Darth Vader's secret apprentice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years before the formation of the Rebel Alliance, Darth Vader discovered a young Human child named Galen Marek during an attack on Kashyyyk. Marek's father and mother, Kento and Mallie Marek, were both trained members of the Jedi Order. Thus, he possessed an incredibly powerful connection to the Force. Realizing the boy's potential was too great to discard, Vader abducted Marek and indoctrinated him into the ways of the Sith as a secret apprentice. As time passed, Marek developed into a highly efficient Sith assassin, known only to a select few by the codename Starkiller; his past and former identity were ultimately forgotten as he had been too young to remember what his life was like before falling under Vader's relentless tutelage. As his training neared completion, Starkiller was all but a true Sith. Under the Rule of Two, however, only two Sith Lords were allowed to exist. Starkiller's Master still answered to another Master, the Galactic Emperor. Ultimately, Vader assured Starkiller that they would eventually unite their powers to overthrow Palpatine in order to rule the galaxy as master and apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, Darth Vader commanded Starkiller to search the galaxy for various rebels and dissidents who opposed the Galactic Empire. He was then required to unite them into a single rebellion that would plunge the Empire into a state of civil war. Vader reasoned that an insurrection created the best opportunity to assassinate the Emperor, especially because his attention would be focused primarily on destroying the rebels. Hence, the apprentice embarked on his mission in earnest, and eventually brought Jedi Master Rahm Kota, the only known survivor from Marek's missions to exterminate any Jedi who survived Order 66, and Bail Organa into the fold after earning their trust. Through Organa, Starkiller also made contact with the fugitives Mon Mothma and Garm Bel Iblis. Organa's adopted daughter, Princess Leia Organa also pledged her support to the nascent rebellion while still serving as her father's successor in the Imperial Senate."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Birth of the Rebellion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Starkiller's fellow subversives were initially resistant to the notion of open rebellion. They felt that the galaxy had to be shown one way or another that the Empire was vulnerable. In accordance with Darth Vader's counsel, Starkiller destroyed an Imperial shipyard that orbited Raxus Prime. As a single Star Destroyer moved to intercept him, the apprentice used the Force to rip the massive vessel from the sky, causing it to crash on the surface below. The symbolic victory had the desired effect as Vader predicted. Starkiller and the senators rendezvoused on Corellia where they ceremoniously proclaimed the birth of the Rebellion, as well as their intentions to restore liberty to the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Starkiller had been betrayed by the Dark Lord of the Sith. The true purpose of his mission was to gather the Emperor's enemies in a single location so that Imperial troops could arrest them all at once. Darth Vader revealed the truth to his shocked apprentice: he never intended to overthrow the Emperor with Starkiller at his side. After leaving his former assassin for dead, Vader transported the Rebel leaders to the incomplete Death Star where Emperor Palpatine awaited their arrival. Yet Starkiller survived and ultimately renounced his Sith persona, thus resuming the use of his birth name \"Galen Marek,\" recovered from repressed memories of his past."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marek infiltrated the battlestation and single-handedly slew countless Imperial soldiers before defeating his former Master in a lightsaber duel. With Darth Vader severely damaged and at the apprentice's mercy, Emperor Palpatine urged Marek to assume the mantle of a true Sith Lord by killing Vader in cold blood. Though briefly tempted to pursue his lifelong goal once more, Marek chose to rescue the Rebel leaders by attacking the Emperor. The Rebels escaped with their lives, but Marek was forced to sacrifice his own in order to provide them with enough time to flee the Death Star in the Rogue Shadow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of Galen Marek's demise, the Rebel leaders reconvened on Kashyyyk where they held a meeting in their fallen leader's childhood home. The Alliance to Restore the Republic was officially realized.

With this advanced fighter, Rebel pilots had a clear advantage over the more numerous yet unshielded TIE fighters. With the help of Gial Ackbar, who had recently been freed by Rebel forces from slavery under the Empire, Mon Mothma then secured an alliance with the Mon Calamari, who openly joined the Rebel Alliance and used their renowned skill in ship construction to supply badly needed capital ships that could take on the Imperial Navy. Their considerable fleet of Mon Calamari Star Cruisers gave the newly formed Alliance substantial firepower. Part of the Alliance's strategy was the doctrine of space denial. That is, the Alliance would attack Imperial shipping in hit and run raids; both to disrupt Imperial supplies and operations, and to confiscate desperately needed materials. In these situations, their fighters had hyperdrive capability along prearranged routes which would allow this kind of harassment and escape before the Empire could react."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time, the Rebel Alliance annexed most of the remaining Separatist holdouts.

An operation headed by Princess Leia was successful in retrieving the schematics of the station, but Darth Vader discovered the act and captured Leia. In an effort to get the young princess to divulge the location of the secret Rebel base, Grand Moff Tarkin threatened to destroy her home planet of Alderaan. Yet even after Leia gave him the location of an abandoned Rebel base on Dantooine, Tarkin ordered the Death Star to fire its primary weapon\u2014a planet-destroying superlaser.

The duo, along with the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, secured passage on a freighter, Millennium Falcon. With the help of smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca, the group managed to free Princess Leia Organa from the Death Star (only after Obi-Wan sacrificed himself in a duel with Vader) and deliver the plans to the Alliance.

This was a blow to the Alliance, though it was offset by the joining of Borsk Fey'lya and his sizable faction of Bothans. Mon Mothma took steps to create a true navy for the Alliance, raising the Mon Calamari Gial Ackbar to the rank of Admiral and appointing him Supreme Commander of the Rebel Fleet. Under Ackbar's leadership the fleet grew in size and ability. Along with the headquarters of the Rebel Alliance, Ackbar's fleet was the most important asset of the Rebellion.

The Alliance was forced to scatter and remain mobile until the end of the war for fear of losing another main base. Therefore the High Command was transferred to the Rebel Fleet, using Ackbar's flagship Home One as their mobile base of operations. This was a dark time for the Alliance with the loss of men and equipment on Hoth as well as being forced into hiding from the Empire. Also, Rebel hero Han Solo was captured while in Lando Calrissian's hospitality on Cloud City, subsequently frozen in carbonite, and sent to Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.
