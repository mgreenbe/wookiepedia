They were essentially mines capable of moving equipped with sensors, repulsorlifts and sometimes with stealth field generators. When they detected a target, they floated into its proximity and exploded. G0-T0 employed a number of floating mines to guard his Droid Yacht. They were also encountered in the antechamber of the airlock from the fuel depot in the Peragus Mining Facility by the Jedi Exile. The HK-50 droid that watched the Exile during her journey to Peragus II also deployed floating mines when it confronted her. These particular mines were equipped with stealth field generators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
