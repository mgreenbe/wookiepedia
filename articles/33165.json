During a visit to the resort world of Maryo in the wake of his mother's death, Torm Dadeferron was approached by agents of the Authority's Security Police and agreed to spy on his family on their behalf in exchange for control of the Kail Ranges, which would have fallen to his brother, Trevim, in the event of the death of their father, Dixon. Shortly thereafter, Dixon, Trevim and several other relatives were kidnapped by the Authority and held in the Stars' End prison facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Torm continued to operate as an Authority spy and used the story of his kidnapped relatives to infiltrate the core leadership of a group dedicated to finding and rescuing political prisoners of the Authority.
