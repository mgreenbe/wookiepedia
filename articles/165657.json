During the tour, Palpatine was informed that two Dark Jedi members of his Dark Side Elite, Executor Sedriss, and Vill Goir, had been killed by Skywalker on the planet Ossus. To replace his fallen Dark Jedi, the Emperor empowered Xecr Nist and Tedryn-Sha with the dark side of the Force and named Nist his new Executor.

After Palpatine was killed in 10 ABY by the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and his sister Leia Organa Solo, he was reborn in one of his clone bodies stored in the Emperor's Citadel on the planet Byss. During this time, Nist served Palpatine as one of his personal advisors. Soon after the Emperor's return, Nist, along with his fellow darksider Tedryn-Sha and the Imperial engineer Umak Leth, accompanied Palpatine aboard a shuttle on an inspection tour of the newest Imperial superweapon, the Galaxy Gun, which was nearing completing in orbit of Byss. As their shuttle circled around the Galaxy Gun, Palpatine received word that Executor Sedriss and Vill Goir\u2014two members of the Dark Side Elite, a select cadre of the Emperor's Dark Jedi\u2014had been killed by Luke Skywalker on the planet Ossus. Fearing that, without his Dark Side warriors, Skywalker could triumph over him, Palpatine quickly turned his attention to Nist and Tedryn-Sha. Stating that they had made progress in submitting to his will, Palpatine imbued Nist and Tedryn-Sha with the dark side, granting them powers of the Dark Jedi and naming Xecr Nist the new Executor to replace the fallen Sedriss.

Unbeknownst to the Imperials, Beltane had made a deal with the New Republic and allowed them to load the droids with New Republic soldiers. Once the droids were delivered to Byss, the soldiers activated them and assaulted the Emperor's Citadel. The Emperor then commanded his adepts in the Citadel to unleash his chrysalide rancors, which decimated the Vipers, although the New Republic troops themselves managed to escape with the help of some local smugglers. Certain that his Galaxy Gun would crush the New Republic despite the enemies' escape, Palpatine told his forces not to waste firepower on the fleeing smuggler ships, much to the surprise of his newly-appointed Dark Jedi.

Soon, a New Republic pilot named Ntthan was captured by the Empire in an uncharted region of space and delivered to Bast Castle on the planet Vjun, where Dark Jedi Kvag Gthull started torturing him on Organa Solo's location. To oversee the results of Ntthan's interrogation, Nist accompanied Palpatine to Bast Castle aboard the Lambda-class shuttle Tridius, where he was awed by the statue of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader that had been erected by the late Sedriss. Noticing Nist's admiration of the statue, Palpatine ordered the Executor to remove it. The Emperor then proceeded to question Gthull on the progress of the interrogation, and the Dark Jedi informed Palpatine that Ntthan had revealed the coordinates and the name of the planet\u2014New Alderaan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having received this information, Palpatine ordered Nist to mobilize the members of the Dark Side Elite and depart for New Alderaan, where they were to capture Skywalker and all his Jedi, along with Organa Solo's children.

Boarding I-7 Howlrunner starships, the Dark Jedi squadron, known as of Dark Side Squadron, departed for New Alderaan. After landing on the planet, Nist dispatched Tedryn-Sha and Krdys Mordi to poison Skywalker with scarab droids and capture him, while he and the rest of the Dark Jedi went to kidnap the Solo twins. Sha and Mordi, however, failed to complete their mission and were killed by Organa Solo and one of Skywalker's Jedi, Jem Ysanna, although Jem herself was mortally wounded by Sha and soon died as well.

Although defeated, the Executor was quick to order Gthull, who had managed to capture the twins, to order the AT-ATs to attack. Gthull followed Nist's command and alerted the AT-ATs, but he was spotted by the Jedi and was killed by Organa Solo's blaster shot immediately thereafter.

During this time, Nist took possession of Bast Castle, which had once belonged to Sedriss, and prior to him, to Darth Vader himself. Disobeying Palpatine, Nist did not remove the statue of Vader, hoping that the Emperor would forget his order.

To this end, Palpatine dispatched Nist to Ossus, ordering the Executor to bring several members of the native Ysanna tribe, who were descended from Jedi, to Vjun. Landing on Ossus, Nist and his stormtroopers quickly secured three Ysanna shamans and proceeded to herd them into Imperial hunter starships. During the loading process, one of the shamans, Okko, tried to mind trick a stormtrooper into letting him go. Sensing Okko's usage of the Force, Nist punched the shaman, freeing the stormtrooper from the effects of the mind trick. Having captured the shamans, Nist's forces departed Ossus, but their departure was witnessed by Skywalker and his allies, who had just arrived there.

He then assembled all six Dark Jedi and prepared to confront the Jedi at the landing pad. Skywalker, however, used Solusar's robotic-controlled Howlrunner to ram the blast doors and engaged the Dark Jedi inside the castle, quickly killing two of them.

After killing the remaining darksider, the Jedi quickly subdued Nist and took him prisoner, demanding him to reveal the procedure for unfreezing the captive Ysanna shamans.

Contrary to his beliefs, Nist was defeated in a lightsaber duel twice, first by Solusar on New Alderaan and then by Skywalker on Vjun.

Nist was able to sense Okko using a mind trick on a stormtrooper and felt that Luke Skywalker was aboard one of the ships headed for Bast Castle. Although initially wary of Skywalker during the mission to New Alderaan, as his self-confidence grew, Nist came to consider himself to be exceptionally powerful and ultimately concluded that Skywalker was no match for him.
