He also would temporarily resign the position of Grand Master of the Jedi Order and would appoint Jedi Master Kenth Hamner as acting Grand Master. Skywalker would not be able to visit or approach any Jedi Temple, Jedi Order School, or any other Jedi Temple facility less than one-light year away from where he was. Skywalker could not establish any Jedi Order Temple, Jedi Order School, or any other Jedi Temple facility.

However, Skywalker decided to remain on Nam Chorios in order to defeat the dark side entity Abeloth and protect the galaxy. However, because his exile was repealed, he was able to fight alongside the Jedi during Operation Shieldfall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
