This essentially meant that each and every clan on the planet was at war with one another as all were after the same goal. The Jedi Council sent Mace Windu to settle the dispute before the Er'stacian people wiped themselves out. Seeing no way to settle the conflict, Mace Windu destroyed the statue\u2014shattering it into thousands of pieces.
