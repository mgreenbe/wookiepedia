The image was put out by the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order, or COMPNOR, and was released shortly after the end of the Clone Wars, which saw the transformation of the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire, the latter of which was in charge of COMPNOR. COMPNOR officials wished to reclaim the image of the Republic's clone troopers, who were now in service to the Empire, as a force for good and stability, prompting the creation of Report Sedition. The clone army would be retired early into the Empire's rule and replaced by the stormtroopers, who the Empire cast as more authoritative than their clone predecessors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Report Sedition showcases a disgruntled Imperial citizen on the capital world of Coruscant being taken away by two clone soldiers clad in Phase II armor, with the city and several airspeeders visible in the distance. In the forefront of the poster is the hand of a clone trooper shaking the hand of the Imperial citizen who reported the vandal. At the top, written in High Galactic with white and red lettering is \"REPORT SEDITION,\" and at the bottom of the poster, also in High Galactic, is \"IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING!\" next to the Imperial crest. At least two versions of this poster exist, however\u2014in the original version, the vandal has marked through the Imperial crest on the side of the building and tacked on a Republic crest below it. In the finalized version, the Republic crest was replaced with the Separatist hex icon after careful review by COMPNOR. Though the Separatist Alliance had been defeated during the Clone Wars, Imperial image-smiths wanted a more smooth transition from Republic to Empire after the war's end, prompting the removal of the Republic crest and the addition of the Separatist icon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
