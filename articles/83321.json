Because Quarren scientist Kimp Minmirn had not paid his docking fees, Peacekeeper Darial Anglethorn ordered Lorrb to place an impoundment transmitter in his starship. When Lieutenant Mils Giel later fled the planet after being caught mutating the planet's native Tirrith population into his personal assassination force, with Minmirn's assistance, he stole the Quarran's ship to make his escape. Lorrb had stored the transmitter's frequency in his droid and, as Giel was unaware of the tracking device, the Beheboth police force planned to use the device to follow the criminal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lorrb was briefly mentioned in part four of Beheboth: Blood and Water, Hit and Mist, a supplement to the Wizards of the Coast Star Wars roleplaying game.
