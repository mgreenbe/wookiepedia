During the space battle, Telsij flew a BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber alongside a mix of other starfighters in his squadron, such as A-wings and B-wings. The battle was a key victory for the Rebel Alliance, which resulted in the destruction of the battle station and the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader.
