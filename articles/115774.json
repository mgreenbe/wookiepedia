When they were based on Courkrus in 11 ABY, they tended to gather in a cantina called The Warren, which they shared with the Red Nova crew. Aside from the Khuiumin Survivors, they fared the best during Corran Horn's \"Ghost Jedi\" operation, losing far fewer members to desertion than other Invid gangs. Timmser was a former Raider."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
