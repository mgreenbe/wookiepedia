Sazz, not possessing a sense of humor, beat the crewmate to death with Grivooga and cooked the being's remains for a meal, consequently deterring future crewmates from making similar remarks about Sazz's relationship with the hydrospanner. Sazz later claimed that Grivooga had no qualms about being used in such a manner.
