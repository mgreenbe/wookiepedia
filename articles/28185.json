Kaa had the vehicles painted in the same color scheme as the Coca-Cola bottles, with the beverage's logo on the side. He also had two other vehicles painted in the green-and-yellow scheme of Sprite bottles and the gray-and-red scheme of Diet Coke bottles. These two vehicles were piloted by the R-series droids J4-KC and J5-KC, respectively, and were used to deliver the Coca-Cola beverages to the other vehicles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the same time, Coca-Cola bottles were served in Black Spire's market at Kat Saka's Kettle, while cups filled with the soda were available at Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo and Ronto Roasters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The soft drink Coca-Cola is one of the beverage items available in the theme park land Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, which opened to guests at Disneyland Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2019. The beverage's Star Wars\u2013themed packaging was developed exclusively for the park as part of a collaboration between Walt Disney Imagineering, Lucasfilm Ltd., and The Coca-Cola Company, which has had a partnership with Disneyland since 1955. The specially-packaged drink was revealed at Star Wars Celebration Chicago in April 2019, during the \"Bringing Star Wars to Life at Disney Parks\" panel, which showcased an advertisement featuring a crate full of Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, and Dasani beverages being stolen from two distracted First Order stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The creative process behind the bottles took over three years, with Coca-Cola Design presenting designs in various shapes and sizes before settling on the rustic orb bottles present in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. Matt Cooper, an associate industrial designer at Coca-Cola, stated that the goal of the final design was to evoke a sense that the bottles had just been pulled off a ship or left behind and repurposed into beverage containers. The textures for the soda bottles were captured in West Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, home of The Coca-Cola Company, with Cooper creating the concept art. The bottle caps, which were also conceptualized by Cooper, were designed to look like something that belonged in the hands of the Resistance, specifically in juxtaposition to the Dasani bottle, which was made to look like it was possibly brought in by the First Order. The shapes for the orbs were designed by James Cha. The idea to use Aurebesh for the logo originated when a group of Imagineers toured the Coke Archives in Atlanta and saw the brand's iconic Spencerian script logo in various languages."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
