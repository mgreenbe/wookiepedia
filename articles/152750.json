She encountered the Corellian smuggler Han Solo on Crseih Station that year and tried to preach to him about her new-found faith. The smuggler assumed she was trying to seduce him, as Ghostlings were wont to do, and he initially rebuffed her, knowing that any intimate relations between a Human and a Ghostling would no doubt kill the Ghostling due to their fragile nature. Nevertheless, the Ghostling female protested that she no longer sought to plague Humans and was entirely devoted to Waru."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
