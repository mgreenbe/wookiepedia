Vanqor was thus able, through its expansionist policies, to creating booming industries for itself and to achieve a measure of wealth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 BBY, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, crash-landed on Vanqor with a crew of TY44 surveillance outpost workers\u2014Typha-Dor resistance fighters whom they'd come to rescue. Later, in their investigations of the planet, the Jedi Master-Padawan team fought off a nest of gundarks deep in the Tomo Craters. By mission's end, the Jedi duo assisted Typha-Dor to fend off invasion by Vanqor and to mediate a peace between the two worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vanqor was ultimately defeated by a strategic maneuvering of the Typha-Dor fleet that allowed it to surround the much larger Vanqor fleet. Warship forces under the command of Typha-Dor High General Bycha took advantage of the concealment afforded by Typha-Dor's \"string of moons\" before suddenly appearing to ensnare Vanqor's invasion fleet within the satellite corridor through which its invasion forces intended to pass. The Vanqor capitulated without a fight rather than face the destruction of most of their military. A ceasefire was worked out with mediation from several Jedi diplomatic envoys sent at the behest of the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, Jenna Zan Arbor hid on Vanqor while experimenting with her new drug, the Zone of Self-Containment.

Dooku slipped away from them by hitching a ride with a Weequay pirate gang who had landed to scavenge his crashed solar sailer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, contact with the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance under the command of Admiral Shoan Kilian was lost as the vessel violently entered into the atmosphere of Vanqor following the sabotage of the engines by Boba Fett after his failed attempt on High Jedi General Mace Windu's life to get vengeance for Windu's killing of Boba's \"father\", Jango Fett at the First Battle of Geonosis. While the crew evacuated the ship, Kilian remained onboard in the belief that an admiral must go down with his ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Mace Windu descended to the planet in Jedi starfighters to look for survivors. However, the surviving crew had been slaughtered and the officers, including Admiral Shoan Kilian, taken prisoner by Boba Fett and his company of bounty hunters. Boba rigged his father's helmet on the bridge of the downed cruiser with a bomb inside it, and Skywalker and Windu were trapped under debris by the resulting explosion. Thanks to the efforts of Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, the two were rescued by Ahsoka Tano and Plo Koon, summoned from the Jedi Temple. Boba and his retinue, however, got away with the hostages aboard Slave I."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
