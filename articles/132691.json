Jedi Knights protect others from all of these evils, but lurking in the dark may be another huge threat-monsters! These beasts travel on land, in the sea, in the sky, and even in space. Although they may threaten the Jedi and the Rebel Alliance, monsters are not naturally evil. They don't start wars or try to rule the galaxy, and they attack villains, too. Of course they can be scary and violent, but often they are just defending their way of life, or doing their job as a gangster's guard, an arena beast, or an assassin for the Jedi's great enemy, the Sith. Sometimes a dangerous monster can even be trained to help the Jedi. You are about to meet these amazing monsters from across the galaxy. A few are driven by savage instincts, while others possess basic intelligence-but you can be sure that all of them are wild at heart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "American"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "International"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
