The size of a city, the vessel also had the population of a small city, and was staffed by a great number of droids including loadlifter droids. It was equipped with numerous drills and other mining equipment capable of peeling the mantle of a moon, and was towed into orbit over low-gravity moons by tugs. Its exterior hull was fitted with cannon emplacements, ion torpedos, and anti-air weapons, arming the vessel like a fortress, and its armor could withstand mines. A series of treads beneath the vessel allowed it to cross planetary surfaces while a front-mounted drill strip-mined the terrain ahead. It was protected by a core security system, and featured cargo bays and top-mounted landing platforms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Continent-class crawlers were used by Kingdom of Shu-Torun and their miners for offworld excavations of low-gravity moons. Queen Trios claimed it could peel a planet's mantle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Rebels overran the drill citadel on the moon of Jedha, Trios brought in the Continent-class crawler Leviathan to continue strip-mining the moon for kyber crystals. Tugged into orbit over Jedha, the vessel served as a symbol of Shu-Torun's commitment to the Galactic Empire, as the behemoth would not be able to achieve orbit again once deployed. The orbital drill entered Jedha's atmosphere and began strip-mining on a massive scale while the Partisans watched. Ubin Des attempted to plant mines in its tracks, but her attack had no effect."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chewbacca supplied the Rebels with schematics of the Leviathan, allowing Leia Organa to plan a counter-attack. Her team infiltrated the vessel by hiding in cargo crates, and took control of the bridge with Trios's help after the Queen revealed she would sacrifice her machine to safe-guard her people. With the Leviathan sabotaged, the Rebels, Trios, and Commander Kanchar escaped as it toppled into the blast crater made by the Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
