The gravitational tides that surrounded the system made the vicinity unstable for starship passage, but the heavily fluctuating magnetic tides also had a side-effect of cloaking the altitude changes of vessels passing through the region, allowing starships that entered the system to change course without their maneuvers being detected by pursuers. In about 18 BBY, the Jedi Knight Jax Pavan planned to fly through the Twins while transporting the resistance leader Thi Xon Yimmon from the planet Coruscant to Dantooine. However, they were attacked close to the system by the forces of the 501st Legion, led by Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
