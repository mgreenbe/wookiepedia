Around 3976 BBY, Marl began his career as a professional duelist in the dueling ring run by the Hutt crime lord Ajuur on the planet Taris. By 3956 BBY, the current dueling champion, Bendak Starkiller, retired after death matches were outlawed by the forces of Darth Malak's Sith Empire, which had quarantined the planet in order to search for Jedi Knight Bastila Shan. Marl became the dueling champion but was defeated by the Rodian Twitch for the title. He still competed with other duelists, such as Ice, Gerlon Two-Fingers, and Deadeye Duncan. During his career, Marl made the decision to use a double-bladed vibrosword during combat after Two-Fingers' blaster overheated and exploded, paralyzing three of his fingers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3956 BBY, the final year of the Jedi Civil War between the Republic and the Sith Empire, the Republic soldier Revan, known by the nickname \"Mysterious Stranger\" after defeating Duncan, Two-Fingers, and Ice to ascend the ranks of duelist, challenged Marl.

He regarded Bendak Starkiller as a legend, albeit bloodthirsty, and respected all the other duelists excluding Deadeye Duncan, whom he believed was the worst duelist ever."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The veteran duelist never fought with blasters, preferring the use of a double-bladed vibrosword, a decision he made after fellow duelist Gerlon Two-Fingers' blaster exploded\u2014which, according to Marl, was a rare occurrence.
