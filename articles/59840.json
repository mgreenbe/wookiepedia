It contained several buildings on two sides of a paved stone path that ran through its center, which came to a dead end marked by an obelisk in front of a cliff on the northwest side. The southwestern facing side of the airbase had two prefab shelters, a command center, a power core, and a spaceport, while the northeastern side had two airbases with a power core between them, and another two prefab shelters. The Airbase was utilized by the Naboo Airforce, and royal trade ships transported goods between Harte Secur and the Airbase."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, during the Invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation, the airbase was guarded by one Udopal speeder.

Once OOM-9 regained the program, fighters from the airbase attacked his camp, but were destroyed by Baron battle droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOM-9's forces later destroyed the Airbase."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harte Secur airbase first appeared in the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, in which it appeared in the second level of the Trade Federation campaign: \"Behind the Lines.\" Destroying the airbase is optional for the player, but recommended by the level's reconaissance report.
