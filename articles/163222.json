The Children of the Watch were a Mandalorian group, described by Bo-Katan Kryze as a cult, who followed the Way and sought to reestablish the religion, which had since fallen out of mainstream Mandalorian society and become considered ancient by the time of the New Republic Era."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The faith practiced by some members of Mandalorian society, such as the Children of the Watch, the Way of the Mandalore involved protecting fellow Mandalorians but also wearing a helmet at all times. Mandalorians who did not follow the Way also went out of their way to help fellow Mandalorians. A major difference between the two groups was that the Way stated that, if a Mandalorian removed their helmet in front of another living being, they were no longer permitted to wear it. Mandalorians who adhered to the Way would state \"This is the Way\" when following its ideals. Mandalorians not of that creed would treat followers of the Way with scorn. In turn, the followers saw those individuals as not being true Mandalorians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Way was followed by at least one Mandalorian tribe, known simply as \"the Tribe,\" which resided in an underground covert on Nevarro during the era of the New Republic. When the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin got into an altercation with Paz Vizsla in the enclave after Vizsla had accused Djarin of being a coward for using Imperial beskar to create his armor, a Mandalorian armorer reminded them both of the Way of the Mandalore, stopping the fight. Later, the members of the Tribe protected Djarin from members of the Bounty Hunters' Guild when he broke the Bounty Hunter Code by rescuing Grogu. Despite the fact that revealing themselves openly would necessitate relocating their covert to remain in hiding, the Tribe assisted Djarin as a fellow Mandalorian who followed the Way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the farmer Omera asked Djarin if he ever removed his helmet publicly, he stated that he never did as he followed his way of life since he was rescued by the Mandalorians as a young boy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being caught in the explosion of an E-Web heavy repeating blaster cannon during a skirmish on Nevarro against an Imperial holdout led by Moff Gideon, Djarin was badly injured. While Carasynthia Dune, Greef Karga, and Grogu escaped into the Nevarro sewer, IG-11, an IG-series assassin droid who had been reprogrammed as a nurse droid, insisted that he remove Djarin's helmet, but was instead greeted by Din Djarin's blaster pistol as he aimed it at the droid to stop him from removing it. However, he lowered his blaster when IG-11 reminded him that he was lifeless and therefore Djarin would not be seen by a living being, which allowed the IG-series droid to remove Djarin's helmet and heal him with a bacta spray."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, while infiltrating the Morak Imperial refinery alongside Migs Mayfeld while disguised as a Juggernaut Pilots, Djarin had to download data from a terminal. As it required a facial scan, the Mandalorian wrestled with the decision, but removed his helmet to allow the scan. Recovering the data allowed him to locate Gideon's light cruiser, where Grogu was being held."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Way of the Mandalore was first laid out in the 2019 live-action television series The Mandalorian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
