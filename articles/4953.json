The Royal Palace overlooked the lake which was in fact a geologically recent meteor crater. It had formed around 30,500 BBY and had subsequently filled with water from the local subterranean aquifers. The city of Aldera itself was built on an island\u2014or more precisely a peninsula\u2014overlooking the lake. Visitors commonly reached the city by crossing the lake by boat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lake of Aldera was first mentioned in the 1995 reference book The Illustrated Star Wars Universe. In the same book, the lake also appeared in the first picture ever depicting the city of Aldera.
