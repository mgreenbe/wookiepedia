In 1984, while still a student at New York's School of Visual Arts, he produced work for Harvey Kurtzman (creator of Mad magazine) on the short-lived young readers anthology NUTS! At the same time Fingerman also signed a contract to produce a series of comical parodies of the Italian comic series, RanXerox, exclusively for the European market, which ran in such magazines as France's L'\u00c9cho des savanes and Comics USA, and Spain's infamous El Vibora. Fingerman toiled in the disparate realms of children's satire, pornography, sci-fi and illustration, producing work regularly for Cracked magazine, Al Goldstein's infamous tabloid, Screw, Penthouse, Hot Talk, Heavy metal, National Lampoon, and High Times. He also worked as an illustrator for the Village Voice, Video Review, Business Week, Guitar World, and many other periodicals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1990 he decided to focus on doing comics. He did a yearlong stint on The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, as well as several titles for the Eros Comix line of adult comics. Among those were Skinheads in Love and Bloodsucker, a collaboration with punk icon Lydia Lunch. He also created covers and short stories for Dark Horse Comics, and DC Comics' Vertigo imprint. In 1993 Fingerman wrote and drew his first graphic novel, White Like She, a sci-fi social satire about a middle-aged black man whose brain is transplanted into a white teenage girl's head. Upon completion of this purely fictional work, Fingerman decided to turn his attention inward and mine his own life for source material. The result was the semi-autobiographical series, Minimum Wage, which in 2003 was collected and extensively reworked as the Fantagraphics graphic novel, Beg the Question (and which was nominated for an Ignatz Award)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fingerman has broadened his palette, turning to prose, and continuing to work in comics. His most recent offerings are the humor collection You Deserved It, Zombie World: Winter's Dregs & Other Stories, the zombie graphic novel, Recess Pieces, and his debut prose novel, Bottomfeeder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars bibiliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
