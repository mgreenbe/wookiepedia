In 3640 BBY, during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the Imperial forces have occupied the museum and used as a makeshift camp for POWs. After high-profile Republic Senator Bevera Dodonna was revealed as a traitor and fled to the museum, Jedi Master Sumalee authorized a mission to locate and retrieve her. Selonian Curske provided the maps of Selonian tunnels leading to the museum and the smuggler Voidhound went in and apprehended the traitorous Senator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
