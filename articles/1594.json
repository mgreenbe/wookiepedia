Its strength was not in accuracy\u2014indeed, it did not have much of that\u2014but rather in its ability to hit anything within a general field of fire. Critics of the CSA have said that the rifle matched the CSA philosophy perfectly\u2014when in doubt, shoot into a crowd, or so the cynics say."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This riot gun also had a close-range stun setting as well, meaning the wielder could switch the weapon to fire stun shots instead of lethal fire, however the close-range stun setting was limited to a range of only 9 meters.
