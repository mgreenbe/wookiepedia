Generally, the goods they could make were relatively basic, but artisans who honed their craft could specialize in more advanced fields, including architecture, droid engineering, and tailoring. They could also specialize in other more focused professions, such as armorsmith, weaponsmith, starshipwright, chef, or merchant. Merchants, also known as traders, would often forgo the title artisan, and yet engage in very similar practices, crafting goods in several specific fields, such as munitions, structures, domestic goods, or engineering."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Artisan was one of the six basic starter professions that appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. However, the profession was removed during the New Game Enhancements of November 15, 2005 and rolled into one, all-encompassing Trader profession. Prior to the NGE, players of the Artisan profession could gain experience to specialize in some of the more advanced crafting professions, such as Armorsmith, Weaponsmith, and Chef. Following the NGE, these professions were also merged into the Trader profession to offer players a less complicated crafting system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being removed from the game as a playable profession, the term artisan was still used throughout the game to describe certain assembly and experimentation skills, as well as some schematics.
