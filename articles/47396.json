Although not as powerful as the other crimelords, she controlled most of the goods and services sold to the majority of citizens harbored beneath the capital and commandeered many troopers and soldiers. Because she supplied the tunnel workers with food, earning great respect from the underground dwellers in the process, she knew the tunnels below almost as well as those of the Resistance movement."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Supporting the peace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 BBY, Tala met Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker.
