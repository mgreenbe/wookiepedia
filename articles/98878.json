At the behest of the Separatists, Vindi re-engineered the Blue Shadow Virus, an extinct virus capable of inflicting mass casualties across the galaxy. He worked out of a secret laboratory on the planet Naboo, where he attempted to spread the virus before being stopped and arrested by the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker were further able to find a cure on Iego in order to save those who had been infected in Vindi's laboratory. While in Republic custody, Vindi, along with Lok Durd, was part of Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic's original plans for a prisoner exchange with the Separatists to secure the release of Galen Erso, Lyra Erso, and the baby Jyn Erso from imprisonment on Vallt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nuvo Vindi was a male Faust from the planet Adana who lived during the Fall of the Republic.
