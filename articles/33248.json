There were very few truly open bodies of water on the planet: the water supply was thinly invested throughout the planet's main habitat, swampland, although there were vast expanses of mud fields. Dagobah was home to many creatures, such as bogwings, dragonsnakes, nudj, sleens, vine snakes, and swamp slugs. Examples of flora included the Adder moss, the hassling, Gnarltree and Meat flower.

Unfortunately, Halka Four-Den and her research team died on Dagobah before they could be retrieved. Likely due to the outbreak of the Clone Wars, their distress signals were ignored until it was too late.

Yoda noted how strong the planet was with the Force, and learned from Qui-Gon's Force-spirit that it was one of the purest places in the Galaxy. This formed the basis for why Yoda eventually chose to endure his time in Exile there.

Due to a bumpy landing, Luke's X-wing ended up being half-buried in the swamp, and a grumpy and irritable Luke met a strange creature that turned out to be Yoda. During his grueling training, Luke learned control and power in the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many of the teaching methods he learned here were later applied at his Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. On Dagobah, Luke confronted a Droid Bounty hunter named Milko, whose mission was to kill Luke. Luke defeated the droid in armed battle. Luke had a feeling that the encounter was a test arranged by Yoda but had no idea whether he had passed or failed. Luke later entered the cave where the Dark Jedi had been defeated to test himself and experienced a vision where he fought a version of Darth Vader with Luke's face underneath his mask, hinting at both Vader's identity as his father and his own later involvement with the dark side. Later in his training, Skywalker had a vision of his friends Han Solo, Leia Organa, and Chewbacca suffering on Bespin.

In 14 ABY, the dark side power of the cave there was siphoned by the Disciples of Ragnos.
