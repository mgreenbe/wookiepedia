As such, they were always looking to assassinate members from the rival Tetsu Clan. Neesh and Thuku hired an assassin named Spurch \"Warhog\" Goa to kill a young Tetsu mercenary named Greedo. Spurch had developed a relationship with Greedo and had helped the young Rodian develop his skills as a potential bounty hunter. Secretly, Spurch despised Rodians and took great joy in manipulating Greedo into going after the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo. Spurch knew that Solo would kill Greedo and he was able to successfully honor his commitment to Neesh without firing a single shot himself. Neesh and Thuku paid Spurch with a chest full of Rodian coinage, claiming that they would have killed Greedo themselves, but they did not want it to become common knowledge that they were hunting their own kind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Rodian tongue, Neesh's name means loud.
