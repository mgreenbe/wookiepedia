The boys were aboard the Imperial prison barge Purge. On this barge, their father had a business; selling weapons to inmates. After their father's death, they attempted to make a sale with Aur Myss, who killed their previous contact. Aur Myss was part of the Delphanian Face Gang, which was a prison gang led by Aur Myss; he and his goons were planning to kill the Longo boys. Kale saw this coming and tried to strike a deal with the Delphanian by simply giving him the weapons free of charge. Myss would not have this due to the fact that he promised his goons that they could kill the boys. Kale reacted by ripping the piercings out of Myss' face and the two boys ran back to their cell in time and were safe for the time being."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jareth Sartoris, captain of the guard on the barge, is called into the warden's office to discuss something. When he arrives, Bissley Kloth, the warden of the barge, explains that the engines on the Purge are breaking down. The good news being, there is a derelict Star Destroyer in the vicinity. Sartoris questions why the Empire would leave a Star Destroyer in the middle of space but Kloth tells him that it is none of their concern and that the Captain is ordered to go on the ship and retrieve spare parts in order to fix the prison barge's engines. Before Sartoris leaves, the warden states that his interrogation techniques are ineffective because the subjects keep dying, like Von Longo. Sartoris recommends he cancels his duty on the Purge and then leaves to board the Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zahara Cody is the Chief Medical Officer on the prison barge, aided by her 2-1B surgical droid, Waste. She is an outcast among the Imperial Personnel due to the fact that she interacts with inmates all day. She has attachment to some inmates and would rather be around them than the Empire. When she saw Sartoris kill Von Longo, she handed in her resignation letter. Once the barge landed at their next stop, she was away from the Empire for good. She also had some sort of a connection to the Longo boys since she carried out their father's last request, which was to bring them to him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sartoris takes ten men and boards the Vector. They split up so Sartoris and his men can find the parts while the other group finds the medical bay. In the medical bay are pairs of lungs in tubes, breathing in unison. The men in the med bay realize they are not alone and they are unable to escape. Sartoris and his men get back to the lift to return to the Purge. One of his guards is coughing violently while one of the engineers is vomiting. They get back to the barge and rush to the medical bay. All the guards are coughing and vomiting. Then inmates and guards alike begin coughing and vomiting. Soon the entire medical bay is full. Sartoris, however, is unaffected by this new virus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the medical bay, Cody is trying to deal with the problem when Waste comes to the conclusion that the virus only activates after there are enough of the cells that the body cannot defend against it. Cody realizes at this point that their containment measures are useless and rips her isolation suit off. She knows that everyone is going to die so she tries to make everyone as comfortable as possible before they succumb to their fate. Waste acknowledges the fact that she has yet to be sick and that she must be immune. He takes her blood and they attempt to create an anti-virus to stop people from getting sick.

They take note of it and start running for the escape pods. They reach the next cell block but they see a young Wookiee in one of the cells with his dead family around him. Trig insists they help the young one and unlocks the doors. They try to get the youngster to go with them but the little one stays with his family and holds them.

She goes to the bridge and asks to do a bioscan of the ship. The ship states that there are six people alive, two of which are in solitary. She reluctantly goes down to solitary, tripping over bodies while getting there. She finds a note that one of the guards was going to give to his wife. She takes it and pockets it. She reaches the first solitary door and opens it, blaster in hand. But no one is in there. She goes to the next one and as soon as she opens it, a huge Wookiee comes out screaming and getting ready to attack Zahara. She yells at him to stop and he does. Zahara unlocks the next door and a man comes out. He introduces himself as Han Solo and the Wookiee's name is Chewbacca. She insists that they take the anti-virus but they are defiant, until they see the bodies around the corner. Han takes it first, then Chewbacca. But Chewbacca did not get it in time and started showing symptoms of the other victims. He starts screaming and going insane and his throat is swelling up. He begins to pass out and Zahara quickly takes the syringe and empties the blisters starting around his neck. The swelling goes down and Chewbacca returns to normal. They get up to leave but they realize the bodies Zahara had stumbled over before are missing. They go back into the medical bay, which is now completely empty, and look for Waste. They find him on the ground in critical condition. Zahara asks what happened to the bodies and Waste replies that they came back and ate.

He tells them both to get out, he gets in, activates the launch codes, and launches away. Kale quickly realizes that there is another escape pod opposite of the position they are in. They start running that way because they feel the thing that was eating the baby Wookiee is following them. When they reach the other escape pod, they run into Han and Chewie. The boys hold their blasters at them but Han and Chewie quickly disarm them. Zahara comes around the corner and tells them to stop and that they are all getting out together. They realize the escape pod's hatch has been sealed because of security measures. So Han, Chewie, and Zahara go to the bridge to disable it, while Kale and Trig stay at the escape pod.

Soon after, Kale bursts through with Trig in his arms and yells at them to run. They run to the turbolift, which leads to the Star Destroyer, and activate it. Trig comes to and sees his father.

Chewie insists that they open the door. Han opens it and they see three Wookiees eating human remains. The Wookiees turn around and run toward Han and Chewie, and Han instinctively starts blasting them.

She notices that their shots are getting better. Her adrenaline is pumping and she is moving faster than ever when all of a sudden, a blaster bolt hits Kale in the side of the face. She leaves him after that and goes into the medical bay and is attacked by a zombie. She sticks syringes in its head and for a minute it starts to act human again. It scratches out in the ground \"Blackwing\" but the cure doesn't last long and it attacks Zahara again. Suddenly another 2-1B surgical droid saves her. It reminds her of Waste and she has a moment with the droid. The droid leads her to a console that will tell her whats happening. She continues to call the droid Waste and says thank you.

He realizes that the tractor beam of the Star Destroyer was turned on and sucked in the escape pod. He hears blaster fire outside and jumps outside. Noticing zombies all around him, he jumps into an abandoned X-wing and fires. The ship skids across the hangar floor and crashes into an Imperial shuttle. He quickly climbs into the shuttle and is greeted by four men, one being Commander Gorrister who explains that this zombie outbreak is because of a weapon that the Empire had created. He also explains the zombies can learn. They learn what works and what doesn't and how to make it work. The whole time all the men are licking their lips. Gorrister explains that they have been stuck in the shuttle for ten weeks. Then he explains that he started out with 30 men and is now down to 6. Two men grab Sartoris and Gorrister explains that they did what they did to survive and they started encroaching to kill Sartoris. All of a sudden a blast knocks the shuttle and Sartoris breaks free. He realizes the zombies learned from what he did and were getting into scattered ships around the hangar bay. Sartoris starts grabbing the men and throwing them into a crowd of zombies, but the last man pleads for mercy. Sartoris asks him his name, to which he replys \"White\". Sartoris asks if the shuttle will fly. The man says the tractor beam won't let them out. Sartoris says he is going to disable the tractor beam and he will be back.

Trig is motionless and Kale starts to climb over Trig to bite him when Trig comes and pushes Kale down the shaft and into the turbine room. He sees Han, who is telling Trig to climb down to the catwalk. Meanwhile all the zombies at the bottom are shooting up at them and they are getting more accurate. Trig tries to climb but falls. He falls into something and he realizes it was the lifter that Sartoris was piloting. Sartoris flies around and gets Han and Chewie. The lifter is overloaded and slowly going down into the crowd of zombies. In a moment of redemption, Sartoris gives Trig the controls and says \"Your father was a good man.

Zahara steps out and explains that since the zombies are away from the source of the infection, the zombies die easier.
