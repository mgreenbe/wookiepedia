With his fellow Hutt Rarsk, Bo-Dum imposed his rule on a planet of the Outer Rim Territories for a time. Ultimately, the two Hutts were defeated by Han Solo, the famous Corellian smuggler, and his co-pilot Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bo-Dum was part of the Hutts, a species of rotund, hermaphroditic gastropods that were reputed for dabbling in shady business throughout the galaxy. He and his partner Rarsk were once part of the Hutt Cartel, a crime syndicate and an alliance between several Hutt clans, but the two were evicted from the organization. Unable to buy their way back into the Cartel, the two low-life Hutts came to impose their law to a planet of the Outer Rim Territories that had a Corellian settlement. They notably had some of their thugs kill the sheriff of the settlement so that the colonists found themselves without a lawman to protect them. Additionally, Bo-Dum took a fancy to Jenna, the late sheriff's daughter. The Hutt's interest in the young woman, however, was far from reciprocated."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Meeting the Corellian Kid"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, the famous Corellian smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca crashed on the planet aboard their ship, the Millennium Falcon. A trio of pirate drones owned by the Hutts managed to shoot the Falcon down, although its crew survived. Unbeknownst to Bo-Dum and his partner, Jenna convinced Solo to help the settlers to get rid of the Hutts. Meanwhile, Bo-Dum and Rarsk learned that the ship their drones had shot earlier was salvageable, but were not informed of its owner's identity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving to the Corellian settlement, Bo-Dum discovered that Jenna was waiting for him. He attempted to molest her, but was interrupted by the growl of Chewbacca, whom Jenna described as the new sheriff. As Bo-Dum did not wish to confront a Wookiee, he retreated to the local cantina with Rarsk so they could make new plans. While the Hutts were discussing, a masked individual who called himself \"the Corellian Kid\" informed them that the crashed ship was that of Han Solo. Knowing that one of their fellow Hutts, Jabba Desilijic Tiure, had put a price on Solo's head, Bo-Dum and Rarsk decided to hire the Corellian Kid, promising that he would get forty percent of the bounty after salvaging the Millennium Falcon's wreck. The next day by dawn, Bo-Dum, Rarsk and the Corellian Kid embarked for the crash site on board of a landspeeder. Once they arrived, it became obvious that the whole bargain was a trap. Not only were the Corellian settlers waiting for them in arms, but the Falcon had been repaired to its full working order. The so-called Corellian Kid, who was none other than Solo in disguise, left the Hutts alone in their vehicle a split second before the settlers attacked. Emerging from his now battered repulsorcraft, Bo-Dum witnessed the Millennium Falcon taking off, taking Solo, Chewbacca and the Corellian settlers with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Hutt, Bo-Dum was known to have had a lust for at least one female Human, a preoccupation that most other Hutts regarded as both perverse and inexplicable. As with all Hutts, Bo-Dum was large and plump. He had yellow eyes and green skin. While the Hutts were not defenseless, with their tails that could be used as weapons to bludgeon their enemies to death, Bo-Dum was too cowardly to engage in a fight against Chewbacca. On at least one occasion, Bo-Dum made use of hypocritical humor, noting how \"sorry\" he was upon \"hearing\" of the demise of Jenna's father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bo-Dum wore a purple pauldron on the right shoulder and a chunky bracelet on the wrist of the corresponding arm.
