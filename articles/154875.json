It was an immense source of power, beyond anything known to the galaxy in the era of the New Republic. Intent on keeping it out of the hands of the First Order, Mika Grey spent two-and-a-half years tracking the relic down before locating it, while being pursued by elite First Order Raiders who were attempting to seize the relic for their Supreme Leader. Grey managed to acquire it after entering the temple, getting stuck inside after activating a trap protecting the relic, and being discovered several days later by Colossus residents Kazuda Xiono, CB-23, Eila and Kel. The relic's power was spent when Grey activated it to kill the Raider squad, led by Agent Raith, which had tracked her and the artifact down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The unidentified Sith relic first appeared in the Star Wars Resistance episode \"The Relic Raiders\".
