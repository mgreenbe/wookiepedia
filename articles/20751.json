Due to specialized focusing lenses and emitters, the broadsaber's hilt made a blade that was broader and flatter than a standard lightsaber's cylindrical blade, and as such, gave it a profile that was closer to that of a traditional metal sword. The broadsaber provided a larger overall surface for the blade, while losing the advantages of an omnidirectional cutting edge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of this, broadsabers were not popular among the members of the Jedi Order, with many Jedi Masters believing that it was less elegant than standard lightsabers.
