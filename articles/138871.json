TX-828 was one of the final clones to be bred on the planet Kamino, and at some point during his service in the clone army, he gained the nickname \"Torrent.\" In 19 BBY, the Galactic Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire, and due to the accelerated aging of clone troopers and his late production, TX-828 became one of the last few in service."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 0 BBY, TX-828 had been promoted to sergeant, and he served under Imperial Security Bureau Senior Commander Alecia Beck, stationed aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Vehement.

Following the new order, TX-828, directed by Beck, led a troop of eight stormtroopers to ambush the Shrikes as they attempted to escape aboard an EE-730 transport. With their E-11 blaster rifles set to stun, TX-828 and his fellow soldiers engaged the rebels in a brief firefight that lasted less than ten seconds. TX-828 and his squad captured four rebel troopers, but a Rodian rebel had eluded capture, and the alien shot the unconscious men and women before committing suicide. Beck, convinced that the action was taken to protect rebel secrets, had TX-828 search the five rebel bodies. TX-828 and his troop conducted the search and found nothing. Beck, however, used her cybernetic eye in the ultraviolet spectrum and found the symbol of the Shrikes. On Beck's orders, TX-828 boarded the rebels' starship with his troop and commanded them to begin a thorough search. TX-828 believed that all of the rebels were accounted for, but when he and Beck entered the ship's sleeping quarters, they discovered evidence that a sixth Shrike, Caluan Ematt, had escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Beck's order, TX-828 had an additional ten squads from the Vehement search the hangars and local cantinas, before sending a scanning crew to deliver the data to the ISB officer.

Beck subsequently contacted TX-828, who affirmed that both the ship's computer and hyperspace logs had been wiped. After the update, Beck was notified that three ships had slipped through the planet's Imperial blockade. Deducing that Ematt was aboard one, a MK I bulk transport, Beck contacted the Vehement's captain, Hove, and a course was set for the transport's destination: Cyrkon, a crime-ridden planet in Hutt Space."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Investigation on Cyrkon"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Promenade firefight"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving at Cyrkon, Beck led TX-828 and a squad to Motok, the planet's capital. In the city, the group began searching for Ematt, eventually arriving at a cantina. Upon Beck's word, TX-828 commanded the stormtroopers to line the bar patrons against the wall and shoot if they resisted. As two of the stormtroopers began searching the patrons for weapons, Beck explained that she was looking for Ematt. When a Twi'lek claimed that none of them had seen Ematt, Beck called the man on his lie, and she had TX-828 take the alien out of the bar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Continuing the interrogation, Beck threatened the Twi'lek, who began to comply. When Beck asked the alien if he knew Ematt was a rebel, the Twi'lek said that he had suspected so. Beck stated that all rebel sympathizers were to be shot on sight, and TX-828 fired upon the Twi'lek. As TX-828 moved the body, Beck learned from Captain Hove that a marked YT-1300 light freighter under the alias \"Lost and Found\" had landed in Motok. Inferring that the ship was attempting to rescue Ematt, Beck informed the sergeant, and the squad raced to the suspect hangar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "En route to the hangar, TX-828, Beck, and the squad encountered a firefight in the spaceport's promenade. When a passerby yelled that the shooters were rebels, the squad advanced, and Beck ordered the assailants to put their weapons down. However, unknown to the Imperials, the passerby was the smuggler Han Solo, owner of the suspect freighter, who was accompanied by the Wookiee Chewbacca, and the shooters were not rebels, but bounty hunters sent after Solo by Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Without hesitation, TX-828 ordered his troops to execute plan Sigma Four, with two stormtroopers flanking either side of the promenade, advancing, firing, and advancing again. One of the stormtrooper pairs quickly stunned a Kubaz fighter, as the other pair brought down a Gran. Only a human and assassin droid remained; the human tried to run, but he was shot. As the droid attempted to surrender, the sergeant lifted his short-barreled DEMP gun and fired, disabling the droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beck praised TX-828 for his efficiency, and the sergeant thanked his commander. TX-828 then directed the squad to disarm and bind the suspects. Meanwhile, Beck approached the unconscious human, whom she expected was Ematt, but after finding an Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate, she realized the four attackers had been bounty hunters and not rebels. Piecing together the situation, Beck asked TX-828 where the human and Wookiee had gone, and the sergeant noted that the two likely had ran when the fight began. Behind them, the droid restarted, identifying itself as \"Captivator\" and stating that the Imperials had interfered with its mission. The droid elaborated, explaining that the man and Wookiee were the smugglers Solo and Chewbacca, and that there was a significant bounty for their capture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeing an opportunity, Beck asked Captivator if it could identify Solo's ship. The droid hesitated, before claiming that Solo flew a KLT-Kuat light freighter named Roundabout Right. Once given the information, Beck allowed Captivator's crew to leave.

Beck confirmed his suspicions, and she explained they were searching for a YT-1300 light freighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Directing her attention to the owner of a nearby caf\u00e9, Beck told the man to remove his clothing; Beck then ordered the sergeant to remove his stormtrooper armor, don the proprietor's tunic, follow the bounty hunters, and report on their progress while she advanced toward Solo's ship. As TX-828 removed his armor, Beck realized that he was a clone, one of the last still in service. Beck asked TX-828 what he was referred to in the barracks, and the sergeant replied that he was called Torrent. The clone finished dressing, and Beck told him to use \"Torrent\" as his callsign, handing him her blaster pistol.

As the group departed the cantina on a landspeeder, TX-828 acquired a swoop, tracking the bounty hunters to a low-rent hotel in the city's south side.

Less than four minutes later, TX-828 arrived at his position, telling Beck that the trio of rebels was twenty seconds away. On cue, Ematt, Solo, and Chewbacca entered the docking bay, and TX-828, armed with his E-11 blaster rifle, covered their exit as Beck sprung the trap. Outnumbered, the three rebels surrendered, and once they were disarmed, TX-828 approached Beck and remained at her side. Beck then ordered for the trio to be searched, bound, and transported to the Vehement, so TX-828 began with Ematt, thoroughly searching the human."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the search was interrupted when a scuffle started between Solo and Chewbacca, resulting in several stormtroopers being knocked to the ground. Solo grabbed a rifle from one of the troopers, revealing that the fight had been a ruse, and he fired upon the generators that formed the hangar's magnetic field, the only separation from Cyrkon's hazardous atmosphere. As the toxic heat rushed into the building, TX-828 began grappling with Ematt before being tackled by Solo. The starship Miss Fortune then appeared above the hangar, firing upon the stormtroopers. As the three rebels ran for the Millennium Falcon's boarding ramp, TX-828 got up and quickly escorted Beck to cover just as the Miss Fortune's ventral turret fired on her previous location."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Flight of the Falcon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Millennium Falcon and Miss Fortune fled from the port, leaving behind the defeated Imperial forces.

The Millennium Falcon fled into Cyrkon's atmosphere and approached the domed city of Motok. As the Vehement followed, Captain Hove informed Beck that continued use of the tractor beam would cause collateral damage to the planet and destroy the city. When Beck stuttered in response, TX-828 addressed her. She then grabbed him and explained that she knew the rebels' plan: if the Vehement captured the Millennium Falcon, there would be millions of witnesses to the destruction caused by the Empire, and the city would be martyred. TX-828 stood with Hove as Beck stormed from the bridge. Hove called off the pursuit, and the Vehement returned to space.
