At the Battle of Sullust in 20 BBY, TJ-912 commanded a Recusant-class light destroyer as part of a fleet led by Separatist commander and Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress, who flew her Ginivex-class fanblade starfighter during the battle. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker engaged Ventress in their own fighter craft, an encounter which led to the three pilots landing in the main hangar of the Separatist command ship, where they dueled with their lightsabers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the duel progressed, TJ-912 was contacted by Separatist leader and master of Ventress, Count Dooku, after the count had been instructed by his own master, Darth Sidious, to eliminate Ventress. TJ-912 informed Dooku of Ventress's whereabouts and was then ordered by the count to destroy the Separatist flagship. While the tactical droid stated that doing so would result in the destruction of their forces as well as Ventress and the Jedi, Dooku confirmed that was the intended outcome, leading TJ-912 to order her own destroyer to open fire on the command ship once they were in position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the command ship sustaining heavy damage, TJ-912 contacted a Hyena-class Droid Bomber and instructed it to crash into the hangar where the Jedi and Ventress were. The craft exploded as it hit the hangar wall, prompting Ventress, Kenobi, and Skywalker to each return to their fighters and flee the ship, which they did immediately before the cruiser's complete destruction. TJ-912 contacted Dooku, informing the count that the ship was destroyed and, since the tactical droid was unaware of Ventress and the Jedi escaping, that their scanning showed there were no survivors. Her task seemingly complete, Dooku ordered TJ-912 to recall the fleet, which the droid acknowledged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A T-series tactical droid, TJ-912 had feminine programming and was 1.93 meters tall.
