During the war, the starship's navigation computer was one of those infected by the navcomputer virus released by the Stark Commercial Combine against the Republic Navy. The virus caused the ship to exit Hyperspace in the center of a star while it was en route to the planet Troiken, killing Isard's brother and destroying the vessel.
