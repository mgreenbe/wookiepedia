General Airen Cracken invented the slug by hollowing out the tip of a standard slug and packing detonite inside, sealed with a sealant made of two parts sealant and one part phospha, a substance that ignited upon contact with a hard surface. When the slug was fired and hit its target, the phospha ignited upon contact with the stormtrooper armor, causing the detonite inside to explode. If fired at an unarmored target, the slugs functioned as normal as soft organic matter was not enough to set off the phospha."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
