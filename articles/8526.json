By the year 0 ABY, it had become famous across the galaxy for its ability to make Human ears bleed after just a few notes. The music was thereby regulated outside of its native system. In 0 ABY, the Rebel Alliance-affiliated droid R2-D2 broadcast a recording of the Aridinian music as a distraction, allowing his companions\u2014Leia Organa, Han Solo, and Chewbacca\u2014to escape from the rogue Imperial Commander Rezi Soresh. However, another of R2-D2's compatriots, Luke Skywalker, stayed behind to continue his masquerade as Soresh's assassin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aridinian folk music was used as a distraction in one scene in Alex Wheeler's 2010 book Rebel Force: Uprising. After the release of Wheeler's book, Aridinia system was added to Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion. Although no explicit link had been made between the folk music and the system, its inclusion in the reference material provided its home. The music was also referenced in Slugthrowers: An Overview of Popular Music and Musicians in a Galaxy Far, Far Away, a StarWars.com Blog released in November 2013 and written by Edward M.
