In 14 BBY, she served onboard the Carrion Spike, the personal ship of Governor Wilhuff Tarkin, during a journey from the Imperial construction project Sentinel Base to the planet Coruscant. Once the ship entered hyperspace, Tarkin carried out an impromptu inspection of the crew and deduced that one crew member, Ensign Baz, was a spice user. The Governor then commanded the officer to confine Baz to his quarters for the remainder of the flight and contact Commander Cassel on Sentinel Base to inform him that spice use had become a problem on the base and an inspection should be made to confiscate the illicit material. She wore a standard Imperial uniform."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The officer first appeared, but was not named, in Tarkin, a novel written by James Luceno and released in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
