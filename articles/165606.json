They had a large head with fanged mouth, six eyes, and large protruding ears that could pick up signals of prey from a distance. Their body appeared somewhat humanoid in that it had a torso, with two thin arm and leg appendages. From the back of the arms were two wings which provided them with the ability to fly. There were two more wing-like formations protruding from each leg. These \"wings\" did not appear to be critical to the xandu's ability to fly.\nThey would snatch prey in their talons, and dash it against rocks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their search for an antidote to the Blue Shadow Virus, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker encountered a xandu while climbing down a cliff wall to obtain reeksa root, the key ingredient.
