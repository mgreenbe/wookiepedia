The feature began in Star Wars Adventure Journal 3 in an article by Paul Sudlow. Each \"Galaxywide NewsNets\" article is supposed to be \"a selection of newsfeeds culled from NewsNets major and minor throughout the Empire, which may or may not prove to be factual.\" The original article explains how news works in the Star Wars galaxy and gives advice on incorporating newsfeeds into roleplaying campaigns. Later Galaxywide NewsNet articles consist solely of newsfeeds with no game-specific commentary. These newsfeeds begin contemporaneous with the events depicted in A New Hope and progress a few months with each successive Journal issue. Some other West End Games products, such as The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook, included in-universe newsfeeds as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "News agencies from which the newsfeeds are supposed to come include:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each newsfile includes a line of code providing information about the source of the file. For instance, the article \"Jatz Musician Roi Debuts New Slug\" includes the code [37:8:14/GLR/J25L/GRC.4.ARC/ENT/T. Marelle]. The first part is the date, in year:month:day format, with the year zeroed against the Great ReSynchronization; in this case, day 14 of the eighth month of year 37 after the ReSynchronization. The second part of the code indicates the newsfeed - in this case, GLR for Galactic Resorts. The next part, J25L, involves information not clearly established at this point. Next is the location where the feed originated, including system, numerical position of planet in system, and city on that planet; thus, GRC.4.ARC indicates that the article originated in the city of Arcopola on the fourth planet of the Greccia system. Next is the general topic of the article, in this case, \"ENT\" for entertainment; other departments include \"GEN\" for general, \"MIL\" for military, \"ECO\" for economy, \"TRD\" for trade, and \"POL\" for politics. Last comes the name of the author; in this case, Tanda Marelle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The newsfeeds include:"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 3"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 4"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 5"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 6"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 7"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 8"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 9"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 10"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 11"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 12"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 13"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars Adventure Journal 14"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Operation: Elrood"}]}
