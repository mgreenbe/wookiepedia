When the 204th then retreated from Chadawa, the Unyielding pursuing the fighter wing's starships.

The colonel contacted the 204th, which had suffered a devastating attack which saw the death of Nuress.

Madrighast's forces then encountered multiple blockades and after two weeks had sustained great losses. Believing Sloane's force were no longer waiting for him, Madrighast and the Unyielding took refuge at Chadawa, an ancient manmade ocean planet, protected by a cage of mechanic rings, whose government had parted ways with the Empire since the Battle of Endor.

The Unyielding and the Chadawan navy subsequently awaited the 204th in orbit of the ocean planet, hiding behind cage of mechanical planetary rings enclosing Chadawa. The Imperial fighter wing and its support vessels, including its carrier the bulk freighter Yadeez, then engaged the Unyielding and the other Chadawan navy starships.

The Unyielding and the other Chadawan navy ships descended deep into the atmosphere of Chadawa and then regrouped to repair at the upper atmosphere on the far side of the planet to the 204th. The Imperial fighter wing ran reconnaissance and strike missions, being cautious of Madrighast's vessels, before beginning to sabotage and bring down Chadawa's satellite rings to bring radiation onto the planet.

The Deliverance shared its firepower between both of Syndulla's opponents, and Syndulla reached out to Madrighast, trying to win his side. The Unyielding, though, did not yield, and both Star Destroyers began circling eachother, exchanging laserfire. Madrighast's destroyer received a large amount of damage to its combat center, and the 204th's starships escaped into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Unyielding continued to fire on the Deliverance, the Syndulla called on the Imperial Star Destroyer to surrender. Madrighast declined her offer, fearing the New Republic would only imprison him and his people. The Unyielding thus accelerated towards the Deliverance on a collision course, firing its weapons. In response, Syndulla had her destroyer divert all power to its weapons and showered Madrighast's vessel with laserfire, destroying its remaining deflector dome. Despite losing function of its weapons, the Unyielding continued to advance as enemy fire tore through its hull, shredding the Star Destroyer apart and killing all aboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Unyielding was first mentioned in the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, the first volume of Alexander Freed's Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron trilogy.
