The sworn enemy of the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village, she once stole from them a powerful artifact, the Sunstar-Shadowstone, believing that it would help her conquer the forest moon. During the theft, she was opposed by the Ewok Logray, and, amused by his antics, she brought the Ewok back to her fortress on Mount Thunderstone to act as her servant. However, this proved to be her undoing, as before she could use the artifact, the stone was broken in half by her Ewok servant. Logray escaped the witch's lair with the light half of the stone, the \"Sunstar,\" and used the powers he had learned from watching Morag to protect Bright Tree Village. Morag held a personal grudge against the Ewok shaman, and constantly sought revenge, hoping to destroy the Ewoks and gain possession of the other half of the stone. With the dark side of the artifact, the Shadowstone, embedded in her magical staff, Morag menaced the Ewoks for nearly two hundred local years. Although Morag sometimes won minor victories over the Ewoks, Logray was able to keep his people from total destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3 ABY, Morag implemented a number of plots to destroy Bright Tree Village, enlisting the aid of local Phlogs for some and coercing the Duloks into helping with others. During this time, she was often foiled by the efforts of the Ewok Wicket Wystri Warrick and his friends, who kept Morag from any lasting success. However, she eventually found her chance to confront Logray by exploiting the carelessness of the young Ewok children. Kidnapping Wicket and his friends, Teebo, Latara, and Princess Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, she ransomed the group in exchange for the Sunstar. In a confrontation at her lair, Morag overpowered the Ewok shaman, obtaining the Sunstar and finally reuniting the two broken halves. However, the resulting power surge collapsed her fortress, and activated the volcano within Mount Thunderstone. Only the power of the Sunstar saved Morag from death, instead transforming her into an imposing lava creature. As Morag attempted to finish off her old nemesis, Logray activated a geyser of water, freezing Morag into a statue of stone. With one final attempt to destroy the Ewoks, Morag lunged for Logray but collapsed into a pile of rubble."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morag was born on the Forest Moon of Endor more than two centuries before the Battle of Yavin. Like most Tulgah, Morag had a preoccupation with the pursuit of magic, attempting to increase her own powers. However, unlike others of her species, who used their knowledge to become great healers, Morag twisted her powers for evil, hoping to conquer the forest moon. Using her dark arts, Morag enslaved many creatures to her will. Among her servants was an enormous winged creature, known as a mantigrue, who did her bidding. Morag and her pets resided in a precariously located fortress on the peak of Mount Thunderstone, a dormant volcano. Morag's lair and the surrounding area were protected by Yuzzum guards, who rode rakazzak beasts across the devastated wasteland."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morag was a devotee of the Night Spirit, and as such, other species that professed fealty to the dark deity looked up to Morag, occasionally visiting her realm to ask for her aid. In particular, the Duloks would prostrate themselves before Morag, requesting local remedies for their ailments. Morag helped these creatures in order to secure favors for the future, but she generally looked down upon them as incompetent and foul, often lording her formidable powers over them. In this fashion, Morag became generally feared by the peoples of Endor, who tried to avoid her presence."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Theft of the Sunstar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Morag came into contact with the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village. The Ewoks were in possession of an incredibly powerful artifact known as the Sunstar-Shadowstone. Knowing the impressive capabilities behind the stone, the Ewoks hid the artifact, never using it. However, even with their precautions, Morag sought out the Sunstar-Shadowstone, using her mantigrue to attack the village. After grabbing the stone, Morag left the village on top her winged beast. Although seemingly unopposed in her theft, one Ewok, Logray, stepped forth to oppose her. As the mantigrue flew from the village, Logray grabbed onto its tail, which brought him back to Morag's sanctuary. Morag was amused by Logray's antics and decided to spare him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at her lair, Morag forced Logray into servitude, making him clean her fortress among other menial tasks. Unknown to Morag, Logray spent his time observing and learning from her. After mastering her magic, Logray was able to turn it against Morag, hitting her with a large blast of energy. The attack broke the Sunstar-Shadowstone into two pieces. Logray snatched up the Sunstar and escaped from the mountain stronghold back to Bright Tree Village. Morag was infuriated over this turn of events; without the other half of the stone, the artifact's power was significantly weakened. However, Morag still retained possession of the Shadowstone, which she attached to her staff. This conflict led to an obsessive grudge, with Morag continually trying to get revenge on Logray by threatening his village, hoping to reacquire the other half of the stone."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sunberry tree plot"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of Morag's attempts to threaten the village revolved around the removal of the village's sunberry trees. The sunberries that were produced by these trees were an important part of the Ewoks' diet, helping them overcome ailments. Morag sent her mantigrue to destroy the sunberry trees, depriving the village of the important fruit. Without the trees, many of the Ewoks became ill until they were able to replant new trees. In order to prevent Morag from using the same plot once more, Logray devised a method to hide the trees from the mantigrue by covering them in shadowroot soap, which made the trees invisible. To warn future generations of the mantigrue's attack and the effect it had had on the village, the Ewoks recorded the first destruction of the sunberry trees in a scroll kept within Logray's hut, within the village."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point around this time, Morag came into contact with the Sanyassan Marauders. The Sanyassans' General Yavid negotiated with Morag to ensure that she would not attack their territory.

Morag gathered the skeleton of the Kreegon and brought it back to her lair. However, in order to reanimate the corpse, Morag required the eye of the beast. Chirpa's father had brought the eye to the village as a trophy, and so Morag formulated a plan to steal the artifact. To distract the Ewoks from the theft, Morag conjured a storm with her staff. With strong winds and lightning forming above the village, Morag sent two of her servants to infiltrate the Ewoks' community and find the eye. As a further effort to distract the Ewoks, Morag sent a vision of her face above the village. Through the conjured image, Morag conversed with Chirpa and Logray, taunting them over their impending doom. Logray prepared to banish the image from the village, but before he could, Morag's face disappeared, confident that her thieves had completed their job. Upon Morag's disappearance, the Ewoks discovered the theft. Surmising Morag's plan, Chirpa mounted a bordok and made his way toward the Tulgah witch's lair."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at her stronghold, Morag waited for her thieves, hoping for their quick return. When her servants returned with the eye, Morag hurried to the depths of her lair, where she had stashed the skeleton. Upon placing the eye within the Kreegon's lifeless corpse, the beast reformed, even regaining its flesh. Using her staff, Morag exerted her control over the Kreegon, bringing it outside of her fortress, ready to send it on a mission to destroy Bright Tree Village. However, upon her departure from the mountain, she witnessed Chirpa leading his bordok toward her home. Amused by Chirpa's tactics, Morag appeared behind the Ewok chief, taunting him for coming to her abode. Although Chirpa dismissed her threats, Morag summoned the Kreegon, ready to do battle with the Ewok warrior. Chirpa's bordok fled from the scene, but Chirpa readied his spear to kill the beast and thus emulate his father. However, upon throwing his weapon, the spear bounced harmlessly off the Kreegon. Morag laughed loudly at the Chief's attempt, claiming that the Kreegon could not be harmed while she was controlling it. As Chirpa prepared to meet death, Morag stopped the Kreegon from finishing off the Ewok. Despite the Ewok's claims that he would never ask for mercy from the likes of her, Morag laughed at the Chief, claiming that she would not finish him off until the Kreegon had destroyed his village. Using her powers, Morag conjured up several vines to detain Chirpa, and she then sent her beast to rampage through the forest. Morag returned to her lair momentarily, but upon leaving her prisoner, the Ewoks Wicket Wystri Warrick and Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka arrived and cut the Chief free. Morag laughed off the escape, knowing that her beast was still invincible and that Chirpa's freedom would make no difference to her overall plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Morag's confidence proved to be premature. Chirpa and his charges led the Kreegon away from the village and toward the nearby Molten Sulfur Pits. Chirpa sent the creature plunging into the fiery sulfur, but its invincibility held true, and the Kreegon emerged from the pits covered in molten sulfur but still alive. Knowing that only Morag's powers could defeat the Kreegon, the Ewoks led the beast back to the Tulgah witch's lair. Chirpa confronted Morag, claiming that they had been able to destroy the Kreegon, taunting her into action. Morag did not believe the Ewok leader, but she responded to the insults, pointing her staff at the Ewoks. As Morag fired a blast from her staff at the group, they quickly dodged out of the way. However, the Kreegon had been slowly approaching the Ewoks at the same time. Although the blast missed Morag's enemies, it hit the Kreegon full in the face. Morag's magic destroyed the Kreegon's eye, transforming her beast back into its original skeletal form. Morag yelled her frustration while the skeleton of the Kreegon collapsed upon the Tulgah witch, pinning her to the floor of her fortress.

While residing in her fortress, Morag used her stone mirror to gaze out on the Ewoks; she spied Logray relaxing in a hot spring. Knowing that the old shaman had put down his guard, since he had neglected to bring his staff of power into the pool with him, Morag used her powers to freeze the water, trapping him. With Logray out of the way, Morag gathered one of her beasts and made her way toward Bright Tree Village."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unopposed, Morag strolled directly into the village alongside her beast. She quickly froze with her staff the Ewoks that tried to flee, preventing any sort of retreat. Confronting Chief Chirpa last, Morag conjured an image of Logray trapped away from the village, exclaiming that without their shaman, the Ewoks would now become her servants at her mountain fortress. However, Chirpa refused, stating that even her powers would not be enough to take them away from their forest. Convinced by Chirpa's confidence, Morag decided that if she could not take the Ewoks out of the forest, then she would take the forest away from the Ewoks. Using her staff, the Tulgah witch spawned a glowing thorn bush on the forest floor. As the bush rapidly grew, Morag claimed that the plant would quickly draw up all the moisture in the forest, depriving the environment of its much-needed water supply. To Morag's amusement, Chirpa accurately surmised the situation: without water, the forest would soon be dead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wile Morag's plant rapidly grew, two of the Ewoks, Wicket and Kneesaa, decided to escape the imprisoned village and rescue Logray. Although Morag's pet beast attempted to stop them, they were able to incapacitate the creature by pouring honey on it. Furious that her minion had failed to stop the Ewoks from escaping the village, Morag commanded her beast to pursue them, lest she turn him into a grub toad. Although the creature hastened to obey, the two Ewok children defeated the creature yet again. The Ewoks then made their way to Logray's position. Still trapped in the pool, Logray told the Ewoks to take his staff back to the village and place it at the plant's base in order to destroy it. When the Ewoks returned to their village, Morag became infuriated that another one of her plans was in danger of falling apart. To prevent the destruction of her plant, Morag used her powers to fly above the glowing bush, transforming it from a simple plant into an anthropomorphic beast. Since the plant was now mobile, it could easily evade the staff's power, rendering Logray's plan to destroy the creature useless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morag commanded her thorn monster to chase Wicket and Kneesaa as they fled through the forest. With each step of the creature, it absorbed more and more of the forest's water supply, slowly depriving the area of moisture. However, as the Ewoks made their escape, they devised a plan to destroy the creature. Remembering advice from Logray that giving a plant too much water could drown it, Wicket and Kneesaa made their way into a nearby lake. Although Morag initially believed that leading her monster into the lake would only allow her monster to become larger and stronger, she was soon proven wrong. The thorn monster began to swell considerably, expanding to an unstable size. To Morag's horror, the beast exploded violently, throwing Morag into the lake. The moisture released into the air upon the beast's destruction triggered a rain storm, which began to restore the water-deprived forest.

In the first, Morag infiltrated the Ewoks' sunberry-tree forest and tried to poison the berries with a potion, thus depriving the Bright Tree Village Ewoks of a staple food and starving them. The plot involved having her pet mantigrue pour the substance over the trees. Nevertheless, Logray made an antidote, which the Ewok tribe sprayed it over the berries. Morag thus attempted to spread the potion again herself. Nevertheless, she found that Logray had included in his antidote ingredient that irritated Morag's sinuses and kept her from breathing. Her plot foiled, she fled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On a later occasion, Morag discovered Bright Tree Village's children painting pictures on a cave wall for their Youth Pictorial Exposition. She sneaked into the cave and painted over the artwork with a potion that erased the paintings, an act she found to represent utmost evil.

With the forests of Endor experiencing a severe drought, Morag planned to set the forest ablaze, destroying the Ewoks' valued Soul Trees and the Ewoks themselves. In order to do this, Morag sent her Yuzzum servants on rakazzak beasts to capture several of the local Wisties, also known as the firefolk. Although the Yuzzum were unable to capture a Wistie, they stirred up the population enough that Morag was able to personally capture the Wistie queen, Izrina. Morag and her minions made their way back to her lair, intent on transforming the Wistie Queen into her instrument for destroying the forests. However, midway through the procedure, her Yuzzum guards brought in in the Dulok shaman Umwak, who wished to procure a bug bite cure from the Tulgah witch. Irritated by the Dulok's intrusion, Morag nonetheless allowed the shaman to witness her plan, transforming Queen Izrina into a literal carrier of fire, a curse that would pass from Wistie to Wistie, causing them to carry the fire into the dried-up foliage of the forest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using Umwak to carry the newly transformed Wistie Queen, Morag made her way to the top of her mountain and released Izrina. Just as she had planned, the Wistie passed on the fire-bringing ability to her subjects. The literal firefolk created a massive forest fire that threatened to destroy the Ewoks. From her lair, Morag witnessed the destruction and worked to oppose any efforts to quench the flames. When the Ewoks banded together to bring water from a river, Morag led her Yuzzum servants in damming the river so that the Ewoks would be unable to use its water supply. However, even without the water, the Ewoks were able to employ a magic foam created by Logray that not only doused the flames but also removed the curse from the tainted Wisties. Just as it seemed that Morag's plan would be defeated, the Tulgah witch conjured a strong wind, which forced several of the still-infected Wisties down onto the Ewoks, destroying the catapult that they were using in conjunction with the magic foam. However, even Morag's best efforts could not stop the effectiveness of the magic foam, and several of the Ewoks, including Wicket, Kneesaa, Paploo, and Teebo, used their hang gliders to stop the worst of the fires. Morag was infuriated over the failure of another of her plans, and as she came to terms with her failure, she was attacked by the Wisties, who had now been cleansed of her curse. The firefolk dropped a sack of magic foam upon the Tulgah witch to repay Morag for the dark magic she had performed upon them.

After sending her beast out on a passing run, the mantigrue returned to Morag's lair with two sunberry trees, filled with fruit that was ripe for the picking. Morag knew that the trees would soon be harvested by the Ewoks, and so any attack on the plants would need to be done soon. Deciding to wait for the following morning to send her pet out on a new mission, Morag let the mantigrue sleep within the confines of her mountain. However, this delay allowed the Ewoks to coat their sunberry trees in shadowroot soap, making the plants invisible.

Using the power of her staff, Morag hypnotized the child, allowing the Yuzzum and their rakazzak beasts to carry the young Phlog away in a net. Before the Phlogs had noticed the theft of their child, Morag planted several Ewok hoods and weapons near the area. When the Phlogs went searching for Nahkee, they discovered the Ewok evidence, and just as Morag had planned, they surmised that the Ewoks had stolen their young son.

After passing the Phlog off on the Duloks, Morag made her way to Bright Tree Village to witness the rampage of the Phlog family. The Ewoks had prepared armaments to deal with the large creatures, but their defenses proved useless. However, just as one of the Phlogs was about to knock down one of the main support trees of the village, the Ewok children Wicket, Kneesaa, Teebo, and Latara arrived with the young Nahkee in tow. Upon seeing their child, the Phlog family immediately broke off their attack. The Duloks, who had accidentally allowed the Phlog to escape, confronted the Ewoks, intent on reclaiming their captive. The action signified to the Phlogs that the Duloks were to blame for keeping their child from them, and they attacked, driving the Duloks all the way back to their swamp. Morag was infuriated by the Dulok King's incompetence, and she tracked down Gorneesh and his shaman Umwak to punish them.

She could manipulate the foliage on the forest moon to work for her. During the rejuvenation of the Kreegon, Morag summoned vines from the ground to restrain Chief Chirpa, making him her prisoner. Morag would use this same power right before her death when she captured Logray in the same manner. Her grandest feat regarding manipulating plant life was her creation and transformation of a mutated thorn bush, which began to remove all the water from the forest floor. Morag eventually manipulated the plant to give it a humanoid shape so that it could chase the Ewoks across the forest moon. However, for all her skill with plants, Morag failed to realize that too much water could kill a plant, which resulted in the death of her thorn monster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morag first appeared in the opening episode of the Ewoks television show, \"The Cries of the Trees,\" written by Paul Dini. She appeared in three following episodes, serving as the main antagonist in each one. Her death in \"Sunstar vs. Shadowstone\" was Morag's last appearance in the series, but she made two further appearances in the Marvel Ewoks comic line. Her appearances in the comics, set before her death in the television show, served to illustrate further attempts that Morag had made in trying to destroy the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village. Morag was voiced by Jackie Burroughs throughout her television appearances. The character also appeared in two installments of the MyComyc series of comic books, which were published in 1986 in Spanish by Editorial Gepsa. The short stories incorrectly use masculine pronouns to refer to the witch. When the comic strips resurfaced in 2013, Dark Horse Comics editor Rich Handley and Lucasfilm Ltd. were unable to determine whether they had been officially licensed or were unauthorized. Nevertheless, Star Wars writer Abel G. Pe\u00f1a translated the strips for release on the StarWars.com website. He corrected the original script to refer to Morag as a female."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Wars Encyclopedia describes Morag as having the face of a mandrill, perhaps indicating that Morag was designed with this type of monkey involved. Morag is a common Gaelic name, meaning \"The Great One.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morag's powers in Star Wars: Ewoks are usually explained as a type of magic, and the presence of the Force is not explicitly mentioned in the cartoon. However, explanations of Ewok magic in reference works, such as the Databank entry for Charal, refer to these magical powers as projections of the Force. The Hyperspace article Castaways of Endor clarified that all the ritualistic magic shown in Star Wars: Ewoks is, in fact, performed through the use of the Force. Since Morag uses her magic for dark purposes, described as \"black magic\" in the Star Wars Encyclopedia, this article implies that she wields the dark side of the Force. According to Leland Chee's definition of a Dark Jedi\u2014\"anyone who practices the dark side of the Force whether or not they were a former Jedi\"\u2014Morag falls into this category."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An action figure of Morag was planned for the Star Wars: Ewoks toy line, but the figure never got past the prototype phase.
