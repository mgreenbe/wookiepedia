It was composed of two dreadnaughts, many frigates and gunships, two starfighters squadrons and 3,000 soldiers. The regiment struck a mining facility in a Wild Space system, but Lorka, a Hutt crime lord, hired a rival mercenary fleet to attack Reog's fleet in retaliation. He and his regiment were then hired by Grruna Thu, Gamorrean leader of the Shrook Clan, to attack the Hakks, a rival clan, in retaliation for destroying their outpost on Gamorr.
