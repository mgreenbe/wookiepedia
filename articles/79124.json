As they walk inside, a young child who had snuck away from an orphanage by shipping himself in a box, emerges from the ship, and joins the group on their tour. Meanwhile, Asajj Ventress is also in the Senate Building, having just stolen secret battle plans with the intention of delivering them to Palpatine and plan an attack on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on the tour, the young child, now known as \"Ian\" stirs up trouble, causing C-3PO, R2-D2 and the rest of the younglings to flee into space, where they find themselves in the middle of a battle between Republic and Confederate forces. While avoiding destruction, they accidentally end up on Obi-Wan's Hyperdrive docking ring sending them to Tatooine. Meanwhile, Yoda and Commander Cody battle with Ventress and a small group of battle droids. Ventress is captured but a battle droid escapes with the plans, causing Yoda and Cody to pursue. While in space, it is revealed that Ian had sneaked aboard Yoda and Cody's ship. The droid ship is tracked to Hoth, where Yoda and Ian go after the plans. In the cold, they find a Tauntaun for shelter where they encounter the battle droid with the plans.

After heading to Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, C-3PO sneaks into it in the hopes of finding a ride, disguised in a cloak so he is not seen as a droid. Meanwhile, the younglings are mistaken for the cantina band. When C-3PO is seen to be a droid, the group is captured and sent to Jabba the Hutt, where the younglings are caged and C-3PO has to fight R2-D2 for Jabba's amusement. After encouragement from the younglings (and a few mind tricks), the two droids help free the children and attempt to escape Jabba's custody. However, they are stopped by the Rancor. Soon after, they are rescued by Ian and Yoda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Everyone arrives on Coruscant where they are rewarded for bravery.
