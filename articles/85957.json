The orbit of the small world was the second closest to its sun, Tythos, of all the planetary bodies in the star system, and it was near to the orbital path of Sunspot, the first planet of the system. The two worlds rotated around their common star in opposite directions, however. Scientists speculated that Malterra had originated in the Tython system, as opposed to Sunspot, which was thought to be a rogue planetoid that had been captured by the gravitational pull of Tythos. Malterra experienced violent storms when it passed Sunspot in its orbit, and the climate on the small planet was extremely hot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the non\u2013Force-sensitive settlers of Tython\u2014the fifth planet of the system\u2014traveled to its neighboring worlds more than a millennium after the year 36,453 BBY, they colonized Malterra. By 25,793 BBY, mining operations had been established on the planet, which were made possible by the use of environment suits. In that year, Ketu\u2014a Temple Master of the mystic Je'daii Order\u2014told the Padawan learners Harun and Resi the history of the Tython system, and mentioned the colonization of Malterra, amid other events."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Malterra was first pictured in the entry for Tython in The Holonet feature of the official website for Star Wars: The Old Republic\u2014a 2011 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by BioWare. The planetoid was depicted in a schematic of the Tython system. Since its establishment in 2008, The Old Republic's website has gone through a number of changes, resulting in the removal of some of the features and images that were originally located there, including the aforementioned schematic. Malterra's name and additional information on it were provided in Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi 0, a preview issue of the Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi series of comic books. The issue was published on February 1, 2012, and was written by John Ostrander and penciled by Jan Duursema. The small world was also mentioned in the first issue of the series, which was published on February 15 of the same year."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
