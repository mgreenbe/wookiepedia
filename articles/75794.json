When Order 66 was initiated by Darth Sidious at the end of the Clone Wars, Khandra went into hiding in a Jedi shrine on Anoat accompanied by three others, Mususiel, Zubain Ankonori, and Nuhj.

With both Mususiel and Ankonori slain by the Inquisitor, Khandra lost her sense of identity as a Jedi, being forced to live in hiding and scrounge for food. At some point, the Inquisitor returned and killed both Khandra and Nuhj in a fight at a chromium mine near Wickridge.
