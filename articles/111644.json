It had an operational range of one hundred light-years. The transceiver was capable of monitoring over three hundred different subspace channels at a time. Due to the fact it could alter channels every tenth of a second, the Ranger could scan the entire subspace spectrum in less than three hours. The powerful com-scan encryption computer was capable of decoding most intercepted messages in a matter of minutes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
