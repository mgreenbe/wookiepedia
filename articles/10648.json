As she was Force-sensitive, Aurora was taken by the Jedi Order for training, an action her uncle likened to an abduction. Arkoh Adasca never contacted her after she was taken, nor did Jedi Master Lucien Draay\u2014a family friend of the Adascas\u2014ever see her again, either. Aurora eventually became a Jedi scout and traveled to the planet Serroco to assist the Revanchist movement, which aimed to involve the whole Order in the ongoing Mandalorian Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. After Serroco was razed by the Mandalorians in 3963 BBY, Aurora was left unaccounted for. As she was the sole remaining heir to the House of Adasca after her uncle was killed, her disappearance enabled investors of the Draay Trust to bid for the takeover of the Adasca Corporation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aurora was first mentioned in a scene in the 2007 comic book Knights of the Old Republic 19, written by John Jackson Miller.
