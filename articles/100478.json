That year, an Oodoc was at the Crystal Jewel casino on Coruscant when explosions rocked the Imperial Palace nearby. The shockwave threatened to collapse the ceiling of the casino, so many of the patrons tried to flee. However, the Oodoc pulled shut the door, believing it was safer to stay inside. Han Solo, a hero of the New Republic, was at the Crystal Jewel at the same time. Fearing the explosion might block escape from the underground casino, he shoved the Oodoc aside, shooting the door lock with his blaster. While the blaster bolt did break the lock, it also deflected into the back of the Oodoc. The large being tried to grab Solo but missed when the Human was carried away in a tide of escaping patrons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later that year, a number of Oodocs were present on Skip 1, an asteroid located in Smuggler's Run, an asteroid belt on the edge of Wild Space that had harbored smugglers and other criminal elements for hundreds of years. A number of droids detonated throughout the asteroid, injuring many sentients. Among them were several Oodocs who had their spikes blown off. These injured Oodocs were loaded aboard the Lady Luck\u2014a pleasure yacht owned by the Human gambler Lando Calrissian, who was visiting the Run as part of an investigation for Han Solo\u2014and flown out of the asteroid field to receive medical care."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Those two explosions were linked: Kueller, a dictator on the planet Almania, had rigged explosives in hundreds of droids to kill senators on Coruscant as part of his plan to destabilize the New Republic and take control for himself.
