Highly-skilled in terrain-following flying, the entire flightknife flew into enemy airspace at low altitude to avoid detection from the series of lightbounce sensors that guarded the border to Cartann. They then set themselves up in deep cover beneath the projected engagement zone. Before the start of the battle, they let loose a volley of missiles into the clustered Cartann flightknives which were flying in formation, effectively taking out multiple fighters per missile in the first few seconds of action."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later when Colonel Tycho Celchu was shot down during the aerial fighting, he was picked up Blastpike Ten and joined Red Flight, which was making its way into Cartann City to retrieve their impounded X-wings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
