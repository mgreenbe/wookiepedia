His shop gladly accepted any members of society, no matter their race, gender, class or rank. This clinic also had a secret room of Kolto Tanks, where Zelka secretly kept Republic soldiers alive for as long as possible. Of course if the Sith found out about this, his clinic would be shut down instantly, so the room was locked tight, and only Revan found its location. Zelka also had an assistant named Gurney, who secretly worked for the Exchange."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
