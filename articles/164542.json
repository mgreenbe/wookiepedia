By 0 BBY, the Unar-Con container tug was so dilapidated that Barso wore an orange vac-suit at all times because of his distrust of the ship's life support system. Nevertheless, in addition to cargo-hauling, he also smuggled refugees out of Jedha City to the freighters orbiting the moon with his ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
