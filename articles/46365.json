He, alongside F-29-PSKx, were the only F series droids in the ride to not be identified by name on the \"Spot the Droid\" posters or in Complete Guide to Star Tours, being instead only identified as \"Spacecap Droid\" and \"Passenger Droid,\" respectively. In Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, the ride's sequel, a modified F-25 has now been moved further inside the queue, though his name is no longer visible. The droid and two others have been posed in a similar manner to a trio of ghosts seen at the end of the Haunted Mansion ride in various Disney theme parks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
