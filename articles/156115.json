In 22 BBY, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, went missing during the Battle of Bothawui. Skywalker, along with his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the Jedi Knight's replacement astromech droid R3-S6, and Captain CT-7567, eventually tracked R2-D2 to Skytop Station, a Confederate listening post orbiting the moon Ruusan 2.
