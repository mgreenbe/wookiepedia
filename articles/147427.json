It was located in between four profitable madilon mines and contained a madilon ore processing facility, It also had a smelting facility, which allowed the Guild to cast the ore into madilon ingots before them shipping off Nyriaan, which saved the Guild money in the long run. However, waste and contaminants from Tonnage were dumped in the surrounding areas, causing an ecological disaster that led to the creation of a wasteland. As a result, the native Nyriaanans viewed the settlement as a blight on the landscape and believed that it would eventually have to be dealt with."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
