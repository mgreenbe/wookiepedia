In all of these reference guides, Mikos Denari is simply listed as a Tatooinian townsperson. The Quick Reference Guide identifies Denari as a level 10 non-player character, while the other two identify Denari as a level 8 NPC. The Total Experience guide further identifies Denari as an individual skilled in melee combat, while the Complete Guide notes that Denari was unarmed. Despite being listed in these reference guides, Miko Denari is not definitively known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. The reference guides do not elaborate on Denari's species or gender, nor any quests Denari may have been associated with. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game. The tree files also contain dialogue for two quests which would have required that the player kill Tusken Raiders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
