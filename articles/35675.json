The error caused Emperor Palpatine to be placed at the top of the public list of loan-defaulters in Imperial City for two hours. Fearing retribution, Daykim, along with his loyal staff and their families fled into the undercity as Imperial agents searched for the person who had been responsible for the erroneous posting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The refugees settled in an abandoned office building and made Daykim their leader. The people of Daykim's Kingdom adapted to life in the undercity. They managed to fashion spring-loaded traps suitable for catching animals for food and used old generators to surreptitiously tap into Imperial City's power grid. To keep an eye out for any unwanted company\u2014be it a group of Imperial soldiers that had finally discovered their location or the odd hawk-bat\u2014the citizens of Daykim's Kingdom managed to throw together a system of surveillance devices and kept a large number of sentries posted at all times."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As time passed, the Empire fell and the New Republic rose in its place.

He turned down an offer to relocate his community from Minister of State Leia Organa Solo, stating that he and his people had decided that he and his people preferred the freedom of life in the undercity to what they viewed as the bureaucratic dullness of life on Coruscant's surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
