Its functioning was known to a Rakata known as Failsafe who was kept in stasis to aid in restoring the system if it was ever compromised. During the Cold War, the Esh-kha Gore Claw led his warriors in a mission to free the World Razer which saw a Galactic Republic official being charged with activating the Burning Way. Before activating the device, the Republic representative was confronted by the World Razer who offered advanced Rakatan technology in exchange for being allowed to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
