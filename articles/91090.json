Bane eventually conceded and led Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu to his base of operations, Black Stall Station, in the Rogue Antar system. The bounty hunter held the holocron and Kyber memory crystal, which contained a list of every force-sensitive child in the galaxy, in the station, and promised the Jedi its safe return. Their mission to Black Stall Station was actually a trap laid out by Bane to ensure his own escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon entry to the station, Windu accidentally caused the security system to go off, and several laser cannons emerged from the station's walls. In the ensuing confusion, Bane escaped the station via an escape pod hidden behind an emergency hatch. Kenobi managed to retrieve the holocron and escape with Windu before the station's self destruct mechanism went off. Though Bane managed to escape, the holocron was safely retrieved with no indication that its contents had been duplicated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The de facto leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious\u2014secretly Sheev Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic\u2014began relying on Cad Bane, who was considered to be the most efficient gun for hire in the galaxy. Following his success in the Sith's assignment to steal both a Jedi holocron from the Jedi Temple and the Kyber memory crystal, a list of every known Force-sensitive child in the galaxy, from the Jedi Master Bolla Ropal on Devaron, Bane was once again hired by Sidious to kidnap four of the children listed in the memory crystal and bring them to his facility on the volcanic mining world Mustafar. Bane succeeded in capturing the Nautolan Zinn Toa on the aquatic world Glee Anselm and the Rodian Wee Dunn on Rodia, despite Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi's efforts to save the child. The Jedi Order took the necessary precautions to save the Gungan Roo-Roo Page on Naboo, Bane's next target, leading Bane into a trap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Duros bounty hunter was captured on Naboo, he and his starfighter, the Xanadu Blood, were taken to the Republic ship Resolute; the hunter was placed in a shielded holding cell, while his starfighter was examined by the Jedi. Interrogated by Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu, Bane refused to reveal the whereabouts of the kidnapped children and the location of a stolen Jedi holocron. The two Masters and Anakin Skywalker bound together and employed the Force, the living force that binds all living creatures, to compel the strong-minded Bane to lead them to the stolen holocron. Thrashing from his attempts at resisting the Jedi's influence, Bane eventually promised to take them to the holocron, albeit with the intention of leading them into a trap. The bound bounty hunter was escorted into a waiting T-6 shuttle, where he dictated the coordinates of the deep space Black Stall Station, his base of operations, to his accompanying guards\u2014Kenobi, Windu, and Clone Commander CC-2224, nicknamed \"Cody.\" Though Anakin wanted to take part in the mission, he was instead ordered to report the Jedi's progress to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After emerging in the asteroid\u2013strewn system and docking to the outpost, the Jedi left Cody with the ship and followed Bane into his base of operations. Though neither Jedi sensed the kidnapped infants, Bane told them that the children were \"safe\" and instead focused on the holocron. The Duros led them to the station's control room and pointed them to the holocron on a table across the room. Although Bane volunteered to get the holocron for them, Windu refused to let the bounty hunter perform another trick. However, Windu unintentionally activated the station's intruder alert system. With alarms blaring and a laser system targeting the Jedi, Bane sneaked away from the distracted Kenobi and Windu, while the two were occupied. Kenobi pursued the bounty hunter, but the Duros escaped through a concealed hatch. Breaking out of his binders, Bane fled Black Stall Station in an escape pod. Meanwhile, Kenobi managed to retrieve the holocron and both Jedi Master managed to make their way back to the shuttle and depart just before the station exploded as a result of a self-destruct."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Cad Bane managed to slip out of the facility during the skirmish, the holocron and Kyber crystal were retrieved.
