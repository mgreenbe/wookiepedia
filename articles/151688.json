The ancient library, which was built to hold the founding texts of the Jedi Order, was made in the hollowed-out trunk of an uneti tree. Chirrut \u00cemwe, a member of the Guardians of the Whills, had a staff made from its wood. The Great Tree which grew at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant was also a uneti tree, one that possessed a strong connection to the Force. During the High Republic Era, Jedi Master Wishan created incense using the petals that blossomed from the Great Tree on Coruscant which Stellan Gios found invaluable to use during Meditation. By the time of the Clone Wars, the tree was generations old."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Uneti tree was first identified in the Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, written by Pablo Hidalgo and published by DK Publishing on December 15, 2017.
