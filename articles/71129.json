The Jinzler parents worked at the Temple itself, as maintenance engineers on the electrical equipment. They adored and honored the Jedi, and took each of their children in to be tested for potential Force sensitivity. The third Jinzler child, Lorana, was accepted for Jedi training at the age of 10 months. The fourth child, Dean, was a gifted engineer, and would later visit the site of his sister's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Family tree"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
