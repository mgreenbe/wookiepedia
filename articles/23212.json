At ten meters in height and thirty meters in length, the canyon krayt represented the smaller of the krayt species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An evolved hunter, the four-legged canyon krayt possessed a yellow-brown camouflage skin pattern, a five-horned crown ridge and a spike-studded tail. They usually fed on womp rats, eopies, and lone banthas. Though it was not nearly as big as the greater krayt, it was big enough to cause destruction, yet small enough for a single Tusken Raider and his bantha to hunt down and kill. Like typical krayt dragons, they produced pearls, although the canyon krayt variety were typically a deep crimson color. Crimson pearls were quite valuable, often fetching upwards of one million credits each."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Red variant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There existed a variant of the canyon krayt that differed so much in appearance from the common canyon krayt to the point of appearing to be a different species altogether. The variant had a trio of large horns on its head that were apparently used for its own defense against such predators, such as the greater krayt dragon, as well as a tall, spined dorsal ridge running along its back. While this subspecies appeared to grow to sizes close to that of the canyon krayt, it was not as elongated, and instead featured a bulkier and more compact body. The variant species possessed large teeth and a powerful-looking jaw, as well as sharp claws that were likely used to take down prey such as dewbacks and banthas. Its reddish coloration may have helped it to blend in with its surroundings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
