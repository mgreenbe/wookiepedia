Due to the high gravity of their home planet, the reptilian Rigellians were very large-framed, dense, and heavily-muscled. This made them formidable foes on normal gravity planets, on which they were reportedly strong enough to tear apart vehicles and other metal objects. Rigellians sometimes were employed as assassins due to their impressive physical prowess. At the time of the Galactic Civil War, they were nearly extinct. The bounty hunter with the alias of Darth Vader's porter belonged to this species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
