Accordingly, the Khzzrys were assigned as backup in case Moor was apprehended. When Moor fell into the hands of TGM's security, the Khzzrys entered the headquarters on a rescue mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using their usual cover as family recruiters, the Khzzrys approached the security guards who were escorting Moor through the lobby of the headquarters. K'lial evaded the guards to put two of its left arms around Moor, claiming that the two Xi'Dec wished to invite Moor to join their family unit, and tried to lead him away to discuss matters in private. Via later surmised that K'lial probably slipped the codekeys to Basal's arm restraints out of the lead guard's pockets at this point."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The guards were confused by K'lial's matrimonial interest in a Human, not to mention the fact that K'lial and its spouse Diskio did not appear to be the same species either (though this was usually the case for Xi'Dec of different sexes.) Via presumed that during this conversation, K'lial freed Moor from his restraints."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the guards gave up on the conversation, and attempted to arrest both Xi'Dec. Diskio, however, had used a remote control unit to signal its ground speeder under the pretense of calling a matrimonial lawyer. The speeder crashed through the lobby window as Diskio pulled out two concealed blasters and began to lay down cover fire. The three Rebels entered the vehicle and made their getaway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the speeder drove out of the lobby, K'lial stuck its head out out the outer hatch and announced that Moor had accepted the \"proposal.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
