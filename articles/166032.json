The scout bomber was a small one pilot fighter that supported the presence of an astromech droid in a astromech socket. As the name suggests, the Y-wing was roughly oriented in the shape of a 'Y,' with a forward facing cockpit with two engines attached to the rear of it on either side. The starfighter boasted four laser cannons: two forward facing guns next to the cockpit, and a rear pair of guns attached to the astromech socket. The starfighter also featured a bomb bay so it could function as a bomber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to or during the standard year 3 BBY the Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus and the astromech droid C1-10P flew a scout bomber and discharged its weapons. This particular scout bomber had an off-white colored hull with yellow markings. The crest of Phoenix Cell, a facet of the rebellion, was painted on the rear of the cockpit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Y-wing scout bomber was an original creation of Hasbro Inc. that first appeared in their Star Wars: The Clone Wars toy line, which existed within the Star Wars Legends continuity.
