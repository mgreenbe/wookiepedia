He was in command of the blockade of Pantora, with the secret intention of forcing the moon to join the Separatist Alliance. To this end, he hired a bounty hunter to kidnap the daughters of Pantoran Supreme Chairman Notluwiski Papanoida to further pressure the Pantoran Assembly. One of the daughters, Che Amanwe was held hostage on his flagship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the blockade, he admitted Pantoran Senator Riyo Chuchi and her servant onto his ship to negotiate. However, the servant was in reality Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and their true mission was to rescue the Chairman's daughter. He confronted the three with a platoon of battle droids, but was defeated. In front of his own men, Canay confessed to Tano's accusations of conspiring with the Separatists, and he agreed to lift the blockade. After the incident was over, Senator Lott Dod distanced the Federation from Canay in the Senate, and said that his actions had been \"of his own accord,\" products of \"Nute Gunray's influence.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sib Canay first appeared in \"Sphere of Influence,\" the fourth episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' third season.
