Waris and his brother Sulale were veteran Car'das pilots. Circa 1 ABY, they were stationed in the Bright Jewel system and flew Z-95 Headhunters. During the Battle of Tansarii Point Station, the Kallor brothers were tasked by Aleas Rans'ery to scout enemy territory and find weaknesses in the Salient Trinity Black Sun bases. The brothers succeed in their mission but were attacked by Black Sun starfighters in the Bright Jewel Ribbon. Waris Kallor's ship was captured while Sulale managed to hyperspace out the area. Waris was finally rescued by Car'das starfighters dispatched by Rans'ery and returned to Tansarii Point Station. Car'das pilots then headed to Sulale Kallor's damaged ship and defended the Z-95 while Sulale performed repairs. Sulale Kallor finally returned to the Nova Orion Station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
