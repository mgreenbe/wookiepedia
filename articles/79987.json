Unlike similar guilds, such as the Corellian Merchants' Guild, the Lantillian Spacers' Brotherhood took on all spacer applicants, regardless of species or planet of origin. The members were generally independent traders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of the Lantillian Spacers' Brotherhood were entitled to certain benefits at guildhouses across the galaxy. These benefits included access to information and trade contacts, as well as somewhat discounted starship repairs, upgrades, and restocking."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lantillian Spacers' Brotherhood had significantly fewer members, guildhouses, and economic clout than its primary rival, the Corellian Merchants' Guild. As a result of this, the Lantillian Spacers' Brotherhood was more likely to be harassed by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. In order to avoid Imperial notice, guildhouses were forced to be generally law-abiding. This made smugglers less likely to join the Brotherhood, further reducing the membership. In general, only those independent traders who did not qualify for membership in the more powerful Corellian Merchants' Guild would join the Lantillian Spacers' Brotherhood."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
