Despite the humble background of the Naberrie family, Padm\u00e9 was identified early for her potential in public service. Devoting her life to civic duty, she was elected queen and, therefore, adopted the regnal name \"Amidala\" in 32 BBY. Due to the machinations of her advisor, Senator Sheev Palpatine, Amidala's reign was put to the test by the Trade Federation's blockade and subsequent invasion of Naboo. Unable to fight the Federation's army of battle droids without assistance, the queen beseeched the Galactic Senate on Coruscant for help, only to see her efforts hampered by bureaucracy and procedure. Although she ultimately liberated her homeworld with the help of the Jedi Order and the Gungan Grand Army, her decision to cast a Vote of No Confidence against Finis Valorum enabled Palpatine to become the Supreme Chancellor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following her reign, Amidala joined the Senate and struggled to resolve the Separatist Crisis through diplomacy, becoming a leading voice in the Loyalist Committee by 22 BBY. After surviving an assassination attempt, she was removed from the capital and sent back to Naboo under the protection of Padawan Anakin Skywalker. Though the Jedi Code forbade personal relationships, deeming attachment, and possession unbecoming of a Jedi, the two gradually became closer as their feelings for each other grew. In the aftermath of the First Battle of Geonosis, Amidala secretly married her Jedi protector, despite her own reservations about their relationship and the consequences they would face if the truth ever came to light. Their subsequent interactions were limited throughout the Clone Wars, with Amidala continuing to advocate peaceful solutions in the Senate while Skywalker served on the front lines as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic. In the waning months of the pan-galactic conflict, Amidala revealed to her husband that she was pregnant. As a result of Skywalker's fear of loss, he was seduced by the dark side of the Force, believing that by becoming a Sith Lord he would gain the power to prevent his wife from dying in childbirth. Amidala, who learned of her husband's transformation into a Sith, ultimately died of a broken heart after giving birth to the twins Luke Skywalker and Leia Amidala Skywalker. With her dying breath, she claimed that there was still good in the former Anakin Skywalker, who embraced the persona of Darth Vader throughout the reign of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidala's children played a major role in the fragmentation of the Empire and the redemption of her husband.

Luke, on the other hand, was trained in the ways of the Jedi like his father before him and was a celebrated war hero of the Rebel Alliance.

Her father was a friend of Senator Onaconda Farr, who represented the solar system of Rodia in the Senate of the Galactic Republic. Naberrie was very fond of the Rodian, whom she referred to as \"Uncle Ono.\" As a child, she traveled with her father on relief missions to offer aid to suffering planets. When Naberrie was seven, she traveled with her father to Shadda-Bi-Boran to help relocate the population in the wake of an ecological disaster. Unfortunately, the effort resulted in failure, as the Shadda-Bi-Boran could not adapt to their new homeworld.

Kelma commented on Karlinus' labor shortage, offering to hire Naboo workers to take seasonal jobs on the planet in addition to young students taking apprenticeships on her planet.

Gunray stated that he required her to sign a treaty before threatening her and ending the transmission. Amidala swiftly ordered Panaka to ready the Security Force to figure out what Gunray's angle was. After analyzing the proposed treaty, Amidala realized that the treaty was not even a serious attempt and was simply a document that signed away Naboo to Trade Federation control for nothing in return, simply legitimizing the invasion in the eyes of the Republic. Contacting Senator Palpatine, he explained that the Trade Federation was involved in a conspiracy in the Senate to shift a tax on trade routes they used, with Naboo being the main planet in their proposed operation.

It was while en route to the camp that she was rescued by two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi. The two had been Valorum's ambassadors charged with negotiating a truce with the Trade Federation, but Gunray had tried to kill them as soon as they had arrived.

Queen Amidala recognized that she had not fooled Master Qui-Gon for a moment, but he went along with her story, which allowed her to continue fooling everyone else. The queen ventured with her companions into the spaceport of Mos Espa, which Qui-Gon Jinn described as a haven for \"those who do not wish to be found.\" While trying to negotiate for spare parts with the junk dealer Watto, the party met Anakin Skywalker, a nine-year-old slave, along with his mother, Shmi Skywalker, and his incompletely built protocol droid, C-3PO.

The senator then encouraged Amidala to move for a Vote of No Confidence in the leadership of Chancellor Valorum. Valorum was a well-meaning politician, and the queen initially refused to move against him. However, upon witnessing the problems of politics during the Senate session in which she pleaded, Amidala ended up following Palpatine's advice, asking for Valorum's ousting from office.

Before the Jedi funeral began, she knelt beside Kenobi when he was alone with his master's body and asked him if he was ready, then gave him more time as he requested. Finally, a huge parade was held in the Naboo capital to celebrate the official unification of the humans and Gungans.
