About one century before 3639 BBY, an accident happened. The specimen consumed Orgglo, a researcher stationed aboard the Theoretika, down to the marrow of his bones. This prompted Vipp, the science officer aboard the vessel, to place the creature in suspended animation. In 3639 BBY, various individuals who sought to recover the only remaining schematics for the HK-51 series assassin droid woke up the specimen and slew it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
