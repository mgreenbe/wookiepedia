He was an acquaintance of the Human Selima DeWitt, the daughter of Davin DeWitt, Bayonard's Baron Administrator, and Selima often visited Tyger in his club, or elsewhere if the club was not open."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 31 BBY, Selima joined the Bark Lovers' Alliance, a Cularin-based environmental group, and left Bayonard to establish a shop in the city Gadrin with her boyfriend, Percival Vale, and the Cerean Higgie Sethven. However, she did not tell her father where she was going, and he eventually hired the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who operated in the Cularin system, to find her. Davin provided the agents with a list of Selima's known contacts, which included Tyger, and, during the course of their investigation, the agents traveled to Tyger's club to ask the Wookiee about Selima. Tyger told them that he had heard that Selima had joined the Bark Lovers' Alliance and was living in Gadrin. The agents subsequently traveled to Gadrin and located Selima."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tyger was fond of Selima DeWitt, and he was worried when she disappeared and joined the Bark Lovers' Alliance.

In the adventure, the player-characters roleplay as the Heroes of Cularin, and, if they travel to Tyger's club when it is not open, they knock on the door and Tyger answers it personally. If the players later inform Tyger of any of their findings in their search for Selima, he is very grateful to them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
