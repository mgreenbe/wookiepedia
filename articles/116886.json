Rohr believed it was prudent to parade the prisoners around, in commemoration of the victory over the Empire in the Galactic Civil War. The Pantoran public relations representative Olia Choko witnessed the spectacle and scolded Argell for treating the men like cattle. When Argell protested that they should be proud of winning the war, Olia explained that this type of conduct was something the Empire would do and the New Republic would be better. She then directed him to tell Commander Rohr to cease the parade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
