The vehicle was requisitioned by Moff Wilhuff Tarkin for use in a task force that aimed to capture the corvette Carrion Spike, which had been stolen from Tarkin by a rebel cell. Tarkin planned to use the CC-2200, along with a newer-model CC-7700 frigate and a newly developed and untested Immobilizer 418 cruiser, to pull the Carrion Spike from hyperspace in the Obroa-skai system, which the Imperials estimated the corvette would pass through based on a homing beacon they had on the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the three cruisers activated their interdiction fields the Immobilizer's overcurrent resistors failed to prevent the cruiser's gravitic systems from redlining, creating a field that was far stronger than necessary. Ships began to be pulled from hyperspace, and those already in the system were dragged toward the interdictors. The field was momentarily turned off, but then reactivated, pulling the large Mon Calamari star cruiser Stellar Vista from hyperspace. Out of control, the larger vessel broadsided the CC-2200, before spinning to impale its dorsal surface on the interdictor's bow. An explosion on the Mon Calamari vessel then knocked the CC-2200 ninety degrees out of position. The interdictors failed to capture the Carrion Spike and its crew, who had become aware of the homing beacon and transferred it to a YT-1000 freighter named the Reticent, which the Imperials did capture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Detainer CC-2200 first appeared in the Star Wars Legends novel Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader which was written by James Luceno and published in 2005.
