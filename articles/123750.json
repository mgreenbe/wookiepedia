Unlike the Reborn warriors, shadowtroopers did not taunt their enemies, preferring instead to remain quiet and concentrate on physical combat. The shadowtroopers were competent duelists, possessing more skill than their Reborn counterparts, and often used the Strong Style of lightsaber combat mixed with other types.
