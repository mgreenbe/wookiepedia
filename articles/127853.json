They were easily concealable or carried in a pocket or utility belt. Some custom upgrades (which doubled the price) that were sometimes incorporated included a panic button or a built-in glowrod. Many models existed, but the Merr-Sonn model was covered in a thin layer of dark sound absorbing material to help reduce the noise when the baton was deployed or used."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Popular in urban areas, snap batons were used as weapons by thugs and as items for personal protection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
