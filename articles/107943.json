It was one of the wealthiest worlds in the Tapani sector. It was the sector capital since Shey Tapani united the Tapani sector, and remained the capital when the sector joined the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Procopia was a verdant world of warm oceans, and thousands of large islands of grassy plains and small woods. The weather was mild throughout most of the year along most of the island chains (except for those close to either pole). Though there is a rainy season along the equator which runs through most of the winter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Davla was Procopia's one proper continent. Located on the southern pole, it was pummeled by gale-force sub-zero winds through most of the year - when it wasn't being buried by molten lava from the hundreds of active volcanoes seething across its surface. Needless to say, few people lived there all year around, though numerous lodges dotted the coast in areas that were least likely to be buried in volcanic ash. In the brief summer months, nobles and politicians traveled here to hunt the elk-like baranda and to fish (or at least pretend to while hatching plots and alliances)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Large urban centers were built upon many of the islands. Many are private preserves owned by houses; residential zones for the house nobility when they stay on Procopia. Others are devoted to government or the service industries which surround government."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Politics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Procopia was the capital of the Tapani sector, and had been since Shey Tapani chose it as the seat of his empire long ago. It was the center of official power within the Expanse, and the social trend-setter for the Expanse and the Freeworlds Territory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Great Council, Senate, and lesser sector governmental bodies would meet on Procopia, and most of the sector's senior rulers resided there at least part of the year. The Imperial Moff Laird Gustavu maintained his official residence there as well, though he was as likely to be on Tallaan or Vycinyth as in his offices."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Procopia had a small care-taker government which maintained police protection, and such services as power and water desalination (natural fresh water is rare on Procopia). Larger issues, such as global defense, taxation, and tariffs were decided by whatever house or coalition dominated in sector affairs. At the time, Houses Mecetti, Calipsa, and Reena held the ruling coalition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Procopia culture was dominated by politics. Everywhere one traveled, one could see statues, marble halls, great shining spires, and noble museums that served as a constant reminder of Tapani's great glories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By ancient tradition, Procopia was considered to be neutral - no house quarrel or feud could be pursued through violent means while on the capital world. This meant that no duels, no poisonings, and no assassinations could take place, even common fist fights among nobles were frowned upon here, and may mean social ostracism for weeks or months for the participants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The edict was strictly observed, and woe to the noble who violated it - his own house may disown him. In a sector where house relations were so delicate, no one could afford to have government disrupted by blood feuds and house wars. Of course, there were those who break the taboo, but they took extreme care to avoid detection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Procopia was the political center of the sector all year around, but for the four summer months of capital season, it became the social epicenter as well. During those months, the entire planet became little more than a playground for the Tapani nobility - who descended on its many palaces, resorts, fine restaurants, balls, and casinos. Of course, those with more had more to lose, and there were dangers which lied in wait behind the glittering fa\u00e7ade for the unwary or careless noble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Non-nobles visiting Procopia during capital season would find it difficult to obtain rooms in good hotels, reservations in the better restaurants, and so on. Nobles got the first of everything in the Tapani sector, but especially during capital season when the planet's luxury resources were stretched to the limit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Economy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Again, Procopia's lifeblood was politics - and had no other significant export. In addition to the expatriate community, the planet maintained a sizable native population, mostly made up of people who contributed to the many service industries which supported the government - consultant companies, cleaning services, entertainment centers, and so on. Directly or indirectly, the whole world was funded almost exclusively through taxes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Points of interest"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Great Council was located on Estalle Island, one of the larger islands in the southern hemisphere. Nearly the entire island was dedicated to the Council, the Senate, and various committees. Estalle was a beautiful city built in the ancient Tapani style of domed towers and temples. The island was networked with canals, which served as an inefficient but elegant method of getting around."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alaphoe Gardens on Lalos Island were owned by House Cadriaan, and was very popular during capital season."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was good hunting and fishing to be had on Davla during the summer, if the festivities of capital season began to turn tiresome. Privacy was a much-valued commodity on Davla. Groups happening upon one another were expected to steer well clear unless there was some evidence of distress on the part of one party. Those ignoring the custom was likely to be coldly invited to move on, though there was always the risk of being shot at by spooked bodyguards, especially if there was someone particularly important in the other party."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
