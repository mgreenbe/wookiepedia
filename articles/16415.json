These electrified rounds had the potential to electrocute targets, which made them convulse, and could even ignite flammable articles of clothing or equipment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Popular among bounty hunters and Imperial special forces teams, the berserker rifle originated in the Stratos Distribution, where violent factions fought for control of the region. By the time of the Imperial Era, arms manufacturers created their own versions of the weapons inspired by other regional technologies like bowcasters. However, original berserker rifles were rare, and many collectors offered a large amount of credits for a verified Stratos Distribution piece."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
