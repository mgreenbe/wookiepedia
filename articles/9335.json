It was a one of a kind vessel of Mon Calamari make. As with other Mon Calamari vessels, the Ashanda Ray had a natural, aquatic appearance to it due to the curves and bumps on the hull. Within the \"pod\" on the belly of the Ray, there was a concealed heavy triple-barreled laser cannon. It also benefited from another Mon Calamari staple, redundant deflector shield systems. These overlapping shields would recharge faster and offer better protection against enemies who believed its shields were down. There were three pods along the front of the Ray that concealed three proton torpedo tubes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
