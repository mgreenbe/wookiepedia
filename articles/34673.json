However, due to the fact that the former Sith Lord's body was destroyed along with the Star Forge, it was unlikely that this particular armor was one that he actually wore in daily use. It was believed that this armor came into the possession of Meetra Surik towards the end of the Old Sith Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
