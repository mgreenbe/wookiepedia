The armor provided a high level of protection to heat, cold, and sonic attacks, in addition to rendering the wearer immune to mind-altering attacks through the Force. It was believed that Revan may have acquired this powersuit at the end of the Jedi Civil War, during his search for the Star Maps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
