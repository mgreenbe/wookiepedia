Located on the top floor of Peace Park in the planet Mandalore's capital city of Sundari, the structure was dominated by a split spire. In the year 21 BBY, the Memorial Shrine was shattered in a bombing engineered by the Death Watch. Though Duchess Satine Kryze ordered the statue left in its broken state as a warning against pointless violence, the monument was removed entirely during the Imperial occupation of Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
