Drift-feeders, they gathered in huge swarms resting on sandbars while feeding on the detritus that floated by. Seeing a swarm of bandaras on the river was considered good luck by Devaronian river pilots because it warned them of shallow waters. During the mating season, male bandaras coarsely sang to attract potential mates, a drone that was unbearable to female Devaronians. They tried to wipe out the insects, but were unable to exterminate them completely. However, male Devaronians could tolerate the song of the bandaras. They were rumored to have hired mercenaries to help save the species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
