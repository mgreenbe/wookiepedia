He was based at Maz Kanata's castle on Takodana. Following the Search for the Kyber Saber, Kordi Freemaker tried to barter an ion projector for a Type A vector coil. The Rodian merchant contemptuously gave them a Type Two power cell. When Rowan Freemaker protested that he was ripping them off, the Rodian told him to take up the matter with his associate Grummgar.
