After he observed a small tug transporting a YT-1200 medium freighter across space, Riffle came up with the idea of designing a small cargo tug that could slot within the forward mandibles of CEC's YT-1300 light freighters. CEC's executives supported Riffle's proposal and his idea resulted in the development of the F-LER, a cargo-handler that saw limited use in conjunction with the YT-1300."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
