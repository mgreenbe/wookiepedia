As a punishment, Broysc got Quinn assigned to Balmorra, where the lieutenant was absorbed into Darth Baras' field of operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Descending further into madness over the years, Broysc almost doomed the command of Major Ovech and later began sending regular transmissions to the ship where now-Captain Quinn served - the Fury-class Imperial interceptor belonging to the Sith Lord who would become the Emperor's Wrath. Eventually being put through, Broysc began to rant on the holotransmitter against Quinn. Referring to him as \"Admiral Malcontent\", believing it to be Quinn's actual rank and name, Broysc began blaming him for events that occurred well before Quinn, or even Broysc himself, were born, such as the Battle of Talay, Broysc's first command, and the Destruction of Taris, which had occurred three centuries earlier. He also accused Quinn of sabotaging the Glory Space Station, which Quinn had no clue what it was."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Downfall"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With his lord's permission, Quinn began to find ways to bring Broysc's incompetence and madness to the attention of the Imperial High Command, but to no avail; Broysc's political and military connections would not allow him to be removed through the proper channels. Thus, taking matters into his own hands, Quinn abducted Broysc from a pleasure barge where he had been holed up while battle was ongoing, and brought him to the Wrath's ship. Clearly mad, Broysc ordered the Wrath to surrender the vessel and its crew to his command and even kill themselves to everyone present. His patience stretched to breaking point, Quinn requested the Wrath's permission to execute the Moff, and the Sith granted it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The body of Moff was then disposed of by Quinn, who was relieved that no one would ever have to deal with Broysc's incompetence again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
