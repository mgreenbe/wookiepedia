During the rescue missions, Irtanna piloted the Star-Wake, an Envoy-class shuttle, which was also crewed by Bordon and his sons, Tallo and Wend. Finally, they came across a little girl who seemed to be a war orphan. The girl was named Rain, but was actually revealed to be Darth Zannah who served as the student of the Sith Lord Darth Bane. As the Star-Wake again opened in the direction of the Republica fleet, Irtanna suddenly heard shots from the hold of the shuttle. As she was about to see what was going on, Irtanna and her crew were murdered by Zannah who came inside the cockpit. After taking the Star-Wake, she set course to Onderon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
