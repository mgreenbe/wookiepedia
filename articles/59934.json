That year, Hask and other members of the Neimoidian leadership of the Trade Federation formed an alliance with Adol Bel of the Xucphra Corporation, a producer of the medical substance bacta on Thyferra. They planned to manufacture a bacta shortage by sabotaging a processing plant for alazhi, a key ingredient in bacta. The plan lowered the availability of bacta and raised its price, increasing the Trade Federation's profits as planned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hask had also coordinated the shortage with Iaco Stark, whose pirate Stark Commercial Combine attacked bacta-carrying transports. The Jedi Tholme and Quinlan Vos traveled to Thyferra to investigate the shortage, finding it suspicious. There, they overheard a meeting between Hask and Bel, where the latter was enraged that Stark's attacks had disrupted their plans. Hask insisted that the Trade Federation was not to blame, while Bel continued to complain that his company could not move any of their bacta safely, and that the galaxy would turn on them if its denizens discovered the conspiracy. Hask reminded Bel that it was his responsibility to keep their secrets safe, as he had heard that Jedi were investigating. Bel told him not to worry as there were HKB-3 hunter-killer droids on patrol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Hask, as well as senator Nute Gunray were intimidated by Jedi Master Mace Windu on Coruscant into mobilizing the Trade Defense Force to save the Republic forces trapped by Stark's Combine on Troiken.
