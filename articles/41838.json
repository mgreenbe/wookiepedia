Aged in rounds, duusha took the same color internally as blue milk, but the outer coloration depended on on the color of the fungi that grew on the outside of the cheese, protecting the cheese as it aged. As a result, duusha cheese could be various colors on the outside. Critics of Head of State Jagged Fel used the word 'Duusha' as a nickname for Fel. As Fel was raised among the blue-skinned Chiss, critics used 'Duusha' to symbolize that Fel was, to them, blue on the inside and a different color on the outside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
