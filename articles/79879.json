As such, he focused his time in office on improved trade relations with neutral systems and, despite the insistence of General Leia Organa and the Resistance, did not consider the emerging First Order to be a threat.

Twenty-nine years after the Battle of Endor, Villecham was elected to serve as the Senate's chancellor. He focused his term in office on improving trade relations with neutral systems in the Trans-Hydian Borderlands, as they had been disaffected from the Republic for decades. His time in office also saw the rise of the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire. Villecham did not consider the First Order a threat so long as they abided by the dictates of the Galactic Concordance, a peace treaty marking the Empire's defeat to the Republic at the end of the Galactic Civil War. This was in contrast to the claims of General Leia Organa and the Resistance, who urged the Republic to consider military action against the resurgent Imperial power. Organa dispatched an envoy, Commander Korr Sella, to the Republic's then capital of Hosnian Prime to argue for a military build-up, but by then it was too late. Villecham, Sella, and the Senate were wiped out when the First Order targeted their superweapon, Starkiller Base, on Hosnian Prime and destroyed it, along with the Hosnian system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lanever Villecham was a male Tarsunt with white hair, black eyes, and yellow skin.
