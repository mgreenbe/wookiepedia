As part of the Wraiths' first assignments, Loran participated in the Zsinj campaign, helping in the New Republic's effort to defeat Warlord Zsinj. He flourished in the Wraiths, using his skills and talents at acting. Loran's posing as Captain Zurel Darillian lured Admiral Apwar Trigit into a trap at Ession which led to the destruction of the Implacable. Later, Loran was called upon to adopt the persona of pirate General Kargin, the leader of the Hawk-bat Independent Space Force, in order to earn the confidence of Zsinj. Loran succeeded and the ruse led to the loss of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Razor's Kiss that Zsinj had attempted to abscond with. Based on his leadership and accomplishments, Loran eventually was promoted to captain and became the commander of the Wraiths after Antilles transferred back to Rogue Squadron. Also during this time he became romantically involved with fellow Wraith Dia Passik, whom he eventually married."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the New Republic Intelligence Service took over Wraith Squadron, Loran followed the unit over to Intelligence. He masterminded a plan to eliminate Imperial admiral Kosh Teradoc on Ryvester in 13 ABY, which also saw the rescue of gemologist Mulus Cheems. Loran served as commander of the Wraiths for many years, including through the entire Yuuzhan Vong War. He helped defend Borleias and infiltrate occupied Coruscant, along with Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade Skywalker, Tahiri Veila, and Danni Quee, the latter mission resulting in the successful elimination of the dangerous Dark Jedi Lord Nyax before the Dark Jedi could escape from the planet. Loran was present in the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar when the newly-reorganized Galactic Alliance retook the planet from the Yuuzhan Vong, ending the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the war, Loran continued to serve in Galactic Alliance intelligence, earning a promotion to general. During this time, he adopted his wife's daughter Adra Passik. After the Second Galactic Civil War, Loran was forced into retirement as part of a purge instituted by the newly-installed Daala regime. However, in 44 ABY, after Daala's replacement, Loran was called back by the head of Galactic Alliance Security, Borath Maddeus, and asked to investigate the chief of the Galactic Alliance Army, Stavin Thaal, who was suspected of possible involvement in a conspiracy to overthrow the Galactic Alliance. Loran put together two separate teams of Wraiths to accomplish this goal and assisted them as he could, though he kept his true activities hidden from Maddeus. As the isolated Wraith teams uncovered evidence implicating Thaal, Loran and his family were targeted by assassins. Loran and his family faked their deaths and the two Wraith teams were able to capture Thaal after exposing his plan to defect from the Galactic Alliance with a private army. Loran's findings also revealed that Maddeus was in league with Thaal, which led to Loran confronting and capturing Maddeus. He was then asked by Chief of State Wynn Dorvan to take over as head of Galactic Alliance Security, which he accepted, while also maintaining the secret existence of the revived Wraith Squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Childhood and early career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Pantolomin native of Lorrdian heritage, as a child Loran made thinly-veiled Imperial propaganda holodramas such as The Black Bantha, Jungle Flutes, and Win or Die\u2014becoming in many ways the galaxywide poster child for Imperial recruitment. Sometime in his childhood acting career, Loran acquired the moniker \"Face\" for his comely appearance and it stuck with him the rest of his life. Kidnapped by an extremist cell that had been kicked out of the Rebel Alliance, his face was scarred when Imperial stormtroopers massacred his kidnappers in a rescue attempt. However, before his captors were killed, they gave him a thorough briefing in the atrocities committed by the Empire and Imperial Intelligence as a precursor to his planned execution. Loran used this occasion to disappear, leaving his fans to believe that he had died in the fight. His supposed death was used by the Empire to sully the image of the New Republic by blaming them for his death. Loran did decide to leave the scar, though, seeing it as a reminder of how much he had helped the Imperial cause. After the encounter, Loran quietly returned to his home on Pantolomin, where his parents later sent him to Lorrd, their homeworld, while publicly maintaining the death of the famous holostar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a youth on Lorrd, he took the alias of Kal zet Berri and was taken in by the governor of Lorrd, Zenobia le Ingiana, as a favor to Loran's parents. He attended the Sebs Jemas Flight School in Lorrd City and was already considering joining the Rebel Alliance. During his stay on Lorrd, he occasionally visited a starship dealership in the city of Qatamer, Hart and Parn Starships, as he was interested in starfighters. On one such visit, Loran climbed into an R-22 Spearhead starfighter and played a trick on a pair of nearby children about his age, Zak and Tash Arranda, by activating the starfighter's targeting system, scaring them. He then climbed out of the starfighter and introduced himself to them, though shortly thereafter, the three were escorted from the premises due to Loran's shenanigans. As it turned out, the Arrandas were staying with the governor as well, so the three youths were able to spend time together. Later, Loran showed the two Arrandas around Qatamer, pointing out sights and locations of interest.

He was unconcerned by the damage, though, and wondered if the proprietor, Hart-and-Parn Gorra-Fiolla, would let him buy the ship instead. He also revealed his true identity to the Arrandas before they departed with their uncle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon reaching maturity, Loran used his own money to purchase his own A-wing starfighter and joined the New Republic, where he was assigned to Colonel Edor Crespin's Comet Squadron.

Loran did well in squadron training, scoring second in the rankings behind demolitions expert Kell Tainer. Once the squad was assembled, Flight Officer Loran earned the designation Wraith Eight.

Loran, who already had four kills to his name from his prior service, scored two more, becoming an ace in his first engagement with the Wraiths. The Wraiths, who had avoided any casualties in the engagement, jumped out of Folor base, only to have the entire squadron disabled by an empion mine planted by Trigit's forces in the midst of an asteroid field. With one X-wing permanently disabled and hostiles likely to show up soon, Loran suggested leaving the craft behind with a pilot in a jury-rigged pilot's chair with a laser rifle. When their attackers pulled in the debris from the attack, the pilot could protect himself. The idea evolved until they had left Wraith pilot Voort saBinring in a shielded compartment pulled from their Lambda-class shuttle, Narra, with a small repulsorlift and a stripped-down laser cannon. When the corvette Night Caller arrived, saBinring was pulled into the ship and hit the bridge with the crude laser cannon weapon, killing the captain.

The deception became more complex when Jesmin Ackbar and Eurrsk Thri'ag used Darillian's holorecorded diary to generate an overlay of Darillian over Loran, generating a life-like holograph of the captain over Loran's words and movements. The Night Caller's next visit was to Xartun, where Loran revealed the location of a transparisteel manufacturing plant, which the other Wraiths later blew up after the disguised Loran left.

The next day, Loran had his first conversation as Darillian with Zsinj via holocomm. The warlord instructed him to aid Apwar Trigit in finishing off the survivors of Folor Base\u2014ironically, Loran was one of those survivors. Zsinj also instructed them to rendezvous with a supply ship. To avert having to let the crewmen onto their ship, Loran and the other Wraiths conducted a mission to Storinal to steal biological agents and TIE fighters, where Loran posed as a stereotypical country idiot from Agamar.

Arriving in-system, the Wraiths realized that Trigit had figured out the trap and dropped the Implacable out of hyperspace prematurely, leaving the frigate Provocateur and the corvette Constrictor for the Wraiths to engage. At the ensuing Battle of Talasea, Loran invented a tactic that came to be known as the \"Loran Spitball,\" in which a group of X-wings would fire a salvo of proton torpedoes while still in their carrier's bow hangar, providing an unexpected addition to a ship's firepower in the opening moments of battle. Loran was heading towards his fighter when Night Caller took a hit that destroyed the bridge, leaving Loran to take over the ship from the auxiliary bridge.

The Night Caller executed the Loran Spitball against the Implacable, weakening the vessel while Antilles put the ship into a dust cloud on Ession's moon, hiding it from the Star Destroyer. After a long engagement, the Wraiths destroyed the Implacable, though they lost Thri'ag and Falynn Sandskimmer and several pilots were forced to eject.

Military police quickly responded, rounding them up for the altercation, but Loran noticed that their captain's walking mannerisms and story didn't add up, and he signaled Antilles of the trap, who gave Loran the lead. Loran struck the first blow, and the Wraiths quickly put down the ersatz policemen, who were later discovered to be infiltrators.

Notsil, officially free of scrutiny, agreed under the condition that she be admitted to Rogue or Wraith Squadron upon graduation from the Academy. Little did Loran or Phanan know that Notsil was actually Gara Petothel, one of Trigit's intelligence operatives, and well-trained enough to fool Loran by masking her Coruscanti heritage with a barely noticeable Aldivian accent.

The Wraiths infiltrated an Imperial base on Halmad using the same ruse that had been attempted against them on Coruscant, but in the guise of the Hawk-bats. They stole five TIE Interceptors to equip their forces with, in addition to the Sungrass, a dilapidated transport that served as their launching platform when they weren't at Hawk-bat Base, an abandoned mining base in the Halmad system. They started their piratical spree by attacking a tanker after Loran picked up their navigational data from a drunk crew member planetside, and continued from there. Loran and most of the other Wraiths made a short layover on Mon Remonda, the Mon Calamari cruiser where they were officially stationed, to pick up orders and supplies, and Notsil, fresh from graduating with honors on an accelerated training program, joined them as one of the Wraiths.

Loran landed his ship to rescue him and, evading Zsinj's troops searching the countryside, found Phanan. He attempted to get the other pilot to safety, but Phanan refused to let Loran surrender in order to save him. Ton, realizing that he was dying and that he had made the mistake of letting his past consume him, confronted Loran for doing the same thing. Phanan died shortly afterwards, and left Loran as the sole beneficiary of his will. Loran, deeply grieved, destroyed the body of his wingman and returned to Hawk-bat Base.

Their meeting with Zsinj was quite profitable at first, with the warlord readily agreeing to hire them for a dangerous mission at a high price. Loran also got a chance to use saBinring's biologically altered background as a cover story for Lieutenant Kettch, who Zsinj believed to be a member of the Hawk-bats based on comm modifications that had disguised Antilles' voice as that of an Ewok over Halmad.

The infiltration party, which also included two other Jedi, Mara Jade Skywalker and Tahiri Veila, along with scientist Danni Quee, was ferried to Coruscant by the transport Record Time. They ejected out of its cargo bay and rode down to the surface in their insertion pods along with other debris to avoid detection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Coruscant, Loran and the others examined the extent of the Vongforming done to the planet while Skywalker and the other Jedi investigated the emanations of the dark side they had sensed on the fallen capital. They found that the planet's orbit, flora, and atmosphere had all been altered, including the creation of foul smelling air created by the decomposition of millions of dead bodies. Loran aided the team by providing perfume-soaked rags, but the sights and sounds of the devastated capital were still evident, and the team realized that the world was permanently changed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they first encountered Yuuzhan Vong warriors up close, Loran was scouting a bridge between two buildings when a party of Yuuzhan Vong appeared. He attempted to bluff his way past them with his knowledge of Yuuzhan Vong culture and language, but the Yuuzhan Vong warriors grew hostile, although unaware of their true nature and identity. Between the combat skills of the Jedi and an explosive from Kell Tainer, the infiltrators were able to kill all of them before the warriors could raise an alarm. Later, they were able to make contact with survivors on Coruscant, a group known as the Walkway Collective. Loran was one of two Wraiths ordered to accompany the two Skywalkers to meet the collective. From these survivors, the Wraiths and Jedi learned of Lord Nyax, a deranged, cybernetically-altered Dark Jedi roaming through the Coruscanti undercity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one of many scouting expeditions, Loran and Veila located an air purifying station. After further investigation, Skywalker revealed that the devourer tank in the purifying station concealed an entrance to a hidden laboratory. Exploring it and examining the droids within, they found that the laboratory that had originally been used to alter Nyax to beyond human norms, and where he had begun his killing spree. While Quee, Wraith operative Bhindi Drayson, and the Skywalkers investigated the laboratory, Loran had the exits marked and assigned Tainer to stand watch. Since the laboratory was abandoned and had access to fresh air, the party used it as a temporary base. Loran and Tainer also set up numerous holocams on the surface to collect astronomical observations. Loran and Skywalker also ventured out on numerous expeditions to find working vehicles. During this time, Tainer and Loran got into a contest of endurance to see who would admit discomfort wearing their Yuuzhan Vong guises first, while the rest of the party had largely ceased wearing them. On one such excursion, Loran and Drayson were investigating a computer in a building that had been a Starfighter Command recruiting office when Skywalker saw Lord Nyax from afar. They left the building hastily and it was overrun by a group of haggard Coruscant survivors who ransacked the place. Loran suggested using snipers to take out Nyax, but Luke disagreed and overruled him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The second time they confronted the Dark Jedi, the Skywalkers, Veila, Tainer, and Loran found workers under Nyax's mental control attacking Yuuzhan Vong warriors and repairing a construction droid. While the Jedi engaged Nyax, Loran and Tainer captured Viqi Shesh, a treacherous senator who was accompanying the Yuuzhan Vong, and took a vehicle locator from her. However, she escaped when the construction droid activated and began plowing its way through the cityscape to the remains of the old Jedi Temple. Under orders from Skywalker Loran followed the droid, resisting Nyax's mental commands, and avoiding the low-flying coralskippers. His persistence helped guide the Jedi to the droid's location in their hunt for Nyax. After the three Jedi approached Nyax for a final encounter at the site of the ruined temple, Loran returned to the Ugly Truth, a workable transport that Tainer had found by following Shesh's vehicle locator. The two blasted the ship free from its hiding place and picked up the others, escaping back to Borleias in time for the conclusion of the siege that had been taking place there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 29 ABY, a mission on Chashima to investigate a new Yuuzhan Vong creature under development called comm-buzzers, which could trace comlink signals, led to the death of longtime Wraith Squadron member Hohass Ekwesh as well as Estoric Sandskimmer. Loran attempted to assuage the grief of the mission's survivor, Voort saBinring, who had been close friends with Ekwesh, but even when Loran tried to tell him that Ekwesh's death had not been in vain, saBinring's grief led him to quit the unit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the Wraiths, including Loran, took part in the Battle of Obroa-skai in an attempt to kill Yuuzhan Vong Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane, where the Wraiths' stealthed ships helped jam yammosk war coordinators, leading to the destruction of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, though Shimrra wasn't there. Loran also participated in the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, the final battle of the war, joining up with Shamed Ones and resistance units on the planet's surface.

However, following the Second Galactic Civil War in 40 ABY, Loran was part of a purge of the intelligence services instituted by new Chief of State Natasi Daala. The Wraiths were disbanded and Loran was forced into an early retirement, which was much to his disliking."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 44 ABY, after the replacement of the Daala administration, Loran was asked by the head of Galactic Alliance Security, General Borath Maddeus, to investigate the chief of the Galactic Alliance Army, General Stavin Thaal, who was under suspicion of being part of the Lecersen Conspiracy. The conspiracy had nearly destabilized the Galactic Alliance during the recent Lost Tribe of Sith emergence. Maddeus had asked Loran to put together a new Wraith team discreetly and unofficially to investigate Thaal, and Loran agreed. Maddeus supplied him with a hyperdrive-equipped space yacht Quarren Eye and Loran began his efforts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Befitting his long and storied career as an intelligence officer, Loran took extra precautions when establishing his new Wraiths. Suspicious of Quarren Eye, he never revealed his true plans or the identities of his new Wraiths over its communication systems, instead only transmitting the details of a fake unit over its systems. He also put together two different Wraith Squadron teams who were kept isolated and unaware of the others' existence while he tasked them with investigating Thaal from different angles. Both teams were led by veteran Wraiths, with Loran recruiting his old colleagues from the Yuuzhan Vong War Sharr Latt to lead one team and Bhindi Drayson to lead the other team. Loran also personally flew to Ayceezee to persuade one of the original Wraith Squadron members, the now-retired Voort saBinring, to join Drayson's team. saBinring was reluctant to rejoin the unit after his experience on Chashima, but Loran was able to convince him he was needed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two returned to Coruscant in disguise, where Loran put saBinring in contact with one of Drayson's Wraiths, Myri Antilles, the daughter of his old unit commander Wedge Antilles. Loran helped set up a heist that Drayson's team were arranging as part of their investigation, depositing a thoroughly unprepared saBinring into the situation and then leaving to handle his own affairs. He remained on Coruscant and met with Thaal's ex-wife, Zehrinne Thaal. She revealed to him that she and Thaal were all but divorced after an unfruitful marriage and the estranged ex-wife informed him that Thaal was adulterous and had had several mistresses, all younger women. Loran obtained their names from Zehrinne Thaal and learned that the latest mistress Keura Fallatte, had disappeared recently. He returned home and forwarded the information to the Wraiths covertly, while sending a fake report through the Quarren Eye. His work completed for the moment, he enjoyed time with his wife and daughter, though favored ordering out for dinner instead of cooking that evening."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Loran later went to visit one of his assets, a Bothan lieutenant named Davian who worked in the Galactic Alliance Navy. The officer was able to obtain him the cargo manifests of a series of naval cargo vessels that had disappeared over the years. Loran learned that all the missing vessels had a HyperTech Industries communications device, typically a hypercomm, onboard. Given that one of the new Wraiths under Drayson, Jesmin Tainer, had once investigated the missing vessels, Loran found this interesting. However, he also used the occasion to swipe Davian's datapad while persuading him to keep his findings secret until the Wraiths could uncover the heart of the matter. Loran used this datapad to plant credentials for a fake Imperial identity that Drayson's Wraiths were using to try and lure out Thaal's conspirators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long afterward, while flying in his airspeeder, Loran found himself being followed by another vehicle. He landed in an open-air market to elude his pursuit, who quickly landed and followed him, revealing themselves to be a Sullustan and an Aqualish. Loran maintained a pretense of shopping, acquiring the necessary items to furnish an impromptu decoy to distract the Aqualish, who revealed himself to be intent on murder when he knifed the decoy. Realizing his danger, Loran slew the Sullustan and broke contact even as the Aqualish revealed himself. Throwing a recently-acquired toy lightsaber as a diversion, Loran raced forward and fatally stabbed his opponent. Retreating to his speeder, Loran asked the droid brain he had installed if the vehicle had been tampered with. It had been, so Loran cut himself to leave genetic evidence of his presumed death, and then ditched the vehicle, having the droid brain fly it off where it exploded soon after thanks to the sabotage. Loran went to ground, informing his wife and daughter and some other associates to warn them. His wife shot the man who had sabotaged his speeder and then Loran and his family went into hiding after disposing of the body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Loran learned that search-and-kill orders had gone out for the fake Wraiths he had established over Quarren Eye, most of whom were fictitious or dead. Realizing that this implicated Maddeus, who had contacted him in the first place, Loran investigated the head of security. After the two Wraith teams under Latt and Drayson linked up and then exposed and captured Thaal, Loran knew it had reached the endgame. He knew that Thaal had escaped detention thanks to the help of his co-conspirator Maddeus and confronted Maddeus inside his office, but did not immediately let on that he knew of Maddeus' involvement. Loran revealed that he knew Thaal and Maddeus were comrades from the Yuuzhan Vong War and although Maddeus initially denied the allegations, he soon confessed. Maddeus was undeterred and when \"General Thaal\" appeared with weapon in hand, was prepared to burn down Loran. Maddeus revealed that he had concealed Thaal one level down from his office, at which point \"Thaal\" was revealed to be a Wraith in disguise and aimed his weapon at Maddeus instead.

This demeanor helped him remain cool and collected in harrowing situations, and he was quickly promoted to captain from flight officer for his leadership ability. He was also a joker, and considered one of the two smart mouths in the Wraiths by his fellow pilots, taking great delight in numerous jibes and jests.
