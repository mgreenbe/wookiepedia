It was 22 meters long, slug-like, and had an armored shell studded with spiny growths which could fire plasma globs. Dovin basals were implanted into the creatures for defense purposes. They were designed as a defender and protector to a thrall herder. Warriors commanding the warkeeper had to keep thralls from wandering into the range of the dovin basal gravity field and being consumed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
