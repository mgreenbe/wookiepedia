For five years, Laynara worked alongside Wyl Tarson, another of Raze's lieutenants and the two of them became friends, though Laynara cared about him more than she let on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their friendship, Tarson never told her that he was secretly spying on Raze's organization for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. After Raze discovered Tarson's espionage, Raze sent him on what he considered a suicide mission to Ahakista and had Laynara accompany Tarson."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarson stopped on a couple of planets before proceeding to Ahakista to gather members for the team that he would need for the mission.

When they entered, they were greeted by the sight of many carvings, all of them of either the same woman or boy.

When Tarson found himself about to be killed by the other man, Laynara diverted the attacker's attention by breaking a bust of the woman.

After an hour of talking, Tarson was unable to convince Nyl to join him on the mission and decided that it was time for them to leave. Before departing for the ship, Laynara asked Nyl if the woman who was depicted in the bust would have wanted him to live like he was now. Nyl would not answer the question and told her that it would be best if she left. However, Nyl decided to come along after all. Par asked Laynara how she convinced him, but Laynara said that she had nothing to do with it. She suspected that Nyl simply \"realized that he wanted to hurt someone again.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following her orders from Raze, Laynara delivered a package to an associate of Raze named Sardoth when they arrived on Ahakista.
