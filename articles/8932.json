It was added to the game on February 22, 2007 as part of the Chapter 5: An Entertaining Enterprise game update. The update saw the return of camping kits and the ability to craft them to the game, which the painting was meant to signify. All players who logged in after the update was released but before the release of Chapter 6 received one of these paintings. They could be used in one of the player's personal structures as decoration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
