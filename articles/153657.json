When a Republic LAAT/i gunship arrived on Ragmar V in order to establish a Republic outpost, the Klatooinian fired a missile launcher at the gunship, destroying it.

In order to avoid being killed by his own men, Sah made peace with Gaan as they took cover from the clone troopers' weapons. The Klatooinian ordered the settlers to open fire on the clones, and the pariahs quickly won the short skirmish.

Gaan met the Republic forces in the street and briefly exchanged words with Sah. However, Sah's clone trooper sergeant, Remy, received Order 66 just then from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine; Order 66 labeled all Jedi as traitors of the Republic, and they were to be executed on sight without hesitation.

As Gaan took cover with Sah, the Klatooinian gave his own order to fire in retaliation for the attack on Gaan. The fight was brief, and Gaan killed Remy during the skirmish. Sah, realizing he was now alone, agreed to band with the outcasts and face another detachment of clone troopers that would be arriving to ensure Sah's elimination.
