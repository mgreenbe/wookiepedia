The priests did not engage in acts of worship, but instead, they spent their lives meditating and contemplating the world around them. At some point, a wandering traveler brought a dangerous Sith artifact, known as the Darkstaff, to Oblis, which began manipulating the Oblee into using the artifact to repel a shadow creature from their homeworld. The Priests of Nether suspected that the staff was manipulating the Oblee to achieve its own ends, but despite the priests' concerns, the Oblee scientist-philosophers used the Darkstaff to power a machine that would send the shadow creature away. The activation of the machine triggered a cataclysm that destroyed Oblis and the Oblee, including the priests, who were transformed into incorporeal beings known as \"shadow lurkers.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
