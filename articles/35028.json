Solo helped Val escape, and as he dueled Wredd with his recovered lightsaber, Solo noticed that the Sith was remotely causing the communications array to crash into Mala. She returned to the array to retrieve her friends aboard AG-37's freighter, and rescued Val before the crash could occur. Wredd, meanwhile, escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The makeshift crew of AG-37's freighter were retrieved by the Animus, a Star Destroyer belonging to the Galactic Triumvirate.

Wredd, meanwhile, was seeking out various Sith who had infiltrated planetary governments and systematically killing them, hoping to be the only Sith left. At Dac's shipyards, Solo and Assam discovered that the Sith Lord Darth Luft was building a pirate fleet, information that their communications droid transmitted to Yalta Val. As a space battle raged, Val and Admiral Gar Stazi of the Triumvirate arrived at Dac with a fleet.

Jao, Sauk, and AG-37 were forced to temporarily abandon their hunt for Darth Wredd when Ania Solo was kidnapped by her former love interest Ramid, who was responding to a bounty on Ania's head. Ania had been framed for the murder of the Imperial Knight Teemen Alton by an old enemy, who had adopted the persona of a bounty hunter. The mission to rescue Ania Solo led Jao and her companions to a remote planet, which rained glass and acid. Following a prolonged skirmish, Ania succeeded in killing the bounty hunter. However, she was subsequently arrested by Imperial stormtroopers, who brought her to Coruscant to face trial. In the end, Ania was cleared when Master Yalta Val and Jao Assam presented evidence that Ania was not Teemen Alton's murderer. Despite Ania's release, Jao Assam was arrested and imprisoned on charges of deserting the Imperial Knights order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that point, Darth Wredd resurfaced on Coruscant and freed Jao Assam from his prison, offering the Imperial Knight a place as a Sith apprentice. Determined to foil Wredd's plot to kill Galactic Empress Marasiah Fel, Jao followed Darth Wredd to the floating world of Mala. Jao quickly learnt that Darth Wredd had been forced to join the One Sith, who had destroyed his homeworld and killed his family. As revenge, Darth Wredd wanted to destroy the One Sith. He tricked Jao into luring both the One Sith and the Imperial Knights onto Mala, which became the site of a great battle which saw the apparent destruction of the One Sith. At the end of the battle, Darth Wredd attempted to assassinate Marasiah Fel with the intent of driving Jao Assam to the dark side of the Force. However, Jao remained true and loyal to his Empress. In the end, Darth Wredd was killed with a blaster by Ania. Following the end of Darth Wredd's insurgency, Empress Fel revised the Imperial Knights' rules to allow its members to follow the light side of the Force rather than the Empress.

The One Sith Vul Isen tested a bioweapon on a backwater world called Mala. This test succeeded in wiping out all life on Mala and even knocking the planet out of its orbit; turning Mala into a rogue planet which wandered through the galaxy. The sole survivor of this genocide was the man who became Darth Wredd, whose Force-sensitivity was recognized by an unidentified Sith master. This Sith master sense Darth Wredd's Force potential and took on him as a Sith apprentice. While Darth Wredd ultimately embraced the dark side and became a Sith, he harbored a desire for revenge against the people that had destroyed his family and homeworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Wredd's opportunity for revenge came during the aftermath of Darth Krayt's death during the Battle of Coruscant in 138 ABY. Following the defeat of the Sith, the One Sith was once again driven underground and embarked on a strategy of infiltrating governments across the galaxy in order to restore their \"golden age.\" A new galactic government called the Galactic Federation Triumvirate was formed which consisted of an alliance of the Fel Empire, the Jedi Order, and the Galactic Alliance. Under the leadership of Empress Marasiah Fel, the Triumvirate embarked on a program to create a galactic-wide communications network to link the Outer Rim Territories with the wide galaxy.

Master Val's shuttle crash-landed on the planet Mala, which happened to be in the Carreras system. The Sith master then killed Master Val's crew and attacked the Imperial Knight. During the duel, Darth Wredd took the opportunity to kill the man who had a role in the destruction of his homeworld and family. He then took Master Val prisoner and stole his armor; impersonating the Imperial Knight. A week later, Darth Wredd's escape pod was retrieved by the Carreras authorities. When meeting Governor Biala, Darth Wredd claimed that there was a Sith presence in the Carreras system and that the Sith had murdered his crew. He then forcibly coerced Biala into ceding control of her security forces over to him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since Darth Wredd had been unable to recover the real Master Val's lightsaber, he ordered a system\u2013wide manhunt to recover the weapon. Unknown to Darth Wredd, Master Val's Imperial communications droid had already recovered the object but was hit during a meteor storm. By chance, the droid fell into a hands of a local junk dealer named Ania Solo, a distant descendant of Han Solo who had fallen on hard times. She and her Mon Calamari friend Sauk, an engineer, attempted to sell the lightsaber but caught the attention of the Carreras authorities.

However, Ania and Sauk managed to escape with the help of their friend, the assassin droid AG-37, who owned a freighter. They also managed to bring Val's communications droid with them. Their travels took them to the barren planet of Carreras Minor. There, they were attacked by a large tentacled monster. At that point, they were rescued by another Imperial Knight named Jao Assam, who had traveled to the Carreras system to ascertain the whereabouts of his mentor Val.

However, they were captured on the way by the Carreras authorities who brought them to the Carreras communications array. By that point, relations between Darth Wredd and Governor Biala had deteriorated sharply to the point that she came to suspect that he was not actually an Imperial Knight. Governor Biala freed Jao Assam and his companions and sent them to deal with the Sith impostor.

During their broadcast, he also attempted to execute Master Val but was thwarted by Ania Solo. As the station headed into a collision course with Mala, Governor Biala ordered a general evacuation. In the midst of the fighting, Darth Wredd managed to escape in his starship and fled for parts unknown. Meanwhile, Ania managed to evacuate her companions and rescue Master Val. To their astonishment, they also discovered that Jao Assam had survived his confrontation with Darth Wredd thanks to the efforts of Master Val's Imperial communications droid. Believing that Jao had come to rescue it, the droid believed that it owed the young Imperial Knight a life debt.

He tracked down a Snivvian infiltrator in Cadomai Prime and killed him following a heated skirmish. In addition, Darth Wredd killed a second infiltrator at the Galactic Triumvirate's legation on Ceitia Five. Despite Darth Wredd's threats to the Galactic Triumvirate, Empress Fel, at the counsel of Admiral Gar Stazi, decided not to hunt down the rogue Sith because he was helping them kill One Sith infiltrators.

Val also reasoned that they should allow the Force to guide the Empress on this matter. Believing that the Triumvirate was underestimating the threat posed by Darth Wredd, Jao persuade Ania to join him on a quest to hunt down the rogue Sith.

Upon arriving at the Mon Calamari Shipyards, Jao and Ania's shuttle was captured by a pirate syndicate and dragged into a hangar bay. However, Jao and Ania managed to overpower two pirates and steal their uniforms. After encountering a Mon Calamari named Luen and a Quarren named Tilin, they discovered that another Sith named Darth Luft and his pirate associates had established a slaving operation in the Mon Calamari shipyards where they were using enslaved Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees to build a pirate fleet.

The slave revolt coincided with the arrival of a joint Galactic Alliance and Imperial task force under Master Val and Admiral Stazi, who decided to come to the aid of the Mon Calamari and Quarren. The Alliance freighter Trand Cappa flooded the shipyards, allowing the amphibian slaves to gain the upper hand over their captors.
