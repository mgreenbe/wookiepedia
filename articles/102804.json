It was displayed in the Imperial Palace on Coruscant. During the Thrawn campaign, Leia Organa Solo, when seeing one of her newborn twin children and have the baby come out to see \"the big world,\" stood next to the painting, although she did not know at the time that the woman in the painting was her birth mother."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The painting made its first appearance in The Last Command 5, the fifth part of the comic adaptation of The Last Command of the Thrawn Trilogy. At the time the Thrawn Trilogy comics were coming out, the decision had just been made to cast Natalie Portman as the future mother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo. The author of the comics then decided, as a reference, to place her likeness in the background. Although this clashes to some extent with the eventual revelation that Leia never knew her mother, the comic was nonetheless the first in-universe appearance of Padm\u00e9 Amidala."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
