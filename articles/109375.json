Its triangular structure made it similar to other dagger-shaped Imperial spacecraft, including Star Destroyers. Unlike Star Destroyers, however the bridge was located at the frontal point and the hangars at the base. The structural integrity of the Quasar Fire spaceframe was questionable, being subject to micro-fractures while reverting from hyperspace to realspace. This much was alleged by a report issued by Mid-Rim Shipwrights."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The four hangar bays had space to accommodate up to 48 starfighters, however, some Imperial light carriers operated with as few as ten TIE/sa bombers and four TIE/ln space superiority starfighters.

After coming under attack by Imperial forces, the starship fled with the rest of the rebel fleet to the planet Atollon. After the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, it became part of the Alliance Fleet, with Colonel Anj Zavor recommending to Mon Mothma the procurement of more escort carriers from the Empire. However, the Phoenix Nest was destroyed at the Battle of Atollon, sacrificed by its commander, Jun Sato. During the early rebellion, one Quasar Fire-class was destroyed by a pair of Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvettes around the orbit of a celestial terrestrial body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least one Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier was present at the Rebel Alliance's Mako-Ta Space Docks. After the surviving ships escaped the Empire's attack on the base, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa used the cruiser-carrier to rescue Han Solo and R2-D2, who were trapped in a damaged X-wing. Once Solo was aboard, the cruiser-carrier escaped to the moon Corosi 7, but was too damaged to make more than one hyperspace jump, so the rebels used it to land on Nar Shaddaa and find passage aboard the Volt Cobra, the ship of Sana Starros."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point in the Galactic Civil War, the Imperial Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier Squall came under attack by a squadron of Rebel RZ-1 A-wing interceptors.
