However, the Yuuzhan Vong and the Galactic Alliance hadn't been the only ones who recognized Caluula's importance: Mandalore Boba Fett had sent a team to review it, and brought in a small force of Mandalorian Protectors. Upon seeing the Mandalorians' fighting abilities, the Yuuzhan Vong warriors were whipped into a frenzy as they attempted to capture the Mandalorians for the upcoming sacrifice, to the point that some fought among themselves for the opportunity to engage the Mandalorians in combat. However, Fett and his team were able to buy enough time for most of Caluula Station's forces\u2014as well as the Solos\u2014to head planetside or escape into hyperspace. Caluula Station exploded shortly after the last forces escaped."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Caluula Orbital destroyed, the Governor of Caluula sent a message to the Yuuzhan Vong suing for peace. In it, the Governor requested that the inhabitants not be implanted with surge-coral, and be allowed to live in peace with the Yuuzhan Vong. She also made one additional request: To allow a scientific team to observe the Nocturne of the Winged-Stars, which was occurring that year. In the efforts of rapid yammosk implantation, Supreme Commander Malik Carr agreed to the request initially, though stating that the final decision on the petition lay with High Prefect Drathul. The Galactic Alliance however, covertly intended to use the team to eliminate the yammosk based on the planet\u2014as well as to secretly monitor the effects of the recently released Alpha Red bioweapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
