Dallow served as the pilot of the Resistance bomber Cobalt Hammer during the Atterra campaign and later the evacuation of D'Qar. During the evacuation, Dallow and the other pilots of the Resistance navy's bombing squadron flew their bombers toward a Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought, the Fulminatrix. After the other bombers were destroyed, the only chance the Resistance had was the Hammer. Despite numerous attacks by enemy fighters, Dallow managed to get the bomber into optimum position over the Fulminatrix before the cockpit was destroyed by a TIE fighter, killing him. Another crewmember, Paige Tico, managed to drop the bomber's payload, ultimately destroying the Fulminatrix, but killing her in the process when the crippled Hammer dropped into the flames. Cobalt Squadron's sacrifice meant the destruction of the Fulminatrix, allowing the Resistance to escape D'Qar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finch Dallow was played by Kevin Layne in the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi where he was credited as \"Resistance Bomber pilot #1.\" Dallow's role as the pilot of the Cobalt Hammer was originally supposed to be filled by Finn in an early draft of the film's script, but director Rian Johnson scrapped the idea because if Finn wasn't aware that Paige Tico was Rose Tico's sister, later there would have been a big \"I saw your sister die\" scene which Johnson didn't want to write, making Finn, in Johnson's words, an \"asshole.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
