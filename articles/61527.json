Ruling from Kashyyyk inside his Palace, Darcc formed alliances with the Trandoshan slaver Pekt and the traitorous Wookiee Weebacca in an effort to rid the planet Kashyyyk of its native sentient species, the arboreal Wookiees."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moff Darcc's rule over Kashyyyk worried Wookiee chieftain Attichitcuk, who contacted his son, Chewbacca, in an effort to petition the burgeoning New Republic. Chewbacca, together with Han Solo, responded personally after the New Republic proved unable to assist. Once made aware of Darcc's intentions, Chewbacca formed an army, joining several Wookiee villages, in an effort to liberate the planet. Though Darcc tried to defeat the growing resistance, the Wookiees forced the Moff to flee the planet with Pekt and take refuge within a fortress on the Avatar Orbital Platform above Kashyyyk. Pursuing the Moff and bolstered by a collection of New Republic forces, Chewbacca's army overwhelmed the Imperial defenses, killing Darcc and destroying the orbital station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "On the Executrix"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the termination of the Clone Wars, the Human male Hindane Darcc was an Imperial officer and captain in the Imperial Navy.

In 19 BBY, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader was requested to meet with Moff Tarkin by Emperor Palpatine, stationed above the planet Kashyyyk, home of the native Wookiee species.

Once word of Emperor Palpatine's demise aboard the second Death Star, of which was stationed above the forest moon of the planet Endor, along with a pivotal Rebel Alliance victory, Darcc claimed complete control of Kashyyyk. Due to his position of power, as well as control of the Imperial technology located on the planet, Darcc proclaimed himself Moff of the Mytaranor sector. The new Moff established a Palace in his Imperial garrison, not far from the villages of Ittummi and Chenachochan, in which he ruled the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, his plans for Kashyyyk did not include the presence of the Wookiees. Forming a pact with Trandoshan slaver Pekt, Darcc instructed him and his hired Trandoshans to remove entire villages of Wookiees. With Imperial assistance, the captured Wookiees would be transported off-planet, where they would either be sold into slavery or killed, skinned, and sold for their pelts. Darcc also made an alliance with the Wookiee Weebacca, who agreed to help Darcc and Pekt in selling Weebacca's fellow species.

At the command of Darcc, Weebacca infiltrated the party, assisting where he could, including defending against an attempt to halt the creation of the Government Tree by Darcc's and Pekt's individual forces. Weebacca fulfilled his mission when he led Chewbacca's forces into a trap engineered at Okikuti, though the party managed to escape and ventured closer to Darcc's base. Darcc, meanwhile, continued his quest to remove the presence of the natives. Working together with Bossk, a retired Trandoshan bounty hunter, Darcc managed to strike and capture another tribe of Wookiee villagers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Chewbacca's army, now a sizable team of warriors, destroyed the three Imperial signal jammers blocking communications from leaving the planet, Solo relayed a mission to the New Republic, alerting them to the Empire's actions on Kashyyyk.

Holed up in his Palace, Darcc's armies and his Trandoshan allies prepared for the oncoming invasion. However, the Wookiee force proved even more powerful than Darcc expected, and Chewbacca and his allies pushed through the defenses of the Imperial garrison. Not long after, Darcc's own Palace came under Wookiee siege, and was eventually demolished."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Control terminated"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darcc escaped the destruction of his Palace through a secret passageway. Meeting with Pekt, Darcc attempted to escape the planet with as many slaves as possible.

The delay caused by the fight with Weebacca allowed the Moff and the Trandoshan to escape the planet, their shuttle's cargo hold filled with enslaved Wookiees. Chewbacca, determined to end the threat once and for all, commanded his forces to follow the transport that was destined for the space station Avatar Orbital Platform, a large shipping center specializing in slave dealings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darcc and Pekt took refuge within a fortress on the Avatar platform. There, the two waited and coordinated attacks on Chewbacca's landing party. The timely arrival of Rogue Squadron, led by Luke Skywalker, and the Millennium Falcon, piloted by Lando Calrissian, increased the pressure on Moff Darcc. Eventually, the combined efforts of the airborne aid and the ground-based attacks proved to be too much for the fortress, and both Darcc and Pekt were forced to evacuate the building. However, the Moff and slaver were soon after killed and his remains were obliterated after the destruction of the facility, caused by combined strikes from the Wookiees, Rogue Squadron, and the Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darcc was an extremely ambitious man with a desire for power. Given the proper resources, Darcc was able to use situations to rise in rank, gaining favor with his peers, until another opportunity arose where he could further increase his standing. When given the opportunity, he did not hesitate to proclaim ownership over something, specifically the planet Kashyyyk. With his position of power, Darcc would build extravagant structures for his own use."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darcc also saw the necessity of forming alliances; in order to remove the native Wookiees from the planet, he relied on the Trandoshan Pekt for assistance. Weebacca the Wookiee was also allied with the Imperials during Darcc's reign as Moff, even though the Wookiee species was in fact Darcc's target for elimination from the planet. Still, he considered these alliances disposable, as he made no effort to aid Weebacca when he came under attack; Darcc instead focused on his own escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darcc first appeared in the 2001 real-time strategy video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, where he served as one of the main antagonists for the Wookiee campaign. Players were often tasked in the later missions to follow a trail leading to an eventual confrontation with the Moff, including bouts through his Imperial garrison and a trip into space, until his final doom on Avatar Orbital Platform. Later, Darcc was given a mention in the James Luceno-written book Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader, as an officer and captain serving under Wilhuff Tarkin, then a Moff. In the book, Darcc welcomes Vader, and escorts the Sith Lord to Tarkin. Though Hindane Darcc was relegated to Star Wars Legends after The Walt Disney Company acquired the Star Wars brand, his service to Tarkin aboard the Executrix re-entered canon after a mention in the 2016 book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars Galaxies offers a chance for players to participate in the destruction of Avatar Orbital Platform. However, the timeline for this event contradicts the canon established by Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds, as Darcc's rise to the title of Moff only occurs after the Battle of Endor and Emperor Palpatine's demise, and Galaxies occurs before this battle. It is possible that the Avatar Platform the player destroys in Galaxies was a different platform completely, or a precursor to the Avatar Orbital Platform Moff Darcc controlled; no official explanation has been given."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
