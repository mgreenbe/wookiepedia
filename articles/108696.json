It used its color to attract its prey, which it rendered immobile by exuding a potent toxin. When the poison entered the system of most mammalian species, it caused excruciating pain and almost instant death in lower species. Any humanoid being coming in contact with the stingwort venom was plunged into anaphylactic shock, which could result in death if not treated immediately."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
