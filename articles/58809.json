The vine was considered a luxury foodstuff, as its leaves and fruit were harvested and fermented as the basis of Cassandran choholl, a potent liquor sought after throughout the galaxy. This amber liquid was known for its fragrant, fruity vapors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hafa vine grew on Garqi, where its cultivation was encouraged by the Imperial Procurator after the planet and all of the Cassander Worlds were annexed by the Galactic Empire shortly before the Battle of Yavin. Chine Gabbard, a botanist from Rehemsa, worked at Garqi Agricultural University, ostensibly trying to improve the crop yield of hafa vines. The project garnered much attention; however, few knew that Gabbard was actually working for the Empire, trying to create a bioweapon from hafa vines suitable for use on Imperial black ops missions. His work involved bioengineering hafa pollen to carry nerve agents, and he was close to recommending that the Empire seize Garqi and turn it into a mass manufacturing center for his bioweapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Downwind from Gabbard's research station was the Vlassy Nature Preserve, home to rdava-birds. Hafa pollen loaded with the nerve agent from Gabbard's experiments escaped his facility and killed off significant numbers of the birds, as well as several biologists who tried to investigate the avian deaths. A group of operatives hired by the scientists managed to break into Gabbard's facility and obtain the antidote before they too succumbed to the nerve agent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hafa species of vine was created for Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds, a roleplaying game sourcebook published by Wizards of the Coast in 2004.
