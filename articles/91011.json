Ben Skywalker acted as an interpreter for Jacen's \"telepathy\" as their guide, Testan ke Harran, nervously toured them around the facility. The adept Jedi detected uneasiness from their guide and fellow Adumari workers pertaining to a certain part of a wall. Astonishing their guide, Ben Skywalker cut open the hidden door where a further production facility was discovered to be manufacturing missiles which were not reported to the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being engaged by up to twenty Adumari guards, Skywalker managed to record evidence of the facility while his Master entered a pitched firefight. The two Jedi managed to escape the facility in a display of Force acrobatics around Cartann \u2013 destroying an odd Adumari starfighter and killing its pilot in the process. Skywalker then transmitted the evidence gained by the investigation while two Jedi took off for Coruscant in Jacen Solo's modified Lambda-class shuttle.
