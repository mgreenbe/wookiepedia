Once loaded in the weapon, each shell was charged by an ionic pulse regulator to energize the plasma inside. The shell could be fully charged in ten minutes, but a partial charge could take as little as two minutes. Upon contact with the target, the shell burst open, scattering the plasma particles which reacted with the atmosphere, causing a localized blast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
