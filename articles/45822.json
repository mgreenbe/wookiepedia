By the time of the Clone Wars, the droid had become the champion of the Arena. When Jedi Master Luminara Unduli came to the gladiator ring looking for the location of a secret CIS factory that Mondo-Mod had gained access to, Mondo-Mod said he would give her the data, if she agreed to a challenge. The Jedi had to beat his three best fighters with out using a lightsaber or any Force powers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After defeating the Arenas' first two fighters, the weary Luminara faced Evil Supreme, the \"Droid to End All Droids\". Although nearly everyone thought that the giant robot was going to win, Luminara surprised them all when she simply picked up a pebble from the ground and kicked it through Evil Supreme's head. The gladiator droid was immediately incapacitated by the pebble and it is unknown if it was ever repaired afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
