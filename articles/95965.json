Traveling to Iktotch to meditate and study the Force, Kame constructed a retreat into the mountains of the moon and spent a decade in seclusion. During this time, Kame worked to develop a tool to make up for the species-wide lack of telekinesis in Iktotchi. Constructing the Herder's Gauntlets and imbuing them with the Force, Kame stitched them from the hide and horns of a native ungulate. Despite the isolation, Kame occasionally had visitors from a nearby village, who brought the Jedi Master food and other supplies in order to receive advice from the wise master. Possessing a sense of humor, Kame became an icon among the village's children, who sought him out as a wise elder. The visits by the children eventually helped him complete the Gauntlet, as he realized that his application of the Force had been wanting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
