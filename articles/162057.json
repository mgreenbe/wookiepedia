In 7 ABY, the Galactic Empire maintained a high level of security at the shipyards, where the Sluissi engineer Ten Dorne, who had deserted from the Rebel Alliance years prior, was stationed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That year, New Republic General Airen Cracken mentioned the Vosteltig ship yards in Wanted by Cracken, a datafile that served as a compilation of reports on various threats to that government. In a personal addendum to an entry dedicated to Dorne, Cracken noted the threat posed by the Sluissi's knowledge of New Republic military technology and the engineer's presence at the Imperial facility. Due to the shipyards' security, no attempt had been made by the New Republic to apprehend Dorne by that time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vosteltig ship yards were mentioned in the 1993 sourcebook Wanted by Cracken, written by Louis J.
