Upon arrival, pilots Wedge Antilles, Luke Skywalker, and Leia Organa were almost immediately ambushed by an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, which dispatched a squadron of TIE/IN interceptors to deal with the Rebels. Antilles ordered the group to the planet's surface, where Organa was shot down, taking a TIE with her in the process. She managed to climb out and kill the pilot of the downed TIE. The Imperials then sent out TIE/sa bombers to search for the Rebels, forcing them to make a hasty escape through a polar storm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
