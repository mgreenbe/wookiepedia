This little-known species had the unusual ability to regenerate body parts. This made them good at combat. Due to their violent nature, they often took positions as bodyguards and even bounty hunters. They had a reputation for being merciless violent people caring only about themselves and vast wealth, which they saw as an indication of social status. They also had a great fondness for gemstones. Their natural habitat was desert or wastelands. At least three members of the species were officials in the Galactic Senate during the Invasion of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
