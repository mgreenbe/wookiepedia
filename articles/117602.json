First, the kings and queens of Naboo were limited to two four-year terms as monarch. This measure proved unpopular, possibly because of the popularity of two-term Queen Amidala, and was dropped by Queen Kylantha's reign. Governors and Senators had no term limits. Naboo has had multiple teenage rulers, the most notable of which was the fourteen-year-old Amidala. The rule of the Royal Naboo government was briefly interrupted by the invasion of the Trade Federation in 32 BBY, until the invasion ended later that year. This also led to closer ties between the Naboo and the Gungans who shared their world, resulting in a group of Gungan representatives and bureaucrats being sent to the Galactic Senate. After the declaration of the Galactic Empire, a Moff was also appointed to rule over Naboo and the rest of the Chommell sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known Royal Houses"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
