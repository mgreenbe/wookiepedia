The guards protected guild interests, including guild controlled space and refineries. Armed with E-11 blaster rifles, guards wore bright-blue uniforms with yellow stripes on the sleeves, pant legs, and torso. The Mining Guild emblem was located on the chest area. Guards also wore yellow and blue helmets with opaque green visors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At guild refineries, the guards acted as ground troops, enforcing Mining Guild whims with force. In order to protect guild controlled territory, the guards flew modified TIE/ln space superiority starfighters which were simply referred to as Mining Guild TIE fighters, which were identifiable by their modified solar panels and yellow color schemes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two locations that the guards patrolled were the Sereeda Waypoint near the planet Yarma and a Clouzon-36 gas refinery located on a planetoid located within an asteroid belt.

The purrgil ate the natural Clouzon-36 gas, as it allowed them to travel through hyperspace. However in doing so the purrgil inhibited the guild's mining operation. In response to the purrgil, Boss Yushyn ordered the Mining Guild guards under his command to eliminate the purrgil in their entirety. A pair of Rodian guards set up a blaster cannon on a tripod and carried out the order by trying to blast the purrgil as they ate up the gas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the guards dealt with the purrgil, Mining Guild TIE fighters that had been patrolling the the asteroid belt encountered the starship Ghost, which belonged to a band of rebels referred to as the Spectres. A dogfight ensued which saw two of the guild pilots perish. As it happened, the Ghost was low on power and fuel, and as such the crew let the remaining TIE fighter escape in order to conserve power. In search of resources, however, the Ghost followed the Mining Guild TIE back to the refinery. Upon arriving, the rebels attempted to abduct Clouzon-36 gas for themselves. During the heist, Yushyn and several Mining Guild guards cornered rebel Ezra Bridger. Yushyn ordered the rebels to stand down, but with the help of the purrgil the Ghost crew managed to turn the tables. The Ghost received the supplies it needed, the remaining TIE fighters were destroyed, and Yushyn was dragged away by a purrgil. Despite the efforts of the guards, the refinery was ultimately destroyed by the rebels."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Skirmish at the Sereeda Waypoint"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later during the year 2 BBY, Mining Guild starfighters encountered the crew of the Ghost again in the Sereeda Waypoint. The rebels were en route to the planet Yarma on a mission to scout out the Galactic Empire's salvage yard at Reklam Station. However, in order to reach Yarma the rebels had to pass through Mining Guild territory. After dropping out of hyperspace in a vessel called the Phantom, the rebels were immediately intercepted by an Aurore class freighter that was flanked by two Mining Guild TIE fighters. The captain of the larger ship attempted to communicate with the rebels, but upon being ignored the guild fighters sprung into action. The skirmish was swiftly brought to an end when the Phantom destroyed the fighter escorts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As it happened, Bridger was aboard the Phantom, and felt it wise that the unarmed Mining Guild ship be destroyed with its fighters.
