The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. His existence contradicted several other canon sources that claim only nine Gamorreans worked in the palace. This was further contradicted by the fact that Jubnuk, Thug, Thok, Warlug, Ghana Gleemort, and Grissom were not in the game, suggesting that a total of nineteen Gamorrean guards worked in Jabba's palace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
