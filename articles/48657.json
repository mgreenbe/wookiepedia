Born in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, the First Order claimed legitimacy as a successor state to the Empire. As with its predecessor, the fascist state was dominated by a ruling political and military human elite. As a polity, the First Order was ruled by a Supreme Leader from their mobile headquarters instead of a traditional planetary capital. It grew from a hermit state to the dominant galactic power, having gradually colonized large swathes of the Unknown Regions and boosted by secessionists from the New Republic, annexing the territory that would serve a crucial role in the regime's plan to eventually seize the galaxy at large.

The First Order drew inspiration and power from a dark and ancient legacy, whereas the New Republic endeavored to create a democratic and demilitarized galaxy.\nThough its ranks initially consisted of former Imperial personnel, a new generation of young zealous officers, including General Armitage Hux and Captain Phasma, rose to power under the patronage of Supreme Leader Snoke, supplanting the old guard which consisted of Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, General Brendol Hux, and Captain Cardinal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 29 ABY, the Centrists\u2014a coalition of worlds that advocated for centralized rule\u2014joined the secretive and enigmatic First Order after seceding from the New Republic.

Having transformed the planet Ilum into a superweapon known as Starkiller Base, the First Order launched a preemptive strike against the Republic Senate, annihilating Hosnian Prime along with other worlds in the Hosnian system.

With the Final Order's Xyston-class Star Destroyers, the First Order nearly completed its transformation into a true empire.

These computers used information derived from Grand Admiral Thrawn, who hailed from the Chiss Ascendancy, and the survey teams and probe droids that the Emperor had previously sent to explore these routes.

Their journey took several months and consisted of many short hyperspace jumps, during which time Sloane discovered that the Imperialis had been transmitting coordinates to other Imperial fleets. Upon regrouping with the Eclipse, Sloane ordered the Sentinel piloting the Imperialis to bring the ship in and rejoin with the others.

Chancellor Mothma then issued another declaration designating all surviving Imperial officers as war criminals, while the Empire had began to break into remnants.

The First Order had used a militia group called the Amaxine warriors as proxies to fund the Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di's cartel to achieve this. Seven years prior to the \"Napkin Bombing\" at the New Republic senatorial complex on Hosnian Prime, the First Order used the Amaxines to inject billions of credits as start-up capital into Rinnrivin's cartel, turning the hitherto minor cartel into a major crime syndicate. Establishing a mutual relationship with the Amaxines, Rinnrivin embarked on lucrative smuggling and gambling operations with the proceeds being channeled through shadowy corporations and Centrist sources back to the First Order, which used the money to rebuild its fleet. In addition, the Order also recruited several Centrist senators like Lady Carise Sindian as clandestine agents who worked to subvert the Republic from within. Many Centrists, an informal faction who were the rivals to the Populists in the Republic's Galactic Senate, and who favored a greater central government and military, admired the Old Empire's leaders and practices. Another proxy of the First Order was Arliz Hadrassian, a former TIE fighter pilot who had become the leader of the Amaxine warriors.

Hadrassian killed herself after assassinating the Republic senator Tai-Lin Garr. While most Republic senators and the media believed that the demise of Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxines eliminated all threats to the Republic, Senator Organa disagreed with the New Republic's complacency.

The Resistance acted as a check on the military designs of the First Order. General Organa released the Grace Report to the New Republic Senate, which publicly claimed that the Order was building hidden shipyards, armories, research-and-development labs, and academies, detailing the fact that facilities were working day and night on the massive military buildup.

With the help of the unwilling spy, Oddy Muva, Terex planted a tracker on Dameron's T-70 X-wing starfighter. A skirmish took place on the skies over Ovanis and the Cave of the Cr\u00e8che, which was complicated by the presence of the Cr\u00e8che cult and the hatching of two winged creatures. Ultimately, Terex and his landing force were defeated. The Cr\u00e8che elder gave the information on Tekka to Dameron.

Though Grakkus had made a deal with Terex to disclose the information, Grakkus changed his mind and decided to sell the information to whoever got him out first. Incensed at Grakkus' double-cross, Terex hired the crime lords Isin, Kan Be, and Toren to use their gangs to storm Grakkus' fortress and kill Black Squadron. He planned to interrogate Grakkus and then kill him. Grakkus' plan was, however, foiled by Black Squadron's astromech droids including BB-8, who deactivated Megalox's gravity shield.

There, he retook control of the Ranc gang, which he had helped create after the Battle of Jakku. Against Captain Phasma's orders, Terex decided to use his Ranc gang to destroy Poe and the Resistance. His plan involved giving false intelligence on the First Order to the Resistance droid spy N1-ZX and tracking Dameron back to the Resistance base.

To this end, recruits abandon their previous lives and identities upon their induction into the First Order and submit to being identified by a numerical code. Senior officers and distinguished members of the Stormtrooper Corps, such as Phasma and Cardinal, were not expected to do so. First Order citizens were educated to believe it had been the pursuit of individual selfishness and desires that led the Rebel Alliance to topple the galaxy-uniting Empire. They were also taught that the Rebels were short-sighted terrorists who could not see the benefit of the Empire, and instead started a war that forced the Empire to crack down on personal liberties in response. Despite this doctrine, First Order military training heavily emphasized individual strength and improvisation, both physically and mentally. Training programs that were mandatory for all recruits beginning at a young age became progressively more severe as they grew to adulthood.
