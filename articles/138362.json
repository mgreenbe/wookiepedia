Intended for use against ground infantry and aircraft, the tank was armed with laser cannons and flak pods. The T1-B was lightly armored and came equipped with a deflector shield. Though the shields did not last long under sustained fire, they did protect the tank from damage sustained from lightly armed vehicles. Later improvements to the T1-B formed the T3-B heavy attack tank, known as a 'heavy hover tank'."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "T1-B tanks were used by the Alliance Army during several missions in the Galactic Civil War, including the Battle of Kalaan, the Evacuation of Yavin, the Reytha campaign, the Battle of Geddes, the Battle of Zaloriis and the Battle of Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
