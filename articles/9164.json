It was operated by the Comet Broom Service, who used it as a navigational monitoring post, to watch the Cularin comet cloud. During the Clone Wars, the Dark Jedi Garth Ezzar traveled to the station and murdered the Wookiee co-owners of the Comet Broom Service. Garth Ezzar then turned the station into a gentlemens club for wandering explorers. All the credits made were put towards Garth Ezzar's own personal fleet of ships that would be used as escorts for the top paying customer. The station soon became extremely popular, making Garth Ezzar very rich and quite powerful."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
