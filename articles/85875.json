The Imperials were caught off guard, but reacted quickly by having the teezl transmit interference on all communication channels but the Imperial war band. This prevented the Rebels from being able to use their special communicators to recognize each other. However, the Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker positioned his fighter to target Giel's battleship, and opened fire disabling the ship and destroying the teezl. Malka panicked as a result, but Giel calmly took command and dispatched a squad of fighters to capture Skywalker. But the Rebel leader escaped and both Giel and Malka were demoted and reassigned to Golrath Station as a result of their failure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Months later, a Rebel Alliance operation led by Princess Leia Organa sabotaged Golrath Station, causing the reactor core of the facility to overload and explode.
