Decades before the First Order/Resistance War, under the Galactic Republic, they charted the planet Crait, and were assigned the responsibility for its exploitation. They built an enormous blast door to protect their operations from seasonal crystalstorms as well as large predatory carnivores. The enterprise was discontinued shortly afterward, however, and the group departed Crait, with the Mining Guild leaving their equipment abandoned rather than pay for a salvage team."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
