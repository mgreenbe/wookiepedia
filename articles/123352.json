Dooku taught Tann the use of the dark side of the Force, and she became one of his most trusted underlings. When the war broke out, Tann fought at Geonosis and later commandeered the Kaer Orbital Platform for Separatist use.

Tann was then sent to oversee Decimator construction on Krant, but was pursued by Jedi Master Echuu Shen-Jon, whose Padawan Tann had killed at Geonosis. After Shen-Jon destroyed the Decimator-producing foundries, Tann kidnapped his new Padawan, Naat Reath, and fled.

She was one of very few Force-sensitive Chiss on record, with an uncanny ability to predict her enemy's movements. Tann attended the Chiss Academy, studying military strategy and tactics. One of Tann's professors once challenged her with training a group of Yresilini, considered an untrainable species into a cohesive, organized army. She started by choosing one of the creatures to be her \"general,\" and teaching him a number of simple commands. Her general and his comrades laughed at her efforts; in response, Tann had him executed on the spot, with his would-be troops present, and appointed a second general, who was taught same rudimentary commands. The successor was far more co-operative than the first, leading the troops to follow her orders implicitly, for which Tann received high marks. The story of her taming of the Yresilini was later repeated by troops under her command. Tann became a talented military tactician, with a large repertoire of strategic and tactical knowledge and an innovative mind, which some believed was furthered by her ability to use the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tann eventually became one of few Chiss to leave Chiss Space, along with her lover, Vandalor, brought to Republic space by Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith. Historians of a later era speculated that Thrawn, an officer in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force who was in contact with Sidious, had alerted the Dark Lord to Tann and Vandalor's existence. Historians were unsure whether it was an attempt to remove Tann from a dangerous situation on Csilla or merely to provide Sidious with a tactician he could have confidence in. Tann became a Dark Acolyte of Count Dooku, Sidious' Sith apprentice, studying the dark side of the Force under him and learning how to wield a lightsaber. She quickly won the trust of her master and several other prominent Separatist leaders with many successes in missions, becoming a general in the Confederacy and the leader of Dooku's Dark Acolytes."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The war begins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tann had joined Dooku during a period known as the Separatist Crisis, and the count was preparing to wage war on the Republic. In 22 BBY, he contacted Tann, informing her that he was en route to the planet Geonosis in the Outer Rim Territories to secure the support of the final constituents of the Confederacy. However, Dooku had foreseen a battle taking place on the planet, and wanted to take the necessary precautions; he ordered Tann to travel to Geonosis and be ready to secure his escape should Dooku need to flee the impending battle. As the count had predicted, a battle did occur, with the Jedi and their newly formed Grand Army of the Republic clashing with Dooku's droid armies, beginning the Clone Wars. Dooku fled the initial battleground, the Geonosians' Petranaki arena, and was making his way to his swoop bike, which would take him to his ship, located in a hangar some distance away from the arena. To reach his swoop, Dooku had to travel through a narrow valley, wherein skirmishes were taking place between small groups of CIS and Republic forces. Tann, along with a number of B2 super battle droids, made her way through the canyon, leading her forces and defeating the few pockets of clone troopers present. As she went, Tann ordered the remaining CIS forces which had been fighting to join her group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Resistance was light, consisting mostly of clone troopers and several Clone Personal Walkers, which Tann and her droids were able to dispatch with ease. Tann eventually came upon a number of CIS OG-9 homing spider droids defending themselves against Republic All Terrain Tactical Enforcers, but again these posed no problems to Tann and her burgeoning forces, and she also slew a Jedi Padawan. Eventually, with the valley entirely cleared of any Republic threats, Dooku passed through, congratulating Tann on her success. However, the count had been pursued by a number of Jedi, including Plo Koon, Ki-Adi-Mundi, Echuu Shen-Jon, and Shen-Jon's Padawan, Stam Reath. Dooku fled, and all the Jedi bar Reath went to try and intercept him; the young Reath approached Tann, demanding that she drop her weapon. Amused, Tann stabbed Reath with her lightsaber, mocking his master and escaping before the Jedi could attack her.

He chose the Kaer Orbital Platform in the Outer Rim as the base of operations for the army's construction; an old InterGalactic Banking Clan manufacturing plant which had long since been abandoned, it contained many large stockpiles of raw resources which had been abandoned by the Banking Clan after interference from the Hutt Cartel. It also housed a number of deactivated production centers which Dooku ordered Tann to capture. The Chiss general would remain at Kaer until she and her Geonosian workers had amassed a formidable army.

However, Dooku contacted Tann to inform her that the Jedi had learned of her presence on the orbital platform, and Tann's scouts discovered a Republic base on the station, as well as a grounded Acclamator-class assault ship. The Republic forces were led by Jedi General Jor Drakas, and Tann opted not to fight, but to take her fresh army and leave the station immediately.

Boorka was willing to sell to the highest bidder, and Tann was charged with persuading him to deal with the CIS. Time was short, so Dooku cleared her to meet any of Boorka's demands in exchange for the information\u2014they would not necessarily honor their agreements.

He informed Tann that the Republic\u2014wanting to get in on the lucrative Outer Rim trading in order to help fund the Clone Wars\u2014had built a heavily fortified spaceport just outside of Mos Osnoe, which disrupted his own criminal activities. Boorka agreed to hand over all the information he possessed about the Republic project if Tann and her forces destroyed the spaceport. Knowing that the spaceport was well-defended, Tann opted to build a temporary base on Tatooine; she ordered a detachment of droids to raid a local camp of Jawa scavengers and steal a number of droids that could help them build the camp. Her battle droids did as instructed, destroying the Jawas' sandcrawler and retrieving numerous droids which helped them construct a base camp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After preparing her forces, Tann launched an attack on the Republic trading outpost and spaceport. The Republic defended it with clone troopers, Jedi, and even a number of locals in an attempt to repel Tann's attack, but she proved too strong for them, and was able to destroy the spaceport in what was her first real taste of combat under Dooku. Boorka was delighted, and, as agreed, provided her with the information, which she sent straight to Dooku. The Republic was developing a type of weapon, known simply as Decimators, at a secret testing facility on remote, inhospitable Eredenn Prime. Because the planet was so far from any potential Republic reinforcements, Dooku sent Tann and her forces there immediately to investigate further. She was ordered to scour the planet and capture any Decimators, ensuring none were destroyed\u2014Dooku wanted to preserve the possibility of the CIS using them against the Republic\u2014and discover where they were being manufactured before being transferred for testing to Eredenn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tann's scouts soon located the first small Decimator construction facility, capturing it but ensuring no damage came to the Decimators themselves. The Separatist analysts present were unable to decipher the operational codes, so the Decimators were unusable. Tann contacted Dooku to inform him of this; he told her to carry on with her mission as before, and that the codes could likely be found by hacking into the databases of the Republic's control centers. Tann located the second Decimator site, before finally finding the third, larger base, wherein the control center was located, in the mountains to the north. Tann penetrated the Republic's meager defenses and ultimately captured the base. They found a protocol droid in whose memory banks the Decimators' operational codes were stored, but they were heavily encrypted, and Tann's analysts could not use them. However, they did learn from the droid that the Decimators were being manufactured by the Wookiees on their colony world, Alaris Prime.

They set down on a small island in a lake, which was surrounded by five Wookiee colonies, though did so stealthily enough to not be noticed. The Wookiees had established a long-range communication tower, defended by clone troopers; Tann was advised to disable it, to ensure no Republic reinforcements would arrive. Her forces destroyed the communication tower, and scouts later discovered the Decimator facilities, guarded by Republic forces, to the east. After the Republic's defenses were terminated, Tann escorted the droid to the facility, where the Separatists were able to decrypt the codes contained within the droid's memory.

With his new weapon, Dooku was ready to attack the Republic where they least expected it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku's target was the volcanic, inhospitable world of Sarapin, located in the Core Worlds. Sarapin generated enough geothermal energy to provide the Core Worlds with 80% of their power, making it an important Republic planet. Protected by a fortified defensive grid and a strong shield, whose energy was relayed from the system's asteroid field, it was one of the most heavily defended planets in the galaxy, and attacking it was an ambitious move for Dooku. Tann assembled an elite task force, consisting of many Confederacy Cruisers, strong ships that could help the Separatist forces navigate the asteroid fields, Geonosian Nantex-class starfighters, and transports laden with ground troops and Geonosian construction workers, as well as Tann's personal starfighter. Tann was ordered to destroy the power relay on Asteroid 426, which would collapse Sarapin's shield and leave it vulnerable to further attacks. The asteroid was heavily guarded, though; the surrounding, smaller asteroids were littered with heavy turrets, and there were Republic ground forces\u2014consisting of clone infantry, Jedi, and vehicles\u2014as well as starfighters posted on Asteroid 426, guarding the power relay. However, there was also a supply depot containing enough resources for Tann and her task force to construct a base on the asteroid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tann's task force made it to Asteroid 426, destroying or avoiding all the turrets in their path. Her droids destroyed the Republic supply depots on the near side of the asteroid, allowing the Geonosian workers to harvest the stockpiled resources stored there by the Republic. Tann had a base constructed, building up her forces and defending the base from occasional strikes by small groups of Republic forces, sent from the other side of the asteroid, where the power relay was located. Eventually, when she deemed her forces sufficient to overwhelm the Republic presence on the asteroid, Tann launched an attack at the power relay, though unlike in previous campaigns, she did not lead from the front with the infantry, opting to pilot her starfighter instead. The CIS triumphed over the Republic in the battle, destroying the power relay and taking with it Sarapin's shields, leaving the vital world ripe for attack.

However, while the planet was relatively undefended and there for the taking, its volatile nature threatened to make Tann's efforts all the more arduous. Dangerous, unpredictable lava flows and harsh conditions, as well as native predators, were all obstacles to be overcome if Tann was to be successful in her mission. The main energy repositories\u2014which Tann sought to capture\u2014were located atop Mount Corvast, a large volcano, alongside the massive Mount Corvast Citadel. Corvast was well-defended, though, with a thick web of Republic forces surrounding it and four major Republic military installations located between Tann's position and the volcano.

Mount Corvast's defenses were primarily geared towards repelling attacks from the air, with many anti-air units, so Tann opted to build up her ground forces instead. As well as destroying the Mount Corvast Citadel, Tann was to destroy all drill platforms between her base and Mount Corvast, further disrupting the Republic, though she was to take precautions to ensure that the planet's collection repositories remained intact, so that the Confederacy could make use of them after they had fully captured the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having prepared her forces, Tann sent her battle droids to attack the first Republic military installation.

Traveling over the walkways and blowholes via air transports was ruled out because of the Republic anti-air units. The Separatists eventually arrived at the first Republic installation, protected by a number of AT-TEs, infantry, and IG-series assassin droids, but Tann's forces were able to overcome them, with the advantage given to them by the Decimators. The second Republic camp was larger and more spread out, but aside from turrets, was relatively undefended, and Tann's forces again razed it. As they moved, they destroyed the Republic energy drills. The third and fourth Republic camps were lightly armed and posed no problem for Tann."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tann and her forces then clashed with the Republic defenses posted on the slopes of Mount Corvast, which consisted of further AT-TEs and mounted clone troopers.

Tann's forces entered the base, routing the remaining Republic forces. When the Separatists began getting close to the citadel, reinforcements under the command of Jedi Knight Jor Drakas attacked Tann. She was able to defeat them, slaying Drakas personally and ending the Republic's defense of the planet. Sarapin was in Separatist hands, its collection repositories ready for Separatist use; the Mount Corvast Citadel was destroyed, as was Sarapin's geothermal generators, vaporized by the Decimators.

She would oversee operations there, in preparation for her next assignment from Dooku, while Zian Finnis was placed in charge of Separatist operations on Sarapin. Tann traveled to Krant, establishing a base there. The maze-like base was heavily defended and located in the midst of an expansive jungle, though Tann's efforts were occasionally disrupted by native Wookiee colonists.
