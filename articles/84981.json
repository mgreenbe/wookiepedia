He would distinguish himself across many battlefronts, most notably on Dantooine, though he would distinguish himself on Ryloth, Null, Boz Pity and Haruun Kal amongst others. In the final days of the war, Windu confronted and cornered Darth Sidious in a difficult duel, after being informed by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker that Sidious and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine were the same person.

Jedi anthropologists, who were studying the fact that all the Korunnai could touch the Force, asked the Windu clan if they might take a child back to the Jedi Order to regain the Korunnai's connection to the Force. Since his parents had already died in the jungles, Windu was given to the Jedi when he was six standard months old. Having not been old enough for his naming day within the tribe, the Order bestowed upon him a name as he entered the Academy. Like all in the Order, the young Korun boy was taught by Grand Master Yoda when he was a learner, and eventually went on to become a Padawan to another Jedi.

While on this mission, Windu was at first chased away by the natives that resided there, but was easily able to resist them using the Force. When he caused one of the fragile natives to shatter, he sobered, and painstakingly restored it using the Force. Learning a valuable lesson about being a Jedi, then he was rewarded by the natives with a violet-colored Hurrikaine crystal. He used this crystal to construct the lightsaber he had seen in his visions and it produced its distinctive violet blade. He would alternate between this weapon and a blue lightsaber he created himself. He also used Eeth Koth's lightsaber, which he obtained when the two Jedi Masters exchanged their sabers during the sacred Concordance of Fealty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next decade and a half, Windu went on many notable missions that included his first visit to his homeworld, Haruun Kal (during which he learned his native Korun language), and one where he tracked down and defeated the killer Uda-Khalid.

He had held his own against an improved Ventress in their second encounter, even if they had been forced to end it prematurely by circumstantial factors. Though he stated that Depa Billaba's bladework potentially surpassed his and while she was even more formidable than she usually was due to tapping into the deaths of many of Kar Vastor's guards, Windu was still able to hold off her and eventually lure her into destroying the spaceport's signal jammer in their ferociously intense duel. However, he clearly had to put in great effort in fighting her and was close to being defeated; both combatants were severely hampered by physical weakness, so the fight would have been close. Windu also managed to duel equally with Sora Bulq, despite his claims of having improved from having perfected Vaapad with the dark side. Windu even managed to disarm Darth Sidious himself, but he openly acknowledged that they would have fought to a draw otherwise; furthermore, he never fully realized that he was drawing upon Anakin Skywalker's fear at the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Known for having fully mastered all the seven combat forms and every stance and technique of lightsaber combat, alongside Sora Bulq, Windu developed the deadly form of combat known as Vaapad, the seventh form of combat which completed (to the Jedi) the Juyo form. Vaapad was named after a predator native to the moons of Sarapin, which was intentionally created to allow him and those he trusted with the form to channel the darkness within and also that of the enemy to use against them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Windu was the only Jedi to fully master Vaapad, though Quinlan Vos could count as a close second. The other two practitioners of the style, Sora Bulq and Depa Billaba, were unable to master it\u2014instead, it mastered them, driving them insane and leading them to the dark side. When Windu went to Haruun Kal in search for Depa, he displayed masterful skill in Jar'Kai, effectively adapting Vaapad into dual-blade combat. Although Windu primarily used Vaapad, he at times also applied his mastery of the other forms to supplement his use of the form he created with aspects from other forms. In addition to using a Form V opening stance in the middle of his battle with Darth Sidious, Windu was highly proficient in deflection, which likely showed outstanding skill in either Soresu or Shien, as shown by how he was one of the few Jedi to survive the Battle of Geonosis, deflecting any shot sent at him by the overwhelmingly massive droid forces in order to survive long enough for Yoda and the clones to aid. He also displayed proficiency in applying Force attacks in his lightsaber sequence, apparently showing his superb mastery of Niman.

He was known for his resistance to the lures of the dark side, channeling his inner darkness into his attacks to help him serve the light side of the Force. This allowed him to utilize some of the darkest powers known to either Jedi or Sith without succumbing to his aggression, such as the terrible Force Crush. His mastery of the form he created, Vaapad, also proved his devotion to the light, as the only two other advanced users, Depa Billaba and Sora Bulq, fell to the dark side. Master Windu was known to be able to ponder matters of the dark and light sides of the Force with a clarity perhaps second only to Master Yoda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Windu was known to be highly proficient in using the Force to enhance the capabilities of his body, and as such, was able to leap to great heights and across enormous distances. On Haruun Kal, he went toe-to-toe with Kar Vastor, and demonstrated incredible Force enhanced speed by landing six blows to the man's body before he could blink; however, for all his speed, he could not come to the aid of his fellow Jedi Masters in time when Darth Sidious made the first move. On Dantooine, having lost his lightsaber, Windu took to tearing super battle droids apart with his bare hands, showing incredible Force strength and resilience as he crushed armor and tore out circuitry with his fingers.

He also demonstrated the ability to simultaneously levitate two clone troopers with the Force and move them swiftly across the length of a bridge. In addition, Windu proved able to release a torrent of Force energy capable of blasting several droids backwards and powerful enough to destroy them on impact with the ground. He even telekinetically removed the bolts of a super battle droid during the Battle of Dantooiee, allowing the droid to fall to pieces. He was incredibly proficient in the application of the Force Wave power, and used it to an incredible degree during the battles of Dantooine and Coruscant; blasting away and instantly destroying hundreds of droids away from him with a single kinetic blast. The Jedi Master also demonstrated an affinity for using darker telekinetic powers, such as Force Grip and Force Crush, the later of which he used to severely injure the fearsome General Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aiding Windu throughout his life was also his shatterpoint ability, a power he always had a natural affinity for. It allowed him to see weak points in opponents, events, and everyday life. This power also allowed a Jedi to shatter otherwise unbreakable objects by channeling the Force into the places of the object that bound it together.
