For a Jedi hunter like the Inquisitor, this function likely served as a way to intimidate, or frighten opponents, as well as deflect any form of direct attack. On some occasion this function is known to catch opponents off balance. However, this was also the weapon's primary weakness, as a lightsaber-wielding opponent could simply permanently separate the emitter itself and sever the weapon in half, as was demonstrated by Lord Vader during his first duel with the Inquisitor and Kanan Jarrus during his final duel with the Inquisitor aboard the Sovereign. This is due to the hilt consisting of non-lightsaber resistant alloy or metal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The handgrip could be removed entirely from the ring-shaped emitter, allowing the Force-imbued circlet of metal to be used as a throwing disc."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grand Inquisitor wielded his lightsaber against Emperor Palpatine's new apprentice, the Sith Lord Darth Vader.

In a final battle against the Inquisitor, after his rescue, Jarrus split the Inquisitor's weapon in two, causing the pieces to fall down a shaft.
