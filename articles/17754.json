Blark managed to see the thief, and held a grudge against him. In 32 BBY, Blark mistakenly believed to have seen the thief in Rothe Gate, a weapon storage asteroid. Blark growled in Shyriwook and attacked the suspect with his baton and a crew of four people. Nobody in the asteroid did anything except betting, and mostly against Blark. The other party was not his fugitive, but a considerably resourceful mercenary who had worked previously for Nirama."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
