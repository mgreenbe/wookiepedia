In many humanoid societies, wearing a cape was a sign of nobility and power. That was notably the case on the planet of Serenno. For that reason, the life-supporting armor of Darth Vader was equipped with an armorweave cape, as a way to announce his special status as Emperor Palpatine's personal enforcer. Capes could also visually enlarge their wearers' silhouette to produce an intimidating effect."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, HoloNet News ran a piece in their \"Life Section\" titled \"Inside Fashion: Capes are Still Hot!\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lando Calrissian and Dooku typically wore capes as part of their outfit. General Grievous sometimes wore a cape as did some of his IG-100 MagnaGuard bodyguards. Pre Vizsla, Grievous's MagnaGuards, and some Senate Guards wore a cape on one shoulder only. Sith-style armor often had capes both as a sign of superiority over inferiors, and a way of concealing themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
