A fair-skinned man with blond hair and green eyes, Berusal wielded a magenta-colored lightsaber in battle like other Scions. After Emperor Arcann ordered the massacre of the Scions around the time of his ascension to the throne of the Eternal Empire, Berusal was among the few Scions who escaped the purge and settled in an enclave on the shadowport Asylum under the leadership of Heskal. In 3631 BBY, the Scions summoned the figure known as the Outlander to Asylum and tested the foreigner to determine why they could not see the Outlander's future. Along with other Scions, Berusal attacked the Outlander in a series of combat tests that ultimately revealed the presence of Valkorion, the Immortal Emperor, within the Outlander's mind. The Scions promised their loyalty to the Outlander, but Heskal later betrayed the Scions and the Outlander to Arcann and drew him to Asylum, as his visions led him to believe it was necessary to force a confrontation. Arcann massacred Berusal and the other Scions just before the Outlander's arrival, sparking the Battle of Asylum."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Berusal appears in Chapter VI: Asylum in Knights of the Fallen Empire, a 2015 Digital Expansion to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.
