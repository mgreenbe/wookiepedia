For this reason, Alliance tactical doctrine dictated that the High Command and the Alliance Fleet were generally not to be in the same place at the same time, since the Alliance could withstand the loss of either the Fleet or the High Command but not both. The most important members of the High Command were the various Supreme Allied Commanders, who had direct command and control of each facet of the Alliance military.
