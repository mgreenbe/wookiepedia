Bridger fails to hit the target, and the lesson is interrupted by Kanan Jarrus who is looking for him. He tells his apprentice that he is missing Jedi training, which is the same time he has blaster training. Bridger tells them both he cannot be in two places at once. Rex tells him that as a soldier he must learn to prioritize. Jarrus reminds Rex that Bridger is a Jedi not a soldier, only for Bridger to say that he may not wish to be either.

They need to find them a new supply of fuel cells to power the heat they need to survive otherwise the colonies will freeze to death. Bridger suggests they check out the black market, which Jarrus and everyone else agrees to. With the briefing over, the Rebels head out except Bridger and Chopper. Under Hera Syndulla's orders, Bridger and Chopper are left behind to clean the Ghost. While cleaning, Bridger begins voicing his frustration over the number of responsibilities he has to the Rebellion and sometimes misses the days when he was just a kid on the streets. Suddenly they receive a distress signal from Cikatro Vizago's ship, the Broken Horn. Bridger sees this as an opportunity to skip chores and square things with Vizago, since he owes him a favor.

Meanwhile Bridger comes across some of Vizago's droids, which all appear powerless. He finds his way to the main bridge, and instead of Vizago he meets Hondo Ohnaka, who reveals himself to as the new owner of Vizago's ship. When Ezra asks him about Vizago, Ohnaka reveals that he bet his ship and droids during a game of Sabacc and lost.

Bridger says they are hard to get a hold of, as well expensive. Ohnaka agrees, which is why he plans to sell them at a fair mark up at five hundred percent. Bridger agrees to help and in return gets a cut in power generators; three crates. After Ohnaka agrees to two crates and split the profit, they seal their deal with a handshake.

Apparently Azmorigan is not satisfied by this and has his men apprehend the two. Ohnaka and Bridger are handcuffed and placed onto a loading dolly. Azmorigan plans to launch them both into the vacuum of space, as the Rang Clan have placed a bounty on Ohnaka and he will make an additional profit from his death.

On the other hand, Ezra feels he would do better as a Pirate as Inquisitors don't hunt them. Just then, Bridger and Chopper hear something coming from the brig and to their surprise find Vizago locked inside one of his own cells.
