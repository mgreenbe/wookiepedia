The module made it possible for such droids to interface directly with various Imperial networks as well as deal with the often rare, shady, and completely undocumented Imperial contractors, such as the Ugnaughts on Bespin. There has been some speculation that the Emperor himself may have supplied the technological basis for the module. However, the initial variant of the TechSpan technology was also mildly buggy in that droid personalities using the module developed arrogance or haughtiness over time through defective metaprogramming."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
