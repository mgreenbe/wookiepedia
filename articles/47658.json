Although the two enjoyed relaxing with a cup of Mandallian Narcolethe, they were not blind to the Galactic Republic's constant disregard for their home planet's well-being. In the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Mandalore maintained their neutrality under the pacifistic New Mandalorians.

Having defected from the Grand Army of the Republic before it had even left Kamino, Spar arrived on Mandalore with none of the pro-Republic sentiment that had been drilled into his brother clones and became determined to resurrect the Mandalorian Supercommandos. When he began recruiting Mandalorian soldiers from the local police force, and Shysa and Dala were all too eager to sign up. Shysa began to spread rumors across Mandalore that Spar was the son of the late Jango Fett, hoping to utilize Jango's ferocious reputation as a warrior and Jedi killer as a rallying point for their troops and a symbol of fear to all outsiders. He would also encourage Spar to take the title of Mand'alor, becoming \"Mandalore the Resurrector\" and leader of the Mandalorians. Due to Spar's inherent physical similarities that came with being a clone of Fett, the recruits began to believe him to be Fett's son, and heir to the legacy of the True Mandalorians. Following their new Mand'alor, Shysa and Dala joined other local police and a dozen former Death Watch commandos to form the Mandalorian Protectors, one of the most formidable forces to fight for the CIS during the Clone Wars.

Following this engagement, the Protectors would carry out covert missions for the Confederacy. Around this time, and perhaps during one of these covert missions, Shysa had a run in with C-3PX, a formidable assassin droid. Following the encounter, the droid gave Shysa and the Mandalorians the inspiration to requisition a droid army for themselves. Using the Separatists' factories, the Protectors created a group of 1000 BL-series Battle Legionnaire droids armed with AAP-11 blaster boxes and capable of piloting deadly Mandalorian battle harnesses. With their new droid army, the Protectors charged into battle against the Republic, executing attacks on Null, New Holstice, and Zaadja.

The Mandalorians were almost entirely wiped out, including nearly all their Battle Legionnaire droids. Of their entire force, only three Mandalorians escaped the slaughter: Shysa, Dala, and Spar. Shysa and the others returned home to Mandalore where a shell-shocked and psychologically scarred Spar stepped down from his position of Mand'alor, though Shysa would make repeated attempts to persuade Spar to reclaim the title.

However, Fi was still recovering from a near fatal brain head injury and Parja declined for him. They would meet again in the following days, this time at the Oyu'baat tapcafe in Keldabe, where Shysa was meeting with Spar and another clone deserter by the name of Sull, who he had also asked to take up the position of Mand'alor and who had also refused. Shysa offered to buy the two drinks when he saw them enter, though Parja let him know they weren't there to discuss the issue of Fi being Mandalore. Undeterred, Shysa tried to convince Fi directly, laying out for him his feelings on Mandalore's need for a Fett heir so as to let the rest of the galaxy know the Mandalorians were still strong, still hoping to use Jango's defeat of six Jedi with his bare hands at Galidraan as a symbol of strength for Mandalore. When Parja suggested that Shysa himself take up the role, he humbly declared himself an \"odd-job man\" and a \"foot soldier\" and felt Mandalore needed more than that in a leader. Fi declined again and, seeing the man wouldn't be persuaded, Shysa let the issue drop with no hard feelings and wished him a speedy recovery. When a conflict arose between Sull and Fi's friend, the former Jedi-turned-Mandalorian Bardan Jusik upon the latter's arrival at the tapcaf, Shysa pulled Sull away bodily, and told them to sort out whatever problems they had over a friendly drink rather than brawl in the Oyu'baat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Clone Wars came to an end and Chancellor Palpatine declared himself Emperor and the Galactic Republic became the Galactic Empire, Shysa became aware of the Emperor's new scarred visage\u2014incurred in his duel with Mace Windu\u2014and found he now appeared remarkably similar to his Darth Sidious persona.

Shysa and Skirata discussed young Boba Fett, and Shysa indicated that he felt Boba could be Mand'alor, but Skirata nominated Shysa himself, stating that it was the general consensus that Shysa should take up the mantel. Shysa earnestly deflected the idea once again, saying that with the new Galactic Empire offering the Mandalorians paid work with no repercussions for their part on the opposing side during the war, the people would \"cheer for a bantha wearin' a buy'ce\". And it was such that the topic of the conversation turned quickly to Palpatine and the Empire, which was interested in building a base on the planet. Skirata thought it incredibly foolish to give the Empire a foothold on Mandalore, but Shysa claimed it would only be temporary and further explained that if they denied Palpatine the base, the clans would lose credits and the Empire might decide to set up a base anyway. Instead, Shysa suggested that Skirata and his fellow training sergeant associates could help train a guerrilla army should the deal go sour. Sidestepping the issue, Skirata instead returned to his attempts to sway Shysa into becoming Mand'alor. He felt that Shysa was the best candidate to give Mandalore focus and stated\u2014jokingly\u2014that with a haircut, he would make a fine Mand'alor. Shysa agreed to step up and become Mand'alor, but only if he didn't like the situation with the Empire and only to \"keep the seat warm until Boba shows up\". Even then, Shysa was eager to hope when Skirata revealed Jango Fett's sister, Arla, was still alive, insisting it might be good to have a female Mand'alor. Skirata was quick to shoot down the idea and Shysa soon apologized for asking so much of him so soon after his adopted daughter had died, offering his sympathy and condolences, and recognizing him as a good father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It wasn't long after their meeting that the Empire arrived to build its garrison and Shysa officially, and reluctantly, accepted the title of Mand'alor, unknown to nearly all that it was in response to his ill feelings toward the Imperial occupation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Dark Times"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Four weeks after the Republic's transformation into an empire, Shysa traveled to an old, derelict hunting lodge in Mandalore's Olankur region to meet again with Kal Skirata, far from the Imperial garrison being set up in Keldabe.

Shysa was personally concerned by the Empire's interest in purchasing the mining rights to mine for beskar metal in the Tokursh area. While the offer was lucrative\u2014eight hundred million credits\u2014neither man liked the idea of what Palpatine might use the lightsaber-resistant metal for; Shysa also informed Skirata of the Empire's wanted list of Jedi survivors, and its interest in worlds like Haruun Kal where Force-sensitivity was practically the norm. Shysa would also bring up his meeting with the former Jedi Bardan Jusik and, thinking of his people and planet first, subtly suggested that Jusik and any children he had, should they turn out to be Force-sensitive, would be a great asset to Mandalore. He also offered an invitation to any of Skirata's sons and friends, many of whom were other clone deserters, to spy on the Imperials due to their ease at passing for stormtroopers.

When the elder Mandalorian stated he had something to offer Mandalore, Shysa's first thought was that Skirata had come around and talked Jusik into aiding him. Skirata instead revealed that he and his people had developed an immunogen for the Empire's FG36 nanovirus which had recently been unleashed on the planet Gibad, killing every inhabitant. Shysa was concerned as to whether or not the immunogen\u2014itself a virus that was transmitted from person to person and induced a brief and mild sickness\u2014was safe considering Skirata's plan entailed spreading it across the planet discreetly so that the Imperials wouldn't catch on and develop something new. With Skirata's reassurances, having already exposed himself and his family to the cure, Shysa gave him his blessing and would tell the other clan leaders that there would be a \"little bug doing the rounds but that we'll be all the stronger for it\".

To recover their losses incurred during the fighting, Mandalore had legalized slavery, using Imperial sanctioned slavers to run the operation. With their own people being sold into servitude, the two Mandalorians were forced back into fighting once again, trying to rid their world of the Empire's grip. The government, though initially hostile to Shysa and Dala's presence, covertly aided the two soldiers, helping them to train special police units around the planet.

In this capacity, Shysa hired himself out to Doctor Follnor Callat, an archaeologist with questionable morals and something of a treasure hunter. Callat had been searching for the Alsakan Tessent, a valuable artifact with great worth to the native Alsakan people. Chasing a rumor that the Tessent had been with a Guard of Aldera who had inhabited the Ast Kikorie Station before its demise in a meteor shower, Callat, along with four of his associates and freelance operatives that included Shysa and an unidentified Blood Carver, arrived at Ast Kikorie to investigate.

Many of these new slaves were forced into hard labor at the Imperial headquarters at the City of Bone, crushing any spirit of resistance they might have retained. Around 3 ABY, the underground resistance formed by Shysa undertook a mission to infiltrate the City of Bone and rescue their enslaved kinsmen, with Shysa leading them and Tobbi Dala at his side.

He would turn Dengar over to them in exchange for the release of his friend. The slavers agreed to the deal, but before the exchange could be made, there was another unexpected arrival to the planet. The Princess Leia Organa, who was chasing rumors that Dengar had aided Boba Fett in capturing Han Solo, landed on the planet and became immediately involved in a shoot out between Mandalorians and Imperial slavers. After initially confusing Shysa with Fett, Organa learned of the Mandalorian's true identity and his purpose on Mandalore.

Taking Shysa out on a midnight stroll to bring him away from the camp, Organa left C-3PO to free the bounty hunter from his suspended prison. On their walk away from the base, Organa seduced Shysa, using a forced kiss to put him off guard and then slamming his head into a nearby tree.

After Organa agreed, the three of them, including C-3PO, made their way to Dala's cell. However, the presence of a guard outside Dala's cell forced the three to come up with a more substantial plan. As Shysa feigned an injury, Organa and C-3PO carried him toward the stormtrooper, hoping to convince him that they were under attack and that he should leave his post.

Shysa was also apparently somewhat of a linguist, as he had the ability to speak Shyriiwook, a skill that most Humans were unable to master. Although proven as a fierce soldier, Shysa also had a compassionate streak, extending his efforts towards other just causes that needed his aid, such as the Nagai campaign to retake their homeworld from the Tof."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shysa spoke with a heavy accent during the fighting to free Mandalore, but by the time of the Nagai-Tof War, this trait had disappeared. Shysa's helmet was distinguishable from others with two notable swooshes, known as Jaig eyes, on either side of the helmet, a characteristic that was adopted in different forms by the Mandalorian Protectors in the Clone Wars. However, just as with his accent, by the time of the conflict with the Nagai, he had taken to wearing a plain helmet with no distinguishing marks present."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fenn Shysa was created by David Michelinie for use in Marvel Star Wars' Star Wars 68. Shysa was used in the following issue, Death in the City of Bone, before disappearing from the story. The backstory given to Shysa claimed that he had fought in the Clone Wars alongside Boba Fett and that the Mandalorians had fought for the Emperor, even being sent to kidnap Princess Leia Organa. This story was only contradicted by the release of the prequel trilogy, which revealed that Fett was a clone of Jango Fett and had been too young to have fought alongside Shysa. Likewise, Organa had not even been born until the end of the Clone Wars. Shysa made three more minor appearances in the Marvel Star Wars arc, including a role in the final issue, All Together Now. Following this, Shysa went unreferenced until 1997's Boba Fett: Twin Engines of Destruction. Also written before the release of the prequels, this comic seemed to take Shysa's account of Fett as reliable, as the bounty hunter mentions both Shysa and Dala during his fight with Jodo Kast."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three years later, still before the release of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones and the revelation of Fett's true backstory, Shysa was again referenced in Rich Handley's and Joseph Bongiorno's article in Star Wars Gamer 1, \"The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life: The Marvel Series\", which served to explain Shysa's actions following the end of the Marvel run, explaining that the Mandalorian had aided the Nagai in the liberation of their homeworld. Shysa was once again referenced in Star Wars Gamer in issue 9's article, Race for the Tessent. Besides mentioning his fight against Imperial slavers, the article took measures to mention that the details of Shysa's early career were \"sketchy,\" referencing the recent contradiction that had been made with his backstory due to Fett's background Attack of the Clones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This contradiction was finally retconned by Abel G. Pe\u00f1a in his article \"The History of the Mandalorians\", in Star Wars Insider 80. This fix explained that the man whom Shysa believed to be Fett was in reality a rogue ARC trooper, Alpha-\u00d82, a character from Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds. In addition, the article helped clarify that Shysa and the Mandalorians who had fought in the Clone Wars had been sent to kidnap Padm\u00e9 Amidala, not Leia Organa, as Shysa had originally claimed. The final inconsistency, surrounding Shysa and the Mandalorians fighting for the Emperor, was fixed by explaining that the Mandalorians had been sent into battle by Darth Sidious. Since both the Emperor and Darth Sidious were one and the same, Shysa's claims were true, from a certain point of view."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following this fix of Shysa's background, the Mandalorian warrior began to be referenced in several newer sources, including the new batch of Essential Guides. Shysa even played a role in the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force series of novels, warranting mentions in Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines, Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice and Legacy of the Force: Revelation. However, the mention of Shysa in Legacy of the Force: Revelation gives a somewhat conflicting backstory to Shysa. While The History of the Mandalorians took the time to explain Shysa's claims in The Search Begins as simply confused recollections, Revelation changes the story. During the novel, the character, Goran Beviin states that Shysa knew the true identity of Spar but encouraged him to impersonate Boba Fett in order to take advantage of Jango's reputation to heighten morale. In this version of events, Shysa was the one really in charge of the Protectors, using Spar as a figurehead. However, this story seems to conflict quite drastically with the original Marvel comics. During The Search Begins, Shysa is highly critical of Fett, decrying him for going off to join the Empire after the Clone Wars. In later issues, Shysa would keep this viewpoint, even directly stating that Fett was simply \"bounty hunting scum\" in Star Wars 99. Using this attitude as a basis, why Shysa would claim to Organa that his commander was Fett, if he had in actuality created the deception seems self-contradictory. Especially since if the purpose of the deception was to establish legitimacy, there doesn't seem to be much reason behind maligning Fett. Since this contradictory backstory is only stated by one Mandalorian who was not present for the Clone Wars, it may be possible that Beviin was just stating a popular rumor that made Shysa out to be more of a mastermind than he actually was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Further explanation of this new version of events were featured in Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, which explained that he did, in fact, know Spar was a clone, and merely asked him to pretend to be Fett's son.
