Anzat assassin Saj\u00e9 Tasha was hired by the corrupt Senator Viento and Separatist acolyte Sora Bulq to eliminate Valorum. After the disgraced politician boarded the Star of Iskin, Tasha killed Valorum and drank his \"soup,\" per Anzati tradition, before sabotaging and escaping the freighter. As a result of Tasha's actions, the Star of Iskin exploded shortly after takeoff.

Gran Senator Ask Aak cited the Republic's inability to prevent the freighter's destruction as proof that the Enhanced Security and Enforcement Act, a controversial piece of legislation that would grant Palpatine more authority at the expense of the Galactic Senate, was desperately needed. Despite Senator Organa's best efforts to block the bill, the Senate passed the act the day after the freighter exploded, giving the Chancellor greater wartime powers\u2014that which Finis Valorum had fought against. Additional policies, such as the Core Worlds Security Act, were also passed in the wake of the disaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately after the Star of Iskin's destruction, a memorial for the late Valorum was planned for the Chancellery Walkway in Coruscant's Jrade District, although, amidst security concerns, the memorial was not opened to the public until weeks later. Jedi Master Quinlan Vos later tracked down Tasha. Using his psychometric abilities, the Kiffar Jedi was able to witness the Anzat's memories of Valorum's murder and the Star of Iskin's destruction. Organa became increasingly suspicious of Palpatine in the months following the Star of Iskin's destruction and, with Senator Mothma, began forming a political body opposed to the Chancellor's increasing influence. By 19 BBY, just prior to the Battle of Coruscant, Organa still viewed Valorum's assassination as one of many convenient incidences that had occurred during Palpatine's consolidation of power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star of Iskin first appeared in Dead Ends, the sixty-first issue of the Star Wars: Republic series of comics, released in 2004. \"The Lost One,\" an episode of the sixth season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, shows Finis Valorum alive and well in 20 BBY, in the time period following the Star of Iskin's destruction in 21 BBY.
