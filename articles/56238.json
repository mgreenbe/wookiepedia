At the center of the spaceport, there was a large staircase called the Great Stair, which decended to the port's various docking bays. At some point between 1000 BBY and 0 BBY, a bagman for the shipping magnate Brevis Taug traveled to the Grand Terminal while transporting some funds that Taug was sending to the Zygerrian Thanda clan. A group of spacers who were tracking the movement of Taug's funds staked out the Great Stair and they followed the bagman to Docking Bay 112, where the bagman and the spacers boarded a starship that was due to travel to the space station Bazarre."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
