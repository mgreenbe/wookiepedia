Han and his team made his way into the Skip and confronted Nandreeson. Han thought that he had the crimelord outnumbered, when the other smugglers revealed that they were actually working for the glottalphib. In the resulting firefight, the smugglers Kid DXo'ln and Zeen Afit, along with some of Nandreeson's glottalphibs were killed. Calrissian obtained a blaster and fired it at the fire-eating Watumba bats on the ceiling, who descended and killed all the glottalphibs present. Han, Lando, Chewbacca then flew to Skip 1 in Nandreeson's ship, along with Ana Blue, who had been waiting to see the outcome of the fight before committing herself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
