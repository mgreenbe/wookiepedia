His friends included Lowghen Badra and Borta the Dolandu. Niquon once sent Laric to take the ruins of an assassin droid discovered by Borta to Lowghen Badra on Yabosta. The Dark Jedi Von Totha waylaid Laric to get him out of her way so she or her allies would be free to assassinate Niquon, but Lowghen Badra helped him escape. Laric then rescued Niquon from a Drethi sent to Skalokor by Totha's group."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
