One evening, the soldier joined half a dozen comrades in meeting with some pilots from the New Republic's Alphabet Squadron around a table in a refugee camp on the planet. One of the pilots, Nath Tensent, passed out Imperial rations. The soldier asked Alphabet Leader, Lieutenant Yrica Quell, if it was true that the 61st was going for Troithe's Imperial governor, Hastemoor.

Quell said that the soldiers better succeed the first time if it was practice, drawing laughter from the soldiers.
