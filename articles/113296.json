The substance was not powerful enough to withstand normal blaster bolts, but it could reflect the weaker blasts of the needle rays used in the Big Game. A blast so reflected lost little of its potency, and was still deadly. By hiding a ray shield with refractory coating under his shirt, Han Solo was able to fake his own death from a needle ray blast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
