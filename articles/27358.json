Clargod and the rest of the team claimed to be in the employ of the Office of Peace and Security, a law enforcement body that had placed a bounty on Mattenic and Kerkum. However, they were also working for Riboga the Hutt, who had recently seized control of crime in the Cularin system from Nirama, and the bounty hunters planned to get paid twice for capturing the pair. However, the Heroes of Cularin were also looking for Mattenic and Kerkum, and they prevented Clargod and the other bounty hunters from capturing the pair."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time afterward, the Heroes of Cularin destroyed Riboga's spice mining operation on the planet Kemix, so the Hutt hired Clargod, Dee'Hars, Kelyan and Kiimo to bring the heroes into a state of despair, and then kill them. The bounty hunters placed explosives aboard a starship that the heroes were traveling on and then detonated the devices, bringing the hero's craft out of hyperspace and causing it to crash on the planet Holador. The bounty hunters landed on the world and Clargod took up a position in a valley, with some sentry droids that were under her command. The heroes eventually made their way into the valley and Clargod offered to make a deal with them, whereby she would fight them all individually in unarmed combat, rather than simply attacking them all at the same time. The heroes engaged her in combat and defeated her, and they eventually made it off Holodor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
