She was a pilot for Sienar Advanced Projects Labratory. She was the one who flew the Scimitar to Darth Maul. Afterward, when other members of the team began to be killed off, she fled across the Tingel Arm - to Ryloth, Nar Shaddaa, and finally Naos III, where she took the name Genne. She hid there from 29 to 19 BBY, becoming an alcoholic sharptooth collector, until Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi found her just before a group of assassins did. Although her right lek (singular of lekku) was shot off, the Jedi not only managed to get her off Naos alive, but also learned that Maul had had his ship delivered to The Works."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
