To gain this trophy, Xris tasked individuals with killing six legendary creatures in the hunting grounds of Etyyy: Greyclimber the Kashyyyk greyclimber, Spiketop the Uller, Stoneleg the Walluga, Paleclaw the Mouf, Brightclaw the Mouf, and Silkthrower the Wyyyschokk. Once an individual had killed each of these creatures and brought him back a memento of the kill, he would call a meeting to award the individual."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
