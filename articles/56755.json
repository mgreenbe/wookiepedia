The destruction of the Jedi traced its origins to the ancient wars against the Sith, at the end of which the Sith were nearly eliminated by the Jedi. The Sith operated in secret, plotting their eventual destruction of the Jedi Order. A millennium after the defeat of the Sith, Darth Sidious, using his public persona of Senator and then Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, manipulated the galaxy into the Clone Wars as a pretext for gaining emergency executive power over the Galactic Republic. He used the war to manipulate the Senate into giving his office virtually unchecked executive power in the name of security. In addition, the clone army that provided the Republic with its military force had secretly been implanted with bio-chips by its Sith creators that, upon activation, would trigger total compliance and force the clones into killing their Jedi leaders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Purge began at the end of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight believed to be the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious and informed Jedi Master Mace Windu. In what Sidious would publicly label the \"Jedi rebellion,\" Windu and three other Masters confronted the Chancellor, who killed the three Masters and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker, who sought power from Sidious in order to save his wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, from death, intervened and incapacitated Windu before the Jedi Master could kill the Dark Lord. Sidious then killed Windu, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader and led the Siege of the Jedi Temple, killing everyone inside it. While Vader carried out the assault on the Temple, Sidious initiated Order 66, with the latter causing the Clones' biochips to brainwash them into slaughtering the Jedi, ultimately leading to the Jedi Order being nearly destroyed. The order was a resounding success: nearly all the Jedi in the field were killed. With the Jedi branded traitors and the Clone Wars at an end, Sidious declared himself Emperor and restored the Sith Empire when he transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire. However, a small number of Jedi who were either not involved with the clones or escaped the trap survived and continued to vex the Sith in years after."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Age of the Empire saw the continued hunting of the Jedi survivors by the Empire. Vader commanded a number of Inquisitors, whose job was to hunt any Jedi survivors. The Grand Inquisitor, a former Jedi Temple Guard from Utapau, hunted a group of rebels on the planet Lothal who were led by a former Padawan, Kanan Jarrus. These rebels ultimately helped create the Alliance to Restore the Republic, which fought against the Empire during the Galactic Civil War. One of the Rebels was Vader's son, Luke Skywalker, who became the last of the Jedi and helped guide his father towards redemption.

While this caused him to be expelled from the Jedi Order, he gained followers and formed a new order that eventually became the Sith. Soon, the Jedi and Sith became bitter enemies and waged many wars against each other. Ultimately, the Sith's greed for power led to infighting within their order, which the Jedi took advantage of, nearly destroying the Sith. Following their victory, the Jedi believed that the Sith were extinct. However, one Sith Lord, Darth Bane, survived and plotted his revenge by enacting the Great Plan and the Rule of Two, which allowed the Sith to operate in secret without anyone, particularly the Jedi, knowing.

In the years before the Invasion of Naboo, Sheev Palpatine of Naboo became the apprentice of Darth Plagueis and took on the name Darth Sidious. As a Sith, Sidious killed his master and became a Dark Lord of the Sith. In his public persona of Senator Palpatine of Naboo, Sidious carried out his plans to gain power over the Galactic Republic. His plan was to destroy the Jedi Order and usher in Sith dominion over the galaxy, with himself as sovereign ruler over an empire that would allow him to cast the galaxy into darkness and unlock the ancient secrets of the Sith and the dark side of the Force. In doing so, Sidious believed he could remake the universe in his own designs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious orchestrated the Invasion of Naboo, in which the Sith\u2014through his apprentice, Darth Maul, before Maul was defeated\u2014revealed themselves to the Jedi, as a means of gaining power.

Palpatine was nominated to succeed Valorum and ultimately won the election, placing him in charge of the Republic. Around the same time, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, a member of the Jedi Council who believed that a galactic war was imminent, secretly ordered the creation of a clone army on Kamino. Sifo-Dyas, who was killed at the behest of Count Dooku, who became Sidious' apprentice after Maul was assumed dead on Naboo, intended the army to be used for the Republic. Dooku, as Darth Tyranus, secretly took over the project, and the Sith saw to it that bio-chips were added to each clone trooper. These chips contained Order 66, a command that, when executed, would force the clone troopers to kill all Jedi they encountered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The years that followed the Naboo Crisis saw the advent of the Separatist Crisis, in which thousands of star systems seceded from the Republic and joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This period of political tension and the calls for war were orchestrated by the Sith, as a means for Sidious to gain further control over the galaxy. In order to allow for Chancellor Palpatine to adopt the clone army to respond to what the Republic saw as the threat of the Separatist Alliance, Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks of Naboo called on the Galactic Senate to give the Chancellor emergency executive power. The Senate granted the Chancellor the power, the clone army was commissioned as the Grand Army of the Republic, and the Clone Wars began shortly thereafter during the First Battle of Geonosis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Order was placed in charge of the war effort, with Jedi serving as Generals and Commanders in the military. After several years of war, many of the galaxy's citizens turned against the conflict and blamed the Jedi leaders for the prolonged and devastating war.

Padawan Barriss Offee, a member of the Order, also viewed the Jedi as having become complicit in a mistaken war, leading her to bomb the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Other Jedi also shared her views; Jedi Master Depa Billaba believed it was a mistake for the Jedi to lead the Clone Wars. Grand Master Yoda, after setting out on a spiritual path to learn the secrets of eternal consciousness within the Force, saw a vision on Dagobah of Jedi fighting clone troopers and being killed by Darth Sidious.

He confronted the Chancellor, who feigned an assassination attempt against him and implicated Fives. Fives told two of his commanders, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, a Knight of the Jedi Order who was believed to be the Chosen One, and Clone Captain Rex, about the conspiracy, but they did not believe him. Fives was killed by a fellow clone after being viewed as a threat, and the official story of what happened to Tup was that he was exposed to a parasite that made him violent.

After the death of Count Dooku during the Battle of Coruscant, the Chancellor promised a swift end to the war once General Grievous, the leader of the Separatist Droid Army, was killed.

The duel moved throughout the Chancellor's office until Windu disarmed the Dark Lord, at which point Skywalker arrived to witness what Sidious claimed was the Jedi trying to take over the Republic. Because he needed Sidious to survive in order to save Amidala's life, Skywalker intervened when Windu was about to kill the Chancellor and cut off Windu's hand.

Through a surviving part of the Lothal temple he had ordered be brought aboard the Star Destroyer, the Sith Lord offered the young man a chance to reunite with his parents.
