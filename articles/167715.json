In her true form, Wesell was a reptilian-like humanoid, although she often appeared as a Human woman with short blonde or bronze-colored hair. She trained in the ways of the Mabari warriors on her homeworld before eventually being labeled a heretic and fleeing to the commercial center of Denon. To escape, Wesell took the form of a human woman and took a job in personal security.

One such contract arose in 27 BBY when the two bounty hunters were seeking the Infant of Shaa ancient artifact and superweapon on behalf of the Dug Fernooda. Originally pitted against each other, the pair agreed to work together to capture the idol. It was then revealed to Wesell that a seedy underworld general planned to use it to destroy the Republic capital world of Coruscant. At Wesell's lead, Fett joined in the hunt to retrieve the artifact and save Coruscant. During this incident, Wesell made use of her developed shapeshifting abilities. This skill was also employed in her other exploits, such as the hunt for Kuati Hurlo Holowan, which was subcontracted by Jango Fett."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, with the rise of the Separatist Crisis, Confederate leader Count Dooku contracted Jango Fett to eliminate Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala on behalf of Nute Gunray. In turn, Fett subcontracted the bounty to Wesell, who attempted to kill the senator by destroying the senator's starship with an explosive device. The explosion, however, only served to kill Amidala's decoy and other passengers aboard the vessel. Amidala had arrived separately on another ship and was unscathed by the blast. Not pleased, but undeterred, Wesell met with Fett and schemed to use two venomous arthropods to kill the vulnerable senator. The attempt was foiled, however, by the alert presence of Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi who had been stationed in the senator's apartment. The Jedi easily killed the arthropods and Kenobi leaped through the apartment window to grab hold of the droid which Wesell had used to deliver the predators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid began its return to Wesell, but the bounty hunter spotted the stowaway Jedi.

Wesell was raised in this oppressed society which was perpetually either on the brink of war or embroiled in it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on Zolan, Wesell was trained in the ways of the Mabari, an ancient religious order of warrior-knights. Raised from a young age by the order, she craftily honed her fighting skills and achieved third level mastery of the Mabari martial arts. During this time, she also developed a desire for profit and became aggressive in her actions. Calling herself a \"progressive,\" Wesell's avarice was met with disapproval from more traditional Zolanders that held strong religious convictions; the natives expressed disdain for her chosen profession of assassinations and bounty hunting. Furthermore, the Mabari held to the belief that those who did not show their true face were the worst of all sinners. As a shapeshifter, Wesell was able to conceal her identity long enough to reach an aptitude in the Mabari martial arts. Eventually, however, the truth that she was a Clawdite was exposed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Identified as a sinner and heretic, Zam Wesell disguised herself as a Human businesswoman and fled Zolan for the commercial planet Denon. There, she took up employment in corporate security. The Clawdite garnered a reputation as she rose through the ranks to become a sergeant. In a carefully calculated move, she took the well-paid position of executive bodyguard. Wesell, however, was more interested in even greater esteem and profit. During her time on Denon, Wesell honed and refined her skills, gathered finances and equipment, and made contacts in order to turn her attention to bounty hunting. She had also firmly established an identity as a young, petite, attractive Human woman, which was a useful tool in gaining contacts for her work."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was during this time that Wesell met another Clawdite who lived on Denon and attempted to start a family.

Sebolto, a crime lord and king, placed the bounty of fifty-thousand credits upon Fust's head. The Mordageen, however, was interned on Oovo IV, an asteroid which housed a maximum security prison. At the same time, Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett was also in pursuit of Fust, seeking the same reward. The Clawdite stowed-away aboard a supply vessel bound for Oovo IV and sneaked into the prison. Wesell and Fett independently\u2014and unaware of each other's presence\u2014snaked through the prison and arrived at Fust's cell.

Improvising, she stumbled upon Fett's ship, Jaster's Legacy, and attempted to hijack it. Prison guards, however, opened fire on Wesell as Fett arrived. The two dispatched the guards and, upon approaching each other, aimed their weapons in a standoff.

Once the shield was down, Fett planned to move into the hangar and commandeer a Firespray-class ship for escape. While Wesell waited for the Mandalorian bounty hunter, Fett destroyed the three power reactors and, keeping with the newly devised plan, proceeded to the hangar.

Fett responded that only Wesell was going to approach Sebolto, while he himself executed \"other plans.\" At that moment, Wesell realized that Fett was working another, larger job and demanded that she be involved. Fett retorted that the Clawdite had been lucky not to die at his hands, but that while he was only using her as a tool for his own purposes, she might find the arrangement beneficial in the end. The Mandalorian devised a plan to infiltrate Sebolto's compound through the jungle while Wesell went to the compound proper with Fust. Wesell dropped Fett off in the jungle and the weapons were removed from the ship so that they could not be confiscated when it was searched. Wesell's mission was to spend time with Sebolto in order to allow Fett time to cross through the jungle and the canyon which isolated the compound.

Fust was being tortured, and she was unwilling to dine with the crime lord. Shortly thereafter, Fett arrived at the top of the cliff.

Reaching the compound, Wesell directed Fett to the building with the throne room. The Mandalorian remarked that he was going alone and wanted Wesell to return to the ship. He then approached Sebolto and chased him into the death stick factory, where the Dug crime lord fell to his death.

Wesell then brought the ship around, all the while overhearing part of the confrontation between Montross and Fett. The ad hoc pair then departed Malastare; however, Montross had placed a tracking device on the ship to follow their pursuits. Once in space, Wesell pressed Fett for more answers about his larger job. Connecting statements by Montross about Komari Vosa to his pursuits of Sebolto, she surmised that he was after the failed Jedi Padawan who had become the cult leader of the Bando Gora via private invitation.

On Tatooine, Jabba the Hutt and Gardulla the Hutt were feuding for control of the planet. Rozatta noted that a Hutt was never seen without something being offered. She suggested pursuit of Longo Two-Guns, a criminal wanted by Jabba, dead or alive. Uncertain as to which Hutt was allied with the Bando Gora, Fett decided that he and Wesell should split up. Fett would go to Jabba for information while Gardulla would be visited by Wesell. As they split up, Fett went in pursuit of Longo Two-Guns, hoping that securing this bounty posted by Jabba would allow the Mandalorian an audience with the Hutt crime lord.

Gardulla chastised him for his efforts and his desire to gain access to her vault. Fett pushed the Hutt into the beast area, where she was consumed by her krayt dragon. In order to escape the palace, Fett terminated the dragon and proceeded to the holding cells to speak with Wesell. Once the Mandalorian arrived in the concourse of the cells, Wesell pleaded for her freedom, and he, in turn, scolded her for turning him in.

For example, Wesell's gender is listed as \"unknown\" in the Guide, but is confirmed as female in sources such as the Databank.

The video game takes place in 32 BBY, five years before the crossing of contracts between Dreddon the Hutt and Vigo Antonin.

Wesell then staked out over a kilometer away and detonated the bomb when she saw Amidala's decoy, believing it was Amidala herself, step out of the vessel and onto the platform. This conflicts with Wesell's Databank entry, which states that Wesell posed as a reporter and conned a drunk Theomet Danl\u00e9 into planting the explosive on the ship. Whether or not Wesell staked out the landing pad in this situation is not stated, but the Databank cites the explosion as having come from the bomb planted inside the vessel."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon and ambiguously canon appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The LEGO model for Wesell does not appear in LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game, as the model was unused.

In this role-playing scenario, the player revisits the Outlander Club following the speeder chase in 22 BBY and creates a what-if situation in which Jango Fett wanted to keep Wesell alive and help her escape the Jedi rather than meet her ultimate canonical fate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
