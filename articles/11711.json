Varieties included tailring bacon, which Jettster used as a topping on his Socorro slider, and nuna bacon. The latter was served on its own as a breakfast side dish, with Anoat oats as the second Pantoran Plate Special breakfast, in Shawda Clubb sandwiches, and in Besh-Leth-Trill sandwiches."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bacon was mentioned in a 2009 Hyperspace-exclusive release, \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written by Gregory Walker in the style of an in-universe menu for Dex's Diner.
