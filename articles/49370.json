It was notable for its unusual pilot-forward design. The speeder structure flowed back aerodynamically from the pilot seat, ending with two stabilizer fins at the rear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Standard models of the Flitknot speeder were fitted with pheromone systems that used the sensitive Geonosian sense of smell to relay information on the performance and status of the vehicle, and had a multi-yoke system of control. Altitude was set by twisting the handlebar grips backwards to rise, and forwards to go lower."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Huppla Pasa Tisc Shipwrights Collective used many of the same components for the Flitknot as they had done on the Nantex-class territorial defense starfighter, including the inertial compensator and the gravity generator used to keep the pilot seated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The speeders were first put to use by Geonosian perimeter scouts to examine new meteor impacts or track acklays and merdeths. Standard models were not fitted with weaponry. Strike versions were equipped with a blaster cannon. Sometimes the speeder bike was modified for use by a B2 super battle droid for scouting missions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Count Dooku used a modified Flitknot during the First Battle of Geonosis to escape from the Stalgasin hive to his secret hangar. He abandoned the vehicle once he left Geonosis in his solar sailer. Dooku had at some point retrieved the speeder from Geonosis and used it to meet Anakin Skywalker and duel him. Following the duel, Skywalker stole the speeder to escape the Dune Sea and head for Jabba the Hutt's Palace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least one Flitknot speeder, painted in the Separatist color scheme, was used by a tactical droid to patrol Naboo prior to the Blue Shadow Virus incident."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Second Battle of Geonosis, Flitknot speeders were extensively used by the Geonosians. Many Commando droids also used them on Battle of Kiros.\nOddly enough, many Republic Naval troopers would used captured speeders to go to bars and other places on Coruscant. One was used by clone trooper CT-5555 when he was trying to escape from other clones to prove his innocence when he was framed for the attempted murder of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
