The SBP-200 was notoriously fragile, and used low grade focusing crystals, meaning the gun packed little punch. Elmainin Arms were reduced to selling most of these guns in backwater locations such as the Tion Hegemony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
