Born on Kiffu circa 3661 BBY during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, his parents were both killed in an accident and he was taken offworld as an infant and turned over to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for Jedi training. Trained in the ways of the Force at the Temple, the muscular and handsome Konshi was selected as a Padawan apprentice by the recently appointed Grand Master, Satele Shan, a descendent of Bastila Shan and former Sith Lord-turned Jedi Revan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following years of training and after constructing a green-bladed lightsaber, Shan thought Konshi was prepared for Knighthood but Konshi was deemed unready to face the Jedi Trials due to his lack of self control and tact. Despite her opinion and her superior rank, his master refused to countermand the Jedi High Council's authority and instead ordered her apprentice to strive to change the Council's decision. Upon hearing the Council's decision, Konshi took a walk in the Old District of Coruscant to cool off and ran into a firefight between Black Sun gangsters and Mandalorian warrior Dao Stryver. There he met Larin Moxla, a former Republic trooper and a fellow Kiffar. He found out that Stryver was looking for a woman named Lema Xandret and something called \"Cinzia\". He took this information back to his master, who sent him off to a mission with Moxla to Nal Hutta to investigate an auction being held by the Hutt matriarch Tassaa Bareesh."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Nal Hutta"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon their arrival on Nal Hutta Konshi and Moxla traveled to the Palace of Tassaa Bareesh, however, the whole area was guarded by Gamorrean guards, servants of the Hutt. Disguised as two of the famed Rancor Riders, Konshi and Moxla were able to enter the palace unharmed. Once there, they were encountered a protocol droid, who instructed the two to go to Quartermaster Droog. While Droog was a Hutt, Konshi was able to manipulate him into allowing them to pass further inside the palace with the additional bribe of a few credit chips. Despite the success of getting inside, Konshi figured that it was a matter of time before they were discovered or Droog alerted the guards and so he and Moxla rushed through the palace to look for information. Discovering that both the Republic and the Empire had entered the palace to join the auction, Konshi and Moxla made their way to the underground chambers to avoid detection and reach the Cinzia before the auction began."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crossing through the tunnels, Konshi and Moxla encounter a trio of Hortek that were guarding the area. Influencing them with the Force, Konshi's ploy was almost successful until they were attacked by security drones. The two Kiffar were able to destroy them and enter the security code at the doorway to the accommodation chamber of an Imperial Security team led by Yeama, who told them that Ula Vii was missing. Eventually, they were met by Sergeant Potannin, introducing himself as an emissary of the Grand Master Shan."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Ambush in the Palace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the auction, Konshi was able to locate and infiltrate the vault holding the material to be auctioned, only to discover explosives that had been secured by a Sith Acolyte named Eldon Ax. Konshi ignited his lightsaber and engaged Ax in a duel and was able to gain the upper hand and disarm Ax. Before Ax could be arrested however, Dao Stryver arrived in the vault and joined the fight which was cut short by an explosion from inside the vault where a superior race of droids, nicknamed \"hexes\" due to their six arms were rapidly multiplying. Battling the droids, Konshi formed an alliance with Ax and Stryver and participate in a vicious battle with the droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, Konshi was arrested by the Hutts and was taken to Bareesh after the droids were subdued and the Sith escaped. Blamed for the damage done to the palace, Konshi was forced to negotiate with Tassaa Bareesh, who would eventually capitulate and allowed Konshi to leave in search of the missing ship. After being released from Hutt custody he made contact with Moxla and instructed her to accompany him on the mission. At the spaceport, Konshi met with Vii, Moxla and Jet Nebula, on board the Auriga Fire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Alliance with the Sith"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Sebaddon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since Stryver went after the NaviComputer, Shigar and the crew needed a way to find this, despite the lack of the Navicomputers onboard the Auriga Fire. When Larin found a way to track down the planet Shigar used his psychometric abilities and thereby detect the position of any planet they find. Although, Shigar harbored doubts about his talent, but finally declared to try it. He later contacted his master and informed her about the situation. Encouraged by the words of his master, Shigar began to meditate, but doesn't succeed. While Larin began to sought Shigar's wounds, he told her about his despondency regarding the undertaking. She told him that he knew what he had to do, but always believed that he could succeed rather then fail. She eventually revealed in the past that she betrayed her corrupt superiors, which is why she resigned from her squadron. After a leaving the room, Shigar regretted his reaction, but focused exclusively on the metal fragments of the nest and realized that Larin words were true. With new knowledge revealed, he was able to experience a new dimension of psychometrics. However, since he had realized that it was hard work, Shigar never gave up and continued to track the position of the home planet of the hexes. Gaining the knowledge throughout the Force, Shigar and the crew were able to find the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving to the planet with a fleet of Republic ships, Shigar asked his master to be allowed to participate in the negotiations on Sebaddon, in which her master agreed on immediately. The Jedi Grand Master then contacted the planet and indicated its peaceful intentions, what Shigar and his team also listened with. When they received contact from one of the Hexes, Shigar realized that the droid would not dwell on it. This was when missiles were launched from the planet, containing thousands of copies of hex droids that began to attack the fleet. Shigar immediately contacted Commander Gurin and instructed him to flee, but it was already too late. Eventually, Satele ordered an evacuation. Moving throughout the ship, Shigar and his master were able to make it to the main gate of the ship before they were ambushed by nine of the hexes. Since Satele told him that these droids could affect the power, Shigar was able to pass through the hexes and opened the door to suck out the droids into space. Since her master didn't have a space suit on, Shigar was able to save her by placing his master into a bubble of power. Despite the confrontation with a hex, the two return without prejudice to the Auriga Fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shigar accompanied the Grand Master to the cockpit, where they made contact with Strvyer. She ordered the Jedi to meet in half an hour with her in the moon. Despite his suspicions, Shigar accompanied with Vii and Larin to the meeting, which also includes the Sith, Eldon Ax and Darth Chratis. Since there had been some disputes between the Sith and the Jedi, Dao told both sides that the hex droids had the potential to destroy all life within the galaxy. Therefore, she suggested to form an alliance for both the Republic and the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Together, the group of unlikely companions would later form an alliance to battle the droids on their homeworld Sebaddon. The Empire and the Republic both joined in the battle against the hexes, where Konshi confronted the Sith Lord Darth Chratis. Konshi survived the ensuing battle and Darth Chratis's temptation, which earned him the right to go on to face the Jedi Trials. While Konshi and Moxla started to develop feelings for each other, Konshi rejected her advances due to his commitment to the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shigar Konshi showed much potential even as an apprentice and was able to hold his own against a Mandalorian and a Sith apprentice at the same time. Showing proficiency in the use of telekinesis and telepathy, Konshi also had a knack for the rare technique of psychometry.
