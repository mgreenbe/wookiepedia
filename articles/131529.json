As they were approaching their destination, their shuttle was damaged and had to make a crash-landing. Korr and Rosh Penin were separated from the group and had to navigate their way through the jungle. Along the way, they fought some howlers and encountered the Disciples of Ragnos, a Sith cult. Korr also saw the cultists using a scepter to drain Force energy from the Massassi temple. When the Jedi were finding the missing students, the Dark Jedi Alora broke into the personal room of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and stole a record of places where Skywalker felt a strong connection to the Force. She gave it to her master, who was later revealed to be Tavion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Jedi Academy, Skywalker assigned Jedi Master Kyle Katarn to teach Korr and Penin. After completing his basic training, Korr, as a Jedi Initiate, went on missions to Mos Eisley, Tatooine, Bakura, Blenjeel, and Corellia to investigate cult activities. During this time, he learned that the cult was working closely with the Imperial Remnant. After the five missions, Skywalker sent Korr to Hoth to investigate the site where he had a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Although Korr did not sense any Force energy at the location, he discovered that the Imperial Remnant was also on Hoth. While exploring the ruins of Echo Base, Korr encountered Alora and dueled her before she escaped. Around the same time, Penin went missing during his mission to Byss."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korr was promoted to Apprentice for his achievements on Hoth, and he progressed to the next stage of training. He completed another five missions to Nar Kreeta, Zonju V, Kril'Dor, Coruscant, and Dosuun. In the meantime, Skywalker discovered that the cultists had been draining Force energy from the locations mentioned in his record. He sent all available Jedi to investigate these places and directed them to travel in pairs\u2014as a precaution after Penin's disappearance. Korr and Katarn were sent to check out Darth Vader's castle on Vjun. While exploring the castle, they destroyed a power generator to cut a path to the upper levels. However, the ensuing explosion separated Korr from Katarn. Korr moved on alone into the meditation chamber, where he encountered the Kothos twins and Penin, who had turned to the dark side. He killed the Kothos twins and dueled Penin until Katarn caught up and stopped them. At the same moment, Tavion showed up and used Force lightning to hold back Katarn and Korr before revealing herself as Penin's new master and the leader of the cult. When Korr threw his lightsaber at the ceiling to collapse it and break the stalemate, Tavion destroyed his lightsaber with the scepter and fled with Penin. Katarn used the Force to temporarily hold up the ceiling while Korr cut a hole in the ground with Katarn's lightsaber, and the two of them jumped through the hole safely to the level below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon returning to the Jedi Academy, Katarn and Korr reported their findings to Skywalker. For displaying courage and skill in defeating the Dark Jedi, Korr received a promotion to Jedi Knight, and constructed a new lightsaber. Katarn sensed Korr's anger at Penin's betrayal and warned him that his anger could lead him to the dark side. While Skywalker and Katarn tried to find out what Tavion intended to do with the scepter, Korr completed another five missions to Chandrila, Tanaab, Yalara, Byss, and Ord Mantell. After Korr finished the fifth mission, Skywalker gathered all the Jedi and told them that he suspected that the cultists wanted to use the Force energy stored in the scepter to resurrect Marka Ragnos, an ancient Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Jedi prepared to go to Korriban to stop the cult, Katarn told Korr that he had received a distress call from Penin, who said he was being held captive in an Imperial facility on Taspir III. When Korr raised concerns that Penin could still be with the dark side and was trying to lure them into a trap, Katarn told Korr that he would not abandon Penin even if it were a trap. Korr then reluctantly followed Katarn to Taspir III, where they split up at the facility to find Penin. Korr was the first to find Penin, who apologized to him and implored him to bring him back to the Jedi Academy. However, Korr turned furious because he thought that Penin had lured him into a trap, so he ignited his lightsaber and pointed it at Penin. While Alora tried to instigate Korr to kill Penin and join the dark side, Katarn used the Force to communicate telepathically with Korr and persuade him to spare Penin. Korr realized his mistake and let go of his anger; he kept his lightsaber and tried to leave with Penin. Alora attacked them and cut off Penin's arm. Korr then dueled Alora and eventually slew her. Katarn showed up and told Korr to leave for Korriban first; he would catch up later after bringing Penin to seek medical attention."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korr landed on Korriban and joined the other Jedi in fighting the cultists while navigating his way through the Sith catacombs. He entered the Tomb of Marka Ragnos and saw Tavion using the scepter to transfer Force energy into the tomb. After Korr defeated Tavion in a lightsaber duel, Ragnos' spirit rose from the tomb and possessed Tavion. The possessed Tavion unsheathed a Sith sword hidden in the scepter and used it to fight Korr. Korr eventually defeated the possessed Tavion and destroyed the scepter with his lightsaber. Ragnos' spirit left Tavion's body and swore vengeance before returning to his tomb, leaving only a dead Tavion behind. After exiting the tomb, Jaden sealed the entrance and met Skywalker and Katarn on the way out, and they returned to the Jedi Academy together. In the meantime, New Republic Star Cruisers attacked and destroyed the Imperial Star Destroyer providing support to the cultists, ending the Battle of Korriban. Korr was honored as a valuable member of the Jedi Order and continued to go on missions to maintain peace in the galaxy. On the other hand, a redeemed Penin was accepted back into the Jedi Academy and got a prosthetic arm."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon dark-side ending"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korr can turn to the dark side by killing Penin in the Imperial facility on Taspir III.

Korr refused and engaged his former master in a lightsaber duel. Toward the end of the duel, Korr used the Force to grab the scepter and blast Force energy at Katarn, knocking him out. He then used the scepter to make a pile of rocks fall on Katarn, and blasted a hole in the wall to make his way out of the tomb. A while later, Skywalker came in and saved Katarn, who told him that Korr had killed Penin and turned to the dark side. Skywalker said he could still sense good in Korr; Katarn left to find Korr in an attempt to turn him back.

Also, when using mind trick, the screen looks the same as when controlling a droid in Jedi Outcast. Controlling droids is also possible, as well as various NPCs, using a cheat code. Specifically, after enabling the cheats (by typing 'helpusobi 1' in the console), merely spawn an NPC with a name. (Example: \"npc spawn stormtrooper bob\") This will spawn a stormtrooper NPC named bob. After this, you will be able to control the NPC as long as it has a name, with the Control cheat code.
