The black hole exerted a powerful gravitational pull so as to prevent starships in its vicinity from escaping into hyperspace. Due to this obstacle, the pirates of the Black Hole Pirates became stranded near the black hole on the ship Random Mallet. The Plunder Moon was a small moon within the region of the black hole; it was close enough to be reached using sublight drives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The black hole is somehow on the last leg of a route to Chiss Space (f-8 to f-9), on the route to the Delphon System (k-18), and on the route from Coruscant to Ketaris (l-5 to l-9)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
