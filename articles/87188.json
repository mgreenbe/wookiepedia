He visited Tatooine during the Clone Wars with his master, coming close to Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. He and his master were later seen at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina around the time when Savage Opress and Darth Maul were at Raydonia. Sometime later, he was on Nal Hutta with his master when Sith Lords Darth Maul, Savage Opress and Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla met with Jabba Desilijic Tiure. When the confrontation became a skirmish, Marrok gave chase to the three with a small team that included Latts Razzi, Dengar and Sugi. When Sugi and Embo ambushed the trio after they returned, Maul easily got the upper hand again and was about to finish off the Zabrak when Marrok intervened and saved her by attacking Maul. Maul was eventually able to throw off the Anooba. When the bounty hunters retreated, Marrok retrieved his master's damaged hat as they fled the lost battle. Later on the planet of Scipio, Marrok retrieved Embo's hat after Embo attacked Anakin Skywalker, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and Rush Clovis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dave Filoni, the director of The Clone Wars, has likened the relationship between Marrok and Embo to that of the G.I.
