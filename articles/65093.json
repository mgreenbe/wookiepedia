Emperor Palpatine appointed these senior functionaries from hundreds of different worlds, to assist him in running the Empire. The Emperor only consulted with a dozen of them at a time. Only a few handful of advisors were appointed to the Imperial Ruling Council.

This method of fear and greed served to bind each advisor to the Emperor. In addition, Imperial Advisors would perform administrative tasks and duties, such as appoint Imperial Governors, Moffs, and other servants of the Galactic Empire as designated by the Emperor. It was Imperial Advisor Ars Dangor who officially appointed Moff Wilhuff Tarkin to the rank of Grand Moff."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "List of Advisors"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aides to Senator Palpatine"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aides to Chancellor Palpatine"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Advisors to Emperor Palpatine"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Councilors after Endor"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Councilors on Byss"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Council on Ord Cantrell"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Advisors never on the Council"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
