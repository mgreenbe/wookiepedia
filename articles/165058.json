Early in his military career, Yularen distinguished himself as a captain in the Kwymar Sector Forces, fighting against slavers and pirates. During this time, he became obsessed with intelligence security, and his desire for improving security and prevent leaks led him to leave the sector fleet and join the Republic's Senate Bureau of Intelligence as an intelligence officer. The presence of powerful enemies and corruption within the Bureau forced Yularen to seek employment elsewhere, and he became a special agent in an anti-corruption unit within the Office of the Supreme Chancellor, investigating government corruption during the Separatist Crisis. Yularen became a strong supporter of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during this time, and it was this dedication that earned him Palpatine's attention."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yularen ultimately retired to the planet Anaxes, his homeworld as a youth, but the Supreme Chancellor still had work for him to do.

By 0 BBY, he had become a colonel in the Bureau and was stationed aboard the first Death Star as the head of the ISB contingent and a member of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's staff. Yularen was tasked with briefing the Grand Moff and maintaining loyalty to the Empire, as many senior officers aboard the Death Star had plans to use the battlestation for their own means.

Formally present as a military observer, Yularen's experience with Sikurd's pirates in the Kwymar sector made him de facto commander against the Sikurdian privateers that formed part of the Corporate Alliance fleet. In the resulting Battle of Malastare Narrows, the Republic force was almost completely annihilated by the fleet of the Harch Admiral Trench.

Ultimately, this lack of security caused him to resign from the sector fleet and instead pursue a career in intelligence. The prominence of his family provided Yularen the political backing to get a job as a special agent with the Senate Bureau of Intelligence. Over the next decade, he investigated a myriad of cases for, against, and about the Senate, observing all the major delegates and assembling detailed dossiers on all of them. Even then, there was corruption within the SBI, and numerous low-level functionaries who were game to support any senator's schemes by passing on misinformation for the right price.

However, the Senate saw Palpatine's special unit as a threat to its power and prerogatives, and managed to starve it of funding and resources.

A year into the war, he was assigned to a major task force led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. When appointing the former Intelligence officer to Skywalker's fleet, Palpatine informed Yularen of Skywalker's unorthodoxy, but maintained that it was the \"highest compliment.\" Yularen was often worried about Skywalker's reckless tactics and often saw him as a bold starfighter pilot rather than a respected general.

While Skywalker prepared to take a stealth ship past the blockade to deliver supplies to Senator Organa's troops, Yularen analyzed data from the engagement and noticed the insignia of Admiral Trench on the Separatist flagship, the dreadnaught Invincible.

General Kenobi prepared to move the fleet into battle, but Yularen saw the trap and knew that any counterattack would result in heavy casualties. Instead, seeing no other option, Skywalker chose to attack Trench's flagship with the stealth ship. Despite Yularen's complaints, Skywalker successfully outmaneuvered Trench and managed to destroy the Invincible.

Aboard the G9 Rigger freighter Twilight, appropriated from Separatists forces on Teth, Skywalker and Tano attempted to board the Spirit to drop off the rescued Rotta while Vulture droids pursued. As the freighter bore a Separatist transponder code, the Star Destroyer originally fired on them, but Skywalker was able to convince the crew that he was who he was. Yularen noticed the Vultures and told Skywalker that while he would have the destroyer's deflector shields momentarily dropped, the Twilight would have to divert to the aft hangar bay. The admiral proceeded to tell his general that the Spirit had faced suicide runs before, forcing the crew to shoot first and ask questions later. Skywalker acknowledged, noting that Yularen had just put him in his place. Before the Twilight could land, three Vulture droids shot into the aft hangar, wreaking havoc on the landing zone and forcing Skywalker to take the Twilight to Tatooine instead.

Confirmation of the Special Operations Brigade's initial report soon came from Yoda, who added that they should call for reinforcements only after they had reached Kothlis and only if they were absolutely necessary. Although Kenobi noted that the cruiser Coryx Moth was on patrol near Falleen, Yularen found Yoda's message to be rather cryptic, and felt that waiting to request reinforcements after they had reached Kothlis would be too late. He was also alarmed when Skywalker and Kenobi suggested that they abstain from asking for assistance altogether, though he relented when Kenobi noted the hard truth that not many battle groups were available.

Further investigation into the matter on Lieutenant Avrey's part revealed that the cause of the disruption was a computer virus that had been implemented through previous sabotage. While Avrey and officers aboard Pioneer and Coruscant Sky worked to restore the fleet's communications, Skywalker and Kenobi confirmed that their starfighters and gunships had also been affected by the virus.

Additionally, he relayed news of the victory over Kothlis to Kenobi, who had also met with success, and dispatched medevac ships to the surface to handle the many wounded troops. When Skywalker told him that Kenobi had been injured in his report on the Kothlis ground situation, Yularen checked with Kenobi's clone medic on his injuries and made arrangements for Kenobi to be transferred to Indomitable's medbay and then back to Coruscant.

Indomitable's repairs were fast-tracked in time for the mission, and Yularen's battle group was supplemented by Coryx Moth and Pioneer. After being joined by Tano, Captain Rex, and the 501st Legion's Torrent Company, Yularen took his fleet to Lanteeb. At the flotilla's pre-approach coordinates to Lanteeb, the fleet received the addition of the cruiser Dagger and Jedi General Mace Windu, who had been keeping watch over Kothlis following the Separatists' invasion. Upon reaching Lanteeb in the Malor-77 system, Yularen, Windu, and their battle group discovered that Lanteeb was being blockaded by a fleet of more than twenty-five Confederate warships, commanded by none other than General Grievous.

Eventually, the Republic battle group launched a series of starfighter assaults on Grievous's flotilla, with Yularen and Windu coordinating the attacks from Indomitable's Battle Operations Room via holotracking. Following the third skirmish, however, Yularen became unwilling to stay at Lanteeb any longer, as he could not afford to further jeopardize his troops with more losses.

Tano disobeyed the orders, resulting in heavy losses for Blue Squadron. The Vulture droids began making kamikaze attacks on the three Republic Star Destroyers, resulting in heavy damage. One Vulture droid dove into the bridge of the Resolute, and though the bridge was not destroyed, Yularen was wounded in the attack. The Redeemer was destroyed, but after Tano and the remnants of her squadron returned, the two remaining destroyers jumped into hyperspace.

While Jet relayed this news to Mundi, Yularen began reallocating the bombers to provide air support for the beleaguered ground troops. This effort produced one available squadron, which Yularen was able to divert to assist the converging remnants of the attack force upon Skywalker's request. With the landing zone secured, Skywalker and Tano led a strike force in destroying the shield protecting the droid foundry, allowing the Republic forces to begin their attack on the foundry itself.

While Grievous personally engaged Kenobi in combat aboard the Jedi's light cruiser, Skywalker and Gallia succeeded in rescuing Koth from the Separatist destroyer, and joined with Kenobi and some clone troopers in escaping aboard the ambassadorial shuttle after the light cruiser was destroyed. The cyborg general, meanwhile, fled to Saleucami's surface following his duel with Kenobi.
