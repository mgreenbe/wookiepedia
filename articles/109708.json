Born into Clan Vos, the ruling bloodline of the planet Kiffu, Vos possessed a strong sensitivity to the Force, one that nurtured in him an exceptional talent for psychometry. After Jedi Master Tholme discovered his Force sensitivity, Vos underwent initial Jedi training on his homeworld instead of at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, as his people hoped to one day make him a Guardian of Kiffu. Yet everything changed for Vos after his power-seeking great-aunt, Tint\u00e9 Vos, secretly sacrificed his parents\u2014Guardians Quian and Pethros Vos\u2014to Anzati vampires and then tricked him into psychometrically experiencing their murders. To master his subsequently acquired fear of Anzati, Vos began proper Jedi training as Tholme's Padawan learner, though the memory of his parents' deaths spawned in him a darkness that he would never be able to vanquish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vos took the lead in a number of missions and events, including the Stark Hyperspace War, and he eventually achieved Jedi Knighthood. He took a Padawan of his own, Aayla Secura, and they formed a close bond over their years of training. While investigating a glitteryll smuggling ring, the two were dosed with glitteryll and robbed of their memories, bringing Vos ever closer to the dark side. Finding an unlikely ally in the bounty hunter Vilmarh Grahrk, Vos returned to the Jedi Temple with help from Jedi Master Mace Windu to recover his forgotten training. Once Vos rescued Secura from the Anzati Dark Jedi Volfe Karkko, Secura resumed her own training under Tholme, though it was not long before Vos and Secura were again reunited. Their combined efforts in rescuing the heir to Ryloth's Clan Secura earned them elevations in the Jedi Order: Secura became a Jedi Knight, while Vos, who had by now overcome the loss of his memory, ascended to Jedi Mastery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After participating in the Battle of Geonosis, Vos turned down orders from the Jedi High Council to serve as a Jedi General in the resultant Clone Wars, instead opting to oversee a spy network that he had developed within the rising Confederacy of Independent Systems. Vos later turned to infiltrating the Confederacy, specifically Count Dooku's inner circle of disciples, to find the identity of the second Sith Lord who was eluding the Jedi. Vos's three-year gambit subjected him to constant tests for Dooku's trust, pitted him against his friends, and saw him commit several cold-blooded assassinations as he sought to justify his exploits. His deceptions persisted until the Siege of Saleucami in the war's final year, in which he renounced Dooku's fold once and for all and returned to the Jedi Order. Vos finally became a Jedi General and took up a command within the Grand Army of the Republic, only to be betrayed by his clone troopers during the Battle of Kashyyyk as part of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's Order 66, which branded all Jedi as traitors to the Republic. Thanks to aid from Vilmarh Grahrk, Vos survived the ambush and went into hiding with his lover, Khaleen Hentz, and their son, Korto Vos, to escape from the newly christened Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quinlan Vos was the Force-sensitive son of Quian and Pethros Vos, members of Clan Vos, the rulers of Vos's homeworld of Kiffu. Vos was born with psychometric powers, and thus destined to become a Guardian like his parents. Most Kiffar had psychometric ability to some degree, but Vos's latent ability with the Force enhanced his own, and he was considered by many to be the best exemplar of that ability that had ever lived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially, Vos's people were unwilling to give him up to the Jedi Order, as that would require him to relocate to Coruscant, cutting him off from his homeworld. As a compromise, Jedi Watchman Tholme agreed to train Vos initially on Kiffu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This changed, however, when both of Vos's parents were murdered by Anzati. Vos's aunt, Tint\u00e9 Vos, then forced the boy to use his abilities to read the memories implanted in his deceased mother's medallion. Vos cried out in terror for days, reliving the nightmare of his parents' deaths, and only Tholme was able to calm him. Knowing that Quinlan would never be safe on his homeworld, now that his aunt had become its ruler, Tholme took the boy back to Coruscant and presented him to the Jedi Council, who agreed that he should enter into regular Jedi training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a youngling, Quinlan trained alongside other Jedi hopefuls such as Siri Tachi, Bant Eerin, Shylar, and Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Through the Force, Vos immediately felt a strong connection to Secura, who was being concealed amongst slaves for her protection. Sensing she was in danger, Vos rushed to her rescue. Vos was able to communicate with Secura through the Force and together they defeated the rampaging wampa. Vos persuaded Master Tholme to test Secura for Jedi training on Coruscant, where she passed the tests and later became Vos's own Padawan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padawan Vos also fought beside his master in their mission to Thyferra and in the Stark Hyperspace War, where he met and became friends with fellow Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. When the war was over, Tholme went away for a while, leaving Vos with Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn on Ragoon VI to complete a survival-training mission. While trying to show off and best each other with different moves, Vos accidentally tumbled into the water. Kenobi jumped in to rescue him, but both were saved by Jinn, who called upon the Force to lift them from the vortex of churning waters in which they'd become trapped. Vos recalled later that, as he was drowning, it had seemed easier to just let go, to surrender himself to \"a comfortable and very familiar darkness.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also during his apprenticeship, Quinlan had a romantic relationship with fellow Padawan Shylar.

While both Jedi were in the settlement of Mos Espa, Vos witnessed an early meeting of Jinn and Anakin Skywalker, who Jinn would soon come to believe was the Chosen One. Secura, who, as a 16-year-old Padawan, was working with Vos on Tatooine, later told the Jedi Council that she and Vos heard about his death just before they left the planet.

He was able to escape to the roof, encountering a small group of bounty hunters upon doing so. Acting instinctively, he Force pushed them off the edge, sending them to their deaths. Diving into one of Nar Shaddaa's many dark alleys, Vos encountered Vilmarh Grahrk, a Devaronian smuggler."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using a commandeered speeder bike, the two managed to find a place to hide, avoiding assassins at every turn. Villie, as he liked to be called, explained to Vos that the local criminals had made bets based on how long Vos would survive on Nar Shaddaa, knowing of his Jedi origins and his amnesia. Once they were safe, Villie put his blaster to Vos's head and pulled the trigger, but it turned out that Vos had switched the weapon's power cell, his powers having forewarned him of Grahrk's betrayal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vos kicked Grahrk to the ground and, after grabbing the blaster and switching its power cell once again, demanded Grahrk tell him everything he knew, or he would kill him. Before he could do so, two beings carrying lightsabers walked into the room, claiming to be Jedi. Grahrk told him that they were in fact \"bad boys,\" and with that the two attacked. Vos instantly killed one with Villie's blaster, then grabbed his downed opponent's green lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As it touched his hand, visions suddenly flowed through his mind, including that of his Padawan, Aayla Secura, and his own name. With a great deal of his power returned to him, he quickly killed the other lightsaber-wielding foe, a Gotal. Villie revealed that, while Vos was killing the fake Jedi, he had made a new bet: that he would get off Nar Shaddaa alive. After being convinced to go with Grahrk, Vos grabbed the other lightsaber which he could sense belonged to Secura. With that, the two began their trek off the Smuggler's Moon."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Leaving Nar Shaddaa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the way, Vos encountered more intense visions; of Tatooine, Bib Fortuna, Tint\u00e9 Vos, and glitteryll, primarily. After learning Grahrk knew of Bib Fortuna and his possible whereabouts, Vos quickly convinced him to help find the Twi'lek and, knowing they could never leave the moon until doing so, Grahrk agreed. Vos and Grahrk located the Twi'lek, and the Jedi asked Fortuna aggressively what glitteryll was. Bib only revealed that \"someone in a high position on Coruscant\" was behind it all before a group of guards burst into the room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vos and Grahrk quickly dispatched the guards, though Fortuna was able to escape during the melee. After the emergence of a droideka, the two escaped through a window, stealing Bib Fortuna's parked speeder, and immediately made their way to Grahrk's ship, the Inferno. Upon arriving to the ship's docking bay, Vos discovered Grahrk had failed to mention he lost the ship in his recent betting on Vos's possible demise, so the ship now had security droids surrounding it, conveniently forcing Vos to help Grahrk regain his ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon entering the ship, Vos and Grahrk were not allowed to take off due to the Inferno's onboard navigation droid, NT 600, correctly claiming that Grahrk was no longer the owner. With annoyed bounty hunters and gamblers fast approaching, Vos quickly told the droid that activating the ship's shields would \"protect the new owner's investment.\" Agreeing with this logic, NT activated the shields, though they began deteriorating instantly due to an ion cannon-wielding bounty hunter firing upon it. A Quarren named Gorzima suddenly came on-screen, accusing Villie of stealing back the Inferno. Vilmarh promised that he would simply fly the Inferno off-planet, collecting his soon-to-be winnings due to Vos escaping Nar Shaddaa, and allowing himself to buy the Inferno back. Gorzima disagreed, but Vos was able to persuade him, allowing the two to fly away from Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grahrk transferred his new-found credits to Gorzima once out of the atmosphere. With Vos not being sure where to go next to fill out his memory a bit more, Grahrk reasoned that the best place would be where he was born. So, NT 600 scanned the Jedi and discovered that he was a Kiffar from the planet Kiffu. After granting him transport to his homeworld, Grahrk stayed behind on the Inferno, allowing Vos to seek out his past, and perhaps learn a little more about himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On his home planet, Vos met with his aunt, Tint\u00e9 Vos, the Sheyf of Kiffu and Kiffex. Though she shunned the Jedi, as well as Quinlan Vos's Padawan Aayla Secura, she told him that a few weeks ago he and Secura had come to Kiffu to learn of a drug called glitteryll. She said that it was a combination of glitterstim and ryll, that the Corporate Sector Authority was interested in it, and that he and Secura had investigated the matter on Nar Shaddaa and Tatooine. She also echoed Bib Fortuna's statement on Nar Shaddaa that someone high up on Coruscant was behind it all.

Vos didn't recognize her, and, after a brief moment of disappointment, Asant\u00e9 brought him to Pol Secura, a Twi'lek chieftain on Ryloth and uncle of Aayla Secura. Vos explained his situation to Pol, who said that, last time Vos and Aayla Secura came to Ryloth, they found nothing in their investigation and went to Kessel, the place of origin for glitterstim, one half of gliteryll's components. Weary from his ordeal on Nar Shaddaa, Vos stayed the night at Secura's residence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he awoke, he was contacted via hologram by Vilmarh Grahrk, who told him to meet him by the Rock Gardens of Ryloth. Upon arrival, Vos was confronted by another Devaronian, Holmar Grahrk, Villie's cousin. Holmar was quickly shot down by the approaching Villie, who told Vos that he had recently made another bet that he would get off Ryloth alive. Vos wasn't ready to leave just then, and the two investigated a nearby cave, Vos picking up traces of his and Secura's visit there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they arrived, the two found a mass web of giant spider eggs; the kind found normally on Kessel, and used to make glitterstim. They were soon attacked by a group of hatched spiders, resulting in Grahrk being knocked down a pit, though he was able to survive by landing on a spider web. All of a sudden, Asant\u00e9 Vos walked in wielding a blaster, and shot Vos in the back. She explained that he and Secura had gotten too deep into the glitteryll situation, and that she and Pol Secura had overdosed them with glitteryll to wipe their memories, in the process protecting them from higher-ups behind the scenes. As she prepared to kill Vos, pulling her blaster up to his head, she was stabbed from behind by the mother spider.

Pol fearfully revealed that she was now one of his servants, motioning to her, mere meters away. Vos introduced himself and asked if she remembered him, but she didn't. He handed her the lightsaber and encouraged her to ignite it; even when she did, she recalled nothing.

As Jedi Secura rushed to her uncle, Grahrk pulled Vos up, explaining to him that going after Aayla Secura would be useless, because to her he was nothing more than the man who made her kill her uncle.

Without warning, Grahrk shot Vos in the back, presumably with a stun blaster. When the Jedi awoke, he found himself handcuffed, laying next to Chom Frey Kaa, a large white Twi'lek, and Vilmarh Grahrk. Kaa revealed that in fact Grahrk was the one who transported the spider eggs from Kessel to Ryloth in the first place, and that he also brought Vos from Ryloth to Nar Shaddaa after his memory wiping.

A fellow worker explained to him how to do it, but just as he was about to eagerly demonstrate on an unfortunate Kwi, Vos punched him to the ground, taking out his lightsaber and killing all attacking slaves.

Quinlan Vos would later demonstrate his level of mastery of Vaapad in defeating Sora Bulq during the Siege of Salecumi in lightsaber combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Count Dooku also trained Vos in some elements of Makashi, while characterizing Vos' dueling skills as \"appalling.\" The Kiffar had also been shown to hold his lightsaber in reverse grip, indicating he was a practitioner of Shien. Such examples of this fighting style were displayed in various missions: Anzat, Kiffex, Kiffu, the assassination of Senator Viento, Titavian IV, Saleucami, and Kashyyyk. At one time, he utilized Jar'Kai against Tysr. Vos's abilities with a lightsaber allowed him to defeat and slay three Dark Acolytes during the Clone Wars; Kadrian Sey, Tol Skorr, and even Sora Bulq. It should be noted that Bulq was considered to be one of the greatest swordsmen of his time, but Vos only defeated him with help from other Jedi supporting him with battle meditation, not only his own skills."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to his considerable lightsaber combat skills, Vos had the power of psychometry, the ability to read images from objects. Vos was also one of the few Jedi who was able to use Force cloak, which he learned from Tholme and taught Secura. He could locate his enemies based on their effects on the environment. He also had considerable working knowledge of espionage and counter-intelligence, and worked as a double agent. While working undercover, Dooku personally trained Quinlan Vos in the dark side and in a variety of dark side powers including Force lightning, Force choke, and to tame animals and bend them to his will, most notably a krayt dragon. At one time, he tried to learn inertia, but had dislocated his shoulder in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quinlan Vos first appeared in The Phantom Menace. His appearance in that film was confirmed by his Databank and Encyclopedia entries, as well as his Star Wars: The Vintage Collection action figure from 2012.

After this, he would take center-stage in the Ostrander/Duursema work Twilight. Vos appeared primarily in the Star Wars: Republic and Star Wars: Jedi comic book series from Dark Horse Comics. In an interview, Ostrander elaborated on the origins of Quinlan Vos's name, explaining that he patterned after Qui-Gon Jinn; he had wanted a name with the same number of syllables. He was later portrayed by Doug Wangler, a model for Duursema, at Celebration III."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quinlan Vos showed up again in the Star Wars Tales comic, \"Ghost\". In the story, Vos rescued a young Han Solo, who was trying to find a treasure with a map he won in sabacc, from a swoop gang on Socorro. The swoop gang hunted Vos because they believed him to be a Jedi. After Vos confronted young Solo, he disappeared into the shadows, never to be seen again. However, that Star Wars Tales issue came out when most of Tales was considered to be Infinities.

Interestingly enough, the Quinlan Vos action figure has more than a passing resemblance to actor Guy Pearce, whose character in the film Memento has problems with memory loss, similar to Quinlan Vos. In 2008 Hasbro released another comic pack with Quinlan Vos and Commander Faie ('08/#13). It also included a reprint of the Star Wars: Republic #82 comic book.
