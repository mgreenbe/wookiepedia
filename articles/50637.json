Han Solo and his wife, Leia Organa Solo, in disguise as Lord Rysto and Syrule, were attempting to track down the Jedi Knights turned Joiners Jaina Solo and Zekk, and bring them back from the front lines of the war. While looking for a spot to land in the Lizil hangar, Leia spotted a Freight Queen taking off. That left an empty space behind for another starship to land, though Han and Leia instead decided to land the Swiff, a Dray-class transport that they had borrowed from their old friend Lando Calrissian, in another part of the hangar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Freight Queen appeared in Dark Nest III: The Swarm War, the third and final instalment of the Star Wars: The Dark Nest Trilogy written by Troy Denning and released in 2005."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
