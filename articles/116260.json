While been guarded by Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano, the cruiser was attacked by Separatists under the command of General Grievous. The cruiser's main reactor was damaged, causing the cells to open and the prisoners who therefore can attack the Jedi. Rkk was one of the first to attack the Jedi and told them that he would exclude them as Womp Rats on Boonta Eve. While the Jedi were trying to hold the prisoners, the crew tried to repair the reactor until they ultimately failed. Rkk was among the prisoners to cooperate with the Jedi and helped repair the ship, allowing it to move safely through Republic space. Skywalker thanked the prisoners for helping and guaranteed their aid would affect their parole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
