During the time of the Galactic Empire, she helped Leo and his wife Tepha Leonis to raise their two children: their daughter Dhara and their son Zare. Since Leo and Tepha worked as agricultural scientists for the Ministry of Agriculture, Nags and her employers settled on several worlds including Hosk Station, Moorja, and Viamarr. She raised Dhara and Zare from infancy to adolescence."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Moving to Lothal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time that Dhara and Zare were fifteen and fourteen years old respectively, the Leonis family had settled on the Outer Rim world of Lothal, a backwater agricultural world that was the target of a new Imperial development program. Shortly after their arrival, Dhara was accepted to study at the Academy for Young Imperials in Lothal's Capital City. To celebrate Dhara's acceptance, her parents organized a farewell dinner that was attended by several Imperial dignitaries including Governor Arihnda Pryce, Lieutenant Piers Roddance, and Assistant Vice Minister Sarkos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the dinner, Auntie Nags helped serve the guests refreshments. She also scolded Zare for not making conversation with one of the guests, Sarkos. Despite his annoyance, Zare did not snarl at her due to his respect for her. Instead, he apologized and admitted that he was despondent because he was too young to attend the Imperial Academy. Auntie Nags tried to encourage Zare by telling him that he was a Leonis and that he should make the best of the situation by studying hard at the Junior Academy of Applied Sciences until he could join his sister at the Academy the following year. She then returned to serving jogan clusters and suggested that Zare chat with Ames Bunkle, Dhara's classmate at the Academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Auntie Nags did not approve of Zare's participation in his school's grav-ball team, the AppSci SaberCats, since she regarded grav-ball as a dirty and dangerous sports. This view was shared by Zare's mother Tepha, who lamented Lothal's obsession with this full-contact sports. When discussing Nags' predicament with his sister Dhara during a visit to the Imperial Academy, Dhara jokingly asked whether Auntie Nags considered dirty or dangerous worse. Zare responded that he thought it was a tie."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Growing Resistance to the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to Auntie Nags, Zare had made friends with a fellow grav-ball player named Beck Ollet, whose family orchard had been expropriated by the Empire to make way for a mineral extraction project. One night, Zare, Beck and another friend, the hacker Merei Spanjaf, had discovered that unknown insurgents had planted explosives on Imperial mining droids in the Westhills. After the insurgents had fled, Beck gave the Imperial authorities the wrong directions, which enabled them to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following that incident, Auntie Nags served woke Zare up the next morning to inform him that an Imperial officer was visiting their household. She informed him that the officer wanted to question him at the Security Ministry. After telling Zare that his parents were serving the visitor a cup of caf, her eyes flashed red. She proceeded to berate Zare for embarking with his friends on a \"foolish adventure.\" Zare accused her of eavesdropping and denied he had been involved in any wrongdoing. At that remarked, Auntie Nags rolled way to grumble. Zare subsequently cooperated with the officer but omitted any mention of what Beck had done."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the winter season, Zare had a disagreement with his school's athletic director Janus Fhurek. The bigoted Fhurek had demanded that Zare cull the SaberCats' two alien members, the Rodian Frid Kelio and the Aqualish Hench Sina, from his team to appease \"bigoted\" fans. The fair-minded Zare had stood his ground and refused. At dinner time, he related the incident to his parents and Auntie Nags. The nanny droid commented that Fhurek had obviously not been raised right; a view shared by both Leo and Tepha."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a grav-ball competition, Zare and Beck visited the Westhills where they discovered that the Imperials were using hazardous mining machinery. Upon arriving home, Auntie Nags chided Zare for his dirty state and went puttering around the kitchen, hunting for non-existent dust particles. When Zare asked for a hot drink, she complained that it would keep him awake all night. She also reminded Zare that his sister was coming home for the winter break this week and that he needed to complete his application to join the Imperial Academy. However, she agreed to serve him some hot chocolate. When Zare shed a tear about his dilemma on whether to join the Academy, Aunty Nags patted his shoulder and comforted him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dhara returned in time for Zare's fifteenth birthday. That night, Auntie Nags had brought out a decorated glazed birthday cake. During the spring season, Zare took care not to alarm Auntie Nags and focused on his exams. On one occasion however, Zare and Beck witnessed Imperial troops opening fire on a demonstration of farmers protesting their eviction in the Westhills. When Zare arrived home, he ignored Auntie Nags's flurry of questions and settled down to watching a factually inaccurate HoloNet report on the shooting incident, which painted the farmers as the aggressors."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Disappearance of Dhara"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Auntie Nags' persistent fussing over trivial matters did little to prepare her for a major crisis in the Leonis family.

Despite efforts by the Imperial authorities to locate her, no sign of Dhara was ever found on Lothal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Leo accepted the official Imperial account and blamed himself for not noticing his daughter's alleged distress, Zare and Tepha were skeptical. During the summer season, Zare, at the suggestion of his friends Beck and Merei, devised a plan to infiltrate the Imperial Academy in order to discover the whereabouts of his sister. After returning home, Zare discussed his idea with his mother Tepha. Knowing Auntie Nags' reputation for eavesdropping, Zare asked the nanny droid to do a manual shut down. Despite her protests, Nags' reluctantly complied with his wishes. While Auntie Nags was switched off, Tepha reluctantly consented to Zare's plan but warned him that they could never tell his father, who was a staunch Imperial loyalist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Zare's farewell dinner prior to joining the Imperial Academy, Auntie Nags served the guests trays of dainties.

When Merei asked whether Tepha was at home, her eyes flared yellow after Merei failed to address her master as Mrs Leonis. Despite her annoyance with the teenager, she still informed Tepha that Merei had come to visit her. During the visit, Merei assured Tepha that she was continuing her search for Dhara.

Nags even recalled that Zare was sitting at the spot where she had been sitting during the last winter break. During the last day of the winter break, Nags was annoyed when Zare and Tepha decided to go on a shopping trip to Capital City's marketplace without bring her along. Knowing her reputation for eavesdropping, her owners had not brought her along since they wanted to discuss Zare's plan to rescue his sister Dhara. Contrary to Imperial reports, Dhara had not run away but had been abducted for a secret Imperial program called Project Harvester, which was based as a secret installation connected to the Arkanis Academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Zare was transferred to the Arkanis Academy as a reward for exposing a fellow Cadet Nazhros Oleg's attempt to pervert the course of justice by protecting his uncles, Auntie Nags answered the intercom when Zare's girlfriend Merei visited the Leonis family household.

Due to its highly sensitive nature, Tepha did not share this information with Auntie Nags and Leo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Zare's transfer to Arkanis, Auntie Nags answered his call in the comm terminal in the Leonises' apartment in Capital City.

Merei then told Tepha and Leo that they needed to flee into hiding because Zare had been arrested and put on trial.

Despite her mothering nature, Auntie Nags was also known to eavesdrop on conversations. This prompted Zare to instruct her to do a manual shut-down on at least one occasion. The elderly nanny droid was never known to sleep except during her rare maintenance cycles. She usually puttered around the entire day.
