Among the three styles, this provided a solid defense against blaster fire. In lightsaber combat, the user could also effectively defend against multiple opponents or a single, stronger opponent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Relying primarily on speed and multiple attacks, the fast style had certain disadvantages. Firstly, its attacks focus on speed which limited the amount of power behind them, making it easy for a strike to be parried or overpowered. Secondly, its attack range was considerably shorter, forcing the practitioner to take down multiple opponents one at a time unless they're grouped closely together. Third, the fast style's defenses could quickly be broken by an opponent with superior physical strength. Since the blade was kept so close to the body, a strong, cunning opponent will simply hammer the user's blade in the hopes that the practitioner would tire and leave themselves open."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Applications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This style bore some similarities to the Soresu form of the Jedi Order, since practitioners kept the blade close to their bodies for a very rapid and effective defense against melee weapons and blasters. It also shared similarities with Ataru, making use of acrobatic jumps and rolls to strike an opponent from unexpected angles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tavion Axmis used a variant of the fast style that had many similarities to that of Shien, being more aggressive and offensive than the fast style that is used by Kyle Katarn. Fast style enabled very fast parries or trap shunts, allowing users to trap and then redirect an opponent's strike to knock them off-balance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
