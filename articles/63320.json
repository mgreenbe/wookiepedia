The region was explored by the Galactic Republic between 20,000 BBY and 15,000 BBY\u2014during the Great Manifest Period\u2014and subsequently annexed. The sector was absorbed by the expanding Hutts circa 5000 BBY, but the Republic won control back by 4000 BBY. After a period of Sith and Republic rule, the Hutts gained control once again by 1000 BBY, losing control during the Imperial Period. By 137 ABY, the sector was controlled by Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
