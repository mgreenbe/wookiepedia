Ever since he arrived he had a cold that changed from mild and annoying to full and severe. Many blamed this for the Ithorian's lack of conversation. In reality he was simply quietly watching all that went on in Gelgelar Free Port, and there was very little that went on that he did not know about. No person, freighter, cargo or event came to town without him knowing. This information was available for sale if enough credits were offered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
