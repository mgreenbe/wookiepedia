Firing small metal projectiles using electromagnetic force, the resultant projectile was super-accelerated to deal kinetic force out of proportion with its small size; all in a manner similar to the more popular and well known Verpine shatter guns. Despite this however, the projectiles dealt far less damage than the infamous shatter gun counterparts - being able to be stopped by heavy armor. Additionally, they left tracers and produced muzzle flash like other rail guns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A common upgrade to the stock miniature rail gun, was the Rika/Moab mini rail cannon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
