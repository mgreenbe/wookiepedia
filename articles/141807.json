Unlike most settlers, she trusted the Jedi, remembering the good they had done when the Enclave had stood firmly. However, she understood that the Jedi in general had an extremely bad reputation on Dantooine, and even she could do nothing about it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The opportunity to change that fact came in 3951 BBY, the year when relations between the settlers and Azkul's Exchange mercenaries grew especially tense.

It was at this time that Meetra Surik arrived on Dantooine, looking for Vrook, and the Administrator granted her the permission to search the ruins of the Enclave. In turn, Surik agreed to help the settlers in any way possible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Exile's investigation, during which Master Vrook was freed from the mercenaries, triggered an open conflict between them and Khoonda, leading to the Battle of Khoonda, when the mercenaries attempted to infiltrate Khoonda and kill Adare.
