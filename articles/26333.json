They were shaped like cylinders, a hundred meters high and nearly that many wide, made of yorik coral. Chom-Vrone digested rock, turning it into a semi-plasmatic state in a process that was similar to that carried out by Yaret-Kor cannons on coralskippers. When a Chom-Vrone had a full load, hundreds of meter-wide tubes would extend from the top of the Chom-Vrone, spewing the plasma out onto the surrounding ground. This had the added effect of keeping the perimeter clear and any undesirables out of the region."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the war ended, many Chom-Vrone remained on the ravaged planets.
