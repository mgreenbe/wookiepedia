They were steadily losing ground, eventually leaving only a small group of clone troopers and a pair of ARC troopers forming the last line of defense protecting a large city. The shield protecting the trench that the clones were using for cover was about to fail, and with no help available it looked as though the day would be lost; as a large force of battle droids and tanks approached, the shield finally collapsed. The clone forces sent one final message and engaged their opponents, destroying at least one tank when their attack caught the droids by surprise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A LAAT/i gunship approached, however it was fired upon and destroyed. A Jedi General managed to jump clear of the transport before the craft's destruction, however, and engaged the droid army. It was the Kel Dor Jedi Master Plo Koon; though the clones were unable to understand the language he spoke, they eventually found a way to communicate with the Jedi using hand signals, and the droid army was defeated as the Jedi brought down its artillery pieces on top of the droid infantry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
