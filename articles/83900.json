Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first apprentice was Luke's own father. During the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's planet-killing superweapon, the Death Star.

The loss of his nephew, who fell to the dark side like Vader before him, haunted Skywalker for the rest of his life.

Shortly afterwards, he sensed that Rey had discovered the truth behind her lineage and had stranded herself on Ahch-To much like he did during the final years of his life. As she threw her lightsaber into the wreckage of her ship, Luke appeared and grabbed it out of the air. Admitting that he was wrong in exiling himself, Luke consoled her that her legacy would not be defined by her bloodline but by her heart and her actions. When Rey lamented that Kylo Ren destroyed the final Sith marker that led to where the resurrected Emperor was residing, Luke mirrored the words of Yoda, stating that she had everything she needed. As a parting gift, Luke gifted Rey his sister's lightsaber and raised his old X-Wing from the depths of the ocean for Rey to use and travel to Exegol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rey could hear Luke among the numerous voices of the Jedi of the past shortly before she received the inner strength to overcome Palpatine.

Within the annals of the Resistance, basic training would see all pilots in its Starfighter Corps learning the Skywalker Swoop, which was based on Luke's piloting abilities during the Galactic Civil War. Many remembered him for destroying the Death Star and killing the Emperor, and as such viewed him as a hero of mythic proportions. Resistance pilot Jessika Pava considered Skywalker to be the greatest X-wing pilot of all time. Some questioned whether or not Luke could have used his powers for evil, while others simply viewed him as a myth.

Some time after the Battle of Yavin, he would confer with Nakari Kelen that he regretted his behavior before then, acknowledging he complained \"about everything\" because of his desire to escape from Tatooine. He also acknowledged his scarce talent at lying, a trait that many people could infer. Despite these traits, Skywalker had a happy childhood anyway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, as his skills in the Force progressed and, especially after losing a hand to Darth Vader, Skywalker became more patient and seasoned, and was often seen as having wisdom beyond his years. However, he still retained his idealistic viewpoint, willing to think the best of anyone, and believing that Vader was redeemable. He was also unable to ignore those who needed help, sometimes to the point of endangering missions for the sake of saving someone else's life, as his father would throughout the Clone Wars. Even as a child, he had a strong sense of morality and a need to help others despite likely danger. Skywalker shows consistently throughout the series his sense to protect those that he cares for and loves, for example risking going to the dark side to help his friends, and his love for his sister very nearly causing him to turn, if it were not for his love for his father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the end of the Empire and the death of the Sith Order, Skywalker came to have great hope for the future of the Jedi, coming to believe that if a single Jedi could help bring back balance to the Force, then a restored Jedi Order perhaps could maintain that achieved peace and prevent the dark side of the Force from ever regaining its hold on the galaxy.

He also became more cautious in teaching others of immense power due to Ben's betrayal, feeling finished with the Jedi Order, as evidenced when he initially refused to train Rey and would later decide to abruptly end their lessons after seeing her starting to turn to the dark side. He also now believed that there was no hope for those who fell to the dark side, as shown when he openly expressed that he believed there was no hope for Kylo to return to the light.

Despite his lost faith in his nephew, Luke showed great remorse for failing to stop his fall to the dark side, and for himself ending up being the turning point in Ben's fall. Luke realized something important, that instead of blaming himself he blamed the Jedi for his failures. His belief of the Jedi being romanticized deitys with a legacy of failure remained, but gained realization that if one stripped away the sacred temples, lightsabers, and even the legends about them, they were just good people the galaxy needed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the end, Luke willingly sacrificed himself for the Jedi to be revived and the Resistance to live on.

Skywalker engaged Vader in a fierce duel and managed to hold his own for much of the duel, wounding Vader in the shoulder, impressing the Dark Lord with his skill, though Vader ultimately bested his son and cut off his hand, proving his superiority. Later, Skywalker showed his abilities in battle during the rescue of Han Solo, where a skirmish ensued in which the Jedi killed many guards aboard the execution skiff and Jabba's sail barge. Later, on board the second Death Star, Luke showed his improved abilities and was finally able to duel Vader on an even footing.

Several years later, Luke effortlessly overpowered the Knights of Ren, seamlessly dodging their attacks and destroying their weapons before using the Force to disarm them. When fighting an angry Rey using her quarterstaff, Luke, using a metal rod, easily blocked each and every single one of her shots after fluidly dodging her initial assault and hitting her once before soon disarming her.

By the time of the Battle of Hoth, Skywalker had the ability to pull his lightsaber to his hands, though not without difficulty. Under Yoda's training, this ability was further developed, enabling him to levitate several objects at once while meditating.

Shortly after recovering the ability to use the Force, Luke detected Rey and Ren's bond and in his anger, he Force pushed Rey's hut into pieces around the two and broke the connection. When defending himself against Rey, Luke easily pried an antenna from the roof of a hut and summoned it to himself in seconds and managed to keep himself suspended off the ground after being knocked down by Rey. Whereas Kylo noted that the very effort of using the ability of Force projection would kill Rey, Luke was able to use the complete version of this ability, giving all of himself into the Force, which allowed him to interact with others, sending a life-like image of himself across the galaxy to distract Kylo Ren and the First Order. The projection was so powerful that Luke was not only able to fool the senses of droids, as C-3PO had acknowledged his presence, but even Kylo was completely tricked into believing it was the real him; he maintained it for a prolonged period of time, although the strain ultimately proved to be fatal and killed the Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke was one of the few Jedi who was able to truly become one with the force and preserve his consciousness as a Force Ghost.

Michael Arndt's initial script for The Force Awakens had Luke first appear halfway through the film, but Arndt came to feel that Luke's direct involvement would upstage Rey and the audience would cease caring about her. Ultimately, he, J.J. Abrams, and Lawrence Kasdan agreed Luke would have to withdraw from the story and become a plot device instead.

I hope it will be for the audience too.\" Johnson explained: \"Honestly, that came out of what I felt was a necessity, because it came from where he was at the end of Episode VII, The Force Awakens. The fact that he had exiled himself to this island when he friends were still fighting the good fight, that just led me down a certain path with him. I couldn't really see any other alternative.\"; \"Knowing that Luke is a hero, knowing Luke from growing up, I know he must think he's doing the right thing by taking himself out of the equation.

As opposed to him just being another character that had to be juggled into the plot, if that makes sense.\" He was unconcerned that the audience might feel unable to cope with Luke's death so soon after Han's murder in The Force Awakens, as Luke's passing was victorious and peaceful, not a violent defeat. Hamill was particularly not keen on Luke dying, feeling he had to return a triumphant hero, but Johnson argued that \"if Skywalker just came back like he did in the original trilogy, an optimistic fighter, he's just an older version of Rey.
