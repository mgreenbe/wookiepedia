Consisting of a thick, gnarled trunk that grew up out of the gelatin sea, a toli tree typically had fewer than ten leaves. The plant was nourished by soaking up nutrients from the gelatin through its system of needle-roots, rather than by photosynthesis. The leaves were used as sails to carry seed pods on the wind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
