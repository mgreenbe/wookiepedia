After his first metamorphosis, he became mature and recalled his time on Rimbaux Four and Solax where mating was plentiful and he enjoyed feeding on the refuse of others. The next stage began after an occurrence known as the molt. At this time, the Ithorian underwent physical changes that made his outward appearance less appealing to his species. It was a time of cruelty when even his closest friends rejected him. He then describes the final stage of life he spends wandering the Free Trade Zone while his outer casing shrinks and his body lengthens. However, by this time, he has made peace with his exterior changes and the disappointments of life. He realizes that these changes were always going to occur and that he must accept the new sad and lonely nature of his existence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
