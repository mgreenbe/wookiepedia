Kibbs decided to take advantage of the tumult that surrounded the Trade Federation's unlawful Invasion of Naboo and the subsequent battle to free that world so as to take control of Naboo for himself. A charismatic person, he managed to gather a group of Humans and Gungans to his side, influencing their minds with his Force powers; they then formed a group called the Renegade. He was eventually defeated by a group of ex-members of the Naboo Underground, who may have killed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
