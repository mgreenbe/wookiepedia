After being lured to the Shintel system through false intelligence, the FarStar was infected with a computer virus that blew out the ship's hyperdrive. Qulok's Fist, hired by Moff Kentor Sarne, attacked the vessel as it was stranded, making several fast attack runs before withdrawing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
