Non-Human humanoids prefer these blasters, due to their wider trigger guard and thicker handle allowing for larger hands and fingers to operate a conventionally sized blaster. Not to say that it did not see use among Humans; it was merely used by non-Humans more frequently."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DT-12 required a power pack to operate and was able to fire 50 shots. This weapon had a close-range stun setting as well, meaning the wielder could switch the weapon to fire stun shots instead of lethal fire, however the close-range stun setting was limited to a range of only 9 meters. The DT-12 cost 900 credits to purchase, but its ownership and use was restricted to legitimate military organizations and police forces only."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
