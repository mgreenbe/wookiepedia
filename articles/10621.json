The village was a simple, rustic place consisting of huts, with a stone wall around the perimeter. To protect themselves, the villagers used their abilities to create a dense mist that surrounded the village. This mist could only be penetrated by Force-sensitives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In around 1 ABY, the cyborg Dark Jedi Mellichae and his Sith Shadows began attacking the village. Mellichae believed that killing or capturing the village's Force-sensitive residents would be a good way for him to regain the trust of Emperor Palpatine and maybe even earn a place at his side. The villagers worked hard to prepare the village for the attack, but it sustained significant damage. Eventually, with the help of a spacer, Mellichae was defeated and imprisoned in the Aurilia Prison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterwards, the village retreated into the mist and cut itself off from the rest of the galaxy.
