Tansarii Point Station was a space station built by Nova Orion Industries by the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. Located near Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system, the station was owned and operated by the Car'das, and was headed by a Twi'lek named Inaldra. Shortly after Inaldra assumed command, the station was riddled with problems. Wild animals ran freely in the station's atrium, dysfunctional droids roamed the droid repair center, and representatives of Black Sun and Genesis Red were present on the station. This dire situation resulted in more and more injured workers being sent to the station's sick bay, much to Alisia's chagrin, who remarked that Inaldra was losing control of the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alisia tended to this influx of patients with the help of a couple of his associates, including a 2-1B surgical droid named Billingsly, and the Bothan Medic Master Aja Sen. Despite this valued assistance, Alisia still lamented the lack of qualified medics. Alisia recognized the dangers that were present on the upper and lower levels of the station, including their infestation by voracious beasts and thugs loyal to the Hutts. However, not all of Alisia's patients were injured onboard Tansarii Point Station. At least one patient found their way back from Station Gamma, a nearby research facility similarly plagued with violent thugs and out of control droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alisia had tan skin and black colored eyes. Alisia was opinionated, and criticized Inaldra for failing to keep the peace aboard Tansarii Point Station. He also bemoaned the lack of qualified medics willing and able to handle the sudden influx of injured station workers. Regardless, Alisia remained committed to the goal of healing his patients."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a station nurse aboard Tansarii Point Station, Alisia wore a white and grey reinforced jumpsuit.

He was added to the game with the release of Publish 25's New Game Enhancements on November 15, 2005, which included a New Character Tutorial featuring Tansarii Point Station.

He would also divulge details about the station to players who conversed with him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alisia's gender was not explicitly revealed in any kind of quest dialogue, however using an in-game text command identified Alisia as a male. However, it should be noted that due to game mechanics, all Gran character models in Star Wars Galaxies were male by default, regardless of the developers' intentions. This was similarly true for other species in the game, such as Gungans. Even though all Gungan character models were male from a game mechanics perspective, the graphical models were still sometimes used for canonically female characters in the Star Wars Legends continuity, such as Lob Dizz and Fassa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
