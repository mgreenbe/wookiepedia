She operated from a cave near Dee'ja Peak with Bloodlord Trienial. Circa 1 ABY, Trienial's group shot down a shuttle that crashed in the Gallo Mountains. The Darkwalkers plundered the wreckage and stole a bio-scanner. Their objective was to use the bio-scanner to make a bomb that would remain inert until its target with the programmed bio-signature came nearby. A spacer working with the scientist Tanoa Vills then raided the Darkwalker Cave to recover the stolen bio-scanner. Bloodlord Trienial and Flangolial were both killed during the assault."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flangolial was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
