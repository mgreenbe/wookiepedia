The gas-processing vanes of the floating city Cloud City, located on the gas giant Bespin, each contained a carbon-freeze chamber, which used a mixture of carbonite and Bespin-mined Tibanna gas for flash-freeze preservation. After the Battle of Hoth, one of Cloud City's chambers was used by the Galactic Empire to encase the Rebel smuggler Han Solo, whose frozen form was then handed off to the bounty hunter Boba Fett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
