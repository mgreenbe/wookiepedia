After her death, Kant's lightsaber was given to her former Padawan by the Jedi High Council and he kept it with him tucked under his Jedi robes. During the Nihil attack on the Valo Republic Fair around 231 BBY, Gios used his master's lightsaber to kill a Trandoshan Nihil who was about to kill him. Later during the attack on the Republic Fair, Gios used Kant's lightsaber in conjunction with his personal lightsaber to defend Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh and Togruta Queen Elarec Yovet, among others, from a frontal assault from the Nihil, led by Tempest Runner Lourna Dee. After the battle at the Republic Fair, Stellan Gios let Padawan Bell Zettifar borrow Kant's lightsaber to replace his own which had been lost during the attack on Valo to be used during a strike on the Nihil's base of operations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
