The caves ran through the mountains just outside of Prak City, and were believed to have been formed by ancient lava flows. After the natives of Prakith discovered large gemstone accumulations within the caves, outside mining companies moved in. After many years, the artificial tunnels that were created for mining purposes made the caves unstable. Numerous collapses occurred, claiming the lives of miners. After the caves had been wiped clean of all gemstones, they were abandoned, and became a haven for criminals and refugees. Andren Biel, who worked of the Alliance, was forced to hide in this cave system after his undercover mission had failed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
