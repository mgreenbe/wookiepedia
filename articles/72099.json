Serenity was the first to greet the Grand Master, informing him that he was late and that the priestess had been waiting for him. She led Yoda to a gathering room where the other priestesses manifested around him. Each of the priestesses reacted to Yoda in a manner befitting the emotion they represented, with Joy expressing the belief that the Grand Master had the ability to succeed in learning to sustain his consciousness after death. Serenity then asked for the blessing of the other priestesses and the five joined hands, beginning to rapidly spin around Yoda and becoming a blinding blur that transported him to elsewhere within the planet, where Serenity would begin his testing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grand Master was successful in his first test, overcoming his fears, after which Joy and the other priestess manifested behind Serenity as she claimed Yoda must trust in their teachings to succeed. The priestess then directed him to pass through the Valley of Extinction, warning him that he must do so without emotion otherwise he would see their faces and be seduced. Yoda was successful in resisting the temptation and made it to the other side of the valley. There Joy, Anger, Sadness and Confusion set his final test, traveling to the Sith homeworld of Moraband to face his greatest fears. Once their challenge was set, they de-manifested, causing their robes and masks to fall to the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Moraband, Yoda was confronted by spectre of the Sith Lord Darth Bane who tried to tempt him to the Dark side but was unsuccessful. Joy and the other priestess then manifested before Yoda, warning him that while all his previous trials have been conjured by them, the final test was out of their control. Yoda was to enter a chamber of darkness where the Sith once sacrificed Jedi, and where he would have to face the Sith of his time, Darth Sidious and Count Dooku. The five then faded away, leaving the Grand Master alone for his final challenge. Yoda faced the Sith, and emerged from the chamber, where he was informed by Serenity that Jinn would commune with him and train him to become immortal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Joy and the other four priestess, who referred to each other as cousins, embodied the connection between the Living Force found in lifeforms and the greater Cosmic Force.
