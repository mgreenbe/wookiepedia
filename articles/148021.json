Strong-willed, and resistant to manipulation of the mind through the Force, this species produced a body odor similar to sweetspice. With a reputation for being stingy and bad-tempered, many Toydarians were possessed of a strong sense of pride in their work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A mammalian race of winged, stout bodied humanoids, the Toydarians had stubby\nfacial tusks which protruded from their lower jaw and framed a short pudgy trunk. Typically a Toydarian had blue-green skin, except over their stomachs which were cream-colored, and each hand and their webbed feet had three digits each. While their stubby legs could support their body weight, Toydarians' primary mode of locomotion was their use of the wings on their upper back. Despite the frailty of their wings and the apparent heaviness of their large gut, Toydarians were remarkably buoyant. Indeed, Toydarian bodily tissue was extremely absorbent of natural gases in the air, which made them incredibly light weight. Though their wings could beat as fast as ten times a second, the effort burned up large amounts of energy, causing the species to need to replenish itself often through regularly eating mass quantities of food. In order to fuel this hyperactive metabolism, Toydarians would eat concentrated foods and egg-seeds. Most of the bloodiest wars in their history were fought over food supplies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Similar to the Hutts, Toydarian brains have an unusual composition which made them resistant to influence from the Force. The males of the species usually showed sparse whiskers, though their craniums remained bare of any hair. Toydarian newborns emerged from their mothers' wombs fully developed, and were able to fly from birth. This characteristic was a vital survival adaption; land-bound creatures fell prey to the dangerous grabworms that roamed the planet's marshes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Conquered by the Hutt Empire long ago, the Hutt had little interest in occupying the world's stagnant wastes and instead set up a feudal system whose vassals answered to the Hutts. Setting up an agriculture-based economy, Toydaria thrived as its population increased, surviving monsoons and widespread fungal diseases throughout their history. Establishing a rail system to connect their swamp-bound cities, all air traffic was restricted to priority Hutt transportation due to safety concerns on a planet where the natives flew naturally."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While maintaining a good relation with their Hutt superiors, the Toydarians stayed out of most galactic events, having little contact with the Galactic Republic through its wars and conflicts. During the Republic's final conflict, the Clone Wars, King Katuunko entered into an agreement with the Republic, allowing them to build a base within Toydarian territory. Shortly after this, the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems retaliated against Katuunko and dispatched an assassin, Savage Opress, who killed the king."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While subjugated by the Galactic Empire after the fall of the Republic, Toydarians saw very little interference in their daily lives during the Galactic Civil War and the eventual destruction of the Empire. As their Hutt rulers were wary of the power of the New Republic, Toydarians remained aloof during the fledgling government's early days. However, the two joined forces when the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy. Despite putting up a valiant defense, the Toydarians were conquered, but did not see lasting harm done during the short-lived occupation of their world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being ruled by the Hutts, the Toydarian people were able to govern themselves free of major outside intervention through the establishment of a feudal monarchy. A ruling king sat on the planet's throne, allowing vassals to form allegiances and have minor disputes to solve their own problems. The king made sure to keep his vassals happy and to have their allegiance, but would occasionally encourage infighting to reveal the true character of the vassals and weed out treachery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A common trait of all Toydarians was their shrewd business sense and their ability to haggle any deal. A loyal and proud people, these traits could be off-putting to outsiders, as many Toydarians in the galaxy were seen as crooks or slimy businessmen, but this was not always the case."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Toydarians in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a people ruled by the Hutts, Toydarians were commonly seen in the employ of their masters throughout Hutt Space and in other Hutt-ruled colonies. Other Toydarians decided to leave the confines of the Hutt-dominated sector and make their fortunes elsewhere in the larger galaxy. Though some Toydarians were known merchants and con artists, many led respectable lives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
