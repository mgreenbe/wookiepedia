They grew in a week, and became refugee fare during the Yuuzhan Vong War. They were apparently rather large; Han Solo ate them in at least two bites. They were apparently large enough to note that Randa Besadii Diori could eat them whole with his gaping maw. They were very bland, although herbs belonging to the Ryn could apparently improve the taste. They were often served steamed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
