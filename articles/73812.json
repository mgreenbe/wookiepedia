The sentient inhabitants of the planet, the Kaminoans lost their dryland cities and architectural treasures, such as the capital Derem City and the Clock Spires of Harai Nova. However, their technology permitted them to move into stilted cities rising above the global ocean, and their genetic knowledge made the preservation of many drowned species possible through cloning. Such engineering also shaped the Kaminoans themselves into a nearly uniform race."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4500 BBY, Galactic Republic scouts made contact with Kamino, whose superiority in the field of cloning brought a number of breeding requests from various locations. More than four millennia later, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army. The Sith Lord Darth Sidious oversaw the project's completion, ensuring its secrecy by having Kamino deleted from stellar databases. The army eventually participated in the Clone Wars of 22\u201319 BBY on the side of the Republic, fighting against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Three battles took place in the system\u2014one in 21 BBY, another in 21.83 BBY and a third in 19.42 BBY, which devastated the cloning facilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the end of the war, Kamino became a fortress world of the Galactic Empire, dedicated to expand the Stormtrooper Corps, and the clone uprising of 12 BBY\u2014orchestrated by rebellious cloners\u2014was rapidly quelled.

Since Kaminoan cloning was superior to contemporary methods, a number of orders were made by both nearby and farther contractors, which resulted in breeds like the shovel-handed miners of Subterrel and the Leech Legion of the Unknown Regions.
