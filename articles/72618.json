Known for his taste for violence, Nath was used as hired muscle. Although Covington accepted to pay the ransom, things turned bad and Felicia was killed by the kidnappers. The poor girl was jettisoned into space from the starship on which she was being held. Jurgen Nath was identified by the authorities at that moment but he managed to flee and escape justice for many years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Almost three decades later, by the time of the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Jurgen Nath was living on Rori where he was leading a small group of bandits. However, Wernell Covington was still looking for the escaped murderers of his beloved daughter. In fact, two members of the group that kidnapped Felicia were still free: Jurgen Nath and Vladlun Travan. Circa 1 ABY, Wernell Covington hired a spacer to investigate the whereabouts of the remaining kidnappers. With the help of Horace Korr, a retired Corellia Times reporter, the spacer was able to identify the two remaining murderers. An associate of Covington in the Narmle Militia was later able to provide the last known locations of the criminals. The spacer tracked Jurgen Nath to his hideout and fought Jurgen's bandits. The spacer finally found Jurgen Nath and killed him for his involvement in the kidnapping and death of the young Felicia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jurgen Nath was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
