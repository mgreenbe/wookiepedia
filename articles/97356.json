Its headquarters were located in the Ageyn Foothills. During the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance, the N.S.H. was affiliated with the Galactic Empire and directly involved in the fight against the Rebellion. Indeed, the N.S.H. had very similar points of view with the Empire. The N.S.H. mercenaries were all male Humans. Furthermore, they usually practiced torture during their interrogations. In addition to their mercenaries, the N.S.H. also used battle droids such as B1-Series battle droids and droideka."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, Galiir Ac Yandar, the N.S.H. commander, sought to make his unit a full military branch of the Imperial armed forces rather than a separate entity. Circa 1 ABY, Ac Yandar met Imperial Colonel Braedic Ekirk in Dearic to negotiate the new operational status of the Nightstrike Soldier Hegemony. Although Ekirk deeply despised Galiir, he considered that the N.S.H. could be a valuable asset for the Empire. However, the negotiations were disturbed when slicers of the Aggregate Civil Liberties Organization, an anti-Imperial movement, planted information that almost ruined Yandar's reputation with the Empire. Colonel Ekirk thus dispatched a spacer who was recommended by CorSec officer Dathnaeya Loessin to raid the A.C.L.O. office. Galiir Ac Yandar ordered the spacer to kill Leeta Poandeu, the slicer who was responsible for slicing his system, and then contact and assist Mark Hieks, a N.S.H. covert operative infiltrated in the A.C.L.O. office. Ekirk also tasked the spacer to slain A.C.L.O. terrorists who sabotaged Imperial shipments. The spacer eventually achieved all those objectives and was rewarded for the assistance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the same time, N.S.H. troops shut down an A.C.L.O. clinic and imprisoned the Wookiee medical officer Syirlabradawk. They also confiscated a shipment of medical supplies before its delivery to Rebel forces on Talus. Alliance Captain Quellium and the A.C.L.O. representative Trezya Nenei therefore sent a spacer to the N.S.H. base. The spacer assaulted the base and managed to retrieve the medical shipment and rescue the medical officer, killing many N.S.H. enforcers in the process. The death of so much N.S.H. mercenaries later allowed the A.C.L.O. to easily ambush an unit of N.S.H. enforcers and stole their shipment of Imperial medical computers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nightstrike Soldier Hegemony appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
