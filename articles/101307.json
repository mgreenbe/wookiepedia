It consisted of replacing worn-out organs with technological counterparts, or sometimes cloned organs. Organ replacement was the reason Bakurans lived much longer than Humans elsewhere in the galaxy. For example, Eppie Belden was young enough to personally lead a guerrilla uprising at the age of 132. The droid 11-4D was versed in organ replacement surgery. In addition, cloning was occasionally used for the process of creating fresh organs to replace defective organs, as a means to ensure that the people undergoing the procedure don't reject the new organs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
