Based on the para-wing gliders used on Cloud City, it had a blaster mounted above the pilot. The glider capability meant that the noise level was low for a repulsor craft, making them suitable for deployment by the Galactic Empire for Stormtrooper stealth raids, and for patrols in variable terrain areas such as the forest world of Aris and the canyons of Ebra. The R-444 was controlled by using the leg rest bar and hand grips attached to the wings. Flight was fairly simple, especially at low speed, and thanks to the repulsor unit, long distances could be covered easily. The pilot used both hands and their legs to steer, which made it difficult to use the blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
