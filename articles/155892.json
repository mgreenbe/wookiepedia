In 28 ABY, the undercover New Republic senator Leia Organa and C-3PO managed to enter the cantina and access data from the local computer core. They managed to download banking records linking Rinnrivin Di's cartel to a paramilitary faction called the Amaxine warriors. The cantina was later destroyed along with the rest of the complex when an Amaxine starfighter crashed into the nearby Amaxine base's ammunitions depot during a brief dogfight; destroying the entire complex and killing everyone aboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
