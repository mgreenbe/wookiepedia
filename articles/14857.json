Several months before they removed Moff Kentor Sarne from power on the planet Kal'Shebbol, the New Republic engaged Imperial forces on Vaenrood. During the engagement, New Republic ground forces prosecuted an action against Imperial units in mountainous terrain, supported by X-wing starfighters flying air support. During the engagement, one of the X-wings\u2014piloted by Darryn Thyte\u2014had its wing clipped by Imperial artillery fire. The resulting crash buckled and snapped the canopy, which in turn sheared off most of Thyte's right arm above the elbow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Vaenrood was mentioned in Darryn Thyte's biography in The DarkStryder Campaign, a book published by West End Games in 1995."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
