It was piloted by an unidentified Yinchorri pilot, who flew the craft to the Alliance Fleet to pick up Princess Leia Organa for a meeting with the Yinchorri Council of Elders. The craft was shot down by a TIE pilot attempting to assassinate Organa, and the entire Yinchorri crew was killed in the crash."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shuttle was a small streamlined craft with a single blaster cannon situated on the top of the ship. Two engines were situated on opposite sides of the shuttle. The blaster cannon turret was accessible by a small ladder that sat next to the pilot's chair. Organa was strapped into the turret during the crash, which saved her when the shuttle crashed in the Yinchorri desert."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
