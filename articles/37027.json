Although the brothers preferred raiding ships, they accepted the task. Unfortunately, the meeting ended in a battle. During the battle, the crossfire damaged a Rebel freighter with an important cargo. The freighter crash-landed on a nearby planet and the Venithons and their colleagues, trying to show their value, followed it to plunder it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
