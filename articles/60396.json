They were armed with E-5C heavy blaster rifles and a disc shield emitter built into their chests to stop most types of incoming enemy fire. However, their feet were still vulnerable and it slowed their movement significantly. Additionally, the heavy units could enter into a sentry mode, during which the droid would focus on using the heavy firepower of a Z-6 rotary blaster cannon. They were nearly identical to standard Geonosis-manufactured B1 Battle Droids with the exception of the grey markings on their head, torso, crotch and limbs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
