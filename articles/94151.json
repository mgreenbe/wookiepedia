Created on Nar Shaddaa, they were used as a source of entertainment in gladiatorial combat. The Circus Horrificus was known to have used at least three of these beasts in 32 BBY for this very purpose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mutant akk dogs could be distinguished from regular akk dogs by the much greater amount of spines covering their heads and bodies, the presence of chin spikes, a reduced amount of digits on their feet, and flattened faces. Also of note was that the subspecies possessed green blood instead of the normal red. The prominent scaly plates of the akk dogs appeared to have been lost in exchange for a thick, leathery hide. Despite this lack in protection, their skin still proved to be very resistant to lightsabers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides these physical mutations, it was noted by Mace Windu that the minds of these beasts had been altered to such an extant that not only had their sentience been reduced to that of savage animals, but their connection to the Force had been severed as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
