When Chewbacca went to rescue Han during the Black Fleet Crisis, he went to Formayj to find information about the Yevetha and the Koornacht Cluster. He was not known to haggle, and was old enough to have created many tricks of the smuggling trade. He carefully appraised the worth of each item and piece of information he sold before parting with it. Much of the information he garnered came directly from Coruscant and New Republic Intelligence, and in fact Alpha Blue used him to funnel information to Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
