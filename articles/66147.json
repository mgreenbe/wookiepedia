Counselor to the Empire Gallius Rax intended to take the Imperialis into the Unknown Regions with the former Commandant Brendol Hux, his son Armitage Hux, and his child soldiers to restart a new Empire. However, Rae Sloane took his place and traveled with the Hux's and the child soldiers into the Unknown Regions. The ship was piloted by a Sentinel droid that was programmed to serve the Emperor's will even after his death. After traveling for several months, they rendezvoused with Emperor Palpatine's flagship Eclipse, which had been dispatched in advance as part of the Emperor's posthumous Contingency plan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
