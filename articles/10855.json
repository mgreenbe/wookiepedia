Grown in secret on the planet Kamino, Aven was one of the Grand Army of the Republic's one hundred elite Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commandos. Like all of the Alpha-class ARC troopers, Aven was trained on Kamino by Jango Fett himself. However, the Kaminoans felt that the ARC trooper's fierce independence made them unpredictable and had them put into stasis until the Battle of Kamino in the first year of the Clone Wars; with the planet under attack by the battle droids of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Jedi Master Shaak Ti had the ARC troopers taken out of stasis to assist in the battle. Once the battle was over and the Republic victorious, Aven and the other ARC troopers would enter Republic service as part of the Grand Army's Special Operations Brigade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 19 BBY, the third and final year of the Clone Wars, Aven held the rank of lieutenant in the Grand Army. When the leader of the Separatist Droid Army, General Grievous, attacked the Republic capital world of Coruscant, Aven was on the surface to aid in the planet's defense. He led the Republic commandos of both Omega and Yayax squads in protecting the headquarters of HoloNet News and Entertainment, ensuring that the HoloNet station would continue to broadcast to the citizens of Coruscant. Once the employees of HNE had assembled a mobile transmitter, both the transmitter and close to a dozen HNE staff members were loaded into a LAAT/i gunship and moved to a more secure location. Aven and the commandos then moved into the foyer of HNE headquarters, where they would hold the building throughout the nearly week-long battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aven possessed a cynic's sharp humor, often quiet but cutting at times. He was critical of Republic Defense Procurement and what Aven viewed as their underwhelming track record, but also sympathetic to the needs of his fellow clone soldiers. In battle, Aven was not afraid of confronting a Separatist super battle droid at close quarters, and his position as an ARC lieutenant afforded him the ability to call in air support from nearby gunships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an Alpha-class ARC trooper, Aven wore the hardier ARC trooper armor rather than the more common Phase II armor worn by standard clone troopers.
