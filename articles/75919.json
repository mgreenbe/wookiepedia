Originally, Khreusis thought the apprentice was there as assigned by their master, but instead, the apprentice was there to retrieve the mask of their ancestor as the latter had commanded the young Sith to. The apprentice soon thereafter revealed this fact and Khreusis threatened that he would tell Darth Thanaton about the situation.
