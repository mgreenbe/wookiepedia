Along with his band mates, Tedn was a registered member of the Intergalactic Federation of Musicians in good standing. Like many Bith, Tedn possessed a highly evolved brain, which allowed him a special acuity when it came to analyzing and relating to music. As such, his talents helped to greatly enhance the quality and popularity of the Modal Nodes' music."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tedn wasn't always a musician. Prior to taking up the fanfar, he was employed as a scout for the Imperial Navy. At some point during the Galactic Civil War, however, Tedn abandoned this field and committed himself to music full time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes had entered into an exclusive contract with the Tatooine crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. They would routinely perform in the courts at Jabba's Palace and his Mos Eisley townhouse, but it didn't take long before they all regretted entering into a contract with the Hutt. Recognizing Jabba's penchant for executing underlings that displeased him at a moment's notice, the Modal Nodes began to fear for their lives. It would only be a matter of time before Jabba decided to make a snack of the musicians, by tossing one down into the dungeon abode of his pet rancor. Fortunately for them, a golden opportunity was fresh at hand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of Jabba's rivals, a Whiphid named Lady Valarian, offered the band 3,000 credits to perform at her wedding to the Whiphid hunter D'Wopp. Figrin decided that the fast money would enable them to get off of Tatooine and out from under the thumb of Jabba the Hutt. They arrived at the Star Chamber Caf\u00e9 reception hall inside the Lucky Despot Hotel & Casino in Mos Eisley."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jabba learned of the Modal Nodes' breach of contract and sent several of his bounty hunters to the casino to disrupt the festivities. As luck would have it, Imperial stormtroopers likewise raided the party, and a massive firefight broke out. During the confusion, the Modal Nodes met a party guest named Wuher, who showed them a quick way out. Wuher put in a good word for them with Chalmun\u2014a Wookiee who owned a nearby cantina where Wuher tended bar. Chalmun hired the Modal Nodes to play a couple of gigs at his bar, the following evening. They were performing when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the cantina seeking a pilot willing to ferry them to the Alderaan system. They continued to perform at Chalmun's on a regular basis. Occasionally, Chalmun's night-shift manager, Ackmena, would liven the bar's atmosphere by singing along with the Modal Nodes' rhythms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after this event, Figrin D'an wagered the band's instruments and equipment on a hand of sabacc. He lost the bet, but the Modal Nodes soon convinced him to win their equipment back. He eventually succeeded, and the Modal Nodes went on to play the intergalactic circuit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tedn was a backup fanfar player in the band and was forced to play second string to the more outspoken Ickabel G'ont.[source?] Tedn and Ickabel would frequently argue over mundane matters such as the size of their fanfar cases.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the Lucasfilm makeup artists played the role of Tedn Dahai in A New Hope. The artist was not given screen credit for the role, and his identity remains unknown."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1995, Kenner released a special Power of the Force series mail-in offer for a five-piece action-figure lot containing the members of the Modal Nodes. Tedn Dahai was one of the action figures featured in the set."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Decipher used an image of Ickabel G'ont to portray Tedn Dahai, as evidenced by the fact that he's holding an instrument that clearly differs from that attributed to Tedn in Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary. This is most likely due to Tedn being almost completely obscured on screen in A New Hope."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1997, Tedn Dahai was released as a twelve-inch action figure for the Wal-Mart exclusive Star Wars Collector Series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2007, the Kenner mold was reissued as part of an exclusive Wal-Mart Commemorative Tin Set containing the members of the Modal Nodes. One of these figures could be either Tedn Dahai or fellow band member Ickabel G'ont, since both play the same instrument. All of the figures in this set wear fabric vests."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
