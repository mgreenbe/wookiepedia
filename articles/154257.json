The fact that the exact time period of Prototypes is never stated makes placing it on a timeline difficult, as does the seemingly immortal lifespan of Gen'Dai like Durge. With the inclusion of the Emperor's cane, the author may have been attempting to hint that the doctor was connected with Palpatine in some way. In addition, the \"war between the Mandalorians and the Sith\" that the doctor mentions could be interpreted as the New Sith Wars, the Clone Wars, or even another conflict. This article, and others referencing Prototypes, assume that it occurred shortly prior to the New Sith Wars, as context clues in the story seem to point to its placement there. Officially, though, no date has been laid down for Prototypes' events, and attempts to date them remain conjecture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
