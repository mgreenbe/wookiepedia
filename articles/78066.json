At some point, Krestock teamed up with the bounty hunter Raxine to claim a bounty on the individual Philo. The pair had a disagreement regarding how they were going to share the proceeds of the bounty so, to decide the matter, they attempted to tear Philo in half, with whoever got the bigger half taking the larger share of the proceeds. Krestock later regaled the tale of Philo's death to the Human Reglis Taal, unaware that Taal was Philo's brother, and Taal shot and killed him. Taal later detailed his encounter with Krestock in his publication Endings And Beginnings: An Autobiography."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
