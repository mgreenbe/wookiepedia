At some point, the Father was forced to withdraw from the temporal world with his children to a realm known as Mortis after his mortal wife, the Mother, became the infamous dark side user known as Abeloth. During the time of the Clone Wars, the Father learned that the Chosen One had been found, and decided to meet him in person. When the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano visited the planet Mortis, Skywalker encountered the Father on his monastery, and was tasked by him to pass one test, in order to find out whether he really was the Chosen One.

With the balance of the Force being tipped toward the dark side due to the Son's existence not being balanced by the Daughter, the Father warned the Jedi to leave the planet, before his Son could use their ship, but unknown to him, his child turned Skywalker to the dark side, after showing him the events of the galaxy and his life in the future.

After that, the Father and his children spotted from a geyser on a jungle planet more than a million years prior to the Clone Wars.\nHis Son and his Daughter expressed an affinity toward the dark and light side of the Force respectively, and it was his duty to keep them in balance; also, his children's strength flowed through him, as they were directly tied together.He told his children to never drink from the Font of Power, or bathe in the Pool of Knowledge; however, they eventually disobeyed him, with the Daughter bathing in the Pool and the Son drinking from the Font, and is how the two became incarnations of the light and dark sides of the Force.

One day, while the others were fighting in the home's courtyard, she quickly snuck a drink from the Font, then bathed in the Pool. The Father pulled her out using the Force, but it was too late. The Font and Pool restored the Mother's youth and bestowed on her great power and immortality, but it also corrupted her. From that moment on, she was no longer the Mother, but Abeloth, the Bringer of Chaos. She attacked the Son and Daughter, beating them into submission until the Father interfered and restrained her.
