Realizing the danger the new weapon poses, Rieekan sends for the group of Rebels who survived the original Death Star, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Chewbacca, and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2. The three Rebels and two droids are sent to the planet Hockaleg in the Patriim system in order to infiltrate an Imperial construction crew and make their way on board the Tarkin. However, Darth Vader observes as the Rebels arrive in the giant weapon, and sets events in motion to capture his long sought after adversary, Luke Skywalker. But little does the Dark Lord know that some of his own men are secretly plotting against him due to his vicious punishments imposed against their fellow Imperial officers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "David Michelinie and Walt Simonson begin their regular run on the title with this issue.
