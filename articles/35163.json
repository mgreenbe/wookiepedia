It could be used to search computer systems for specific information, and could search thousands of data screen units in less than three seconds. General searches, such as \"stormtrooper\" yielded thousands of results; specific search strings such as \"stormtrooper garrisons in the Yartexx quarter\" would return more accurate results."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike the DataSearch Engine 9C, the 12C-A did not function with the addition of a power condenser.
