After the location of the pirates was confirmed by a probe droid, the Empire hired the bounty hunter Boba Fett to scout out the pirate base and destroy their early warning systems. Fett succeeded in the task and an Imperial task force was brought in to attack the pirate asteroid base to root out the leader, who attempted to escape aboard an Interceptor-class frigate.

However, his investigation was interrupted by the news of a Rebel uprising on the starship-producing world of Fondor.
