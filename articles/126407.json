It had a high-pressure methane atmosphere that was unpleasant or deadly to offworlders. Using the methane and Skako's plentiful metallic resources, the technology-focused Skakoans covered the planet in industry and turned it into an ecumenopolis. For many millennia it remained disconnected from the Galactic Republic due to the Skakoans' xenophobic and isolationist tendencies, but eventually the Skakoan Foreman Wat Tambor of the Techno Union became de facto representative of the world and its people in the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the world indirectly supported the Confederacy of Independent Systems, due to Tambor's allegiance with them. As a consequence, following the end of the war the Galactic Empire placed emigration restrictions on Skako and caused its people to suffer greatly, although many Skakoans were happy to remain isolated from the galaxy on Skako."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located in grid square L-9 on the Standard Galactic Grid, the planet Skako sat between Brentaal and Fedalle on the Hydian Way hyperspace route. The world had a high-pressure methane atmosphere that to offwordlers was uncomfortable at best and deadly at worst, with even non-native methane breathers finding the pressure unpleasant. Rich in metallic resources, Skako was developed into an ecumenopolis by the technology focused Skakoan species native to the world.

The world was then pictured for the first time in Star Wars: The Force Awakens Beginner Game, a roleplaying game released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2015.

During the episodes set on Skako Minor, characters refer to the world as just \"Skako\" several times, and Anakin Skywalker referred to Skako Minor as \"Skako\" in the 2019 book Choose Your Destiny: An Obi-Wan & Anakin Adventure. However, the 2018 role-playing supplement Fully Operational clarified that Skako and Skako Minor were separate worlds. A trivia gallery caption in the episode guide for the episode \"A Distant Echo\" also erroneously describes Skako Minor as \"home\" of the Skakoan people, rather than Skako."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
