He was the cousin of the renowned hunter Boba Fett, making his repeated failures at apprehending bounties even more comical to his peers. At some point before 6 BBY, Fett accepted a bounty for the Gungan Senator Jar Jar Binks of the planet Naboo in the hopes of redeeming himself in the eyes of his colleagues. Tracking Binks to the desert world Tatooine, Fett was caught unprepared by the planet's harsh climate, which put him at a tactical disadvantage. Such was his confusion that he mistook a Senator Jar Jar Binks commemorative drinking cup for the Senator himself. Although he apprehended the cup, Fett failed yet again to retrieve his bounty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Melvin Fett, a humanoid male cousin of the more well-known mercenary Boba Fett, was born into Clan Fett sometime prior to 6 BBY.[source?] As he grew up, Fett chose to pursue a career as a bounty hunter. He attempted to collect at least a few bounties but was unable to do so at each opportunity, which caused his fellow bounty hunters to tease him. At some point during the reign of the Galactic Empire, Fett, who hoped to prove himself to his colleagues, accepted a bounty for the Gungan Imperial Senator Jar Jar Binks, who was a representative for his homeworld, Naboo. The intelligence that he gathered on the Gungan led Fett to the Outer Rim world of Tatooine, which he mistakenly identified as a \"dessert\" planet instead of a \"desert\" planet. In the hopes of an easy and glorious catch on a world of cupcakes and ice cream, Fett journeyed to the sunny Tatoo system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arrival in the deserts of Tatooine, Fett was surprised to learn that while the planet's environment offered little in the way of confectionery, it did have massive amounts of sand and two scorching suns. Fett had brought his heavy Mandalorian armor, which only made matters worse\u2014he started sweating heavily in the warm climate and experienced optical pains that obstructed his eyesight. Disoriented, yet still motivated, Fett eventually made his way to an area close to a cold-drinks outlet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before long, Fett happened upon a local Jawa drinking soda from a Senator Jar Jar Binks commemorative drinking cup. The drinking receptacle's top resembled the Senator himself, and was equipped with \"talking action\"; the trinket played loud audio clips of Binks. Fett immediately recognized the voice of his quarry, but, due to his impaired vision, he mistook the Gungan-shaped cup for the Senator. He pulled his blaster pistol to apprehend the Gungan but tripped over a small, black desert rock, causing him to fall to the ground and hurl the blaster at the unsuspecting Jawa. The weapon hit and rendered the native unconscious, the novelty cup flying from his hands to Fett. Happy to have collected what he thought was his first successful bounty, Fett looked forward to telling the other bounty hunters of his deed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Melvin Fett's ineptitude at his profession was a constant point of disappointment for him, and a trait that earned him the ridicule of his fellow bounty hunters. The constant mocking and lack of respect from his peers caused Fett to shed tears on more than one occasion. Regardless of their scorn, Fett yearned for the acceptance of his detractors. He was quite clumsy and easily fooled, and even believed that Tatooine was a dessert planet. Despite his lack of professional success, Fett maintained a positive outlook on life. When he successfully apprehended what he thought to be Senator Jar Jar Binks, he was ecstatic, looking forward to being recognized as an equal by the bounty hunters with whom he socialized. Fett often talked to himself, spewing forth lengthy monologues on the details of his mission and revealing his deepest feelings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Melvin Fett wore a suit of Mandalorian armor consisting of a green jumpsuit that even covered his boots, and was adorned with protective padding on his elbows and knees. His stomach and chest were covered by a thick armored carapace. The padding was secured by brown straps, the likes of which also supported his blaster pistol's holster. Fett's head sported a Mandalorian helmet, painted green and red, which was complemented by a broadband antenna. He wore light green protective gloves, and his neck was defended by a thin, dark green scarf. All the heavy equipment he carried had its drawbacks during his time on Tatooine, causing him to sweat heavily and muddling his eyesight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Melvin Fett's first and only appearance was in the short comic \"Melvin Fett\", which was collected in Star Wars Tales 20.
