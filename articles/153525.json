In that year, a series of uprisings were springing up throughout the Yinchorri system, a conflict which drew most of the Jedi High Council away from Coruscant. Stationed at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant at the time, this Jedi was present when a group of Yinchorri infiltrated the Tower of First Knowledge in an attempt to slay the Jedi Initiates housed there. The Jedi in the Temple attacked the raiding party in force, this being among their number. Successful, the invaders were repelled and the Jedi only suffered two casualties, Jedi Tieren Nie-Tan and Jude Rozess."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This alien Jedi was created by penciller David\u00e9 Fabbri for the second issue of the Jedi Council: Acts of War comic book arc.
