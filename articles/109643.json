This was partly achieved by removing the strap used to secure the blaster in place which was found on common holsters. The notorious bounty hunter Cad Bane had dual quick-draw holsters for his twin modified LL-30 blaster pistols. Han Solo also carried his custom DL-44 heavy blaster pistol in a quickdraw holster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
