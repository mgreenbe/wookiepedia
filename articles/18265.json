One of these posters referred to a Rodian named \"Ludlo, brother of Greedo, last seen at the cantina in Star Wars.\" These posters may have referred to the same character seen in The Star Wars Holiday Special. The name could also refer to a second Rodian who appears in Chalmun's Cantina in A New Hope. This Rodian can be distinguished from Greedo by his lack of an orange vest. Because the posters refer to a character \"last seen at the cantina in Star Wars,\" this second Rodian might be named Ludlo. However, no source other than the 1978 poster mentions any siblings for Greedo other than Pqweeduk, who died well before A New Hope."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
