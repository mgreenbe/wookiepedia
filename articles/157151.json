Shortly before the attack on a pirate station, he was defrosting a Bor to assist the interrogation officer's failed attempts to break a prisoner known only as Joystick Chevron. Captain-Inspector Magna Tolvan soon arrived and intervened, wanting to take Chevron away. The warden failed to see what she could do that they could not but Tolvan told him that they wanted Chevron for another investigation. After telling the warden that the girl could not be deployed on their next battle, the warden led Tolvan in the direction of Chevron and left a lieutenant to take her to Chevron's holding cell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
