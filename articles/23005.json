As per Republic Navy strategy, the camp was located on the edge of one of Serroco's Stereb cities, large settlements of stone towers and pyramids constructed by the native Stereb species. The camp comprised a number of ships, both Republic and fringer, that served as barracks, restaurants, and other establishments for Republic soldiers. These ships included numerous Hammerhead-class cruisers, troop transports that housed naval personnel, and the Little Bivoli, a fringer mess ship that became extremely popular amongst the men of Camp Three."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Featuring the talented Trandoshan cook Slyssk, the Little Bivoli was actually run by two of the Republic's most wanted fugitives\u2014Zayne Carrick, a former Jedi Padawan wanted for his involvement in the Padawan Massacre of Taris, and the Snivvian Marn Hierogryph, his \"accomplice.\" Situated as the compound was on the \"mudhole\" Serroco, Republic personnel had trouble staying dry at Camp Three. Other than the soldiers, Serroco's native Stereb also wandered the camp, eating scraps. Air traffic to and from Camp Three was directed by a manned control tower, and surrounding loudspeakers alerted Republic servicemen to enemy forces in the system. In case of an attack, Camp Three, like the other camps on Serroco, was equipped with a missile defense system, but it was not kept online when no assault was expected."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3963 BBY, the Mandalorian warrior clans, in the midst of their campaign against the Galactic Republic, threatened the Expansion Region world of Serroco, a full member of the Republic.

The Mandalorians started off the proceedings by firing a barrage of nuclear missiles, and Carrick could only watch as his vision came true. Initially appearing to be headed for Karath's ships, the missiles angled around the Republic fleet, aimed at the camps all along, Mandalore the Ultimate's way of punishing the Republic for what he saw as an honorless defense.
