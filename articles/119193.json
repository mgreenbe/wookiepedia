Posing as a humble merchant, the Yarkora mingled with the various denizens of Jabba's fortress on Tatooine, learning of the intrigues developing behind the Hutt's back and revealing those to Jabba. Shortly before the Battle of Endor, Saelt-Marae traveled on board Jabba's sail barge Khetanna to the Great Pit of Carkoon to witness the execution of two of the Hutt's prisoners, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. The prisoners were to be fed to the sarlacc which resided in the pit, but managed to escape and kill Jabba before destroying the sail barge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saelt-Marae was played by Sean Crawford in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.
