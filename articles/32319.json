During the Auction of Rur on the Sorca Retreat, the Cyban Front, representing various organizations, sent two droids to acquire the Rur crystal so that it could be destroyed. The droids failed to win the crystal, and were both destroyed in a skirmish that took place after 0-0-0 and BT-1 inserted the Rur crystal into one of the Cyban Front droids.
