Notable members included Bail Organa, Leia Organa Solo, Tycho Celchu, Winter Celchu, Ulic Qel-Droma, Cay Qel-Droma, Wade Vox, and Raymus Antilles. They were celebrated as a peaceful and cultured race, with a long-standing involvement in galactic politics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Death Star destroyed Alderaan, millions died. The surviving people returned to the wreckage, known as the Graveyard, to leave presents and pay respect to the ones who died there. Many former residents of Alderaan moved to a new planet, named New Alderaan. A colony of Alderaanians on Ejolus was wiped out after the Imperial Star Destroyer Reprisal tracked them down and destroyed the entire settlement. The destruction of Alderaan by the Empire caused thousands of Alderaanians who were off-world to immediately join the Rebellion, and the majority of Alderaanians serving in the Imperial military promptly defected or subtly aided the Rebellion from within."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
