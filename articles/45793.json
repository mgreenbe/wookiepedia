She resided in a bombed-out paper mill on a planet with an undeveloped society, sharing a stained mattress with her daughter. When Chalis was six years old, her mother tried to sell her to the captain of a Trade Federation exploratory vessel, but Everi was too small. As a result, Chalis remained on the planet until she departed by enrolling into the Colonial Academy. Everi later mentioned her mother to the Rebel Alliance First Sergeant Hazram Namir in 3 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Everi Chalis's mother was first mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
