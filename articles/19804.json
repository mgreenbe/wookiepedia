A loyal and obedient soldier, he rose to his rank by around the time of Order 66, which Emperor Palpatine used to brand all Jedi as traitors to the Empire and initiate the galaxy-wide Jedi Purge. One month into the purge, Bow was part of a 501st stormtrooper squad that Clone Commander Appo took to Kessel. There, Bow and his fellow troopers rescued the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader from a batch of Jedi Knights who had survived Order 66. Bow and his comrades gunned down Jedi Masters Jastus Farr, Tsui Choi, and Roblio Dart\u00e9, executing them in mid-battle with Vader. Following the incident, Bow personally filed reports on several of the Jedi victims, and he continued to serve in the 501st after Appo's death at the Battle of Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone stormtrooper nicknamed \"Bow\" was born on the planet Kamino.

The character goes unnamed within the comic's dialogue, hence leaving his identity ambiguous, with the possibility of the unidentified character being Appo, Bow, or another 501st commander. Further complicating the problem was the fact that, at the time, Purge did not have an established timeline in relation to the November 2005 novel Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader, in which Appo is killed; both Purge and Dark Lord are stated to take place one month after the events of the film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. The Purge commander's identity was resolved in 2006 when Hasbro released a figure of Appo as part of its Saga Collection. The figure package identified Appo as the commander in charge of the 501st squad in the comic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In December 2008, Bow received a short entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, which established that he appears in Purge himself as one of the clone stormtroopers serving under Appo.
