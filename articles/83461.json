Wanted under the Galactic Empire, the Dug smuggled himself to Imperial Lothal aboard a drone barge nine days prior. Upon exiting hyperspace, Bossk's ship detected that it was being scanned by Imperial sensors. Immediately after, the Lothal Imperial Spaceport Authority contacted Bossk through the comlink in the Hound's Tooth's cockpit. Identifying the ship to be a YV-666 light freighter, an agent of the Authority requested the pilot to state their name and business. Bossk replied promptly, telling the agent that he was a licensed bounty hunter who came to Lothal to acquire Gronson Takkaro and provided his Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate number. Confirming this, the Spaceport Authority transferred Bossk to the local Imperial Security Bureau headquarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a thirty-second delay, the Security Bureau officer Lieutenant Herdringer appeared to the bounty hunter in hologram. With the officer, Bossk discussed about his quarry, and was granted permission to operate on Lothal. Herdringer then informed the Spaceport Authority that the hunter had clearance to land, and ordered it to deploy a TIE fighter escort for the Hound's Tooth, which proceeded to the planet surface on autopilot. Landing at the Capital City spaceport, Bossk was inspected by a squad of stormtroopers commanded by Lieutenant Jenkes of the Security Bureau. The Trandoshan then proceeded to hunt his quarry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lothal Imperial Spaceport Authority appears in Ryder Windham's 2014 novel Ezra's Gamble.
