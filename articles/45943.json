Kun was apprenticed to the respected Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas, and in his days as a student he came across forbidden knowledge of the history of the Sith. Extremely confident in his own abilities and naturally quick to anger, Kun was filled with a burning curiosity regarding the Sith, and soon went on his own quest to find out as much as he could. Kun's search led him to the planet Onderon, which had once been ruled by a Sith Lord named Freedon Nadd. With the help of a pair of Nadd's followers, Kun came across Nadd's tomb on Onderon's moon Dxun, and there was confronted with the spirit of the dead Sith himself. Seeing in Kun a potential avenue to regain a physical form, Nadd directed the young Jedi to the ancient Sith homeworld of Korriban. There, Nadd conspired to grievously injure Kun, only healing the man when he accepted the dark side into his heart. Kun's next stop was to the moon Yavin 4, a place with its own Sith history\u2014Kun enslaved the primitive Massassi living there and compelled them to build extensive temple complexes across the forested world. Soon afterward the fully corrupted Kun banished Nadd's spirit, having never trusted the old Sith, and in the process learned of several other nascent dark side users who had learned from Nadd."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeing Nadd's other apprentices\u2014Satal and Aleema Keto, Tetan nobles who had founded the Krath cult and conquered their native star system\u2014as a threat, Kun set out to destroy them. On Empress Teta, Kun encountered Ulic Qel-Droma, a Jedi Knight who had lost his Master to a Krath attack and had gone undercover within the group to seek revenge. Qel-Droma had been seduced by the dark side himself, and while the two briefly dueled, their battle was ended when the spirit of long-dead Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos appeared to proclaim the two fit to call themselves Sith Lords. Exar Kun was to be the Dark Lord of the Sith, and Qel-Droma his apprentice, and together they resolved to bring a Sith golden age back to the galaxy. Allied with the remnants of the Krath and the Mandalorian warrior clans, Kun and Qel-Droma commenced a bloody war against the Republic starting in 3996 BBY. In the early stages of the conflict, Kun traveled to the Jedi library world of Ossus, murdered the Jedi Keeper of Antiquities, Odan-Urr, and took possession of a rare Sith holocron. Kun then took several prospective Jedi followers back to Yavin 4, where he used the holocron's power to corrupt them and reshape them into his Brotherhood of the Sith.

Distrustful of Aleema Keto, who had been responsible for Qel-Droma's capture, Kun sent her to her death soon afterward, manipulating her into causing a massive supernova in the Cron Cluster that was sure to destroy the planet Ossus. Ahead of the Jedi Order's chaotic evacuation of the doomed planet, Kun and Qel-Droma descended onto Ossus and ransacked the Great Jedi Library for its ancient treasures. While Kun made it in and out with a sizable haul, Qel-Droma got caught in combat, killed his brother, was taken prisoner and stripped of his connection to the Force. Shattered by his brother's death, Qel-Droma switched sides and led the Jedi to Kun's base on Yavin 4. In the ensuing battle, Kun refused to go quietly, conducting an ancient ritual to free his spirit from his mortal form so he could wreak havoc through the cosmos.

On Dantooine, Kun honed his skills with the lightsaber by frequently taking on the two Cathar in training duels. From the beginning, Kun harbored a deep, burning desire to become a great Jedi, and pushed himself extremely hard to achieve his goals. Possessed of great ability but not a Jedi Knight yet, Kun regardless had great pride in his own skill and believed himself ready to learn about forbidden knowledge and the history of the Sith. On one occasion in 3997 BBY, Kun snuck into Baas' hut and activated the Master's holocron, which contained a wealth of information about the Sith\u2014it was there that Kun first heard the name of Freedon Nadd, a fallen Jedi turned Dark Lord of the Sith who conquered the planet Onderon and ruled as a Sith king.

Kun responded with a furious outburst of his own, nearly striking Sylvar down, but Baas jumped into the fray in the nick of time and disarmed his apprentice. When Baas challenged Kun himself, Crado tossed the Human his lightsaber, daring Kun to prove his arrogance. Wielding only his wooden staff, Baas quickly found Kun's balance point and sent him flying with only a single blow. But as Kun lay on the ground, he spotted another lightsaber sitting only a short distance away, using the Force to retrieve it and arming himself with both blades.

When Kun insisted that he had to study the artifacts, he was rebuffed\u2014Qel-Droma and Doneeta's Master, the Arkanian Arca Jeth, arrived on the scene and confronted Kun about his fascination with the dark side, revealing that he knew Kun was lying about being an archaeologist. Although Jeth attempted to banish Kun from Onderon, Kun resolved to continue his investigation without their help and raised ship for Iziz. After wandering the streets of the walled city for some time, Kun came across a pair of street preachers named Nebo and Rask, who were being assaulted by an angry crowd for speaking out against the Jedi and expressing Naddist sympathies. Kun rescued the men from their plight, and after an interrogation and a promise of gold, the two Naddists agreed to guide Kun to Freedon Nadd's tomb, which Master Jeth had hidden away in secret on Onderon's moon Dxun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kun ventured on alone after reaching Dxun, easily slicing through the beasts that guarded the massive structure.

Although Kun had some misgivings about proceeding further, he nonetheless journeyed on\u2014passing the sarcophagi of King Ommin and his wife, Queen Amanoa, Kun finally came across the skeletal corpse of Nadd himself. To Kun's shock, Nadd's spirit emerged from the coffin. Offering Kun a \"gift,\" Nadd ordered the Jedi to remove his corpse from the sarcophagus, leading Kun to find a pair of scrolls written by Nadd's former master. Nadd revealed that the scrolls would lead Kun to the \"last home of the Sith,\" where Nadd would meet Kun again to continue the young Jedi's journey down the dark path. Nebo and Rask attempted to rob Kun for the scrolls when the Jedi emerged from the tomb, but Kun lashed out in a burst of anger and quickly slaughtered the pair with his lightsaber. Although Kun was shaken and distressed by how easily he gave into his anger after being touched by Nadd's dark power, he could not dwell on these negative emotions for long\u2014he was overcome with relief and excitement to have the scrolls in his possession, and felt ready to uncover the secrets that awaited him.

As Kun descended into the valley, he was attacked by skeletal corpses made animate by dark side energy\u2014after destroying several, he once again heard the voice of Freedon Nadd, which beckoned him into a nearby temple. Disturbed by the immense dark side power he felt within the place, Kun attempted to turn back and return to his ship, only to find that the exit had been blocked in a sudden rockslide. With no choice but to press on further, Kun followed Nadd's spirit through the halls of the temple until finally coming across a mausoleum containing a large crystal that held the spirits of Jedi Masters defeated by the ancient Sith. As Kun peered into the crystal, Nadd released the cataclysmic energy inhabiting the temple, bringing the whole structure down on Kun. Kun barely survived the collapse, clinging to life with his bones smashed in over a hundred places. As he lay motionless on the rubble of the temple, Nadd's spirit again appeared to Kun, promising that he could only be saved by surrendering to the dark side.

Made whole again, Kun rose feeling stronger than he ever had before. Nadd's spirit guided him to the resting place of many of the ancient Sith Lords, where Kun realized that he now had the ability to read the Sith language written on the sarcophagi. Although Kun maintained that he was still a Jedi and would never belong to the dark side, when Nadd roused several deadly tuk'ata beasts into the room to test Kun, he found that he had lost his ability to draw on the light side of the Force. His lightsaber taken by Nadd and a tuk'ata at his neck, Kun reluctantly called upon the dark side and his inner anger to retrieve his lightsaber and slay the beasts. The spirits of the ancient Sith announced their approval of Kun after this act, and although he still believed that he had not been seduced by the dark side, Kun decided to follow Nadd's bidding and complete his research on the moon Yavin 4, where the Sith magician Naga Sadow had taken his followers hundreds of years before."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Becoming the Dark Lord"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Seizing power"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kun immediately charted a hyperspace course to Yavin 4, landing the Starstorm One next to one of the ancient Sith temples that dotted the moon's landscape.

As Kun moved further into the jungle, he was attacked by a group of Massassi warriors\u2014the mutated and twisted descendants of Naga Sadow's followers, transformed into violent and single-minded guardians by Sadow's magic. Again finding his access to the light side of the Force blocked and hesitant to use the dark side, Kun was injured by the Massassi's flying lanvarok discs and was quickly swarmed by the warriors while attempting to flee the skirmish, while other Massassi began removing parts from his ship and rendered it inoperable. Overtaken by several warriors, Kun was inspected by the Massassi temple priest Zythmnr, who had emerged from twelve years in solitude after sensing the commotion. Recognizing Kun's power, Zythmnr ordered his warriors to bring Kun to the Temple of Fire, where Kun was chained to a Massassi altar to be the honored guest at a blood sacrifice. Using the power of Zythmnr's Sith amulet and Naga Sadow's ancient magics, the Massassi summoned a mighty Sith wyrm, a Sithspawn beast created by Sadow that towered over the unarmed Human.

Although Kun nearly lost control, he emerged victorious, and those Massassi that had survived honored him and pledged their service. The battle over, Nadd suddenly manifested himself again to Kun, expressing his delight with Kun's newfound power and declaring that it was time for them to begin work on Sith alchemy that could once again give Nadd a physical form. Instead, Kun decided that he had had enough of Nadd's orders and tests. With a single burst of anger, multiplied by the power of the amulet, Kun obliterated Nadd's spirit once and for all. In his last moments, Nadd appeared to two of his other dark students\u2014the cousins Satal and Aleema Keto, leaders of the Krath cult, who had used their significant talent in Sith magic to conquer the Empress Teta system\u2014warning them of Kun's power and declaring him to be a pretender to the Sith legacy."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Dark secrets"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By lifting the curse of Naga Sadow from the moon, Kun established himself as the leader of the Massassi on Yavin 4, with the tribesmen believing that he was the returned Dark Lord of the Sith spoken of in their legends.

The Massassi followed their \"God-King\" enthusiastically and reverently over the following months, building statues and monuments to him along with the temples\u2014Kun was willing to allow the tribesmen to believe whatever they liked about him, as long as they continued to obey him. Kun additionally took the opportunity to further his control over the Massassi, imprisoning the souls of their children in a massive Golden Globe, held in the newly built Palace of the Woolamander. Kun began to draw energy off the trapped souls within the Golden Globe, which was bound with Sith magic that only could be undone by Force-sensitive children. For himself, Kun constructed a temple that would come to be known as the Temple of Exar Kun as a private retreat, adorned with Corusca gems and distinguished by an ebon statue of the dark side sojourner. Kun also continued his research into the moon's dark mysteries, eventually deciding to follow the draw of the dark side back into the Temple of Fire where he had defeated the Sith wyrm. Kun surmised that the wyrm was created to guard something older and more powerful, which he was determined to master.

Kun was eager to put this knowledge to the test, and the priest Zythmnr agreed to be his first subject. In accordance with Sith legends that told of alchemy that could turn a warrior into a god, Kun began a dark side ritual in the Temple of Fire where the power of the dark side would transform Zythmnr into \"the greatest of all the Massassi.\" Indeed, when the ritual was completed and the matrix opened, Zythmnr was changed. Kun had infused the priest with a metallic bioarmor and enhanced his muscle mass and bone structure, along with giving Zythmnr razor-sharp claws and a hardened outer hide. Contrary to Kun's assurances, the process was excruciatingly painful for Zythmnr\u2014the Massassi still urged that the process continue, and Kun finished the ritual by infusing Zythmnr with the dark side, using some of his own physical makeup as a template. Zythmnr took well to the treatment and showed promise with the Force afterward, encouraging Kun enough to repeat the procedure on several dozen other Massassi.

Along with two of his Massassi, Kun lifted off from Yavin 4 in the Corsair and traveled to the planet Empress Teta in search of the Ketos, eventually finding his way to the Iron Citadel that the Krath magicians called home. As he approached the fortress, his Sith amulet began to glow\u2014Kun realized that the Ketos had taken possession of the amulet's mate, making them even more of a threat. But by then, circumstances had changed: Satal Keto was dead, slain by a Jedi named Ulic Qel-Droma who had initially joined the Krath as a sleeper agent, but had himself become seduced by the dark side and was leading the Krath alongside his now-lover Aleema Keto. Desperate to save Qel-Droma from his fate, several of his Jedi friends attacked the Iron Citadel from above in a daring bid to extract him from the Krath.

As the two fallen Jedi battled, the Sith amulets they wore began to glow and envelop the pair in energy. The energies from the amulets combined and began to form an image of the ancient Sith Empire, a message carried in the two talismans for centuries. Finally, the image of long-dead Dark Lord Marka Ragnos appeared and ordered the pair to cease fighting, which they both immediately obeyed.

Coupled with a device called the Force Harvester, the Dark Reaper had the ability to drain the Force energy from those around it and focus it into beams, making it a horrific offensive weapon. After the Reaper claimed thousands of lives on Raxus Prime, Kun devised a plan to use the weapon to destroy the Jedi Order.
