They were stopped when a Energy projector was placed and were buried in the ground. The droids were reactivated when Captain Han Solo, his first mate Chewbacca, and the bounty hunter Zuckuss destroyed the projector's power source. The droids reactivated and attacked them. The scorpion-droids continue to attack Solo, Chewbacca, Zuckuss and 4-LOM. The droids were able to pursue the four of them, and followed them as they swam to the Millennium Falcon. Solo was able to get them off the Falcon's hull. When Solo tricked Zuckuss and 4-LOM, the droids resumed their attack on the two bounty hunters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
