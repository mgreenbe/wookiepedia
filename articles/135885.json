A clone of the Human bounty hunter Jango Fett and a member of Gamma Squad, Stoker was born on the planet Kamino to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic's Special Operations Brigade during the Clone Wars. In 22 BBY, Stoker and his squad served at the outbreak of the Clone Wars on the planet Geonosis. However, he was the only member of his squad to survive the battle. Five days after the fight on Geonosis, Stoker was redeployed to the Republic capital planet Coruscant, where the six Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos had barricaded themselves in the barracks of Arca Company. Together with four squads of Republic commandos, Stoker took part in a stand-off before his old training sergeant, Kal Skirata, was able to solve the situation peacefully. Like his clone imprint, Stoker stood 1.83 meters tall. In combat, he used the Katarn-class armor issued to clone commandos with his own customized colors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stoker appeared in the 2006 novel Republic Commando: Triple Zero which was written by Karen Traviss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
