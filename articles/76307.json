The brief gameplay trailer showed the player controlling a lightsaber-wielding Jedi, fighting stormtroopers and vulture droids, before being challenged by Darth Vader. The events of the game begin shortly after Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and conclude during Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.

Zane instructs the Padawans on how to wield a lightsaber, to deflect blaster bolts and duel an opponent. After their training on the ship, the group lands on Kashyyyk and are greeted by Master Yoda, Master Mace Windu and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (as a hologram). Master Yoda greets the Padawans and instructs them to rest for their lessons. The next day, Master Yoda instructs two Padawans on how to use the Force on the training course that the Wookiees trained in for millennia. The two progressed through the course speeding, destroying dummies, jumping, and ducking obstacles with the guidance of Yoda, and continued their training. They learned to use the Force to destroy training dummies; lift, throw, and catch rocks; and lift a Jedi Starfighter. After finishing these tests, their training was over and they had mastered their control of the Force."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle on Kashyyyk"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After finishing their training, the two Padawans and Yoda found Trandoshan transports invading the planet with Battle Droids and Trandoshan warriors.

After reaching the village, Yoda left the Padawans to fight the Trandoshans and battle droids on his own. After dispatching some B1's, B2's, Droidekas and Trandoshans, the Padawans were reunited with Mavra and made their way to the beach to take out a Trandoshan base. After dispatching many Trandoshans, droids, and missiles, the three made it to the base. Zane went inside to blow up the main reactor while the Padawans fought more Trandoshans and droids, and even facing two Trandoshan sword-wielding sport-hunters, Zane set the thermal detonator and they only had a few seconds until the base's utter destruction and the Trandoshans retreated."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Trandoshan Counterattack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the first battle's end, debris and bodies from both factions were everywhere.

All of the Wookiees and Padawans tried to make it to a Raddaugh Gnasp fluttercraft to escape. Before they could get on, a chunk of platform fell in front of Zane and the two Padawans. Before the platform fell, the three made it to a zip-line on the far end and mounted it. After dispatching more droids and Trandoshans, the Jedi made it to some more fluttercraft. But Trandoshans already blew them up with their hover pods. They fight through more invaders and destroy an Ubrikkian floating fortress. Then Master Zane instructed the two Padawans and Chewbacca to escape Kashyyyk and warn the Jedi council of the Trandoshan counterattack. Then she left to engage more Trandoshans.
