He finds out that they are cloning his friend, Jango Fett, and that the clones have had their age factor doubled. If the clones have lived a year they will have aged two, and when they have lived two years they will have aged four, and so forth. Skirata is disgusted with the Kaminoans' practice of \"reconditioning\"\u2014often a term used for terminating\u2014clone children who didn't pass quality control standards. Six \"prototype\" ARC Trooper children, designated Null-class, were labeled defective and scheduled for reconditioning because they would not follow any orders given them. However, before the unruly clones can be executed, Skirata intervenes and takes it upon himself to raise and train them personally, keeping them separate from the other clones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plot jumps forward to five days after the Battle of Geonosis.

Skirata's Wookiee companion Enacca also joins the group, as does Null ARC trooper Ordo and clone trooper Corr. However, the situation is made more complicated when Vau and Delta Squad\u2014Boss, Sev, Scorch, and Fixer\u2014also join the team. Skirata and Vau have a rivalry due to their different philosophies in training clone soldiers. Skirata trained Omega Squad as a role model father-figure, while Vau trained Delta Squad through abusive discipline. Atin has a hard history with Vau since he was beaten so many times under his tutelage. During the course of the story, Etain and Darman's relationship grows stronger, and Etain becomes pregnant with Darman's child but does not tell him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the mission to track the terrorists down, Jinart and Valaqil join in to remind Omega Squad and Etain that they still owe the Gurlanins a debt after they helped the clones and Jedi back on Qiilura.

Later, after the celebration of the squads' victory over their mission, Etain reveals to Skirata that she is pregnant with Darman's child. Skirata is angered by this because he believes Etain used Darman. Nevertheless, the two agree to keep this a secret from everyone else\u2014aside from Jinart and Valaqil\u2014and that the child will be a Mandalorian like his father and not a Jedi like his mother.
