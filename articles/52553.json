The armour could deflect glancing blaster bolts, and was worn over a hermetically-sealed body glove. Magnatomic plates located near the upper-breast-plate allowed for more movement and mobility during battle, and the shoulder-mounted Telemetry pod bounced radio signals back and forth; this created an accurate read of the surrounding environment. The irregular panels on the helmet assisted in redirecting blaster bolts, and helped to absorb the impact afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
