Standing at a height of 2.2 meters and weighing over 150 kilograms, Brooser was a large man\u2014considerably simian in appearance\u2014whose mass consisted of all muscle, except for a protruding belly gained from the consumption of Jargridian Brandy. Brooser garnered the most joy from fighting, reveling in the slightest provocation, with a zeal for gambling a close second. More than his vices, though, he loved his girlfriend, the beautiful and seductive Jezzable. However, her blatantly coquettish manner with the spacers who traveled through their home of Celanon City drove him to the zenith of jealousy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One afternoon, Brooser was present at Gularg's Libation Emporium, a local drinking establishment, when he noticed that Jezzable was assiduously flirting with a newly arrived smuggler. Having decided that he didn't like the look of the smuggler, Brooser provoked a brawl, in which the other patrons soon joined. The fracas continued until blaster weapons were drawn. At that point, Gularg, the Hutt owner of the locale\u2014and an individual who did not condone the use of firearms in his bar\u2014disarmed the opponents and ended the altercation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brooser was a strong, tough working-class man who took pleasure, and was rather skilled, in fighting with his bare hands. One of the most common items that he carried with himself included brass knuckles. Brooser was easily agitated and provoked into displays of violence, especially by Jezzable's provocative actions toward males of all species. Some individuals found Brooser's physical appearance to be anomalous in regard to a standard Human. At one point, a freighter captain named Jorgan Blech compared Brooser to a Wookiee. What was left of the hapless captain after Brooser was finished with him was then pummeled by a Wookiee for insulting his people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brooser first appeared in The Right Place ..., one of the five adventure scenarios written for The Politics of Contraband, a 1992 West End Games supplement for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
