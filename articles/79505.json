He was one of just a few Imperials in the Tapani sector with patronage on Coruscant that was not from the sector itself. He had the power to go head-to-head with any of the houses. When nearing retirement, however, he seldom exercised this power; he was known more as a paper-pusher and did not go out of his way to exert the Empire's will on the sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although he was considered an able leader, Gustavu's success could also be largely credited to hiring competent people and then claiming the credit for himself.
