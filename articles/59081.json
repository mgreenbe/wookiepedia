Under his rule, the sale of rare Tynzo crystals overwhelmed Isobe with wealth. At one point, however, the lord's own son, Captain Thelan, started a crystal smuggling ring. Eventually, law enforcement caught a member of that ring, a young human named Jun Sato.To add insult to the injury, the human had begun a sentimental relationship with Hallux's daughter, Princess Althea. Although Sato defended himself, the Lord of Isobe found him guilty of the charge, and banished him from the planet forever."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the years that followed, Hallux dealt with a disruption of the Tynzo market causded by Thelan's undercutting. Eventually, Althea died. The day after the princess' burial, Jun Sato, now a Commander in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, was brought before Hallux, accompanied by fellow Rebel Sabine Wren. The Lord of Isobe then learned from the Rebel commander that Thelan had been behind the smuggling ring all along, undercutting him for all those years. Hallux ordered his guards to take the prince away, and gave Sato one hour to pay his respects at Althea's grave."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hallux was a broad-shouldered, peach-skinned Sephi with green eyes.
