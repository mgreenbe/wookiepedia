Commander Lindon Javes feared of an Imperial invasion, and sent Vanguard Squadron to investigate these blackouts and re-establish communications. After finding the wreckage of a New Republic scout ship, Vanguard Squadron soon encountered the Imperial jamming ships, which were escorted by TIE/ln space superiority starfighters and a Arquitens-class command cruiser. Vanguard destroyed the jamming ships, re-establishing communications, and called for reinforcements. Two New Republic CR90 corvettes arrived and the remaining Imperial ships were finally destroyed. The Imperial incursion was therefore pushed back and communications across the Bormea Sector restored."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cavas first appeared in Star Wars canon in the 2020 video game Star Wars: Squadrons, where it was the location for one of the single-player campaign missions.
