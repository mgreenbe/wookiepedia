They were on Taanab when they were ambushed by an Imperial Security Bureau force led by Alecia Beck. He managed to escape the ambush and sent a burst transmission to the Alliance High Command informing them of his plan to hide in the city of Motok on Cyrkon. He stowed away on a Kuat Yards hauler in a freight container. Once on Motok, he visited a cantina but left without talking to anyone. Ematt hid out in a hotel on the outskirts of Motok, but let Delia Leighton know he was looking for a way off-planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han Solo and his co-pilot Chewbacca were tasked by Leia Organa to meet Ematt and get him to safety before he could be captured and interrogated. She knew that Ematt held vast amounts of data on the Rebellion's plans, future bases, and supply caches and if the Empire could extract that from the soldier, it could mean the end of the war. The smugglers flew to Cyrkon and located Ematt. After receiving the pass-phrase, he let them into his room and prepared to depart. Before they could leave, the environmental alarms in the building went off, which was a signal that Solo had arranged with a local bum in case of trouble. Ematt suggested that they escape down the stairs, but they were locked due to the alarms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Chewbacca tried to hotwire the door, a group of bounty hunters exited the elevators and opened fire on Ematt and the smugglers.

The two ships then fled the planet but were intercepted by the Vehement who sent TIE fighters to attack the two ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ematt took control of the Falcon's quad laser cannons and proceeded to shoot down several fighters. He entered the coordinates for the rendezvous with the Rebel fleet into the Falcon's navicomputer but Solo refused to leave the damaged Miss Fortune alone against the Imperials. When the freighter was captured by a tractor beam from the Vehement, Ematt vowed that he would not be taken alive.

The ship had been loaded with treasures by the famed pirate queen Maz Kanata and had since then been locked into close orbit around a dark star. Accompanied by several Alliance Pathfinders, Ematt worked in concert with Solo and Chewbacca which resulted in a successful mission. Among one of the many useful finds was a significant batch of Kiirium.
