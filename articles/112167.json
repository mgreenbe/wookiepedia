Concerned about Bail's safety, Antilles abruptly entered Bail's quarters with a security team whilst he was talking to Tano, but Bail assured him that she was a friend. Shortly after, Antilles was having a conversation with Bail in the Tantive IV's mess hall, when Tano approached the pair to devise a plan to help her remaining friends on the moon Raada. Once signaled by Tano, Antilles and the Tantive IV, along with several other transports and A-wings, traveled to Raada to help evacuate the farmers on the moon from Imperial occupation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the following years, Antilles carefully steered the Tantive IV through countless Imperial blockades and checkpoints, always able to avoid suspicion and detection.

Unfortunately for the the Rebels,  Vader's flagship, the Devastator,  had already followed them. Still worried about the Princess' security, Antilles asked Leia to use one of the escape pods, but Chief Petty Officer Corla Metonae as the Tantive IV was still flying under a diplomatic flag, the Empire would not dare to board them, but Antilles really doubted that could happen given the importance of what Rogue One had stolen from Scarif and that Darth Vader had been dispatched to retrieve the plans. One of the bosuns also intercepted an Imperial transmission, priority red. This directive allowed any CR90 corvettes to be searched and held, confirming Antilles' fears. The most dire news of all, however, was the report from Second Officer Toshma Jefkin of Darth Vader in the hall of the Profundity. With little time left, Antilles returned to his quarters and attempted to write three letters, one for his wife, and two for his daughters, but he was never able to find the words.

A loyal guard to the princess, the captain protected Leia's identity, assuring the Sith Lord that they had received no transmissions because the Tantive IV was a consular ship on a diplomatic mission, leading Vader to ask Antilles where the ambassador was in that case as Antilles desperately fought for air. As he began to lose consciousness, Raymus Antilles found himself strangely hopeful. Acknowledging that his life had come to an end, Antilles hoped before expiring that Leia would find a way to escape and deliver the plans to the rebellion so they could destroy the Death Star.
