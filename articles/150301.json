Like the later Octuptarra combat tri-droid, the turret droid was arranged as a weapon pod atop three stilt legs.

This version spun around on a stationary four-legged pod with a single \"eye\" from which it fired plasma waves. The droid also possessed a cannon on either side of its head that could launch thermal detonators, and a personal energy shield, similar to that employed by the Trade Federation's Droidekas. If the cannons on either side of its head were damaged, the turret droid could fire a sustained laser beam from its \"eye\". This model was destroyed at the end of the Fall of Theed by the Jedi who had arrived to rescue Naboo's Queen Amidala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Sia-Lan Wezz, Rorworr, and Vor'en Kurn fought a mixed group of turret droids and B1-Series battle droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
