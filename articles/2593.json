The GTU AV-1 was made for private security forces and Paramilitary groups. It was made of interlocking plates that completely cover the wearer's body. The armor was vacuum sealed and included a built in helmet package. It also included an advanced jet pack system that produced no sound, heat, or flames. Three different variants were produced; AV-1A Assault Armor, AV-1C Combat Armor, and AV-1S Scout Armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Arms & Equipment Guide and Scum and Villainy have the manufacturer as GTU, The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia has the manufacturer as Wrokix Works.
