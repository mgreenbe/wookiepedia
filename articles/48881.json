On Zoh, Fixer and other droids were led by Jek-14. Shorty after the Freemakers visited Zoh seeking Jek-14's help, a ungrateful droid named N-3RO led a droid uprising against Jek-14 and the Freemakers.

They failed and N-3RO was still on Zoh and had been fitted for a restraining bolt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fixer first appeared in LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures but was later canonized by Star Wars: Droidography."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
