Six months after the Battle of Yavin, they contacted the Alliance to Restore the Republic to gain the support of the Alliance. Princess Leia Organa was sent to negotiate with them on Shelkonwa, the capital planet of Shelsha sector. However, Leia was betrayed by Disra who denounced her presence to Darth Vader. The Executor soon arrived in the system and the 501st Legion was deployed in Makrin City, the capital city of Shelkonwa, to find Leia Organa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other ships followed the Executor to Shelkonwa: the Happer's Way, a freighter stolen by BloodScar leader Caaldra, pursued by Emperor's Hand Mara Jade's Z-10 Seeker.

She was shot down and crash landed near the Hand of Judgment and Rebels. The troopers sent Luke and Han after their friend-in-need, while they raced to help save the pilot of the downed craft. When they arrived at the craft, Mara took command of them, using them as her own personal stormtrooper squad, which they must agree with or blow their cover. As Luke and Han found Leia and started heading for safety, Chewbacca, in the Melnor Spear, helped Mara and the troopers take out the AT-ST, only to find that Caaldra was not inside. It was under its own autopilot control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor's Hand realized that Caaldra had already reached Choard's Palace. She ordered the Hand of Judgment to follow her to the palace to take the pirate and the governor out of play. They managed to infiltrate the palace and eliminated all guards they met. Mara sent the troopers to execute Choard, while she went after Caaldra, who revealed before she killed him that it was Disra, not Choard, who was behind the plot to break away from the Empire. Mara was led to believe that Choard might actually be innocent and raced to stop the troopers from killing him. The troopers had already got him, though, but instead of taking him down, they were stopped by one of their own, as Marcross revealed himself to be Choard's nephew. Marcross hoped they were wrong about his uncle but Choard revealed his true colors when he mentioned information that only the conspirators could have. As Choard tried to make his escape, Mara, who has just arrived, took him into custody and eventually delivered him to Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels were able to get back to the Alliance without incident.
