Before the Battle of Scarif, Ramda sent Berretic a request listing loaned equipment and troops that he wanted back. In the request, Ramda informed Berretic to rewrite the request using official formatting and to send it up through the oversector chain of command until an official acknowledged the request. Ramda made it clear, however, not to send the request to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, as Tarkin was very close to Emperor Palpatine and that they always needed to demonstrate their best towards Palpatine, and so ordered Berretic to instead send the request to one of the sector admirals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the request, Ramda detailed that he wanted two squadrons of TIE/sk x1 experimental air superiority fighters loaned to the Unassailable, in order to have adequate patrols and allow for proper training of TIE fighter pilots. Ramda also requested that twelve AT-ACTs be returned in order to transport valuable ore from mines and refineries, as well two companies of Shoretroopers. Ramda saw no issue in having the Shoretroopers returned as he believed that Scarif was one of the few planets to be suitable for them, and did not imagine that they could serve much aboard Star Destroyers. Lastly, Ramda requested to be returned two platoons of Death troopers, as the training camp on Scarif needed more instructors. Ramda preferred veteran Death troopers with body augmentations at v1.01 or earlier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
