That year, the Galactic Empire occupied the planet Bespin. During the occupation, the YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon managed to escape the planet, and OS-72-8 was among the TIE pilots who subsequently pursued the freighter. However, the TIE fighters were unable to capture the Millennium Falcon, with the freighter managing to evade Imperial capture in space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OS-72-8 was created for 2003's The Empire Strikes Back expansion set of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Trading Card Game.
