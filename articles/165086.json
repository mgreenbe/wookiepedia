Wurtz's three Venator-class Star Destroyers arrived to Christophsis alongside four Acclamator-class assault ships to reinforced Republic forces on the ground. Jedi Master Yoda joined Admiral Wullf Yularen, who had linked up with the fleet, on the bridge of one of the Venator-class Star Destroyers and began engaging the Confederacy of Independent Systems Navy. When the blockade was in retreat, the Acclamator-class assault ships landed and deployed their forces on the planet. The flagship of Wurtz's fleet along with the four Acclamators belonged to the Open Circle's Fifth Fleet of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wurtz's fleet first appeared in the theatrical 2008 film, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, albeit unidentified."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
