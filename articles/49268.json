Although combat with flickerphase blades could be more difficult than an ordinary lightsaber, it was challenging for an opponent to effectively block the weapon, a fact which caused the Jedi Order to generally view them as dishonorable and unsporting. Flickerphase blades cost 5,000 credits per unit and never saw widespread use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flickerphase blades were mentioned in Knights of Fate, a 2018 sourcebook published by Fantasy Flight Games for use with its Star Wars: Force and Destiny roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
