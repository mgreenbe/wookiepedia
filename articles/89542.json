Its mission was to evacuate a TIE Defender research and development station, since the station's defenses were crippled. Tan Maarek Stele in a TIE Defender managed to protect the bulk freighter from attack by Zaarin's forces, who were attempting to destroy the facility, and the TIE Defender prototypes, which were loaded into the freighter by technicians from the shuttle G'nabgib. The freighter then made it into hyperspace. Both the freighter and the shuttle, despite an attempt to be captured by Rebels led by the frigate Hunu, then delivered the prototypes to the Assassin-class corvette Hashim group."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
