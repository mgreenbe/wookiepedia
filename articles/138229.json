However, because it was armed with only a single mounted repeating blaster, it was often overlooked by the military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even so, these airspeeders were often used as training vehicles by the Rebel Alliance, due to the fact that their flight controls were similar to those of X-wings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The skyhopper was a common sight across the galaxy, with versions of the craft found on nearly every settled world. The T-16 was identified by its tri-wing design and triangular cabin. The three wings, which were reproduced in countless Imperial transports, provided excellent stability. The central airfoil segmented the canopy and blocked much of the pilot's view, but computer displays and a holographic mapping system compensated for this decreased field of view."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The speeder had a top speed of approximately 1,200 kilometers per hour, and the two repulsor generators provided lift up to 300 meters. Many young pilots preferred skyhoppers over landspeeders because of the increased maneuverability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kodo Arr, the self-proclaimed \"galaxy's best smuggler\", owned a T-16.

He once smuggled a box larger than the speeder on Nar Shaddaa, which almost broke the craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker owned a T-16 on his home planet of Tatooine, where he would use womp rats as target practice and race through Beggar's Canyon with his friend, Biggs Darklighter.

The actual prop could not be completed, and an incomplete hull can be seen as a matte painting in the background. Supplemental material explained that Luke's T-16 had been damaged, so he used his landspeeder to search for R2-D2."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A flying T-16 can be seen above Mos Eisley during the Return of the Jedi Special Edition's celebration ending sequence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Attack of the Clones, a T-16 can be seen in the background of the homestead garage scene."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the 1998 video game Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, the first bonus mission is a T-16 skyhopper race between the player (Luke Skywalker), Wedge Antilles, Zev Senesca, and Dak Ralter.
