Han tells Rey to keep her head down at Maz Kanata's castle and to \"leave it to him.\" Suddenly, the Millennium Falcon experiences a sudden jolt that causes it to exit hyperspace. When Rey asks Han if he did a full sweep for tracking devices, Han asks Chewbacca if he did a scan of the ship. While Chewbacca growls back, Rey warns Han that Unkar Plutt has installed a new kind of tracking device and that they need to do a visual check."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han says that he'll get the hyperdrive online and tells Rey and Chewbacca to do a visual check of the ship. In the Millennium Falcon's corridor, Finn asks Rey what is going on. Rey tells him that Unkar Plutt hired her to fix starships. While she did not install a tracking device on the Millennium Falcon, she thinks that he may have done it. Chewbacca growls they should look near the aft sensor pulse generator. Rey translates this and adds that Unkar Plutt may have hidden it there to avoid detection since the augment would boost the modulation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under his breath, Finn mutters \"sorry that I asked.\" The three find the tracker on the sensor pulse generator. Despite Rey's warnings, Finn picks up the tracking device and accidentally sets off the self-destruct mechanism. Rey tells Chewbacca to get the tracking device to the airlock. Rey and Finn are alarmed that they only have twenty seconds to dispose of the bomb. Finn goes to warn Han. At Rey and Han's signal, Chewie hurls the tracking device out of the airlock. The tracker explodes and the traveling companions are able to continue their journey to Takodana. Han praises Rey for her good catch, but Rey responds that she and Chewbacca were a good team. Chewie roars back in appreciation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
