By the time of the Cold War, which was fought between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, he had a wife and children, and owned an astromech droid. Around the year 3643 BBY, Dorotsech was taken captive by a rogue Sith named Lord Grathan and held in his estate. There, Dorotsech was commissioned by Lord Zash to develop a weapon called the cyber neutralizer that could kill or weaken beings whose bodies were composed of at least fifty percent cybernetics, though Dorotsech preferred to remain ignorant of the reasons behind the creation of such a weapon. Zash intended to use the weapon to help defeat her rival, Darth Skotia, so she sent her apprentice to retrieve it and erase any traces that connected the theft of the weapon to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dorotsech was eventually found by Zash's apprentice during the latter's infiltration of Grathan's estate, searching for Dorotsech's creation.
