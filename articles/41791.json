Dustdivers would come to the surface of the comet in spacesuits and then mine valuable minerals such as Thorilide directly. Minimal gravity, deadly crevices and the danger of the comet vaporizing under the rays from the nearby star made this job most hazardous. In the Core Worlds it was one of the highest-paid jobs, though some organizations, like the Sungrazer cooperative, preferred to use slaves instead of paying for it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
