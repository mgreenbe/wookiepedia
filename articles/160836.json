They had long noses, which twitched. Hran Beling was a male Vicon who was training at the Coruscant Jedi Temple as a youngling in 89 BBY. That year, the Dark Holocron was stolen from the Temple, and Beling conveyed this news to one of his contemporaries at the Temple, Dooku, speculating that there could have been an intruder in the building. Beling later competed with Dooku in a challenge against another team of Jedi trainees to secure a piece of muja fruit from a market, although the Vicon was stunned unconscious by the other team."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vicon were created by Jude Watson for her novel Legacy of the Jedi, published by Del Rey in 2003.
