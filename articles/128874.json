The team was known for trying to befuddle its opponents with trick plays. Approximately six years before the Battle of Yavin, this team played the AppSci SaberCats in a heated match in drizzling rain in the second half of the grav-ball season. This first game of the second match was presented to stands full of fans despite the weather, as the strong performance of the SaberCats in the first-half meant that everyone was following the team's prospects. The Volunteers won the chance cube toss that began the game and put in a fairly strong showing, but the SaberCats ultimately won the match by twelve points."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
