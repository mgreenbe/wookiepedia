Noting that the droid looks a little down, Orka pours the rest of his blurrgfire into G-LN's bowl. As Aunt Z comes up to talk to Flix and Orka, G-LN downs the alcohol and gets somewhat hyper. Unnoticed by his masters or the bartender, G-LN goes running through the tavern, attacking and earning the ire of two service droids, including Glitch, as well as Klatooinian Bolza Grool. As Aunt Z, Orka and Flix discuss the fact that most people in the galaxy don't notice things going on around them, Grool and the two droids gang up on and knock out G-LN. When Orka and Flix decide to look around for their droid, they see him falling onto the floor, with his assailants gone, and decide the blurrgfire didn't agree with him. Orka calls for a refill."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
