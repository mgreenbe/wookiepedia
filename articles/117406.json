While his deeds were lost to history, a stone statue was erected in his memory in the keep of a citadel on the planet Rhen Var. The statue and the citadel itself survived until the start of the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. A battle between the two sides during the Battle of Rhen Var left the citadel in ruins, but a plaque identifying the statue as depicting Mysliwiec was still legible above the statue. Inside the citadel was also a tomb, possibly belonging to this ancient Jedi. Mysliwiec's name appeared on a building several kilometers to the east in an old, frozen harbor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
