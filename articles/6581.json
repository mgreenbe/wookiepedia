Black-and-white sketches include sketch studies of Anakin's fellow Jedi, scenes from his training (such as lightsaber stances), and far-off planets visited while on missions with Obi-Wan Kenobi, and many drawings of Padm\u00e9 Amidala. This Jedi's journal looks and feels as though it came right out of the Jedi Temple Archives. Blank spaces on every page allow fans room to use this book as their personal journal and sketchbook as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
