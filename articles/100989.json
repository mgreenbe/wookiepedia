When the Outer Rim was threatened by the Emergences, pieces of debris from the destroyed freighter Legacy Run which were randomly emerging from hyperspace, an extensive blockade on travel throughout the region was ordered by Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh to prevent further catastrophe, with the exception of limited shipments of necessary goods. The space station was being used to coordinate a massive aid shipment to beleaguered star systems when one of the first twenty-one Emergences caused its destruction, as one of two known Emergences in the vicinity of Dantooine. The facility's destruction was noted in a daily report issued by the Office of the Chancellor which was read by Jedi Padawan Burryaga Agaburry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
