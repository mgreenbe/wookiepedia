The peaceful world boasted color architecture with a mix of modern and classical designs. During the Galactic Civil War, two Imperial Inquisitors, the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother, captured a Force-sensitive Ithorian named Pypey from the Ithorian settlement known as Hammertown. The infant was rescued by Ezra Bridger and other members of the rebel crew of the starship Ghost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Takobo first appeared in \"The Future of the Force,\" an episode of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels. StarWars.com hinted that the planet was named Takobo because the dining option available on the day of the episode's writing conference was a taco bar. Most of the Takobo sets were based on unused ones of the moon Pantora during Star Wars: The Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The domes and steeples seen on many of the buildings in Takobo City resemble that of real-life traditional Eastern Orthodox architecture found in Russia and some of its neighboring countries; likewise, the pattern seen several times on Takobo and used by some of its inhabitants (such as the one that Alora is swaddled in) bears a strong resemblance to the folkloristic designs often found on embroidery and regional costumes in Poland and Belarus. These facts, combined with the tower block laden landscape of Hammertown akin to the cities of Ukraine and other Eastern European countries, suggest that the planet of Takobo was heavily inspired by aesthetics of the Slavonic nations. Its climate also seems to resemble the Siberian tundra.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
