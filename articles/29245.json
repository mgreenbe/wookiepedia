Grand Master Yoda was also present with him on Kashyyyk to handle the politicians. The Jedi were aware that some Wookiees were becoming unhappy to be allied with the Galactic Republic, but the conference was considered too important to be delayed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All attendees of the conference, including the Wookiee Chewbacca, had to pass through a holoscanner, which was monitored by a Wookiee sergeant, to check for weapons. A ray shield also protected the speakers against blaster fire from the audience."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the security measures, one Wookiee, the decorated war hero General Attimun, managed to sneak a dismantled explosive charge launcher through the scanner. When the conference started, he used the weapon to attack the speakers from the trees above the conference room. Kenobi successfully attacked and subdued the Wookiee before he could deal too much damage. Attimun was immediately arrested and later revealed to have become enraged with the Republic after the death of his wife and two children during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
