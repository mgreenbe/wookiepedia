Space barges were short range vessels, usually not equipped with a hyperdrive but fitted with powerful sublight drives and large cargo storage areas. Crews of space barges generally numbered three; a pilot, co-pilot, and fifth-degree labor droid. Barges were generally unarmed as they operated in urbanized systems with adequate defenses, and possessed limited deflector shields."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Incom Corporation X-23 StarWorker was an intra-system space barge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
