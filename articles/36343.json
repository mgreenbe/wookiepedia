He was one of the winners of the Great Hunt, along with Bloodworthy, Jewl'a Nightbringer, and Mandalore's Chosen. The Defenstrator, along with Nightbringer and Bloodworthy, was killed by a squad of Republic SIS agents and Jedi after they refused to disclose the whereabouts of their latest Champion, the bounty hunter whom Jun Seros was determined to bring in. The Defenestrator's body soon activated a self-destruct sequence, causing a brief enough distraction that scattered the strike team before they could engage the Champion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
