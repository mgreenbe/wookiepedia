Female early death dogs typically hid their offspring from the males to avoid cannibalism during the first years of life.

The urcaninus had strong shoulders and arms, a lumbarless spine\u2014which at one point was in the process of de-evolving\u2014four limbs: two clawed and two pawed and an overdeveloped torso with an ancillary pelvic structure.

Its nighttime predisposition made the creature particularly irritable during daylight hours, even though it was naturally seen as aimless, erratic and frustrated for most of the time, often suffering from a psychological condition known as melancholia agressiva. Its main habitats were swamps and veldts, ranging from the Middle Plains to 30,000 leagues the south of Troon, depending on the season.
