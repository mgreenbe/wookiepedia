Operated by a crew of five, the UniScan could focus on and return detailed information on any target within an area of one hundred meters wide by one hundred meters long, by twenty meters high. The narrow focus of the UniScan however made it impractical as a means of early warning detection and its scans could be blocked by obstructions such as mountainous terrain. For this reason, the UniScan was often used in conjunction with other sensor systems, such as the Tana Ire GroundSweeper-3 and Siep-Irol GlobeScan, especially in defense of Alliance to Restore the Republic bases."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
