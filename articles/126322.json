After the Treaty of Coruscant was signed, Sivill was given secret orders from Sith Lord Darth Baras to attack the Envoy, which was carrying Jedi Satele Shan and Dar'Nala in the Kuat sector of the Core Worlds, and frame it as a Republic first strike.

Meanwhile Sivill and the other commandos faced off against Dar'Nala and mockingly told her that she would not go down in a \"blaze of glory\" as they had too much to discuss, before trapping her in a net. Dar'Nala called to Shan to run and inform the council of the attack.
