The GAG was founded by Chief of State Cal Omas and placed under the command of Colonel Jacen Solo, a Knight of the New Jedi Order, as a result of the Corellian terrorist attacks and riots on the galactic capital world of Coruscant in 40 ABY. As the war against the Confederation progressed, the GAG undertook offworld missions across the galaxy and became essential in Colonel Solo's rise to power as the Sith Lord Darth Caedus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Specializing in intelligence gathering, special operations and counter-terrorism, members of the GAG were recruited from the Coruscant Security Force, the Galactic Alliance Intelligence Service, and the Galactic Alliance Defense Force. The GAG possessed a myriad of assets to suppress acts of sedition and treason on Coruscant, such as the use of droid brains to monitor the HoloNet and the deployment of combat drones against insurgents. The organization included a wing of elite black-armored soldiers, known as GAG troopers, for combat operations. One its sub-units, the 967 Commando, served under the direct command of Colonel Solo and his informal Jedi apprentice, Lieutenant Ben Skywalker, during the GAG's early raids against the Corellian sectors in Galactic City. The GAG later acquired its own warship, the Anakin Solo\u2014a modified Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, it would serve as the GAG's mobile headquarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the time of their inception, the GAG was a source of controversy within the Galactic Alliance as well as the Jedi High Council. It was disapproved of by members of Grand Master Luke Skywalker's family for its similarities to the Galactic Empire. The GAG became increasingly loyal to its commanding officer, Colonel Solo, who used the Guard and its resources to further his agenda. As a result, Five World Prime Minister Dur Gejjen was assassinated by GAG operatives on Vulpter, while GAG troopers arrested Cal Omas in a coup that put Solo and Admiral Cha Niathal in power as co-rulers of the Alliance. But as Jacen Solo embraced the dark side of the Force, renouncing the Jedi path to become the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Caedus, the GAG's list of enemies grew to include Fondorians, Mandalorians, the Hapes Consortium, and even the Jedi Order. In 41 ABY, Caedus was killed in the Battle of Uroro Station, causing his New Order to collapse as the Jedi Coalition achieved the decisive victory in the conflict. Natasi Daala assumed leadership of the Alliance as its new Chief of State, resulting in the disbandment of the GAG and the formation of the Galactic Alliance Security (GAS)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization and role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Alliance Guard was created for the purposes of domestic security, counter-terrorism and law enforcement on Coruscant. Created by Chief of State Cal Omas as a secret police force of anti-terrorist commandos, the Guard operated independently of both CSF and the GA Defense Force. Nevertheless, its members were recruited from both organizations, as well as the GA Intelligence Service and its predecessor, NR Intelligence Service. A special operations branch was also incorporated into GAG's structure, and thus was comprised of elite soldiers who served with the GA Special Forces. Under the leadership of Darth Caedus, the Sith persona of the fallen Jedi Knight Jacen Solo, the Galactic Alliance Guard became a symbol of the state's counter-terrorism policy. Black became the standard color by which almost everything GAG-related was identified by, especially the soldiers who were dressed in black plastoid armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Guard's primary mission profile was simple and straightforward: arrest and detain anyone who was either confirmed or suspected traitors to the Galactic Alliance. Millions of beings\u2014ranging from citizens guilty of seditious chatter to Corellian terrorists and Confederate insurgents\u2014were found guilty of treason, and therefore transferred by GAG to concentration camps. Droid technology was extensively utilized in the Guard's surveillance network, which was spread throughout civilian and even government systems. In addition to the specially-trained GAG troopers, which included spies, assassins and special ops commandos, an array of droid brains and combat drones were utilized by the Guard, both to monitor subversive HoloNet sources and suppress armed insurrectionists. The Guard's special operations units, such as 967 Commando, were deployed to various locations throughout the galactic capital and generally wherever anti-Alliance activities took place. As such, GAG troopers were equipped with a combination of riot and combat weaponry, mainly for either non-lethal or lethal purposes, depending on the nature of the mission. They were also equipped with sensor devices called Noses, which would be attached to the back of a gauntlet, and would blink red and orange when detecting something. Their strategy was rapid entry; dropships entered a target zone and off-loaded soldiers with orders to subdue insurgents and apprehend any survivors. The same tactic was used consistently with little alteration, regardless if their targets were enemy combatants, unarmed protesters, neutral civilians, or hostage takers and their prisoners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Galactic Alliance Guard was issued with state-of-the-art technology, its own technological superiority could be exploited and transformed into a fatal weakness by ion weaponry and signal jammers. Such inherent weaknesses in GAG's system was inherited from the Galactic Alliance's intelligence, military and police organizations, all of which had spent more than thirty years fighting primitive warlords and aliens, none of whom posed a major threat to the Alliance's primacy. As a consequence of lacking a true rival, the Alliance grew complacent and overconfident in its technology, and was thus unprepared to counter the Confederation's anti-sensor weapons and sabotage tactics. Such flaws were passed on to the Guard, which only perpetuated the same mistakes that jeopardized Alliance security in the first place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially based in the Galactic Justice Center, one of the many districts on Coruscant, the Guard was given a mobile base of operations after Colonel Jacen Solo commissioned the Anakin Solo\u2014a modified Imperial II-class Star Destroyer named in honor of his deceased brother\u2014as his own flagship. One of the nine Galactic Alliance fleets, the Ninth Fleet was later placed under Galactic Alliance Guard command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Darth Caedus, he seized control of the government with the support of GAG, albeit within the range of constitutional legality via numerous amendments and legal loopholes in the system. With Caedus's elevation to Chief of State and his accumulation of dictatorial powers, the Guard effectively replaced the state, but also proved to be a detriment to effective government due to the fact that its upper command structure was designed for overseeing infantry battle groups rather than running the daily affairs of a galactic power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Formation of the Guard"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of a series of terrorist attacks on Coruscant in 40 ABY, Chief of State Cal Omas and Senator G'vli G'Sil spearheaded the creation of the secret police force known as the Galactic Alliance Guard. Leadership of the Guard was initially offered to the Jedi Mara Jade Skywalker, a former Emperor's Hand and the wife of Grand Master Luke Skywalker. When she declined the offer due to the Jedi Order's opposition to the government's sanctioning of secret police tactics, Jacen Solo accepted leadership of GAG, along with the military rank of colonel. However, Omas had also unwittingly placed the secret police under the command of an aspiring Sith Lord, as Solo had secretly disavowed his allegiance to the Jedi by becoming the Sith apprentice of the Dark Lady Lumiya. Disgusted by the prospect of yet another galactic civil war, Solo had become disillusioned with the Jedi Order, of which he perceived as ineffective in its efforts to maintain the stability of the Galactic Alliance. Ultimately, he was convinced that the only way to achieve a lasting era of order and peace was by embracing the dark side of the Force, like his grandfather before him, but for more selfless reasons. With Lumiya's guidance and the backing of GAG, Solo committed himself to the cause of building a new order at any cost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Colonel Solo was not the only Jedi who joined the Galactic Alliance Guard despite the Order's refusal to be associated with the secret police. Much to the chagrin of the Jedi High Council, Solo's thirteen year-old cousin Ben Skywalker, son of Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker, became a junior lieutenant in the Guard. In addition to its two Jedi officers, GAG personnel was highly diverse; numerous members were handpicked by Solo from various branches of intelligence and military organizations. Captain Lon Shevu was a CSF police officer before joining the Guard; he disapproved of the Colonel's hardline methods, but nevertheless remained loyal to the chain of command. Heol Girdun, another GAG officer, previously served as an intelligence operative under the New Republic. He specialized in advanced interrogation techniques and surveillance. Corporal Jori Lekauf was the grandson of Erv Lekauf, an Imperial officer who faithfully served under Darth Vader's command. Inspired by his grandfather, the younger Lekauf joined the Guard and became one of Jacen Solo's most loyal soldiers. Their different past affiliations aside, all members of the Guard were Coruscant-born Humans\u2014patriotic citizens of the Alliance with no association with Corellia and its fellow subversive worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after their formation, various GAG special forces units were deployed throughout the many districts of Coruscant, particularly the areas with a heavy concentration of Corellian inhabitants. Colonel Solo and Lieutenant Skywalker participated in several raids alongside the GAG troopers of 967 Commando. Despite the continued opposition of the Jedi Order and civilian protesters, the Guard's preemptive methods were largely successful at deterring further terrorist attacks against Coruscant. Some of GAG's missions were recorded and displayed on HoloNet News; their enforcement of the government's counter-terrorism policy was supported by many Coruscanti citizens who hailed Jacen Solo as a hero of the Alliance. Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, however, shared the Jedi Council's distrust of the Guard. He thus resigned his commission as Supreme Commander of the Galactic Alliance Defense Force. Secret police was one aspect of the Old Empire that disgusted Pellaeon, and was hence abolished as part of the reforms he introduced into the Imperial Remnant. Though Solo remained popular with much of the Alliance citizenry, his detractors began drawing comparisons between GAG troopers and stormtroopers. For some, the Guard was an omen that the Galactic Alliance was evolving into a new Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within the Guard itself, Solo was immensely popular with the rank-and-file troops, many of whom became personally loyal to the Colonel. Like Vader, Solo never issued orders that he wasn't willing to carry out himself. He preferred to lead by example, often serving alongside the GAG troopers in hazardous situations. His willingness to endure the same hardships in a constant struggle against terrorism endeared him to the Guard. In further recognition of his association with the Guard, and by extension his gradual disassociation with the Jedi Order, Solo discarded his Jedi apparel in favor of a GAG uniform, complemented with black robes and a cloak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to counter the increasing threats of Corellia's secessionist movement, GAG was authorized to intern, deport and interrogate its suspects; a duty that they executed with brutal efficiency. Furthermore, they were given the authority to monitor civilian activities for terrorists, insurgents and generally anyone who could be construed as a traitor to the Galactic Alliance. The extent of their surveillance network extended to certain branches within the government itself, particularly the elected dignitaries of the Galactic Alliance Senate. Colonel Solo occasionally oversaw interrogation sessions where he utilized his Force abilities to coerce detainees into compliance. During one incident, Solo inadvertently killed a prisoner, a bounty hunter named Ailyn Vel, who had been hired to assassinate Solo and his parents, Han and Leia Solo."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Expansion and coup d'\u00e9tat"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, reconciliation efforts between the Galactic Alliance and the Corellian-led separatists proved unsuccessful, culminating in the failed blockade of Corellia and the ensuing Second Galactic Civil War. Colonel Jacen Solo took an active role in the Alliance's war strategy, and utilized the Guard's resources to undermine the Confederation's efforts to secede from the Alliance by military force. Due to the expansion of the Guard's role, which was previously limited to enforcing domestic security on Coruscant, a modified Imperial II-class Star Destroyer was commissioned as a GAG mobile base of operations. The starship was subsequently named the Anakin Solo in honor of the Colonel's late brother, much to the vexation of the members of his family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Anakin Solo was first deployed into combat at the Battle of Hapes where Colonel Solo coordinated Alliance forces alongside the Hapan Military. At the same time, Han and Leia Solo were falsely implicated in a failed assassination attempt on Queen Mother Tenel Ka Djo, the leader of the Hapes Consortium and mother of his secret child, Allana. Convinced that both were guilty, and possibly meant to be sacrificed in his ascendency as a Sith Lord, Solo declared them traitors to the Alliance. During the battle, he ordered one of the Anakin Solo's long-range turbolasers to open fire on the Millennium Falcon. His mother's Noghri bodyguards were killed by the attack, and the Falcon sustained heavy damage before escaping their son's Star Destroyer through hyperspace. Solo later discovered that Dur Gejjen, the Corellian Prime Minister of the Five Worlds, was the true culprit behind the attempt on Djo's life. Nevertheless, the Colonel refused to rescind the arrest warrants, choosing to maintain his parents on the Guard's most wanted list on the grounds that they were still guilty of initially aiding the Confederation against the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Lumiya continued to guide Jacen Solo through his development as a Sith Lord, the master and her apprentice both considered Lieutenant Ben Skywalker as a possible future apprentice for Solo. Before a final decision could be made, however, they decided that Skywalker's susceptibility to the dark side of the Force had to be tested. He was dispatched on a covert GAG mission that eventually led him to Ziost where Skywalker discovered a Sith Meditation Sphere known as the Ship. Upon returning to the Anakin Solo, he presented the vessel to Colonel Solo, who then gave it to Lumiya."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Civil War escalated into a stalemate between the Galactic Alliance and the Confederation, Chief of State Omas and Colonel Solo became antagonized by one another in regard to the Alliance's overall strategy. However, the crisis of rebellion worked in Solo's favor, in that it motivated the Senate to legislate emergency-level amendments to the Constitution, thereby permitting the Guard's surveillance network to expand into government systems. GAG spies closely monitored high-ranking officials, including the Chief of State, and were on the lookout for any signs of treachery. The new security protocol enabled Solo to discover a secret meeting between Omas and Gejjen on Vulpter, in which parties considered the possibility of a cease fire under certain concessions which included the removal of Jacen Solo from power. Lieutenant Skywalker monitored and recorded the conversation, shortly before killing Gejjen with a sniper rifle. Before Skywalker, Shevu, and Lekauf could return to Coruscant, the GAG trio was discovered and forced to defend themselves against the Vulpter spaceport security forces. Lekauf, who had only recently been promoted to the rank of lieutenant, sacrificed his life so that his comrades could escape to safety.

Through the constitutional amendments, the Galactic Alliance Guard had the authority to overthrow the Chief of State if he had proven to be a security risk to the Galactic Alliance. Colonel Solo, accompanied by two GAG troopers, Sergeant Wirut and Trooper Limm, marched into Omas's office at the Executive Building on Coruscant and promptly arrested him on the grounds of high treason for conspiring with the enemies of the Galactic Alliance, namely the Confederate rebellion and their terrorist supporters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With former Chief of State Cal Omas under house arrest, Solo and Niathal quickly seized control of the government. After allaying the fears of the senators, many of whom initially interpreted the act as a military takeover, the Senate agreed to the temporary installment of a duumvirate, in which the Office of the Chief of State was shared by Niathal and Solo, both of whom had been appointed as Joint Chief of State Number One and Joint Chief of State Number Two respectively. By and large, the government and the citizenry accepted the rule of the Solo-Niathal regime, which was also supported by GAG and the Defense Force, and thus ensured that the coup d'\u00e9tat was a smooth and bloodless transition of power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after Omas's fall from power, Mara Jade Skywalker confronted Jacen Solo after she learned of his secret ties to Lumiya's Sith Order. Ben Skywalker overheard a conversation between his cousin and the Dark Lady of the Sith, neither of whom detected the young Jedi's presence due to his use of Force stealth, an ability to conceal one's own presence in the Force. The distraught Skywalker revealed his discovery to his mother, who unilaterally decided to confront her nephew with an ultimatum: abandon the dark side and return to the Jedi Order for rehabilitation, or die as a Sith. Solo declined her offer without acknowledging her accusations, and Jade Skywalker ultimately decided to murder him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She ambushed her nephew on Kavan, convinced that the former Jedi was beyond any hope for redemption.

In the end, Mara Jade Skywalker was fatally wounded by one of Solo's poison darts, and thus died as her body succumbed to the weapon's toxin. Solo's destiny as the new Dark Lord of the Sith was realized, and Lumiya chose to make her own sacrifice.

Jaina Solo, Caedus's twin sister, realized that the Guard's presence was not to provide security for the Praxeum, but rather to exterminate the students if the Order became disloyal.

With victory far from certain, Caedus ordered his fleet to inflict as much casualties as possible on the enemy, thereby disabling their ability to aid other Confederate forces at Kuat.

On Ossus, Major Serpa was ordered by Caedus to neutralize the Jedi Praxeum's inhabitants with lethal force if necessary. The Guard deployed coma gas into the dormitory rooms of the adult Jedi, but Jaina Solo managed to escape from the effects of the gas. The rest of the Jedi were herded into the Praxeum's central exercise pavilion by GAG troopers. Jedi Master Tionne Solusar threatened Serpa to stand down, but only succeeded at providing the Major with an excuse to shoot her in the leg. Master Kam Solusar tried to rescue his wife, but was shot three times by GAG snipers.

Although the Sith Lord and Lady sustained injuries during the rescue attempt, Caedus ultimately succeeded in bringing Veila back to the safety of the Anakin where he realized that they were destined to rule together as master and apprentice. Afterward, the Alliance and Remnant forces withdrew from Fondor. Although the battle was considered a defeat, the loss of Fondor was inconsequential to Caedus since the Rule of Two had been restored with Veila's ascension to the only remaining rank within the Sith Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to Coruscant, Caedus officially established himself as the sole Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance\u2014his rule enforced by the GAG presence on the galactic capital. When Captain Shevu arrived in Caedus' new office, his report turned into an informal conversation in which Caedus revealed how he killed Mara Jade Skywalker and assumed his mantle as the Dark Lord of the Sith. Unknown to him at the time, however, Shevu had become a spy within the Galactic Alliance Guard for the Jedi Order. After secretly recording the conversation, he sent it to Ben Skywalker as proof of Caedus' direct involvement in Mara's death."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dissolution of the Guard"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In late 41 ABY, Captain Shevu rendezvoused with the Jedi Ben Skywalker, Leia Organa Solo and Jaina Solo On Coruscant to report on the activities and whereabouts of Chief of State Darth Caedus. However, during the meeting, the Jedi were followed by two Rodian spies of the Galactic Alliance Guard. Skywalker pretended to fight with Shevu and created appearance of resisting arrest, mainly so that Shevu could remain on Coruscant as the Jedi's spy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he tried to escape from the area, his path was blocked by the Sith Lady Tahiri Veila, who was garbed in GAG armor and a black cloak, and thus resembled her master's appearance. A team of elite GAG commandos followed closely behind Veila. Skywalker briefly fought the Sith apprentice in a lightsaber duel until a squad of GAG troopers fired on him. While distracted with deflecting their blaster fire, Skywalker was knocked unconscious after being punched several times in the back by Veila. At the same time, Shevu was overwhelmed and captured by his former GAG comrades."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once Veila and her shock troops loaded Ben and the prone Shevu into a Doomsled, Jaina made her way over to Leia, noticing the two Rodians being loaded into a med-wagon. Using a few acting tricks and some Force Force suggestions on CSF officers Tobyl and Jat'ho, the Solos commandeered the med-wagon. Ejecting the hapless Bith pilot, they took to the skies after Veila. Going a different way initially, to throw off suspicion, once they were out of sight of the GAG troopsleds, Jaina shoved the throttle forward, and they sped after the Doomsled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they began to close the distance with the GAG squad. When the two Rodians in the med-wagon began to wake up, Leia gave them some more sedatives to keep them unconscious. As the Jedi flew closer to the Galactic City SpeedPipe, following Veila, they became suspicious of the possibility that they were driving into a trap. They ultimately turned out to be correct when Veila, who had anticipated the rescue attempt, voice-activated a gas trap. Using various methods, Jaina and Leia survived the gas. With the entire capital world under GAG control, they reluctantly left Skywalker behind and escaped from Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly afterward, Ben Skywalker was tortured several times during an interrogation session by a GAG security droid designated as SD-XX. Although the droid failed to discern any information regarding the Jedi Order's secret base, its methods were successful in breaking much of Skywalker's mental resolve, thus creating an opportunity for Tahiri Veila to take over the interrogation. Dressed in only a form-fitting GAG jumpsuit, Veila feigned kindness toward Skywalker by personally dressing his wounds in an attempt to seduce the adolescent Jedi prisoner. Although Skywalker was tempted for obvious reasons, as well as his fear of dying from SD-XX's style of questioning, he resisted Veila's advances by reminding himself that she was the Sith apprentice to the man who killed his mother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lady Veila then changed her tactics by threatening to kill Lon Shevu, whom she electrocuted with Force lightning. However, she unintentionally killed the former captain by underestimating the strength of her own dark side powers.

While Veila led a team of Imperial shock troopers of the Moffs' Elite Guard, Jaina Solo infiltrated the badly damaged Anakin to confront and kill her twin brother. As the GAG suffered heavy losses alongside the rest of the Alliance fleet and their Imperial allies, Caedus was ultimately killed by Solo in a duel to the death.

In the aftermath of the battle, the Confederation also admitted defeat to the combined forces of the Galactic Alliance, the Imperial Remnant and the Jedi Order. As the Second Galactic Civil War ended, the Galactic Alliance Guard was disbanded while its former leader was succeeded by Natasi Daala, formerly of the Imperial Remnant, as the new Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance. Many of the responsibilities of the former GAG were transferred to the newly-formed Galactic Alliance Security (GAS).
