In return for giving him three of their stolen shield generators, the rebels traveled to Calrissian's farm in a stolen Imperial shuttle to rendezvous with W1-LE, who would assist them. With the aid of the Mandalorian rebel Sabine Wren, W1-LE created sensor buoys that would replicate the signal of the shuttle and scatter Imperial forces when they tried to track them. This plan worked and the rebels escaped the Imperial blockade and rejoined Phoenix Cell's fleet in deep space. Unknown to both Willie and the rebels, the Sith Lord Darth Vader had planted a tracking device aboard the shuttle and used it to assault Phoenix Squadron's fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "W1-LE had a laid-back personality but was still able to manage his master Lando Calrissian's farm and mining operation on Lothal.
