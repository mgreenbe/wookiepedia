The bathysphere was assigned to operations under the cloud layer of a Jovian gas giant during the Galactic Civil War. At some point, the smuggler Roark Garnet boarded the vessel. During an altercation in the control cabin\u2014which also caused the bathysphere to spin out of control\u2014Garnet dispatched the rest of the vessel's crew until only the Imperial remained. The two fought for control of the bathysphere as it plunged through the Jovian's cloud layers. During the struggle, the Imperial briefly got the upper hand on Garnet, taking control of the vessel, stabilizing the craft and arresting its descent. Moments later, Garnet took control of the bathysphere as the Imperial had exhausted himself trying to stabilize the stricken craft. The smuggler's intervention saved the bathysphere from colliding with a flying lifeform in the atmosphere, which the Imperial thought was impossible as he believed there were no life forms on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, the craft's repulsors failed, exposing the bathysphere to the full force of the planet's gravity of a thousand atmospheres. The Imperial was of the opinion that he and Garnet were doomed, and lay on the deck. Garnet inquired where the ship's repulsors were; the Imperial indicated the location to the aft and the smuggler went and fixed them. With the danger averted, the Imperial decided that the temporary truce between him and Garnet was over. As the smuggler was returning to the control cabin, the Imperial switched the setting on his blaster. Garnet heard the click, and unsure if it was set to stun or kill, decided to act first, leaping through the door to the control cabin firing. The Imperial managed to get his own shot off after Garnet's first, but the smuggler dodged the blast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial was a competent individual, capable of taking control of the vessel he was assigned to in an emergency. He was also fatalistic, believing that the loss of the craft's repulsors meant that he was doomed to die and did not attempt to repair them himself. The Imperial was also willing to stun or kill Garnet, who had just saved his life by repairing the repulsors. He was also stunned by the appearance of a life form in the atmosphere of the Jovian gas giant, as he believed that no life forms existing on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial appeared in Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, published by West End Games in 1987.
