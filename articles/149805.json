Some versions scanned individuals for increases or decreases in brain activity, in order to determine if they are lying. A person with memory loss could not be scanned however, if they could truly not remember an event. Others, like the Saldalith Manufacturing Veridicator 200, detected the minute changes in a target's physiology and changes in their biorhythm patterns when under stress. However, such scans were usual not admissible evidence in court proceedings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
