During that time, Stansun served as a police officer with the Coruscant Security Force under the Republic government. Around 3643 BBY he was assigned to the Black Sun territory where he attempted to shut down an illegal surgical clinic run by Black Sun criminal syndicate. The clinic was used to change the faces of known criminals to prevent the CSF from identifying them. However, every time CSF moved in to shut down the clinic, Black Sun moved to a different location at the sight of the CSF uniforms.
