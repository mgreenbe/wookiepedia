The ship was found adrift in space near the Peragus asteroid field in the Peragus system by the crew of the Galactic Republic Hammerhead-class cruiser Harbinger, while en route to the planet Telos IV on orders of highest priority from Admiral Carth Onasi to ferry a woman there, The Harbinger sent a boarding party to investigate the ship and found a comatose Sion, immediately sending him to the medical bay and into a kolto tank. He subsequently escaped and killed everyone on board the Republic ship, taking control of it and used it to reach the Peragus Mining Facility where the woman he was searching for, Meetra Surik, had been jettisoned to."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
