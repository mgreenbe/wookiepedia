During the early years of the Galactic Civil War, he was the head of a Rebel Alliance organization named Republic Redux. In 0 ABY, the Shelsha sector's Chief Administrator, Vilim Disra, told him that Governor Barshnis Choard planned to make the sector independent, and eventually ally with the Rebel Alliance. Chivkyrie's colleagues, the Shining Hope director of planning Thillis Slanni and the Freedonna Kaisu leader Ydor Vokkoli, distrusted Disra and a conflict resulted, which Leia Organa\u2014as a representative of the Rebel Alliance\u2014tried to resolve. Due to missing information, they visited Disra, who left the meeting shortly after the beginning of the conversation. At that point, Chivkyrie realized that Disra had betrayed them and as a consequence, he hid himself and Organa from the local Imperial patrols. When Chivkyrie heard rumors that Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, had come to Shelkonwa in order to capture Organa, Chivkyrie took refuge in Shelkonwa's catacombs per Organa's recommendation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yeeru Chivkyrie was born on the planet Shelkonwa as a male Adarian into a second-class family. His rank curbed certain aspects of his life\u2014he always had to be polite to first-class individuals and was not allowed to speak in a language that a member of a higher rank did not understand. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Chivkyrie founded an organization called Republic Redux to fight the Empire, and Republic Redux later became a member organization of the Rebel Alliance. Around 0 ABY, Chivkyrie met several times with Vilim Disra, the Chief Administrator of the Shelsha sector. Disra told him that Governor Barshnis Choard planned to have the Shelsha sector secede from the Empire. In addition, Disra said he could imagine cooperating with the Rebel Alliance. Thrilled with the prospect, Chivkyrie told his colleagues\u2014the Shining Hope director of planning Thillis Slanni and the Freedonna Kaisu leader Ydor Vokkoli\u2014of the plan. However, they saw much risk in the move, and distrusted Disra. Both were strictly against the idea, and threatened to abandon the Rebel Alliance. To resolve the conflict, Rebel leader Leia Organa was sent to Chivkyrie's ship to have a disputation with Chivkyrie, Slanni and Vokkoli."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chivkyrie told Organa what Disra had said to him during their meetings. Organa, who saw some advantages in this plan, wanted to know how Choard intended to resist the Empire. Chivkyrie could not answer this question, and so Organa, Chivkyrie and his colleagues went to the Flower Market in Shelkonwa's capital, Makrin City, to get the information from Disra. When they arrived, there were some differences regarding the hotel. Chivkyrie preferred the more luxurious variant unlike Organa, who deliberately chose the less luxurious option. Arriving at the Flower Market, the Adarian did not want to utter his companions' real names, as Leia Organa was one of the most wanted fugitives in the galaxy. Therefore, he named them after the first three letters of the Aurebesh alphabet: Aurek, Besh and Cresh. When Organa asked Disra how many allies he had, the administrator left the meeting, as he was not able to answer the question without investigation. Chivkyrie was annoyed\u2014but not surprised\u2014by Disra's behavior and wanted to apologize, but Organa asked him to never contact Disra again. She also wanted to leave the planet as soon as possible. Though Chivkyrie could not understand Organa's mistrust, he contacted his pilot. The pilot told him that Choard had just forbidden Humans to leave Shelkonwa. After hearing that, Chivkyrie knew that Disra had betrayed them. Chivkyrie then told his colleagues to flee so that the patrols would not capture them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Slanni and Vokkoli left the planet to protect their people. Chivkyrie decided\u2014against his colleagues' will\u2014to stay with Organa, because he did not want to leave a guest in danger on his home planet. Knowing that he could no longer keep his social standing, he gave up his name, his home, and his rank to keep Organa alive. His plan was to hide in plain sight, and he looked for a safe job that Organa could perform while they laid low. In the job advertisements, he found what he was looking for: a tapcafe run by the Mungra Vicria. Organa\u2014who had not expected such an action by him\u2014accepted the job. Over the course of the day, the Adarian grew pessimistic due to the fact that patrols were looking for both of them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around midnight, Chivkyrie and Organa had a conversation about their current situation in a flat provided for employees of Vicria's tapcafe, when they heard some housebreakers trying to break into a theater employee's house. Organa spotted an Adarian child in the same house, and knowing what housebreakers were capable of when they saw potential witnesses, she felt obligated to save the child. However, Chivkyrie feared for her safety. The Rebel leader planned to snap a pipe next to the window by shooting at its mountings, and then intended to place the pipe's end on the theater employee's roof and slip down to confront the criminals. After her first shots at the pipe, Chivkyrie saw the housebreakers running away, and Organa returned to the house."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next day, Chivkyrie lost all his confidence in his and Organa's survival after he heard that Darth Vader, a Dark Lord of the Sith, arrived in the city. Organa encouraged him, having escaped from Vader quite often before. She reminded him that the stormtroopers would not be searching for him, but rather for her. After this conversation, he hid himself in the catacombs, a place in Makrin City's caves that had usually served as a hiding place for outlaws and war criminals throughout Makrin City's history. Meanwhile, Organa continued working in Vicria's tapcafe until the Rebels Luke Skywalker and Han Solo saved her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yeeru Chivkyrie was a sentient who had a large amount of confidence in others. For example, he only saw a small impoliteness in Disra's disappearance, as if it had happened several times before, while Organa and the other Rebels were quite sure that Disra had betrayed them. The Adarian only saw the betrayal when he heard that Humans were not allowed to leave Shelkonwa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition, it was very important to Chivkyrie that he did not lose his social standing. He disliked the idea of staying the night in a lower-class hotel, but he did not object, as he did not want to make a bad impression. Though he cared a lot about his image, the Republic Redux leader willingly gave up his social reputation just to fight the Empire. During the search by local patrols, he became unsure if the Rebel Alliance could really defeat the Empire, especially when he heard that Darth Vader was leading the search. Finally, when Organa told him that the Empire would not search for him, he regained his confidence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yeeru Chivkyrie's first and only appearance was in the 2006 novel Allegiance by author Timothy Zahn.
