While mostly used as a droid-disabling weapon, it could also be used to incapacitate an organic enemy. It was the predecessor to the DEMP 2 gun built on the same principles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DEMP gun released a modified-frequency pulse effect that was capable of overwhelming shielding and hardened circuitry and had three adjustable power settings. The normal firing mode was capable of disabling a droid for some time, while the weaker setting would only pause it momentarily. At its highest setting, the DEMP gun was capable of inflicting physical damage to a droid's internal components, sometimes causing them to catch on fire, and require their complete replacement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A smaller version was also available in pistol form."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
