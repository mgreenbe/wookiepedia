Another example of omnivores included Humans."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Silicavorous"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Silicavore referred to species that ate rocks and minerals, digesting organic material within.

Business owners sometimes enhanced their security by using these creatures as a way to keep firearms out of their establishments.

For instance, some visitors to the Forest Moon of Endor speculated that the tiny Wisties fed on laughter and other positive emotions.

Through the chain, energy would first travel from the sun to a plant, then from a plants to animals, then from animals to other animals, and then back to the soil through decay. On a related note, a food web was a way of describing the interconnected feeding relationship in a given ecosystem: vertically, it showed who ate whom, and horizontally, it showed who was in competition with whom for food."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
