The Trandoshan assisted Moore in her plot to kill the Sith Lord and Imperial enforcer Darth Vader, in which Moore passed a datacard containing the details of Vader's armor between the members of her court so that it could be sent to the assassin droid IG-88. However, Vader survived an attack by IG-88 and uncovered Moore's operations, confronting her and her court. The Trandoshan and Moore's other allies attempted to flee, but were defeated by the Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
