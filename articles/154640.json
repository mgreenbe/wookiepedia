He was seen watching a Twi'lek dancer with a male Quarren while they argued about who she would go out with. When Fong Do and a Weequay pirate caught Ahsoka eavesdropping, this Rodian pulled out a blaster, along with everyone else, but hesitated firing after Plo ignited his lightsaber. He, like the other patrons, bought Ahsoka's gold credit distraction and let the two Jedi get away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
