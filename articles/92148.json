They were common in casinos on the Rim's Haven worlds, such as Tresidiss. Their gaming programs were usually rigged to favor the house, though most customers knew this and enjoyed trying to figure out which games were rigged. The GDA-8 could accept electronic currency transfers and credit slip payments via comlink tie-ins with local banks and could exchange New Republic, Imperial, and\u2014if programmed to do so\u2014local planetary currencies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The model had a 1.9-meter-tall semi-humanoid body with two arms and a repulsorlift generator at its base.
