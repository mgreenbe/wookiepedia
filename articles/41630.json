His sister was Ducilla, and he was married, with a married son. He was an admirer of Palpatine, whose reign he had lived through."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When SELCORE approached the Duros High House about setting up refugee settlements on Duro, Brarun was approached by the Peace Brigade to buy the votes needed, hopping to turn Duro into an ideal target for the Yuuzhan Vong. Brarun then had CorDuro ship the supplies intended for the refugees to the orbital cities. Brarun also took Jacen Solo hostage when the Yuuzhan Vong attacked Duro. Initially, Brarun and CorDuro had agreed to sacrifice one orbital city and spare the other eighteen, while leaving the planet to the Vong. But when the Yuuzhan Vong continued to destroy all but one city, Brarun and several other officials came down to protest. Warmaster Tsavong Lah, who had just been defeated by Jacen Solo, instead demanded Solo's name. Once Brarun gave it, Lah imprisoned him in a dovin basal containment field. Brarun and the other officials were then fed to Tu-Scart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
