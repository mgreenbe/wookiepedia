Based out of an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate which moved location regularly, pilots were required to negotiate a series of gates and targets within a time limit. The course used holographic technology to simulate damage to starfighters and pilots had the opportunity to try a variety of starfighters, including the X-wing, Y-wing, A-wing and B-wing. During his first run through the Maze, Rebel pilot Dev accidentally made a hyperspace jump to an Imperial training area in the Senex system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
