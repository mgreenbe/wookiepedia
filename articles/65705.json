It mounted only a single Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. Mark 3/S Medium Blaster Cannon. The 1-L required a crew of two to operate; a driver and a gunner. There was room for two passengers in the tank, usually reserved for a section sergeant or platoon sergeant major who generally moved between all the tanks in a unit on a daily basis, although in some cases they can even carry up to four passengers. Like all Imperial-class repulsortanks, the 1-L was built on the same 20.5 meter-long chassis and could reach speeds of up to 300 kilometers an hour. It had a cargo capacity of 300 kilograms and a ground clearance of between two and three meters. 1-Ls cost between 40,000 and 50,000 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lightly-armored hull was sloped in order to deflect blaster fire, and was fully environmentally sealed, with up to 3 standard days of air and water available. In addition, their Mark 3/S Medium Blaster Cannon has such excellent range and punch that a squad of 1-Ls can easily destroy enemy AFVs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
