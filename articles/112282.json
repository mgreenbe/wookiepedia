It was an underground facility featuring solitary confinement cells and brainwashing sessions for enrolled youth. Students and infants at the Re-Learning Circle were usually sent there for consistent misbehavior or an incurable illness. V-Davi was among the students sent to the Re-Learning Circle for misbehavior. O-Lana was sent there for her Force abilities, but she was eventually rescued by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Siri Tachi, who arranged to be sent there by misbehaving in the Learning Circle. Following this rescue, the population of Kegan found out about the Re-Learning Circle's similarities to a prison and voted to shut it down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
