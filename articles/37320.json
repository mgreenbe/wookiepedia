The sail skiffs were smaller in size however, and were designed to be used as one-man personal fliers. Unlike the Bantha IIs, the sail skiffs housed a pair of blaster cannons located on each side of the lower hull."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An action figure accessory of the Desert sail skiff was released as part of Kenner's Return of the Jedi mini-rig toy line. Smaller than vehicles or playsets, the mini-rigs were fairly inexpensive and provided more play value at a lower cost to consumers than many of the larger accessories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The package illustration showed the character of Boba Fett piloting the sail skiff across an arid terrain. Presumably, these vehicles were intended to be part of Jabba the Hutt's entourage, but they were never shown in the movie. The similar Floater-935 did, however, appear in the Star Wars: Droids animated television series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
