When activated, the lightning module emitted a bolt of pure electricity at a specific target. Like most DarkStryder technology, though, the lightning module was only usable in Kathol sector. Any attempt to remove it from the sector and use it would result in the destruction of the module."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
