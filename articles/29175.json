By order of the Republic Strategic Information Service, prisoners' descendants were not allowed to leave Belsavis, and the group became strongly opposed to the Republic under the leadership of the Kaleesh Nyranos. They attacked the Prison Administration Center during the reconstituted Sith Empire's assault on Belsavis during the Galactic War and killed Warden Playt, though his successor Warden Graal was eventually convinced to strike a deal with Nyranos and form an alliance with them in return for improved living conditions and employment by the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
