By using a Rancor tooth that Lando had already brought, his intention was to lay low for a while and return with the tooth, giving the illusion he had slain the Rancor. The real Rancor is found however, and in their getaway, Flek tricks the Rancor into thinking there are more at sea by using a recording of the beast's cry and then throwing the tooth into the ocean. The Rancor swims away, and the two realize they have inadvertently rid Meek of the Rancor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back in the village, the Meek praise Lando and Flek, and the two are given the relics as promised.
