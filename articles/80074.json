Perhaps due to the added systems required by these weapons, Wandrau fitted them with a far weaker shield system, only able to produce a tenth of the defensive capability of the Large Gun Emplacement. Furthermore, these systems somehow compromised hull armor (or the armor was omitted entirely), giving the Large Gun/Warhead Emplacement a paltry armor rating of 2 RU."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nonetheless, this defense was extremely dangerous to incoming starfighters. The warhead launchers also made it especially threatening to smaller capital ships, such as a CR90 corvette."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
