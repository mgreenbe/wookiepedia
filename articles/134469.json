As the series begins, Imperial forces have occupied a remote planet, ruling with an iron fist and ruining the lives of its people. But there are a select few who are brave enough to stand up against the endless Stormtroopers and TIE fighters of the Empire: the clever and motley crew of the starship Ghost.

Thus, the series was placed between Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, during the reign of the Galactic Empire, though not so close to A New Hope that it would feel repetitive. In contrast to the galaxy-hopping structure of The Clone Wars, it was decided Rebels would depict the Rebellion from one group of characters' point of view. According to Filoni, Kinberg likened it to imagining a show set during the American Revolution \"that was about five guys that were locked up in a farmhouse somewhere fighting against the local British military and without any real knowledge of the larger political movements\". He also noted how the original trilogy mentioned events like the dissolution of the Imperial Senate without depicting them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The development team set out to differentiate the series from The Clone Wars by basing much of the visuals on the designs of Ralph McQuarrie\u2014the artist who developed concept art for much of the original trilogy of films. Rebels was influenced by ideas developed by George Lucas for Star Wars: Underworld, and much of the action in Rebels was influenced by the Indiana Jones franchise. Early in development, Disney wanted a more comedy-oriented series than Lucasfilm was interested in making. Kathleen Kennedy and the Rebels creative team had to make their case otherwise. At one point, Filoni considered involving the Death Star plans in the show, but abandoned the idea after Rogue One began development. He later planned to have appearances from the Death Star and Orson Krennic, but decided it was best to focus on things that directly affect the Ghost crew."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Production"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucasfilm Ltd. veteran sculptor Darren Marshall, who worked on Star Wars: The Clone Wars prior to its cancellation, developed sculpts for the core characters of Star Wars Rebels before leaving Lucasfilm in June 2013.

Voice-recording had been finished for five episodes, with three more episodes undergoing storyboarding, two more undergoing animation, and the first episode undergoing lighting. Sound design was also underway, with a theme in place for the series.

To aid in animating the show, Lucasfilm developed a special tool for Adobe Photoshop that emulates Ralph McQuarrie's artistic style; the character Zeb Orrelios is based on McQuarie's original concept art for the Wookiee Chewbacca. The series' look is also inspired by the work of Hayao Miyazaki\u2014a favorite of Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy. Filoni requested that the animation crew look at the Disney film Tangled, for which 2D facial expressions were created using 3D animation. Simon Kinberg wrote the series's first two episodes, which serve as a short story arc to introduce the show's main characters. By March 2014, the entire first season had been mapped out, and according to Greg Weisman, the series as a whole is organized as a three-act play. The first season serves as the first act of the overall series, while the second and third acts may take more than one season."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars Rebels was overseen by three executive producers: Dave Filoni, Simon Kinberg, and Greg Weisman.
