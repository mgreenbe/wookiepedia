It operated with a crew of four and could carry up to eight passengers. Its defenses relied entirely on weak shields, as the ship was completely unarmed and had a weak hull."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cargo Empress was produced shortly after the introduction of the Class 720 freighter and was an attempt to capitalize on the smaller ship's modest success. However, the Cargo Empress sold poorly and was a major contributing factor to Ghtroc's bankruptcy. In a desperate attempt to pay off the company's debts, all remaining Cargo Empress-class ships were dumped on the market at very low prices. As a result, ships of the class could be found throughout the galaxy, despite their commercial failure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
