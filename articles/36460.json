Degrades were often given based on the will of the teacher or proctor, although it was meant to be based on the severity of the transgression. Any student that amassed fifty or more degrades was automatically expelled from the Academy and sent to the Mining Corps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
