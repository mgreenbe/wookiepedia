Aphra is behind bars. Again. But this time, she finds herself in Imperial custody, strapped to an explosive transmitter synced to a single hub-droid. Take one step too far? KABLOOEY! Normally, this wouldn't be an issue to sit still for Aphra \u2013 but what happens when her Imperial captors send her hub-droid to the middle of a war zone?

As a prisoner, Aphra is forced to serve in the Accresker Penal Legion, an expendable force deployed into battle by the Empire. While being interrogated by an Imperial officer, Aphra recounts the events of the previous battle, an attack on a Rebel Alliance frigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, Aphra sabotages the hubdroid supervising her squad, causing it to explode. The explosion kills all the prisoners in the squad, aside from the fearful electrician Lopset Yas.

Meanwhile, on the planet Son-tuul, the assassin droid 0-0-0, whose status at the front of the Son-tuul Pride was lost in the recent attack, stands within the wreckage of the Son-tuul Spaceport with fellow assassin droid BT-1.

Dek-Nil destroys the escape pod, foiling Aphra's escape plan. As the escape pod explodes, Aphra notices a ghostly figure nearby, who speaks of justice. The battle comes to an end, and the prisoners are ordered to return to Accresker Jail. Aphra loses sight of the figure, and is forced to give up, retreating back to the prison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The officer terminates the interrogation, and his lieutenant concludes that Aphra is hiding something from the interrogator droid. Aphra, with no plan and no hope of escape, is escorted back to the prison by Dek-Nil, who is still under the control of the Imperial restraining bolt. When Aphra returns to her quarters, she meets Yas, who offers her a transmitter that he built from scrap. With the Empire able to track and jam any unwanted signals, Yas gives Aphra one chance to contact anyone in the galaxy.
