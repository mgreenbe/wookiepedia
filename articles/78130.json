She became a member of the Jedi Order and attended the Almas Academy, a Jedi academy that was located on the planet Almas, in the Cularin system. While there, she trained to become a Jedi Guardian, a combat-orientated Jedi specialization. During the time of the Clone Wars, D'bis undertook the Jedi Trials, which she passed, making her a Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time after her graduation, D'bis was picked to be an official representative of the Academy at a celebration that was being held on Dorumaa, the moon of Almas. The celebration had been organized by the Metatheran Cartel, a trade organization that was jointly run by members of the Caarite and Filordus species. They had organized the event to thank a group of freelance agents for preventing the release of a deadly virus on the Caarite homeworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jawa Jedi Consular Akial was chosen to accompany D'bis. Due to their different specializations within the Order, D'bis and Akial could represent different approaches to being a Jedi and show that the Order was not single-minded. They traveled from Almas to Greentree Pointe resort on Dorumaa, where the celebration was being held. Upon their arrival, they set up a booth to try and recruit potential students for the Academy. While at the celebration, D'bis and Akial debated the threat posed by the Believers, a Sith cult that operated in the Cularin system. They both agreed that the Believers were a major problem for the system but disagreed over how to deal with the cult. D'bis suggested that the Believers should be hunted down, but Akial thought that it would be better to investigate the capabilities of the cult, as little was known about what their goals were. They also discussed the Metatheran Cartel, which had committed many past transgressions in the Cularin system, such as destroying the sacred ch'hala tree grove. D'bis believed that the Cartel should be regarded with suspicion, due to its secretive nature, although she did not think it was prudent to openly denounce it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "D'bis was slightly impulsive and liked to speak her mind. Despite this, she generally acted in a patient manner.

Paarty On! was an interactive scenario that was intended for use at roleplaying events, and it outlined how event staff would play the roles of the various non-player characters, such as D'bis, and interact with players of the campaign. The scenario encouraged those playing D'bis and Akial to involve the players in their debate about the Believers and the Cartel, and to also discuss the nature of the Force with them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
