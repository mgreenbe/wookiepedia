The design was simple itself: propelled by six legs using a simple walking algorithm, the unit was easily moved by two foot pedals located at the base. This design enabled the pilot to look like a mere passenger. An alternate version, the Royux, removed 150 kilos of cargo space to add a pilot. The unit stood 4 meters tall and generally cost 40,000 credits new. With the rise of the Galactic Empire the new set of military contracts and low sales of Emperiax units encouraged Arakyd to discontinue the line."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
