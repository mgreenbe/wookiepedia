He then spent time traveling the Outer Rim Territories in search of experience and adventure. By the time of the Trade Federation invasion of Naboo, he was an accomplished pilot. Hollis was captured in the opening stages of the invasion. When he was rescued from his prison camp, he joined a resistance band led by Captain Kael. The captain was later shot down in battle, and Hollis reported this fact to his fellow resistance member, Gavyn Sykes. Hollis then joined in the search for Kael, eventually locating the captain's fighter. Kael revealed with his dying breath that their smuggler ally Borvo the Hutt had betrayed him. Sykes swore revenge against the Hutt. Hollis and his wingmate Vedd Deviss flanked the Hutt's position on Porso Hill, protecting Sykes while he engaged the Hutt's personal transport. After Borvo was forced to flee, the resistance turned their sights back to the Trade Federation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Acting on information provided by the mercenary pilot Kol Kotha, they planned on liberating Camp Four. Flying under cover of darkness, the pilots flew into the camp. Hollis broke formation, thinking his family might be in the camp. His actions exposed their position to the enemy. Sykes was able to infiltrate the camp and liberate the prisoners. Hollis performed a strafing run, firing on several tanks which were threatening Sykes; Hollis succeeded in blowing up part of the wall, allowing Sykes to reach a shield generator.
