The films had an special influence on his life, feeling identified with the Mandalorian bounty hunter Boba Fett. He also praised several Expanded Universe stories, arguing that some of them are amazing and that some good lessons about life could be learned from them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Raymond had the chance to write on Star Wars Insider, he wrote positively about Karen Traviss' Republic Commando: Hard Contact, praising her writing. Both Ramirez and Traviss have become good friends since then. As a form of gratitude, Traviss thanked him for his advice in the acknowledgments in Republic Commando: Triple Zero, Republic Commando: True Colors and Legacy of the Force: Revelation (which was dedicated to him too). The character of Ram Zerimar, seen in Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines, is a tuckerization of Ramirez' name. Ramirez designed the Verpine shatter gun with bipod and a helmet for Kal Skirata as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Raymond Ramirez attended Celebration IV in 2007. He cosplayed as a Mandalorian.
