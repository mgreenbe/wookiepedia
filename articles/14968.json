Following the Yuuzhan Vong capture of Reecee, Han and Leia Organa Solo scouted the Black Bantha, a dangerous nebula that was immune to sensors and located on the hyperroute between Reecee and Coruscant. There, they discovered that the Yuuzhan Vong Reecee fleet had moved there, and was being joined by hundreds of other Yuuzhan Vong ships from across the galaxy, in preparation for an attack on Coruscant. They sent word to New Republic Fleet Command, and Supreme Commander Sien Sovv hurriedly assembled a 900-ship fleet to attack. However, the Vong fleet outnumbered it by hundreds and was aided by superior coordination."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crew of the Millennium Falcon discovered that a large amount of the Vong fleet had not yet refuelled or restocked, and was in effect acting as a harmless decoy. This allowed Sovv to ignore that portion and concentrate on the main threats. Although one quarter of the New Republic fleet ended up being destroyed, in the end the Vong ships were destroyed or scattered. Additionally, a Jedi force under Luke Skywalker managed to capture the fleet's yammosk for the Yammosk Action."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle at the Black Bantha Nebula first appeared in the novel The New Jedi Order: Star by Star.
