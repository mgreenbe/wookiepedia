When ready to deploy proton torpedoes, the armored shell of the vehicle would split open to expose nine launch tubes. When used in coordination with spotter droids that sensor pinged heavily armored enemy units, the MPTL-2a had a maximum firing range of more than 20 kilometers. However, range and accuracy could be severely hampered without assistance from sensor droids or spotting units."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the slow responsiveness and turn rate of the MPTL-L, Imperial artillery units began exploiting its sluggishness during the Galactic Civil War. The Rebel Alliance sent Loratus Manufacturing desperate requests for design upgrades, and the resulting 2a variant was lighter, making it more maneuverable and faster in deploying its launch assembly than the MPTL-L. However, the lightweight build hampered the launcher's stability and range, and the initial upgrades performed poorly during field tests, requiring the addition of gription stabilizers to steady the vehicle so the launch assembly could effectively fire. Although its increased mobility over the MPTL-L made it less of an easy target, it was not a direct combat vehicle. Therefore, Rebel Commanders attached armed escorts to the vehicles or kept them out of range of heavy fire. In spite of its few shortcomings, the MPTL-2a was a significant upgrade over the MPTL-L design due to its lightweight build and\u2014with the accompaniment of spotter units\u2014its extended weapons range."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The MPTL-2a appears in Star Wars: Empire at War as the Rebel artillery unit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
