Zettifar and Greatstorm were part of the Republic response team sent to the Hetzal system to protect the evacuating civilians. On the surface of Hetzal Prime, the two Jedi confronted a group of security guards that were preventing a large group of citizens from attaining passage offworld as was ordered by Minister Zeffren Ecka. Zettifar and his master ended up having to fight off a force of attacking pirates as well as deal with the guards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the Great Disaster, Zettifar and his master traveled to a Jedi outpost on the planet Elphrona. They were stationed there with Indeera Stokes, Jedi Master Porter Engle, and the charhound Ember. Zettifar continued to be trained by Greatstorm, who worked to help him master controlled descent from a great height by aid of the Force. Zettifar was unsuccessful with learning the maneuver and had to be saved by Stokes, who Greatstorm had positioned on the ground in case his Padawan was in danger. Zettifar was embarrassed that he had to be saved, but he then went to eat with Stokes when Engle announced that he was making Nine-Egg Stew. However, their meal was interrupted when the Jedi received a distress signal from the Blythe family. The four Jedi showed up at the Blythe homestead and found that they had been kidnapped. They chased down the Nihil raiders that had captured them, splitting up at one point so Stokes could get a ship and Engle could take care of the enemy rearguard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zettifar and Greatstorm recovered the mother, Erika, and defended her as the enemy ship strafed the area.
