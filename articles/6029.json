As the Empire became more destabilized at the close of the Galactic Civil War, the New Republic established a base on Altyr V. In 10 ABY, Jedi Knight Kyle Katarn was stationed on the planet acting as Captain along with his temporary apprentice Mara Jade. During their stay, the Dark Empire began an assault on the planet. The Republic forces found out that the Remnant had manned two modified asteroids, which they used to bombard the planet, pinning the Republic forces down until a large-scale assault could be staged. Katarn managed to travel to one of the asteroids and redirect its weapon to the other asteroid, destroying it. He then circumvented the weapon's cooling system, destroying the one he was on, barely escaping himself. It was during this mission he learned of an Imperial presence on Dromund Kaas, leading to his fateful brush with the Dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Yuuzhan Vong War, Altyr V was granted representation in the Galactic Alliance Senate.
