The Rimma Trade Route ran through the system, far off from which was the planet Askaj. Living on the planet were a species called Askajians who worshiped the planet's one moon, Moon Lady, as a deity. The major orbital body of the system was the planet Askaj. The system was under the administration of Grand Moff Wilkadon whose oppression forced many inhabitants to relocate to Tatooine. The planet was later liberated by the New Republic some time after the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
