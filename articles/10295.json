Imperial Intelligence discovered that the Cartel shared the information from this listening post with the Galactic Republic; so the Sith assembled a fleet of Terminus-class destroyer and Sith starfighters to destroy it, but the space station was defended by a large Republic fleet so the Sith Command called for reinforcements, requesting any Sith forces in the areas. With these new fighters, especially a very skilled Sith pilot, the Empire succeeded in accomplishing the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
