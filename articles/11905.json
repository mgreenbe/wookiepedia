When the Yevethan thrustship Aramadia broke off negotiations with the New Republic and made an unauthorized launch to return to N'zoth, Admiral Gial Ackbar ordered Baintorf to raise the planetary shield to prevent the Aramadia's passage and for the Nebula-class Star Destroyer Brilliant to shadow the Aramadia while it held position underneath the shield. When Nil Spaar protested that this was an illegal violation of his right of free passage, Leia Organa Solo ordered General Baintorf to lower the shield and to allow the Aramadia to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
