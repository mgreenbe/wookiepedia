Tradition dictated that the Boss, or leader, of each village venture into the forest once a year and hunt enough animals to feed all the villagers. One certain Sacred Feast took place around the year 3000 BBY. During the event, Boss Gallo left his village of Otoh Sancture to search for nerfs to prepare for the Sacred Feast. However, as he came upon some nerfs, his village was attacked and destroyed by bursas, furry carnivorous semi-sentient creatures, later found out to be sent by Boss Rogoe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sacred Feast made its only appearances in the 2001 PC video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its expansion pack Clone Campaigns.
