The transport had at least one bright navigation light and was piloted by two Daimanate Sith troopers. The vessel was dark blue with a few red stripes. It also had four rear thruster engines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her second raid on Daiman's compound, Kerra stowed aboard the ship and used it to infiltrate Daiman's palace. Upon landing, she freed the village leaders and killed their escorting Sith troopers. She then rescued Gorlan Palladane, a fellow Jedi Knight and the leader of the Chelloan resistance. Kerra and the freed village leaders then traveled to Arboth where they evacuated Chelloa's population using a fleet of freighters known as the Freedom Fleet. Due to Kerra and Palladane's efforts, they managed to evacuate 60,000 Chelloans to Republic space prior to the Destruction of Chelloa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
