The end result was a tremendously powerful weapon based on archaic principles, but enhanced through modern technology. Each caster used a side loading clip of arrows, with each arrow measuring at 15-centimeters long."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While initially designed to attempt to duplicate the Wookiee bowcasters lethality and simplicity of dealing heavy damage to heavily armored targets, the Magna caster-100 ultimately could not compete with the bowcasters explosive quarrels and raw power. However, in trade off for more moderate stopping power, what the Magna Caster-100 lacked in penetration power it made up for in range; possessing twice the range of a bowcaster, the Magna Caster-100 was more than capable of piercing light and medium armors and dealing impressive damage. Additionally, the Magna Caster-100 was whisper quiet, and its quarrels lacked the glow of the characteristic energy sheath that bowcasters imbued."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lack of noise when firing, and an absence of a visible and traceable bolt made it a popular weapon of choice by Alliance Commandoes, who preferred the weapon for its ability to silently take out an enemy invisibly at long range."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
