It would kill a Human once it passed his or her lips. When mixed with liquids, it would fizz. When the venom would be spilled, an acid smell and a greenish flame could be seen, and a sizzling noise could be heard. In 19 BBY, the crime lord Hat Lo tried to kill the young bounty hunter Boba Fett by giving him a drink which included Dozoisian Snark Venom. However, Fett immediately recognized that and spilled the drink."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The venom first appeared in Boba Fett: Pursuit, a novel written by Elizabeth Hand and published in 2004."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
