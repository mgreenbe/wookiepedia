From the creation of Bartyn's Landing up until c. 29 BBY, the mayor was a member of the Bartyn family, who also ruled the two more important local businesses\u2014the fully automated mines for Outer Rim Oreworks and Bartyn Gourmet Delicacies, giving a job to most of the people\u2014and who held the property of almost all the land; sometimes, the Bartyns selected an agent or proxy as the mayor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The councilors were publicly elected by the people in a vote that included a good amount of corruption. Even then, they had limited power, as they could not interfere in the management of ORO or in interplanetary trade, and the mayor could veto any action of the council, following the town charter\u2014although this last action had only happened in the worst of times. The councilors did supervise the planetary trade of textiles and food with other towns in Lamaredd, including the sovereign state of Little Mon Cal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The councilors voted who would be the Security Chief, or de facto constable of the town, even if the Chief was supposedly an employee of ORO.
