Like all R-series astromech droids, 6R-0WL built by Industrial Automaton and stood 0.96 meters tall. 6R-0WL also had a particularly vicious attitude. On Life Day during the war, the droid was offered for sale by the vendor droid 80-T5, who operated a stall in the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant. 6R-0WL's plating was gray and included decals to make it look like a wampa at the time he was available for sale."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "6R-0WL first appeared as a purchasable companion for players in the MMORPG Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures released by Sony Online Entertainment in 2010. The droid could be bought only during the Life Day event for 300 station cash, a premium in-game currency players have to buy with real money. Given that 6R-0WL's purchase is entirely optional, this article makes no assumptions about if it was bought.
