The most notable distinction from the Lambda-class was the cofferdam that had been placed beneath the bridge. The outer rim of the cofferdam was lined with Corusca gems, which were used to cut through the hulls of space stations or other vessels just prior to a boarding action. As such, the shuttle was used primarily in boarding operations and even on small strategic raids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Modified assault shuttles were used in conjunction with Rebel Assault Frigate Mark Is, being docked at the top of each frigate's superstructure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Battle of Ciutric, an Imperial Assault Shuttle was used to attempt an escape by Colonel Lorrir and Ysanne Isard's clone, but was destroyed by Wedge Antilles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Shadow Academy/Second Imperium insurgence of 23 ABY, a modified version was used to raid GemDiver Station over Yavin and to board and capture the bulk cruiser Adamant above Coruscant.
