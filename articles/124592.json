Upon arrival, they found that the sole Imperial installation on the planet, Imperial Depot 4290-1, had been abandoned by Sarne, and the personnel were stranded. The base commander, Colonel Heget, strikes a deal with Captain Kaiya Adrimetrum to transport him to the shadowport Tanquilla Beach in exchange for navigational data."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, an agent of Sarne's, Lieutenant Palme, manages to upload a special datacard into the FarStar's computers. As the corvette attempts to jump to Tanquilla Beach, programming from the datacard causes the hypdrive to overload. Shortly after, the ship is attacked by the bounty hunter group Qulok's Fist. A short battle ensues, but Qulok's Fist are employed by Sarne to harass the FarStar only, and they withdraw. With no functioning hyperdrive, Lofryyhn jury-rigs the engines with parts from the X-wings onboard the FarStar, and the ship was limped to the Beach."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Beach, the FarStar crew enlists the help of Fia to fix their engines, and learns of the numerous trapdoors that Sarne had installed in the ship. After assisting the Beach to fight off an attack on the shadowport by one of Sarne's Carrack-class light cruisers, the FarStar departs for Pembric II to find a slicer capable of removing Sarne's little surprises."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
