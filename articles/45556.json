As with earlier Jedi starfighters, the ship lacked a hyperdrive and relied on an external hyperspace transport ring to reach hyperspace. Despite this, it was faster than its Aethersprite predecessor, with twin ion engines providing a maximum acceleration of 5,200G and a max speed of 1,500 kph. The Eta-2 featured wings with upper and lower radiator panels, S-foils, that were opened to shed excess heat from the ship's engines. The radiator wings were primarily opened during intense combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was piloted by a single pilot, with the assistance of a single externally mounted astromech droid for navigation and repair assistance.
