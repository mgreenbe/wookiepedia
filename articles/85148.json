Each mag-pellet had a magnetic charge that caused them to be fired at a great velocity from a magnetic pulse weapon, such as a Verpine shatter gun. The magnetic charge could also induce the mag-pellets to travel more quickly to their destination if there was any metal components on armor or towards the hull of a starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
