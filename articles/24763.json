Junda and Cordova were later sent by the Jedi High Council to oversee an excavation of a temple located on the planet Ontotho but in the process, they were caught up in a battle between the Fylar Freedom Fighters and the local security forces. During the course of the battle, Junda worked with the Fylar Freedom Fighters. She eventually became a Jedi Knight serving the Order as a Jedi seeker, and took Trilla Suduri as her Padawan.

There, Kestis discovered a droid, BD-1, who played a message from Cordova telling the viewer that he had hidden a Jedi holocron inside the vault. The holocron contained the names of Force-sensitive children across the galaxy. Junda, realizing that the holocron could be the key to rebuilding the Jedi Order, took it upon herself to mentor the former Padawan and complete his training. She and Kestis embarked on a quest to unlock the knowledge necessary to recover the holocron that took them across the galaxy.

While she cut herself off from the Force, shortly following the Great Jedi Purge, due to the trauma inflicted upon her by the Galactic Empire, Junda was a powerful Jedi. She possessed skill in lightsaber combat, and could create a Force barrier similar in appearance and potency to a ray shield, a barrier that was capable of stopping Darth Vader's lightsaber briefly, but was also rendered unconscious from the effort. Junda was also a fine marksman, capable of using a blaster to great effect; when using a lightsaber and a blaster side by side, Junda easily handled a multitude of Purge Troopers, soldiers trained to kill Jedi. To her own horror, however, she was also quite strong with the dark side of the Force, capable of inflicting mass destruction and killing a multitude of people when giving in to despair, fear and rage. Her anguish at the sight of her former apprentice, Trilla, having been inducted into the Inquisitorius caused her to involuntarily release a shockwave that broke her free from her interrogation chair and killed everyone in the chamber with her except Trilla.
