He spent several months rehearsing his speech, which he regarded as an exercise in propaganda to assure the troops of their role in the climactic battle. Rax delivered the speech in front of a podium at the Imperial headquarters beneath a massive flickering holostatue projection of himself. He wanted to invoke the image of a god issuing divine commands to the faithful. Unknown to his own soldiers, Rax was planning to destroy Jakku along with the amassed Imperial and New Republic forces as part of the Contingency."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Full Text"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gallius Rax's speech was included as part of Chuck Wendig's 2017 novel Aftermath: Empire's End, the third installment in Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
