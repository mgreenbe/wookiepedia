It was part of the first wave of Imperial ships that were passing through the Almaran system. Alliance Command had launched multiple A-wings piloted by Rogue Squadron to inspect the ships and to destroy any freighters carrying Warheads to buy time. The frigate soon launched TIE Fighters to intercept the A-wings but the fighters were outwitted and most, if not all of them were lost in the skirmish."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
