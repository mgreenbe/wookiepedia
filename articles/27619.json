Cleben warned Swiftbird and her compatriots not to stray into the Red Zone, an Imperial-controlled region of the station, and he agreed to purchase some cargo from them. However, as the goods were being off-loaded, I-5YQ deliberately dropped a crate onto Cleben's foot in order to create a distraction, to allow them to observe the security controls that governed access point to the Red Zone. Cleben howled out in pain and he was subsequently carried to the infirmary by some of his men."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
