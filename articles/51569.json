The mill was a grav treadmill incline that was circular in shape and included a railing around one side. It could simulate both high and low gravity environments. The mill could be used for exercise in the privacy of one's own home, and to train for work in gravity fields of strengths that the user was not used to. Dedicated training on the mill over a period of between a few days and a few weeks, with the amount of time depending on the difference between the simulated gravity and what the user was accustomed to, allowed users to acclimate to the gravity strengths that they practiced in."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Between the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Hoth during the Galactic Civil War fought by the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the company Galladinium Galactic Exports sold the grav mills through its product catalog for 700.
