A breed of rodent, they were considered hairy, monstrous pests. They had lumpish, gray skin with tufts of spiky black hair running along their backs. They moved on four legs tipped with three-clawed paws, and had long tails and ears. Typically not much bigger than two meters, they possessed big, sharp fangs used to seize prey, and had large, yellow eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Womp rats were not timid creatures, hunting in packs and using their fangs to seize prey. When alone, a single womp rat was known to devour the garbage left by moisture farmers. They lived in the Jawa Heights region and used Beggar's Canyon as their den, alongside the more fearsome krayt dragons. The smell of dead womp rats was known to attract krayts. Nesting in the desert, womp rats sometimes gathered in swarms to attack the inhabitants of Tatooine, and while these dangerous swarms were feared, inhabitants didn't hesitate to hunt the creatures for sport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Womp rats evolved in the harsh desert climate of Tatooine, where they gathered in packs to attack locals.
