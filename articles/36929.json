Brought up in the culture of swoop bikes and becoming a successful racer himself, Dengar also led a double life as a successful bounty hunter during the Clone Wars, becoming one of the galaxy's most efficient mercenaries; his work teamed him with the likes of bounty hunters such as Boba Fett and Bossk. Dengar would eventually give up the life of bounty hunting to pursue his other passion: swoop racing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a grievous injury sustained at the hands of the smuggler Han Solo during a swoop race through Agrilat Swamp on Corellia, Dengar was rebuilt by the scientists of the Galactic Empire as an assassin, augmented by various neuro-implants and cybernetic enhancements and being void of all emotions besides rage, despair, and hope. Dengar served under the Empire until he refused to kill the Holy Children of Asrat; sensing the despair in the children, Dengar deserted his post and became a freelance gun-for hire. It was after a bounty was posted on Han Solo by the Empire that he became entangled in the Galactic Civil War, serving under the Rebel Alliance in Echo Base on Hoth with the intention of taking Solo when he had the chance. Due to a chance encounter, Dengar was among an elite group of hunters recruited by Darth Vader to capture Solo and the passengers of the Millennium Falcon shortly after the Battle of Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dengar was born on Corellia and as a young child, he worked with his father repairing and tuning swoops.

He eventually became a member of a posse of hunters consisting of Boba Fett, Bossk, Latts Razzi, C-21 Highsinger, and Oked. Dengar and company were hired to escort a hovertrain containing cargo valuable to Otua Blank, the leader of the Belugan people of Quarzite. Dengar and company prepared for the mission on Tatooine, making a last minute addition to the team: Asajj Ventress, a (unbeknownst to them) Dark Jedi who killed Oked in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dengar and company set off in the Hound's Tooth to Quarzite, where Major Rigosso transported the team to the train's subterranean loading dock via a space elevator from an orbital skyhook. Dengar, along with Ventress, were assigned to guard the rear of the train. After unsuccessfully flirting with Ventress, a team of skilled Kage Warriors boarded the train in an attempt to retrieve the cargo. Dengar managed to fight off many of the attackers due to his skilled hand-to-hand combat techniques, and even managed to kill two using sticky explosives. Dengar was eventually overwhelmed by the attackers and was thrown from the train, landing safely on the subterranean surface. Dengar and his allies, who were likewise thrown from the train, returned to the skyhook to await Ventress, who had betrayed the mission objective by swapping the cargo with Boba Fett, who was bound and gagged."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dengar was employed soon by the Hutts alongside Latts, Embo, and Sugi as protection on Nal Hutta. They were present when Darth Maul, Savage Opress, and Death Watch leader, Pre Vizsla came to ally with the Hutts. When the plan went sour, the four bounty hunters attacked, though they were pushed by the Mandalorian's flamethrower. The trio soon received reinforcements and attacked. When the battle was clearly lost, Dengar and Latts saved the beaten Embo and Sugi by covering their escape with smoke grenades.

He was constantly compared to a young swoop jockey on the private circuit named Han Solo. Eager to prove his superiority, Dengar challenged Solo to a winner-takes-all race through the crystal swamps of Agrilat. On the final stretch of the race, Solo brought his swoop down directly over and in front of Dengar, burning his face in the swoop's exhaust and locking the repulsor fins of both swoops. The maneuver sent Dengar flying off of his swoop to crash headfirst into crystalline plants. One crystalline stem directly impaled his brain, leaving him in a condition so perilous that only the Empire's doctors had the ability to repair him to a near-natural state. Dengar was kicked out of professional swoop racing for engaging in the illegal race and was abandoned by his friends on the Ferini team. Part of the Agrilat Swamp Racing Circuit eventually became known as Dengar's End, in honor of his accident. With his life in ruins, Dengar became viciously embittered with Solo, upon whom he vowed his vengeance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As it was, to save his life, Dengar was forced to become part cyborg through Imperial experimentation. The parts of his brain controlling his senses of compassion, mercy, and pity were removed, leaving him an emotionless killer. He was only left with rage, hope and, accidentally, loneliness, the only emotions the Imperial doctors decided he would need to fulfill his new duties as an assassin. Particularly, the doctors allowed him to feel hope at the empty promise that if Dengar was successful in serving the Empire, he would be returned to his old self. He was also fitted with a number of cybernetic implants, such as new, more powerfully-enhanced eyes and ears, and a drug-induced flawless memory, which left him susceptible to hallucinations. His hypothalamus gland was cut out and replaced with a central computer module to control his new systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ferini team had scattered after his accident and eventually joined up with another swoop gang on Tatooine.

These children denounced the Emperor and declared their official desire to leave the Empire. Faced with killing children or deserting the Empire, Dengar chose to leave. Despite no longer being able to feel the difference between good and evil, he still recognized the disparity when he saw it. The Empire posted a bounty for his desertion."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Return to bounty hunting"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Lethal assassin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after his desertion from Imperial service, Dengar became a bounty hunter again after learning of a price on Han Solo's head. Drawing from his vast Imperial assassin experience, he quickly came into the service of Jabba the Hutt despite a debatable record at best. Of the twenty-three bounties he'd collected, only six were taken alive. During the Galactic Civil War, he encountered Solo a number of times. Once, just before the Battle of Yavin, while searching for the Yavin Vassilika, and then twice in the year before the Battle of Hoth: once on Tatooine, when Solo attempted to reunite Jabba the Hutt with his nephew Grubba, and then again while teamed up with Boba Fett, Skorr, and Bossk in a showdown with Solo, Luke Skywalker, and the pirate Raskar on Ord Mantell. Still, Dengar was never able to capture Solo; it seemed as if Solo always got the best of him and was always one step ahead of him. Dengar often remarked to himself that all he ever saw of Solo was the aft of the Millennium Falcon as it was flying away from him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His career as a bounty hunter and assassin even saw him targeting Imperials, specifically officers of COMPNOR's Redesign efforts. Dengar believed that COMPNOR was the most evil branch of the Empire. This included COMPNOR General Sinick Kritkeen on the planet Aruza. During this mission, the Aruzans paid him a small bounty to assassinate Kritkeen in the hopes that the Empire would abandon their Redesign efforts of Aruza. There, Dengar saved an Aruzan woman named Manaroo, who would soon become an integral part of his life. At some point, he also contacted a spacer to deliver a \"message\" to pirate captain Nym on Lok."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle of Talus, Dengar was one of many bounty hunters involved in capturing Emperor's Most Wanted, individuals from a list of high-paid bounties on critical Rebel Alliance leaders. Dengar had scored a big bounty on Tatooine, and then traveled to Naboo to hand it over to the Empire. From Moenia, he made his way to the Imperial outpost at Dee'ja Peak, where he engaged in a conversation with several sneaky-looking individuals. In the midst of the conversation, they were interrupted by an arrival of several individuals in a landspeeder. They explained that they worked for Borvo the Hutt, who, reportedly, had a job for Dengar. However, Dengar was suspicious, and the individuals revealed themselves to be in fact Rebel agents looking for the location of the captured Rebel leaders. With uncanny speed, Dengar drew his blasters and started the firefight, his associates joined him immediately. However, while the Corellian bounty hunter put up a strong defense, his companions were all killed, forcing Dengar to surrender. He explained that he handed over the bounty to Imperial authorities at the outpost in Dee'ja Peak, but did not know the location where the prisoners were being held. When pressed, he added that, according to rumors, Snoova had recently delivered a bounty to the same outpost as well. The Rebels went in pursuit of the trail, while handing Dengar over to the Rebel authorities for questioning. He was later seen walking free on Nal Hutta in 2 ABY, seeking bounty hunting work from the Hutts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the planet Toola, Dengar was recruited by an unnamed woman to join the Rebel Alliance, who had taken notice of his targeting of Imperial officials. The woman secretly programmed the coordinates for an unnamed star on the farthest rim of the galaxy into his ship's navicomputer, where he found a hidden Rebel outpost. There, he was examined by military intelligence officers and accepted assignment to a newly-formed outpost on the planet Hoth.

Despite the presence of a Super Star Destroyer and a massive Imperial fleet before him, he recklessly tried to reach the planet's surface in hopes of finding Solo. His ruse of posing as an Imperial scout failed when, riding in the wake of a squadron of TIE Fighters, Dengar's ship was hit with an ion blast from the planet's surface. Drifting helplessly through space, his ship was tractored in by the Executor. His ship was boarded, Dengar was captured and, the Empire quickly realizing his identity, was imprisoned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard the Executor, Darth Vader offered him a reprieve of his death warrant, allowing him the freedom to hunt down Solo and the Millennium Falcon. Disgusted with the fleet's inability to capture the fugitive ship, Vader then recruited Dengar and five other bounty hunters to bring him the passengers of the Falcon, possibly believing Luke Skywalker was one of them. By this time, his bounty hunting record was still unimpressive. He had yet to claim one remarkable bounty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While searching for Solo in the Hoth asteroid field, the engines of the Punishing One were crippled by a bomb placed by Boba Fett, who may have heard of Dengar's death warrant, only to leave Dengar helplessly watching the Millennium Falcon slowly limp out of the system followed closely by the Slave I. He managed to repair his craft and followed Solo's particle vapor trail to Bespin's Cloud City, where he arrived a few days later, again, to see the Slave I leaving the city with the carbonite frozen Han Solo on board. However, it was on Cloud City that Dengar was reunited with Manaroo, where he saved her and several other dancers, for a time, from the Imperial subjugation of the city. The woman would soon become a permanent part of his life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Manaroo accompanying him away from Cloud City, the Aruzan woman, pitying Dengar's near-emotionless state, tried to share her own feelings with him through her Attanni, an Aruzan custom in which two people shared emotions cybernetically. Dengar was able to feel what it was to be Human again, feeling what she felt and seeing what she saw. It was from this emotional experience that Dengar was finally able to work with the Rebel Alliance by assisting in the evacuation of the Aruzans from their world, freeing them of their Imperial tormentors. Dengar's primary interest in the matter was to free Manaroo's parents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during 3 ABY, a contract had Dengar teaming up with fellow bounty-hunters 4-LOM, IG-88, Bossk, and Zuckuss on a mission for Domina Tagge to steal a sacred gem from a temple in the Red Nebula."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, Dengar had a run in with Princess Leia who was searching for information about the location of Solo.

He witnessed Jabba's ruthlessness when killing Oola, his Twi'lek dancer. Quickly, he formulated a plot with few other members of Jabba's entourage, which Jabba himself soon discovered. The Hutt tasked Boba Fett with personally taking care of Dengar, with the stipulation that he died a painful death by way of the Teeth of Tatooine in the Valley of the Winds. The night before Jabba was to execute Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca at the Great Pit of Carkoon, Fett drugged Dengar and left him at the mercy of Tatooine's elements. Surprisingly, for the second time, Boba Fett had done Dengar a favor, so to speak. Although he left Dengar to die, he allowed him to remain with his armor strapped on, which effectively saved him from the brutally harsh winds until he was saved by Manaroo. Dengar realized that for the second time, Fett refrained from killing him, the first being when he merely disabled the Punishing One near the Hoth asteroid field instead of destroying it and Dengar outright. Still, he vowed to make Fett pay."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Life after 4 ABY"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being rescued by Manaroo, the two agreed to be married. Dengar recovered from his wounds after several weeks in Mos Eisley, racking up enormous medical bills. It was then that he realized that few people were aware that Jabba had died at the Pit of Carkoon. He traveled with Manaroo to the site of the Hutt's death hoping to salvage valuable goods, only to find a badly burned and scarred man on the brink of death, who had apparently killed the Sarlacc. He discovered that this broken man was Boba Fett, having survived from being swallowed by the Sarlacc. With Dengar's newly found compassion, sourced from Manaroo's Attanni device, he nursed Fett back to health. Dengar, Fett, and Kateel of Kuhlvult then survived to a bombing run on the Great Pit of Carkoon arranged by Kuat of Kuat, the leader of Kuat Drive Yards. This unlikely partnership then led Fett and Dengar on a mission to foil what was believed to be Prince Xizor's complicated plan to destroy the Bounty Hunters' Guild. To achieve this the pair had to kidnap the powerful Kuat of Kuat.

However Jodo Kast, whom Dengar believed to be the feared Boba Fett, had arrived first. Dengar entered to see Kast dangling from a spiked pit. Dengar blasted the computer controls to the trapdoor that dropped into the pit, saving Kast's life. Kast responded by pointing a blaster at Dengar and taking the bounty for himself. Realizing that Boba Fett wouldn't have made nearly as many mistakes or threatened to shoot the man that saved his life, Dengar contacted Fett, making him aware of Kast's posturing. Dengar accompanied Fett to Paqualis III where Fett disguised himself as \"Sava Brec Madak\" and approached the House Benelex bounty hunters' guild to hire Kast. According to \"Madak,\" a man called Satnik Hiicrop had stolen his name and reputation; Hiicrop, \"Madak\" said, could be found in a clan keep on Nal Hutta, and he wanted Kast to bring him in.
