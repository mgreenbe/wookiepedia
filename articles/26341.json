The sector had an additional 40,000 settled dependencies and 300,000,000 barren stars and even in such a sparsely populated sector, a thorough home constituency tour for the local Senator could take a lifetime. During the reign of Emperor Palpatine, the Chommell sector was governed by Moff Quarsh Panaka, a long-time associate of Palpatine, and represented by Jar Jar Binks and later Pooja Naberrie in the Imperial Senate and Boma in the New Republic Senate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some sources use an alternate spelling of Chommel.
