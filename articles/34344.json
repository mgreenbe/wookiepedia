Shortly thereafter, Marek apparently released a dark side burst when he sacrificed himself in his battle against Darth Sidious, although his body was left behind. Six years later, Sidious released a massive surge of blue dark side energy after being thrown down a reactor core shaft aboard the second Death Star. Later on the planet Ruusan, Jerec's body dissipated after he was killed by Kyle Katarn. In 8 ABY, the Nightsister Ocheron gave off a burst of dark energy after being beheaded by Luke Skywalker. One year later, at 9 ABY, Joruus C'baoth also released a blast of energy after being killed by Mara Jade with Skywalker's lightsaber, blowing a gaping hole in the side of Mount Tantiss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Traya appears to release a dark side burst in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, when the Exile throws her off of Trayus Core into a bottomless pit.
