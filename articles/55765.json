Due to his poor treatment of his clients and his illegal weaponry, Rainstealer earned the enmity of the Galactic Empire, the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the Hutt Cartel, Black Sun, and a Whiphid crime lord named Valarian. Due to the fact that these factions either wanted his work or wanted him dead, Rainstealer attempted to hide in the city of Narmle on Rori, a moon of the planet Naboo. However, at one point after the Battle of Yavin during the Galactic Civil War, Rainstealer was approached by a spacer who wanted him to produce a special weapon. Eventually Rainstealer consented and sent the spacer to procure the ingredients, which he used to produce several Zicx-bug bombs in order to keep that individual from speaking openly about him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male individual, Goru Rainstealer was a skilled weapons designer who created weapons such as the Zicx-bug bomb, which was a grenade-like weapon made from live Zicx bugs suspended in sarlacc bile. At some point during his life, Rainstealer's poor treatment of his clients angered both the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire, the two major factions in the Galactic Civil War. His creation, the Zicx-bug bomb, was made illegal by the Empire and was viewed as a repulsive weapon by the Alliance. However, various criminal factions, such as the Hutt Cartel and Black Sun, wanted to obtain the weapon from Rainstealer. Altogether, Rainstealer's treatment of his clients resulted in both the Empire and Alliance wanting him killed, while the Hutts, Black Sun, and a Whiphid crime lord named Valarian also wanted him dead. At some point after the Battle of Yavin during the Galactic Civil War, Rainstealer was living in Narmle, a city on Rori, a moon of the planet Naboo. There, Rainstealer lived in fear that someone who he had angered or who wanted his work would come and kill him. Rainstealer's status as a disgraced weapons designer was known to at least one individual, who was overheard by a spacer while talking about Rainstealer and the Zicx-bug bomb in a cantina in Narmle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Rainstealer was living in Narmle, the spacer approached him with a request for a special weapon. Although Rainstealer was at first afraid the spacer was an assassin sent to kill him, the individual soon extinguished those fears. Rainstealer agreed to provide the individual with a Zicx-bug bomb, under the condition that the spacer keep quiet about Rainstealer's whereabouts. Although Rainstealer still had the casings for the weapons, he needed the spacer to bring him Zicx bugs and sarlacc bile for the weapon's active ingredients, which were only found on the planet Tatooine. To gain access to these items, he gave the spacer his calling card and sent the individual to a friend, a xenobiologist named Jowir Ar'Lensa. Ar'Lensa helped the spacer acquire the necessary ingredients, at which point the spacer returned to Rainstealer in Narmle. Now that he had the needed components, Rainstealer upheld his side of the deal and built five bug bombs for the spacer. After building the bombs, he made it clear that he would not agree to make anything else, and due to his fear of assassins, Rainstealer reminded the spacer to keep his location secret."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Goru Rainstealer was a skilled weapons designer, believed by some to be the only individual capable of constructing the illegal Zicx-bug bomb. During what he termed his youth, Rainstealer treated his clients in an unethical manner that angered various powerful organizations to the point where they wanted to kill him. However, while his weapons were viewed as unethical by the Empire and Alliance, they attracted the interest and envy of both Black Sun and the Hutts. The animosity from these organizations caused Rainstealer to live in fear of being attacked and killed by individuals working for them. He had a friend named Jowir Ar'Lensa, who was willing to help the individual that Rainstealer sent to him. Rainstealer had a large amount of knowledge about Zicx-bugs and had a high opinion of the bomb he made from them. His creation, the Zicx-bug bomb, was viewed as an infamous weapon that was more trouble than anyone wanted to deal with."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he offered to build Zicx-bug bombs for the spacer, Rainstealer cautioned the individual to never mention him to anyone else due to his fear of the organizations he had angered. Upon the completion of the bug bombs, Rainstealer told the spacer that he could not make any more of the weapon, out of fear that he would be discovered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Goru Rainstealer was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Rainstealer was located in the city of Narmle on Rori, where he would give players a quest to obtain ingredients for the Zicx-bug bomb. This required that the player go to Tatooine in order to work for Jowir Ar'Lensa in a settlement called Wayfar. After obtaining Valarian spice for Ar'Lensa, the player was awarded with a jar of Zicx bugs. The player then had to embark on a quest for a woman named Palu, which involved the player rescuing Palu's sister, Feinu. Completion of this quest yielded a protective coverall, allowing players to approach the sarlacc inside of the Great Pit of Carkoon unharmed. After extracting the bile, the player then needed to return to Rainstealer in order to receive five Zicx-bug bombs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Goru Rainstealer was also mentioned in the \"10 Hot Spots Travel Guide\", an article on the game's website written by Michael Farone that featured an anonymous quote about Rainstealer and the bug bomb quest. In the \"10 Hot Spots Travel Guide\" article, Rainstealer appeared as a male Bith, but Rainstealer was later given a permanent Human male appearance in the game. Because the Galaxies feature is an official source, it cannot be concluded with absolute certainty whether Rainstealer was a Bith or Human. Although the player could choose not to do Rainstealer's quest, this article assumes 100 percent game completion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
