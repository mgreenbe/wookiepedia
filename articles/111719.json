In 1 BBY, Ransom commented on the entry for the LE-VO law enforcement droid, citing it was almost a pleasure to confront them because their programming meant they never shot to kill. In 0 ABY, commenting on the entry for the Class I Defense Droid, Ransom relayed information that the Corporate Sector Authority had deployed several Class Is against of the few remaining Trianii spaceports. In 1 ABY, Ransom commented on the entry for the FLR-series Logger Droid, complaining that the problem with the droid was that Industrial Automaton made them too user-friendly. The result was a droid that took forever to program since the unit would constantly check if the user's commands were really what they wanted to program into the droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
