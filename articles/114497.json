The sails were woven with a network of tiny repulsorlift generators, which turned their anti-gravity fields perpendicular to the field of gravity. This caused pressure on the sails that was similar to the forces of wind, allowing a vessel to move about on the water without natural winds. This kind of technology was used to propel gondola skimmersubs when on the surface of the seas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
