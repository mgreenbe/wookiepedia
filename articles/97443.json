Nar Shaddaa was seen as an attractive site for employment by Nikto enforcers seeking masters amongst the Hutt Cartel. This previously-unnamed region was originally a location where Nikto warriors arrived, but was only formally named for them when Horoth Gendi saved his Hutt master's life and business through quick-thinking bloodshed. As a result, the Nikto Sector was bequeathed to the Nikto warrior as a reward for his actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterward, Gendi used the opportunity to found his own gang and eventually freed himself from a life of servitude to higher powers. Since that time, the Nikto Sector became an area of Nar Shaddaa that fell under the control of a succession of Nikto gangs that sought the biggest part of the planet's underworld business. Amongst the latest of these during the Cold War was the formidable Kintan Kings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
