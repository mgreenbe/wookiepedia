The Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster first tasted the berries while trading furbogs on the Corellian Run, eating them daily. One of his preferred methods of ingesting them was in a zoochberry cobbler. Jettster later served cobblers at his diner on the planet Coruscant, which operated until being destroyed during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's reign. Jettster described the cobblers as \"fine\" in his menu, where he charged 2.7 credits for the dish and a total of 5.7 credits to serve it with a scoop of Denta bean ice cream."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zoochberry cobbler was mentioned in \"Dining at Dex's,\" a 2009 Hyperspace-exclusive article written by Gregory Walker and formatted as an in-universe menu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
