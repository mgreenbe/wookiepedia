In retaliation against the strike team's presence, Geonosian warriors and Confederate battle droids attacked the Jedi, sparking the Battle of Geonosis, the opening engagement of the Clone Wars. Eekin fought on the upper half of the arena's tribune, but his power to manipulate minds proved ineffective against the battle droids, and the Klatooinian perished in the fight.
