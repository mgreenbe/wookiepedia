The Tribe quickly dominated the native Keshiri species, who believed the newcomers to be their gods. Sith Captain Yaru Korsin became Grand Lord of the Tribe and of the Keshiri, a title that was passed on to his daughter, Nida, after his death. Isolated from the outer galaxy for years, the Sith built a Temple in the Takara Mountains over the Omen's crash site and moved their headquarters to the capital city Tahv. Although the original Tribe consisted of several members of both the Human and Sith species, Yaru Korsin ordered a purge of all members of the latter in 4985 BBY. Over time, the Sith formed a ruling Circle of Lords, made up of Lords and High Lords, and ruled by the Grand Lord. Although one Jedi Knight, Jelph Marrian, discovered the Sith in 3963 BBY, the destruction of his strikefighter permanently stranded him on the world as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith remained isolated for millennia, largely unaware of the state of the galaxy and the Sith, but after the end of the Second Galactic Civil War in 41 ABY, the Sith Meditation Sphere Ship found the Tribe.

Ship assisted the Tribe in traveling offworld and forming a new armada, and two years later, the Tribe felt the presence of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker in the Force and determined to kill him. However, Ship was suddenly overcome by the will of Abeloth, a dark side entity living in the Maw, and deserted Kesh for Abeloth's world. The Sith quickly launched a strike team to recover Ship and assassinate Skywalker. The team encountered Abeloth in the Maw, and she weakened the strike team before allowing Ship to return to them so that they could continue on their mission. Their attack on the Jedi failed, however, and Skywalker and his son Ben tracked Vestara Khai, the team's sole surviving member, to the planet Dathomir. There, a team led by Viun Gaalan captured a group of the darksider Nightsisters and dueled with the Skywalkers while attempting to retrieve Khai, although again the Sith were defeated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly afterward, a fleet led by High Lord Sarasu Taalon convinced the Jedi to form an alliance against Abeloth, who was causing a psychosis among the Jedi Knights.

Abeloth was defeated, and the Jedi and Sith temporarily repaired their alliance in order to learn more about her origins.

The Sith soon evacuated the crash site, which was located in the midst of the Cetajan Mountains. However, the Omen's captain, Yaru Korsin, returned to the crash site to try to send a transmission in the hopes of being rescued. However, his half-brother, Devore, was already there, and insisted that since they had failed Sadow's orders, they would be killed.

With the aid of Vaal, Korsin tricked the natives into believing that the survivors were the Skyborn, the legendary gods of the Keshiri. Korsin was proclaimed as the Grand Lord of the Skyborn, and the Sith began to mine for the metals needed to repair their vessel, although Vaal knew that the metals needed to repair the Omen\u2014if they existed on Kesh at all\u2014would be buried deep beneath the planet's surface. Indeed, the appropriate metals were never found, and the materials needed to upkeep many of the Sith's technologically advanced equipment were unattainable on Kesh.

Unbeknownst to any of the other Sith, Seelah Korsin\u2014the widowed wife of Devore Korsin who had since remarried to Yaru Korsin\u2014ensured the deaths of all of the Red Sith offspring in hopes of making the Tribe purely of a Human bloodline. Meanwhile, the surviving Red Sith\u2014who had taken the moniker the \"Fifty-Seven\"\u2014feared that their inability to reproduce was due to Kesh itself, and thus pushed for the Tribe to work toward finding a way to leave Kesh. To that end, fifteen years after the Omen's crash landing, when Grand Lord Korsin gave the spokesperson for the Red Sith, Ravilan, the assignment of examining eight Keshiri villages along the Ragnos Lakes, Ravilan decided to poison the Keshiri. He had recently discovered that cyanogen silicate\u2014a cauterizing agent that had been used by the Massassi aboard the Omen\u2014was deadly to touch for the Keshiri, but had no adverse effects on the Red Sith. Ravilan and the other Red Sith traveled first to Tetsubal, the village farthest from the Sith Temple in the Mountains, where Ravilan introduced the cyanogen silicate into the town's aqueduct systems.

As the Grand Lord recalled all Sith in the Tribe to the Takara Mountains and sent out reconnaissance fliers to see if the plague had spread, Seelah Korsin\u2014who had discovered Ravilan's treachery\u2014decided to use the cyanogen silicate to her own political advantage. She introduced the silicate first to the village Rabolow, and then to more and more of the villages on the Ragnos Lakes. She then persuaded her husband that it was Ravilan and the Red Sith who were spreading the plague. Convinced that they were plotting against him, Yaru Korsin ordered for a purge of all of the Red Sith on Kesh. Taken completely by surprise, the Red Sith were quickly hunted down and wiped out; the Grand Lord and his chief lieutenants soon cornered the last surviving members of the species at the precipice where the Omen had crashed, and those who surrendered were thrown off the cliff to their deaths. Ravilan, the last surviving member of his species, was soon after captured by Seelah Korsin and tortured. She confirmed that she had seen to the deaths of all of the Red Sith babies, and that she was behind the poisoning of the Keshiri towns and the Red Sith massacre. She then had Jariad\u2014her son from her marriage with Devore\u2014kill Ravilan. However, Seelah herself had played into the hands of Adari Vaal, who had begun to lead an underground resistance movement to rid the Sith from Kesh\u2014Vaal felt responsible for her species' subjugation fifteen years earlier, and desired to personally remove the Tribe from her homeworld.

The fact that Sadow had not found them after twenty-five years and that the planet did not have the materials required to repair the Omen led Korsin to resign himself to the belief that the Sith could never leave Kesh. This was why the Sith had left their Temple in the Takara Mountains to settle more comfortably into Tahv, which had become the Sith capital. Furthermore, in a population which counted at this time nearly six hundreds Sith, Korsin had hierarchized the commandment of the Tribe, founding the Circle of Lords, which was filled with the High Lords and Sith Lords that the Grand Lord had appointed, while Tahv structures were reorganized to accommodate the new institutions. The eugenics programs of Seelah Korsin had also introduced in a tribe now exclusively human, with the exception of the old Houk Gloyd, a worship for racial purity and physical perfection. Meanwhile, the Tribe continued to dominate the Keshiri; the native species was not allowed to ride uvak\u2014a reptavian species that had been domesticated and used for travel on Kesh for millennia\u2014and the majority of the natives still worshiped the Sith as their gods.

Unfortunately for Seelah and Jariad, if Korsin had not planned the rebellion of Adari, the Grand Lord saw through their intrigues and had secretly prepared Nida to succeed him. In fact, unbeknownst to Seelah who only saw Nida as a means for her and Jariad to stay close to the Grand Lord, Yaru Korsin had staged the death of some of his most trusted Sith so that they could train Nida in the dark side of the Force, while the function of Sith ambassador to the Keshiri, imagined by Seelah to keep her daughter away, had allowed Nida to form a network of influence among both Keshiri as well as among the Sith faithful to her father.
