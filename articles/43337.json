One such example was Chiss Defense Force warships such as the Springhawk, although electrostatic barriers were also employed by the Paataatus Hiveborn and the Nikardun Destiny."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the attack on the Paataatus, Ufsa'mak'ro supervised checks on the Springhawk's electrostatic barrier. Although similar in purpose to the shields used by the Galactic Republic, electrostatic barriers were much weaker. This led Mitth'raw'nuruodo to seek out a so-called \"Republic energy shield\" for his people during his mission to Batuu during the Clone Wars. During the battle over Primea, Nikardun General Yiv the Benevolent attacked Thrawn's Springhawk, expecting the cruiser to only be protected by an electrostatic barrier. However, the Springhawk was outfitted with the much stronger Republic energy shield, helping the Chiss Ascendancy win the battle and end the Nikardun conquests."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
