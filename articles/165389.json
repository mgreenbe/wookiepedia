He soon tracked X1's forces to the planet Dathomir, where X1 possessed a base, and arrived there with Grey Squadron, landing in a swamp in order to avoid detection by the heavy security of X1's base. On the surface of the planet, X2 sensed that X1 had been working on something important inside the base. He and Grey Squadron took speeder bikes to X1's base, where X2's Force sense ability told him that the place resonated with the dark side, although it did not feel like X1. At this moment, he was attacked by a lightsaber-wielding woman, whom X2 recognized as a member of the Nightsisters clan of the Dathomiri Witches. He defeated her, but more Nightsisters appeared, attacking Grey Squadron. X2 rescued his unit and was informed by them that the Nightsisters had been trying to break into the base. X2 went inside, telling his men to wait for him at the entrance because he sensed something very powerful and dark in the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Entering his brother's lair, X2 was confronted by the Nightsister Matriarch, who was riding a rancor. After a battle with them, he killed the rancor, and ultimately, the Matriarch herself.

X2 realized that his brother had left the base and the Nightsisters had since overrun it. In order to retrieve any important data, he broke into X1's office. Locating the main computer, X2 called Shara to help him recover the data from there. Once the mission was completed, the two returned to the landing pad to meet with Grey Squadron, only to find the place completely devastated; an Imperial had infiltrated it and planted detonation packs on Grey Squadron's X-wings. Many members of the unit had died, including Tavoy, Watkins, and Ryder, but the saboteur was captured. X2 tried to interrogate him about X1's plans using a mind trick, but the man had been trained to resist such methods and did not tell anything. Angered, X2 slipped into the dark side and Force-choked the Imperial, but was then calmed down by Shara and regretted his actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Realizing that the Empire was aware of their presence on Dathomir, the remainder of Grey Squadron took the ships that were left intact and tried to escape from the planet. However, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer had already arrived there, and fighting ensued. X2 destroyed the ship's turrets, and Shara told him that they would now be able to escape. Still emotionally shaken by the loss of his men, however, X2 decided not to run from the Empire anymore and was determined to destroy the Star Destroyer. He wiped out the vessel's TIE fighter escort and made an attack run on the bridge, placing a shot at the bridge that started a chain reaction and destroyed the entire ship. X2 and the remaining pilots of Grey Squadron escaped from the planet and informed the New Republic command of what had transpired on Dathomir."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Showdown"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, X2 discovered that X1 had proclaimed himself as a Sith Lord and sought to learn the secrets of the dark side. To this end, he had traveled to the planet Vjun and had occupied Bast Castle, the former residence of the late Darth Vader. X2 was determined to prevent X1 from learning too much from Vader's castle and set off there, guided by Skywalker via comlink. Arriving at the planet, he took out a network of security satellites in space in order to avoid detection. Hoping to learn more about X1's operation on the planet, X2 boarded an Imperial-class Star Destroyer in orbit and sliced its mainframe. The ship's log indicated that X1 had already left the planet, but also that he had left a Sith holocron inside the castle. Skywalker hoped to determine X1's location by analyzing that holocron. After reaching the planet's surface and dealing with a starfighter garrison, X2 infiltrated Bast Castle. Inside, he was forced to fight against droid bodyguards that the late Vader had used for sparring. While inside the castle, X2 also received intelligence from Skywalker, who told him that X1 had been keeping Falon Grey's lightsaber in Vader's trophy room. X2 reached it and retrieved the weapon. He then proceeded to Vader's meditation chamber, obtained the holocron, and escaped on a TIE bomber before more droids could arrive. The data on the holocron helped track X1 to Mustafar.

Reaching the space above the planet, X2 infiltrated an orbiting Star Destroyer, trying to find some information about Skywalker's location. Aboard the ship, he again met X1, corrupted and disfigured by the dark side. After a duel, X1 retreated to the planet's surface, taking a TIE Advanced x1. X2 followed him, taunted by his brother. On the surface, he rejoined with Grey Squadron inside the crust of a wrecked Venator-class Star Destroyer, from which they began to make raids onto the Imperial positions. X2 assisted his men, taking down a deflector shield and allowing a Y-wing to bombard X1's defenses. Soon, X2 met X1 inside one of the buildings. After yet another duel, X1 retreated, but not before releasing a swarm of cloned Wookiees, a result of his cloning experiments, upon X2."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "X2 killed all of the attackers and pursued X1 all the way to a mining platform. After a final battle, X2 managed to overpower X1; the latter asked his brother to kill him, but X2, abiding by the Jedi Code, refused to do so. Then, in a final act, X1 manipulated his dropped lightsaber with the Force to kill X2. X2 jumped over the lightsaber, causing X1 to be impaled by his own blade. With the lightsaber in his chest, X1 stepped back over the edge and fell down into a lava river to his death. The battle was won, and Skywalker was liberated.

Unlike his brother, who openly spoke out against the Jedi's pacifist views, X2 supported the Order's stance. He was loyal to the government he served too, as long as his loyalty did not contradict his moral qualities. On Cato Neimoidia, he executed Order 66 and remained to serve the Empire; though he was disturbed by his actions during this time and deeply regretted them, he was persuaded by X1 to follow orders and continue his service. X2 found his murder of Ferroda to be a terrible act and regretted not having the Jedi Master around when he needed his advice. However, on Dantooine, X2 could not follow X1's orders to kill innocent people and defected from the Empire. After joining with his father on the surface of the planet, he confessed the things he had done and gladly accepted Grey's offer to seek out redemption together. After Grey was killed, X2 distanced himself from the politics of the galaxy and chose the life of a farmer.

Despite this, he did not want to assume a leadership position, preferring to be just one of the many soldiers serving the Alliance. It was only due to Kota's words that he agreed to become the leader of Grey Squadron. As Kota became a mentor of sorts to X2, the latter came to trust the veteran General's judgment completely, willing to accept the former bounty hunter Shara on his recommendation without questions. Eventually, X2 came to be considered to be a respected figure in the Alliance. After he discovered the Force in him and witnessed X1 using it for evil, he began to question whether he should use his abilities to help the Rebellion, still viewing himself as a soldier and being afraid to slip into the dark side like his brother. However, X2 was eventually convinced by Skywalker\u2014who thought very highly of his accomplishments\u2014to accept the title of Jedi Knight, telling him that facing the dark side was a test every Jedi had to endure. X2 faced such a test on Dathomir, when he, wishing to avenge his fallen men, stepped into the dark, Force-choked the Imperial infiltrator, and destroyed a Star Destroyer.

His Force sense ability was also well-developed, as he was able to sense a dark side presence on Dathomir and could distinguish it from his brother's presence. Later, during the same mission, he sensed the Nightsister Matriarch's aura inside the abandoned base. On Dathomir, however, X2 also allowed his anger to take control of him and Force-choked the Imperial saboteur, although he was able to restrain himself immediately after the incident. In addition to his Force powers, X2 was proficient with a wide variety of weapons, from melee weapons like staffs, to blasters and sniper rifles, rocket launchers, and ground- and starship-based weapon emplacements.
