Leading a small fleet, the cruiser emerged from hyperspace above the shipyard and, before the Imperials could react, bombarded the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Dauntless with several blasts from its ion cannons, disabling the Imperial warship and leaving it unable to detach from the station. However, agents of Inferno Squad were able to repel the rebel starfighters and boarding craft and in turn boarded the cruiser itself, where they proceeded to disable its ion batteries from within. Unable to fire back, the cruiser was then helplessly struck by a heavy barrage from the newly freed Dauntless, leaving it heavily damaged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
