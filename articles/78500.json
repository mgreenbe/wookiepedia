She was a huge sow at nearly two meters in height and weighing over two hundred kilograms. She wore her long green-brown hair in braids and was covered with a large number of morrts.

Kufbrug and Guth were in love. When Vrokk died and Guth was framed and expected to be killed, Kufbrug fell into a depression. This was lifted when Callista recruited her for help with the kheilwar that had killed Vrokk. The pair fought the insect for an entire night before killing it, clearing Guth's name. Kufbrug and Guth were then married."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kufbrug was particularly intelligent for an unmodified Gamorrean, able to puzzle out forgery and think of contingencies, to the surprise of Callista Ming.
