The largest of the system's three suns was an R-class star. It contained the planet Hetzal Prime and its two inhabited moons, the Fruited and the Rooted, with a population of forty billion in total. The system also contained some frozen rocky planets and gas giants. The inhabited worlds in the system were heavily involved in agricultural efforts, but some mining rigs existed in space. During the High Republic Era, the system was threatened by the Great Hyperspace Disaster, in which fragments of the freighter Legacy Run exited hyperspace and threatened to obliterate the system's population."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
