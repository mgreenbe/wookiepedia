They were spider-like animals that could be kept inside glass tubes.

However, Yus' loyalty to the Qrephs wavered during the mission, and she failed to deploy the creatures. When a firefight broke out at the casino when the Qrephs' agent, Mirta Gev attempted to take Solo into custody, the arachnokillers were released. When a Gran patron slammed a glass onto one of the arachnids, it exploded in a bright white explosion, incinerating the Gran. Calrissian fired a blaster at the remaining arachnokillers, causing the creatures to explode and destroy the casino, allowing Gev to take Solo captive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
