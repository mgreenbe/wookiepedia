During the New Republic's push toward the Galactic Empire's capital world of Coruscant, Admiral Gial Ackbar sent Admiral Nammo and elements of the New Republic Third Battle Group to seize Bilbringi. Nammo was defeated by Admiral Teren Rogriss and the 181st Imperial Fighter Group, led by Major Turr Phennir.
