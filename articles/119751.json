He rose to become the leader of the group, a position known as the Kursk, and became one of its strongest members. Whilst head of the group he felt that the cult was too small in size, and introduced a new rule allowing non-Force sensitive individuals to join to boost numbers. This broke tradition running back to the founding of the group after the Seventh Battle of Ruusan by the Dark Jedi Vulta Daanat. The new troops quickly filled out the Blackguard's ranks and soon became the most visible part of the faction, leading many who encountered the group to believe they were simply a paramilitary organization rather than a Force-using cult."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY a Sullustan archaeologist named Mi Fon Lu wished to research within the Southern Jedi Ruins in which the Blackguard made their home.
