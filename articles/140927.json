The process in which it was made was simple, involving the addition of certain exotic plant-leaves to boiling water, the heat of the water leaching the properties of the leaves, giving the tea flavor. Occasionally milk or sugar were added, either to lessen the heat, or to curb the flavor slightly, or to sweeten it. Some found this unpleasant. Crumpets were sometimes served with tea. Tea could also be paired with biscuits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tea was normally drank from a mug or thermajug."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine and Wedge Antilles were known to enjoy drinking tea."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
