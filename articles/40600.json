In the paper, Herrera and Reston argued that droids deserved the same rights as those granted to sentience beings, and they recommended that all droids should be freed from their owners and that involuntary droid memory wipes should be made illegal. Herrera and Reston sent copies of the paper to every news agency and government office in the Cularin system, and the reporter Yara Grugara subsequently interviewed them about the paper for the HoloNet program Eye on Cularin. The Jedi Knight Tam Azur-Jamin later considered the paper to be a pioneering development in the study of the rights of droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
