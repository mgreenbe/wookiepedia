A native of Neutra Four, Torlent joined the Rebels after the Galactic Empire seized his homeworld. Shortly after the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, Torlent was aboard his ship when it was attacked by 13-K, an augmented Infiltrator probe droid sent by Imperial Admiral Damon Krell to seize the vessel and use it to decimate the Rebel fleet. Torlent played dead as 13-K moved through the ship, methodically killing his comrades, before making a break for the ship's communications terminal to warn Rebel leadership. Unfortunately for Torlent, the terminal was located in the room 13-K had made its destination, and the probe droid killed him moments before he could send his crucial message."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rad Torlent first appeared in Star Wars 45, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1980.
