Due to his genetic mutations, he appeared leaner, fairer, and younger than his fellow clone troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tech served as the brains of his squad and was a valued asset in this regard, using his high intellect and mastery of technology to ensure their operations were successful. Even so, he was no less skilled in combat than the other three members."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tech was part of Clone Force 99, an elite squad of clone commandos with genetically engineered enhanced abilities. Tech had an aptitude for science and had incredible skills with technology, including engineering, decryption, and language translation. His appearance differed from that of normal clones of Jango Fett in that he appeared younger, leaner, and lighter-skinned than his genetic template."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tech and the rest of Clone Force 99 were on Kaller when Order 66 was issued. However, his inhibitor chip failed to activate properly, and Tech did not participate in the Great Jedi Purge. Shortly after Order 66, Tech and his fellow clones returned to Kamino, where they learned with the rest of the galaxy that the Galactic Republic was being reformed into the Galactic Empire. After meeting a female clone named Omega, Tech and the rest of Clone Force 99, with the exception of CT-9904 \"Crosshair,\" fled Kamino against orders, becoming fugitives from the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tech made use of a heavily modified suit of scout trooper armor[source?] with a specialized visor that acted as a computer display. A computer terminal was installed into the forearm portion of his armor, enabling him to access a number of versatile functions, such as trajectory calculation, translation of alien languages, and recording and replaying sound effects. Tech's advanced data analysis skills allowed him to solve technical issues at speeds even faster than some droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Personality-wise, Tech was very talkative and communicative; one of his major quirks was his eagerness to dispense trivial knowledge about any given subject without hesitation or reason. When confronted with a task which demanded his full concentration, he tended to become oblivious to what was going on in his surroundings, unless it was a matter of life and death. Tech could often miss the intention behind a question someone asked him, such as when Omega asked him what the Clone Wars were like."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He also made an effort of recording all sentient sounds he encountered, that at one occasion helped the squad, alongside Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, CT-7567 \"Rex,\" and CT-1409 \"Echo\" escape from an enemy base. Tech was also very non-confrontational. When his squad-mates would argue with each other, he would frequently walk away and not participate. Much like Hunter and unlike his other two teammates, Tech was mostly civil and respectful to his fellow clones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tech's primary weapons were two DC-17 hand blasters, with which he was very proficient, and during a mission in Corellia he carried a DC-15A blaster carbine. He wore modified Katarn-class Commando Armor with a unique helmet. The helmet was equipped with a translation visor that was capable of translating various languages."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "George Lucas had a very specific vision of the Bad Batch, in that he wanted a version of The Dirty Dozen with clones. Dave Filoni sketched their appearances which Brent Friedman and Matt Michnovetz used to imagine the Bad Batch's voices and personalities. Matt and Brent worked with Dave to flesh out the characters and their story."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tech was to appear in a four episode arc written by Michnovetz which starred the Bad Batch, now including \"Echo,\" alongside Yoda on Kashyyyk. At the \"Untold Clone Wars\" panel at Celebration Anaheim, Dave Filoni talked about the plot of the arc. He revealed that the characters would ride on \"giant ape lizards,\" that were holy to the Wookiees in a religious way. In one scene Tarfful would ask the tree spirits for permission to go into battle against the enemy, which was a Trandoshan and the Separatist Alliance. To get the enemy out of some of their cities they would have to burn some of the trees. The Clones had no problem with it, but it was upsetting to the Wookiees. A part of the arc would be about the Clones and the Wookiees finding a common ground to fight the Separatists. A story reel clip was shown at the panel, which showed the Bad Batch and other Wookiees riding on the \"ape lizards\" and battle against kinraths from the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
