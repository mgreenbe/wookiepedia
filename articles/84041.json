Decorative permacrete blocks that also served as flower beds were placed around the square's perimeter, while a statue of the ancient Anarrian hero Lunaara was situated in the center of the meeting place. At some point during galactic history, a group of spacers traveled to Lunaara Square in search of Dilta, an Anarrian child whom they had been falsely accused of kidnapping, and a local security team attacked the agents in the square."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
