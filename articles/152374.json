Both creatures could fly and carry smaller beings. The blue-skinned creature appeared to eat other beings.

They believed that their \"savior unborn\" dwelled inside the Cr\u00e8che egg. Following Operation: Sabre Strike, the Resistance starfighter pilot Poe Dameron traveled to the cave to ask about the whereabouts of the explorer Lor San Tekka, who was believed to know where Luke Skywalker had gone. The First Order agent Terex pursued Poe and ordered his flametroopers to torch the egg in order to intimidate Poe and the Cr\u00e8che."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cr\u00e8che egg ultimately cracked and released a large blue winged creature. The Cr\u00e8che elder and her followers initially mistook the creature for their savior. However, it proved hostile and attacked the Cr\u00e8che and Terex's stormtroopers. The stormtroopers' blasters were unable to penetrate its thick skin. The creature tried to devour the Cr\u00e8che elder but was punched in the jaw by a black winged creature with red eyes. The two creatures fought. The stormtroopers' blaster bolts only caused them to grow bigger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, they broke through the roof of the cafe, interrupting a dogfight between Poe's Black Squadron and Terex's TIE/fo space superiority fighters. The black winged creature ultimately gained the upper hand over the blue winged creature and fired a red beam from its mouth, killing the latter. The black winged creature glistened from the red beam it had fired. Following the defeat of the First Order forces, the creature returned to the cave and knelt on a terrace. The grateful Cr\u00e8che regarded the creature as their savior and climbed on its back. The Cr\u00e8che followed the creature to their new home. Meanwhile, Poe's Black Squadron left and radioed for Terex's Maxima-A class heavy cruiser Ravenous to pick up Terex and his surviving men."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cr\u00e8che creatures first appeared in the 2016 Marvel Comics issue Poe Dameron 3, written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Phil Noto."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
