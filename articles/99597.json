They supplied pilots and mechanics, like Team Fireball, with ship parts of various quality. They also sponsored Hype Fazon and his ship, Green Ace. Flix and Orka were assisted in their job by G-LN, a pit droid. Each partner focused on an aspect of their operation: Orka did the bartering, while Flix took care of book-keeping. The shop had a trapdoor located just inside the entrance, which unwary thieves would usually find themselves dumped down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
