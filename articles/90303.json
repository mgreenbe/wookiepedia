The drone would then fly upon preset flight paths or be remotely controlled by the host ship via comlink. Each Mimic came with five pre-loaded \"false image options\", allowing the decoy to appear to be the host ship, a TIE fighter, Lambda-class Shuttle, YT-1300, or even a Corellian corvette. Owners could also program the decoy to appear to be another ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
