Because each Troig had at least two heads, the language used the infix sin to separate the two elements of a Troig's personal name. For instance, in the Troig tongue, the name of the Podrace commentator more widely known as Fode and Beed was Fodesinbeed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Troig language is mentioned in Obsessed With Star Wars, a trivia book written by Benjamin Harper and published in 2008 by Chronicle Books. Although several sources describe the differences between indigenous Troig naming conventions and the simpler names that members of the species used with non-Troigs, Harper's book is the first source to explicitly name the language used in such native appellations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
