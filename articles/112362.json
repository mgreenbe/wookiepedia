After informing the group, including Rebb, that Skywalker\u2014the Chosen One who was believed by some to bring balance to the Force\u2014was fighting on Mon Cala, Barr explained to them how the Jedi Order onced believed in him, and how he betrayed and destroyed them.

One of the acolytes, however, Nipaltoo, vectored towards Vader's submarine and attacked, only to have his helmet crushed by the Sith Lord and killed.
