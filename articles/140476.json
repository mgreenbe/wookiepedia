Under the guidance of this exceptional tutor, Blood became a feared warrior and the favorite to claim victory in the next Great Hunt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately for him, Tarro Blood's characteristic arrogance and sudden rise to prominence rubbed his competition the wrong way. The other Mandalorians in the competition made it their mission to ensure that he never came close to claiming victory. The resulting defeat nearly cost Blood his life, in addition to his pride, and he remained out of the public eye for nearly a decade, choosing not to participate in the next Great Hunt."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Second Great Hunt"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After ten years, Blood entered another Hunt, and had no desire to maintain honor during the competition, sabotaging his competitors at every chance. One of the rival hunters he targeted was Braden, who had found a talented protege to be a Great Hunt competitor. While the Hunter was out collecting a bounty on the Corellian fugitive Vexx, Blood had his accomplice, Sedyn Kyne, murder Braden and his friend Jory, unaware that his actions were on holocam, in order to strand the Hunter on Nal Hutta. He later dispatched a Rodian bounty hunter named Nails to take down the Hunter but his lackey greatly underestimated her opponent and was killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hunter managed to win sponsorship into the Great Hunt from Suudaa Nem'ro and arrived on Dromund Kaas to win a spot in the final melee. Blood continued to interfere by hiring freelance Imperial soldiers to interrupt the Hunter's first bounty and later tried claiming that the Hunter died within the Dark Temple, all unsuccessful. When the Hunter won the final melee and became a Great Hunt competitor, Blood directly interfered and tried to denounce the Hunter's credentials, saying they were falsified, but the Huntmaster and his assistant had already made their decision. Frustrated that his adversary would not die, Blood promised that he would have the Hunter's skull in his hand by the time the competition was finished. He then alerted the Imperial authorities that the Hunter intended to steal a D5-Mantis Patrol Craft from the local spaceport; he was unjustly considered an honest Mandalorian. Despite this, the Hunter succeeded and stole the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the Great Hunt, Blood made constant interference in the Hunter's hunts. On Balmorra, he tricked Vexx's siblings into thinking that the Hunter shot Vexx in the back and killed Braden when he discovered the \"crime.\" He then alerted Hunt target Tyresius Lokai that the Hunter was after him and on Alderaan, paid off House Rist to assassinate the hunter. Blood also leaked the list of Great Hunt targets to sell on an auction on Hutta, forcing Assistant Huntsmaster Lek to call on the Hunter for assistance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hedarr Soongh became aware of Blood's crimes and assisted the Hunter in taking out Blood's allies on Nar Shaddaa. Kyne was challenged to a death match and lost, but his compatriots fatally wounded Soongh when they refused his demand to stop persecuting the Hunter, but were subsequently killed by the Hunter, thus depriving Blood of any support in the Hunt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The final target of the Great Hunt was Jedi Master Kellian Jarro, credited for the highest number of Mandalorian deaths. Blood was the first hunter to reach Jarro but was quickly subdued by a mind trick. Held under questioning, Blood claimed that the Hunter was his accomplice, hoping that the Republic would detain or at least kill his rival once and for all. He was wrong on both counted. Face-to-face for the last time, separated by a forcefield, Blood attempted to goad the Hunter into releasing him and facing him for a final confrontation, claiming that both Soongh and Braden would've wanted it. Mako, the Hunter's partner, stated that Braden would've wanted to see Blood as he was, undeserving of a warrior's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarro Blood is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011.
