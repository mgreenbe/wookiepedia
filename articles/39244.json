The howling winds also resulted in the near\u2013complete loss of their hearing. Baros' high gravity caused the Brubb to be stronger than what their average size of 1.5\u20131.7 meters suggested. Brubbs could also change their skin color, ranging from yellow to greenish\u2013gray."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brubbs were a social species, living in communal groups known as habas, most of which were extended families raising their children and operating a specialized business together. \"University\" habas incorporated the best and brightest individuals from other habas, possessing technology comparable to galactic standards, especially in the fields of solar and wind power.

Cronal, one of Emperor Palpatine's dark side servants, discovered the world after 5 ABY and established a laboratory inside Trailia's jungles, capturing native Trailians and transforming them through genetic engineering and dark side experimentation into a race of warriors he intended to sue against the Republic.
