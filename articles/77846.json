The ship was constructed from a stripped-down version of the GAT-12 Skipray Blastboat in order to track down Imperial war criminals. Irackant modified the ship's environmental systems to give it a more moist atmosphere, as well as fitting the ship with a cell, enhancing the starship's automated systems and fitting the Krakana's Claw with a proton torpedo launcher holding 16 heavy torpedoes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
