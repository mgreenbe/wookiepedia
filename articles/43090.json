Erstwhile, their brother left for Tatooine to become a miner, and their pet Hyperdrive followed either one of them.

This safe was locked by a computerized touch panel that employed a password entry system, and it was impossible for Tarisians to slice into due to it being a foreign and by 3956 BBY, outdated, model. In spite of this, Elam added an additional layer of security in the form of a minor gas mine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nevertheless, the strongbox was cracked by the mind-wiped former Jedi Revan and his companions when they wandered into Elam's apartment during the Sith Empire's occupation of Taris. Louie had left an electronic message on Elam's personal message center next to the safe, and this message provided all the answers to the box's security questions: the name of Elam's pet (Hyperdrive), the relative that taught Elam to use a blaster (Uncle), and Elam's homeworld (Alderaan). Deactivating the mine, Revan and his friends accessed the crate and retrieved its contents for their own use when Elam was not home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elam Mattic only figures as an off-screen non-player character in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.
