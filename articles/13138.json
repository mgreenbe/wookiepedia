It was fully automated and manned by scout droids and collector droids whose task it was to collect 30,000 unique specimens of alien life. Eventually, it reached Orellon II where its droids brought fear to the hearts of the local Kentra. Upon its arrival on Orellon II, it had received no messages from its homeworld in three hundred years. The Kentra thought the droids were demons, and commissioned a group of Rebels with the task of eliminating them. The ship was programmed to leave the planet and move on to the next if discovered or fired upon with energy weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
