It featured night barbarbarbs, sanvals, hragscythes and a mudhorn. In 231 BBY, Jedi Master Elzar Mann visited the zoo before the arrival of multiple dignitaries and many of his fellow Jedi. He gazed at one of the hragscythes in an enclosure, and it stared back at him. Later, during the evening opening of the Republic Fair, Jedi Padawan Ram Jomaram had to find a route around the zoo to reach the planet\u2019s nearly finished Jedi temple, and stopped outside of its gates while he considered his options. Later, Padawans Jomaram and Lula Talisola found themselves at the gates of the zoo during the Nihil attack on Lonisa City. The Nihil\u2019s chaotic assault resulted in the release of many of the zoo\u2019s animals, and the zoo's entrance gate was destroyed when a hragscythe began to rampage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lonisa City Zoo debuted simultaneously in The High Republic: Race to Crashpoint Tower, a novel by Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older, and The High Republic: The Rising Storm, a novel by Cavan Scott, both of which were released on June 29, 2021."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
