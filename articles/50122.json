They were immune to blaster fire due to their ability to swallow it. Forosnags were used by the Forosnag Attack Battalion of Sef Con, who confronted a team led by Han Solo during a standoff at Substation Grimdock. The slicer Peekpa hacked into the prison and opened panels in the floor below the forosnags and the Sef Con troopers, causing them to fall into the lower levels. Some of the forosnags survived, but were eaten by bastaks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
