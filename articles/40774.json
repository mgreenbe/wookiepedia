Manufactured by the Colicoids on Colla IV, droidekas were dangerous and deadly, designed to exterminate their adversaries with extreme prejudice. They could transform their shape by curling into a ball and moving up to 75 kilometers per hour across a surface, or stand on three legs and utilize a shield generator while firing at a target. Before the Invasion of Naboo, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn had to face droidekas on a Droid Control Ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shelled in bronzium armor, droidekas came equipped with numerous armaments, both defensive and offensive. In particular, they made use of twin repeating blaster cannons and personal deflector shield generators, which meant that when clones conducted mass attacks, they were scythed down by the droideka's twin repeating blaster cannons, and nothing could be done, unless the clones could get an EMP through the shield, or artillery could be called in. A droideka's shields were so strong and powerful that they could easily repel or deflect short-range, high-velocity attacks; rendering sidearms or blasters ineffective. The droideka was able to fire through its shield because the shield was polarized (meaning that it was phased) to allow the droideka's blaster bolts to travel out, but would stop any projectiles from coming in. Most hand-held weapons did not have enough power to pierce it. Although powerful, they featured several flaws that could be exploited to guarantee a kill; droideka were blind from behind and their shields were ineffective against slow and stationary objects. Rear assaults, coupled with a distraction and a well-thrown Electro Magnetic Pulse grenade, were an extremely effective combination."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Naboo, droidekas cut a path through the Gungan formation with their deadly repeating blaster cannons and then shot the shield generators that the Fambaa were carrying. Later, they served as part of the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars against the Galactic Republic. After the Separatist Council was  massacred by Darth Vader, the droidekas were ordered to shut down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the war, a droideka known as \"The Unwinder,\" was champion in a gladiatorial arena, and another droideka was in a scrap pile operated by the Bidvel and Davil, but was activated by, and was able to save, C1-10P from the two. When a B2-series super battle droid questioned what they should do now that they were safe, C1-10P suggested forming a group to help other droids. During the Galactic Civil War, the Droideka Oppressor and Droideka Sentinel variants were used by smugglers, and were also used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic and Galactic Empire. At least one droideka was used as a security droid by Quarantine World III, and chased after Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra when she attempted to steal the Triple-Zero protocol personality matrix. Aphra later reprogrammed a droideka mark one, Dek-Nil, making him into a probability droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
