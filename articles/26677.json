A former slaver, he and his sister Avax eventually became top bosses of the Rishi-based Kanawyn Syndicate along with Dastid. In 3637 BBY the Syndicate went after the smuggling business of Thera Markon, demanding her routes and clients. Thera used the reputation of her bounty hunter mother Crysta Markon who coached the Grand Champion of the Great Hunt to keep Kanawyns away, and it worked for a time. Eventually, it stopped working and the Syndicate killed Crysta, which proved their undoing. Thera used her money to put a bounty on all three bosses and the Grand Champion collected, killing them and dealing a huge blow to the Syndicate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chrone appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan during the Bounty Hunter class quest on Rishi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
