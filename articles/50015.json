The forest did not contain any trees and it's name was derived from numerous silicate rock formations of various shapes and colors that were situated in the region. The formations reflected blaster bolts and were highly resistant to damage. However, strong winds sometimes caused some of the larger formations to shatter into sharp shards, which proved to be a dangerous hazard to any travelers that passed through the forest. The creatures that evolved to live in the Forest of Broken Glass were rumored to be very receptive to the alchemical techniques of the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
