Although he was heavily built like most members of his species, the Gamorrean artist was graceful and skilled enough to dance en pointe, full weight resting on the tiptoes of a single foot. He wore the usual leather and fur clothes of his species with metallic epaulets and armbands, but had exchanged the traditional Gamorrean sandals for a pair of dance shoes with pointy tips and ribbons. Fode, the left head of the bicephalic Troig Podrace commentator Fodesinbeed Annodue, once expressed his admiration for the Gamorrean's dancing skills."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This unidentified Gamorrean was introduced as a comical background character in Star Wars: Anakin's Speedway, a children's video game released by Lucas Learning in 2000."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
