This unit was used to cool the Eksoan Class-4T3 power generator found in the E-Web heavy repeating blaster. However, even with the advanced cryogenic cooling abilities found in the Gk3, the power generator could sometimes overheat and explode. This was most common when one gunner manned the E-web without an engineer overlooking the generator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
