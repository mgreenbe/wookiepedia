The Cephalon did not support the Empire, however, and joined an underground resistance movement known as Whiplash. Around this time, Aoloiloa was visited by two Whiplash members, the Twi'lek Gray Paladin Laranth Tarak and ex-journalist Den Dhur. However, due to the Cephalon's four-dimensional perception of the galaxy, it was unable to communicate effectively with Dhur and Tarak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
