Omega was to be returned to Kamino and discreetly terminated once her genetic material had been obtained.

The bounty hunter, however, had realized We was dead, and Shand soon revealed herself, starting a duel between the two hunters for Omega. After Bane was briefly knocked out, Omega demanded Shand to answer why she had killed We, although the hunter remained unsympathetic, noting that the Kaminoan's death helped keep her safe from Su.
