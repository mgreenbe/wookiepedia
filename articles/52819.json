Gar-Oth had been prospecting for an easy world to conquer and add to his empire and in 31 BBY, he selected a small planetoid ruled by an monarchy of elfish humanoids. Gar-Oth invaded the world, murdering its king, and in order to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the world's residents, tried to force the king's daughter Princess Lourdes to marry him.
