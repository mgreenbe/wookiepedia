When she is first introduced on page 160 of the novel, she is identified as a Lorrdian female. However, in a scene later in the novel, she is described as a Falleen, complete with the species' dorsal spines, face scales, small claws on her fingers, and usage of pheromones to manipulate others' emotions. This discrepancy has not yet been addressed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
