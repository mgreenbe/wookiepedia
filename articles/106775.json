In some lightsabers, the cap also held an extra backup power cell; such was the case with Dooku's lightsaber and Obi-Wan Kenobi's first lightsaber. These heavy ends of the hilt were sometimes incorporated into the fighting styles of a Jedi as an alternative to actually impaling an opponent on the blade end of the weapon. This sometimes provided a nonfatal resolution to an incident."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They typically included a ring to hook onto the wielder's belt when not in use, though some lightsabers, such as Dooku's, used a powerful magnetic plate for the same purpose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
