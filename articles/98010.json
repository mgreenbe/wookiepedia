During a trip to the Stenness system, Andur was ambushed by gang members of Bogga the Hutt, who were after the Adegan crystals carried by Sunrider and her husband. The ensuing fight witnessed the murder of Andur, and Sunrider's decision to begin down the path to become a Jedi Knight. Sunrider eventually completed her training under the Jedi Master Thon, and was placed in charge of the Jedi relief mission sent to Onderon to aid Ulic Qel-Droma in the Freedon Nadd Uprising. Along with several other Jedi, Sunrider helped Qel-Droma bring about the end of the Naddist Revolt, essentially putting an end to the reign of the Sith on Onderon. Following those events, Sunrider was one of many Jedi to participate in the Great Sith War against the rise of Exar Kun and his apprentice, the fallen Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma. During the war, Sunrider witnessed Qel-Droma slay his own brother Cay and, guided by her intense emotions, used her powers to permanently sever Qel-Droma from The Force.

For her, a lightsaber only served as a reminder of when she was forced to kill two of her husband's murderers. Master Thon, however, challenged her views on this, telling her that a lightsaber was not only a weapon to be used for attack and defense\u2014it also provided a Jedi with a focus for their mind, and also strengthened their connection with the Force. To further strengthen his argument, Thon took Sunrider and young Vima out into the wilderness of Ambria, and showed Sunrider an ancient holocron which had been lent to him by Master Arca Jeth; the gatekeeper of the holocron was Master Ood Bnar. Master Bnar proceeded to tell Sunrider the history of the Jedi's age-old fight against the dark side, and concluded by stating that Sunrider would play an important role in the momentous events to come.

Once there, Thon commanded Sunrider to pick up the lightsaber he had given her and to join him at his side for the coming battle\u2014Sunrider, however, refused. Thon became frustrated by his apprentice's stubbornness concerning the lightsaber, and, seeing no other way to convince her to use the physical aspects of her Jedi abilities, he surrendered himself to the pirates. However, while he was being led away, Thon stretched out through the Force and told Sunrider that if she refused to use a lightsaber, then she simply had to focus her Force powers on the pirates if she wanted to save both him and her daughter. At that moment, Sunrider saw through the fog of her remaining grief and apprehension, and concentrated on the image of the pirates and the other enforcers attacking each other; suddenly, the pirates turned on each other, fighting over the crystals. The ensuing confusion allowed Sunrider the time needed to reach the decision which Thon had been trying to show her\u2014that the lightsaber was the weapon of a Jedi, and that she was a Jedi.

The Naddists were able to steal both of the sarcophagi and retreat to their underground headquarters. Also, Master Jeth was captured by King Ommin and subjected to prolonged torture.

Sunrider led Diath and others in a charge against the more numerous enemy soldiers, projecting a Force shield around themselves, and utilizing Force battle techniques that the Jedi had developed throughout their history.

Following the explosion of a star by Aleema Keto at Kemplex IX, the resulting supernova put the Jedi planet of Ossus directly in its path of destruction. As a result, hundreds of Jedi, including Sunrider, descended upon the library world to help evacuate as much Jedi lore as possible. However, while the Jedi were busy loading ships with information, Sunrider and Cay Qel-Droma both sensed Qel-Droma approaching the planet in a personal starship. Believing that his brother had finally returned to the Jedi in their time of need, Cay Qel-Droma took his own ship and went to meet his older brother. Qel-Droma, though, shot his sibling's fighter down and, once on the ground, proceeded to attack his brother in a deadly lightsaber duel. Sunrider, along with Doneeta, watched as Cay Qel-Droma's fighter crashed into Ossus; they then attempted to make their way to him. However, by the time they reached the two brothers, Qel-Droma had again given into his anger and murdered his brother. Sunrider, upon witnessing Cay Qel-Droma's murder, found herself overcome with grief and torment, and unleashed her powers upon the now grieving Qel-Droma. Sunrider effectively cut Qel-Droma off from the Force, severing all connections that he could previously experience. Qel-Droma, feeling pain over his brother as well as defeated by the effects of Sunrider's punishment, repented and agreed to help Sunrider and the other Jedi end the war which he had helped start."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Qel-Droma to Exar Kun's secret temple on Yavin 4, Sunrider and the other Jedi decided that they needed to create a solid wall of light side energy to be able to combat the dark effects of Exar Kun's Sith magic.

However, their efforts had unforeseen effects as Sunrider watched the light side wave turn the surface of Yavin 4 into a blazing inferno.

Following the conclave, it was discovered that her daughter had run away from Exis Station to unknown parts of the galaxy, and Sunrider was left to worry and ponder over her daughter's seemingly constant rash decisions. Vima had become disillusioned with her mother's hesitation to train her to become a Jedi\u2014Vima felt that her mother was more of a politician for the Jedi, rather than her mother or master. As a result, Sunrider's daughter secretly left her mother to search out a master who would further her training in the ways of the Force.

Although young Vima had constantly asked Sunrider to advance the Jedi training they had begun together, Sunrider had consistently grew into her role as Grand Master, often neglecting her daughter's training. Upon reaching this understanding, Sunrider allowed her anger at her daughter to melt away, and instead she admitted to herself that there was no better example for young Vima than Ulic Qel-Droma to show her the cost of being a Jedi. However, upon this realization Sunrider began to question if Qel-Droma was indeed the best teacher for her daughter.

Qel-Droma, however, understood why Sunrider had arrived, and advised her that if she was prepared to take Vima back as an apprentice, then Qel-Droma's tutelage of her daughter was complete; he harbored no ill feelings towards Sunrider and still only wanted what was best for her and her daughter. To demonstrate to her mother the progress of her training, Vima took Sunrider to the side of an ice-covered mountain, where Qel-Droma had shown her how to let the Force guide her actions\u2014the end result had been an enormous sculpture being carved by Vima in the likeness of her late father, Andur.
