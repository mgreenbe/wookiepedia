Some time afterwards, Corrin and Kaal narrowly saved Kallig from being disposed of after their new master was nearly killed by Darth Thanaton. They then returned to Kallig's ship to discuss their next move, knowing that Thanaton would execute them for their defiance. The best bet for Kallig to succeed was to bind more Force ghosts with the Force walk, as the two Kallig possessed were insufficient to overpower Thanaton. Kallig agreed to check out a lead on Taris while Corrin and Kaal promised to keep an eye on Thanaton."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After their master succeeded on Taris, the two apprentices contacted Kallig, revealing that they stole the key to Thanaton's private meditation chamber and now the Dark Lord was out for their blood.

Kallig avenged their deaths by killing Cineratus, even though he stated that he was just following Thanaton's order and didn't want himself killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
