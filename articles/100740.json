A group of undercover Imperial Intelligence agents had secured top secret Republic defense plans and was attempting to flee back to Sith space in a stolen shuttle. They were however, reached by a pursuing Republic fleet over Jabiim. The Imperial Empire's Fury squadron and a small Imperial fleet were assigned to escort the Imperial agents to safety, protecting them from the pursuing enemy fleet. A space battle eventually issued with both fleets suffering many losses causing large debris fields in Jabiim's orbit. The Empire's Fury was able to destroy most of the pursuing Republic starfighters and still damage their Cruisers, giving time for the Imperial Agents' shuttle to escape to Hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Operation Silent Roar appears as one of the Space Missions available in the MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic.
