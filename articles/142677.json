The explorer Reidi Artom reported trying to reach a cave on Rennokk, but was chased off by a worm-like lava creature c. 232 BBY. Another group of explorers returned about a century later and found a city of interconnected metal buildings, but they were also chased by the lava worm. Only one of the explorers, a Tarasin named Kum'Jushkin, survived. His accounts have been called into question, as he was often drunk when he told the story, and his embellishments kept growing over time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
