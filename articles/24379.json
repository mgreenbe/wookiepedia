Zothip met his end shortly before the Pellaeon\u2013Gavrisom Treaty was signed, when one of his lieutenants, a pirate named Control, engineered a confrontation between Zothip and Disra. Zothip was killed by the Mistryl Shadow Guard Karoly D'ulin, and Control was left to take over the Cavrilhu Pirates. In 19 ABY, Luke Skywalker managed to infiltrate their base in the Kauron asteroid belt but was captured and survived only due to the timely arrival of Mara Jade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade escaped from their base, the Cavrilhu Pirates looked for the two Jedi and eventually found their trace in the Nirauan system. When the pirates arrived on Nirauan, the Jedi were already gone but they found the Hand of Thrawn. Due to the destruction of their defenses by the Jedi, the personnel of the base were forced to evacuate and the pirates captured the base. Shortly later, they attacked and were repelled from a secret Chiss training center in the Rata Nebula. They involuntarily discovered the base when one of their freighters crashed through the transparisteel dome hiding the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
