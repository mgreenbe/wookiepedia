The world's judicial system was quick and harsh, with individuals guilty of murder being punished by death. During the Galactic Civil War, the Galactic Empire did not deem it necessary to station troops or weapons on Tralfin. As a result, to its visitors Tralfin seemed removed from the conflict. The world became a popular vacation site for personnel of the Rebel Alliance due to the fact they could be anonymous there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tralfin was created by Bill Olmesdahl as the setting for \"Murder in Paradise,\" a roleplaying adventure hook published in the 1992 supplement Star Wars Gamemaster Screen for use with West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. \"Murder in Paradise\" suggests several reasons for why the player-characters would want visit the world, such as being rewarded by a luxury vacation by their superiors or a grateful client, or being sent on an undercover mission\u2014possibly even to kidnap Moff Crin Harson, who ends up being murdered by another party."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The adventure hook presents several options for the identity and motives of Harson's killer. It may be the Moff's wife, who, unbeknownst to Harson, visits Tralfin and discovers his affair with a mistress, and subsequently kills her husband in a fit of jealous rage. Other options include: a grudge-bearing Imperial officer whose career Harson has ruined; Rebel Alliance sympathizers who carry out a political assassination and then try to pin the blame on the player-characters, who they believe are associated with the Galactic Empire; or a team of bounty hunters hired by one of Harson's superiors, who wishes to get rid of the power-hungry Moff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Murder in Paradise\" also briefly discusses the potential first reaction of the player-characters to Harson's murder, with both contacting Tralfin's law enforcement agency and attempting to hide the evidence of the crime being described as highly problematic for the characters. The adventure hook also suggests an alternate way to play it: instead of running a mystery adventure, the game-master player can frame it as a fast-paced escape scenario by having Tralfin's police launch a manhunt for the player-characters. They then have to avoid capture and escape, and possibly have to attempt to prove their innocence in later adventures. This article assumes the scenario plays out as described."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2008 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia established the canonicity of several details of Moff Harson's murder on Tralfin with respect to the Star Wars Legends continuity, although contrary to the setting of \"Murder in Paradise,\" the former work established that the Moff was found dead in his own apartment instead of that of the individuals later implicated in his murder. The 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas placed the Tralfin system, and therefore Tralfin itself, in grid square Q-3."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
