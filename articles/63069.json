The village was inhabited by the Howling Crag Clan, including a Dathomirian by the name of Denkra Kymeri. Denkra, the middle daughter of Amaya Kymeri, assumed the role of protecting the village. However, sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, an outbreak of the Blackwing virus decimated the villagers, including Denkra. In an attempt to contain the outbreak, the Galactic Empire killed most of the clan. However, Kymeri, along with two of her sisters, Naija Kymeri and Thestriel Kymeri, formed the Sisters of the Void, used spells to fight off the contagion, and took on new names, Denkra's being \"Voidsister Warrior\". In her undead state, Denkra remained at the village, still believing she had a responsibility to protect it and her other undead clan mates. Eventually, the Force ghost of Amaya Kymeri sent a spacer to destroy the village and Denkra once and for all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Howling Crag Clan Village was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
