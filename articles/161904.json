When the man was in his twenties, he defended Alderaan after the Empire initiated a massive assault on the Republic Core World. Although the Imperial forces under the Sith Lord Darth Malgus were initially successful, the incursion force was eventually beaten back and the Sith were forced into a retreat. While the surviving invasion forces fled the world, Vorin and his Zabrak Jedi comrade surveyed the ruin of a destroyed Alderaanian town. Malgus, who had been heavily wounded during a Republic counterattack, was flying overhead in retreat, but felt the presence of Jedi on the surface below. The Sith Lord descended upon the ruined town, where he discovered the Zabrak Jedi and engaged him in lightsaber combat. Vorin hid from battle, waiting for the opportune moment to reveal himself and strike, but Darth Malgus sensed his presence in the Force. After delivering a Force-augmented kick to the Zabrak's ribs, the Sith used the Force to pull Vorin out of hiding and crush his windpipe. Although the Jedi attempted to fight back, he was able to do little more than swing his green lightsaber at empty air before Malgus killed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
