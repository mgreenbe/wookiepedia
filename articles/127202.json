Unlike other core ships, the station was equipped with several large antennae which protruded from both the top and bottom of the station's hull, and was kept alfoat through the assistance of reactor-powered repulsorlift generators. The reactors themselves were protected by a ray shielded blast door."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside, the station contained a disassembly chamber used to dismantle droids, as well as a room used to store spare battle droid components. There were also several hangar bays within the station, which maintained enough space for squadrons of Vulture-class droid starfighters from the 88th Flight, of which were hung from ceiling-mounted recharge racks, and Rogue-class Porax-38 starfighters. The bay doors were controlled by interface terminals situated on the inside and outside of the station along a maintenance catwalk, which were accessible by an astromech droid. Furthermore, the station's delicate sensor suites were operated by Aqualish technicians in a dimly lit room near the disassembly chamber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Republic confirmation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Skytop Station and its intercepted transmissions were used by the Separatist General Grievous in order to both ambush and destroy Republic fleets. Sometime later, Republic Intelligence officers were able to confirm that the Separatists were utilizing a secret listening post to launch the attacks.

However, despite the belief that he was destroyed, R2 was taken captive by the Trandoshan scavenger Gha Nachkt, who planned to sell the droid to Grievous. While en route to Skytop Station to deliver the droid, R2 was able to transmit his position to Skywalker, who received the signal after his rescue from the Separatist frigates by his Padawan and Clone Captain CT-7567, tracking the signal to the listening post."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Skytop Station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving on the station, Nachkt and R2 met with Grievous in a surveillance room, who ordered the Trandoshan to bring the astromech to the disassembly chamber, where he was to be dismantled and searched for any Republic information.

Afterwards, R3 informed Grievous that the Republic had infiltrated the station, which prompted the general to put the station on high alert, as well as order a group of IG-100 MagnaGuards to bring the R2 unit to his ship, while he left to confront the Jedi. With the station on alert, Tano and her squad were kept from completing their mission as a ray shield was lowered over the doors to the reactor room, prompting the Togruta to order R3 to lower the shields. As the droid deactivated the shield, a squad of battle droids approached their position, trapping Tano and her troops in a brief crossfire, but were able to defeat the droids using EMP grenades. Despite having defeated the droids, the Republic squad was engaged by Grievous shortly after, losing all but Captain Rex, the clone trooper Denal, and Tano, who lured the Kaleesh away into a nearby room to allow the two clones to complete the mission."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destruction of Skytop Station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elsewhere, Skywalker, who had managed to locate his droid, caught up with and destroyed the MagnaGuards escorting the astromech, and then proceeded to make their way to the station's south landing bay, where they were to meet with Tano and the others. However, Rex and Denal rendezvoused with Skywalker in the landing bay after completing their mission, where they explained that Tano had engaged Grievous and broke off from the group. Skywalker, attempting to locate his Padawan, was locked within the landing bay alongside the two troopers by R3-S6, who then activated three vulture droids, forcing the Jedi and the clones into a battle with the droids.
