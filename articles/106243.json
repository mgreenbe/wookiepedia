Pok, the Mon Calamari bartender of the establishment, gave a bottle of plooey-sap to the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, who accepted it upon prompting. He drank a swig of it and immediately cringed, reflecting on its awful bitter and sweet flavors as his mouth went slightly numb. Velus continued to drink it, which surprised his companion, entrepreneur Temmin Wexley, who explained the beverage's origin from Akiva's jungle trees. The former loyalty officer then compared the taste of plooey-sap to licking the underside of a leaky droid. When Wexley clambered over the table to reunite with his mother, Norra, Velus' plooey-sap bottle tumbled to the ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plooey-sap first appeared in Aftermath, a 2015 novel written by Chuck Wendig."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
