As many duties required a specific set of instruction, the RapidResponse allowed for the droid to be retasked with a minimum of effort. GLD-M General Labor Droid/Mining units were fitted with this system, allowing them to switch between several tasks such as aiding Resource Recon Speeders, operational planning, piloting skiffs, or debris clearance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
