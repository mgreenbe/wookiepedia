When members of the class could not answer one of Lah's questions on the Battle of Coruscant, he decided to give them all a Czulkang Lah pit. Tudrath Dyn correctly guessed the answer to Lah's question: They needed to know what the New Republic was willing to sacrifice, so that would know how they thought. Dyn was instructed to sit, and did not receive a pit from Lah's amphistaff."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
