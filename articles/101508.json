A particularly simple-minded species, orobirds nevertheless thrived on numerous worlds, baffling scientists as to how they survived despite the fact that they were easy prey for predators and poachers due to their low intelligence, bright plumage and general loudness. Orobirds possessed a brutish temperament, and their meat was particularly foul-tasting. Juvenile orobirds were known as orokeets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
