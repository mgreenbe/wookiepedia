There were no rules, except only three types of vehicles were allowed, which had to be rented from the racing authorities. Several exit points were located along the course for survivors of disabled vehicles. Anyone could participate; all one had to do was register and pay a registry fee as well as a rental fee. Prize money were given to those who made it through the course without too much damage. Death and serious injuries were not uncommon in these events, and much focus was placed upon the violent nature of the sport, even within BlastBoast 2000 advertisements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Permitted vehicles"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Permitted vehicles were:"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
