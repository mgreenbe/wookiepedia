Of the city's many cantinas, the Falling Rodian was middle-of-the-road in terms of quality. The sign over the door depicted a Rodian toppling over a railing. The story of how the cantina got its name had been lost in time as the Falling Rodian passed between a dozen different owners. Though there were signs posted prohibiting droids and weapons within the bar, these were ignored, and virtually all of its customers went armed. Shortly after the Trade Wars, a Human named Norben was a barkeep in the Rodian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
