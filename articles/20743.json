Located in the shadow of the Royal Palace, a dock was erected on the palace-side of the island and serviced small boats that the local Naboo used to float about the river. At the center of the island was a small rotunda which shared the traditional sandstone block construct and green-tiled roof as many of the other buildings in the city. Primarily used for event space or important government business by members of the Royal House and those who visited the Palace, the surrounding lawns were well-tended lawns and flower gardens. The pathways were lined with bricks, leading from the rotunda to several recreational fields, an orchard, and through dense stands of trees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Broadberry Meadow was first identified in the sourcebook Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Episode I following the release of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
