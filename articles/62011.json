Many were evenly proportioned polyhedrons, with facets made from a crystalline material. Some had transparent outer shells that allowed their users to perceive their inner mechanisms, and they glowed when activated. While known Jedi holocrons were cubes, dodecahedrons, or cuboctahedrons, those built by the Sith were usually identified by their pyramidal shapes. They functioned similarly to their Jedi counterparts, and contained the ancient secrets of the dark side and the Sith Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Holocrons acted as repositories of vital, sensitive knowledge and wisdom pertaining to the nature and use of the Force, a mystical energy field that connected all living things in the galaxy. Data playback typically took the form of an interactive hologram resembling the person who recorded the information. Given the sensitive nature of the lessons they contained, many such devices were equipped with a security mechanism that granted access only to those keenly attuned with the Force. Additionally, many holocrons could only be activated if paired with a specific memory crystal.  When the Force was correctly used to open a holocron, it would physically manipulate its various mechanical parts to grant the user access to its data.  Each of these individual parts was imbued with the power of the Force, and could provide some functionality even if they were removed from the holocron, such as being able to remotely manipulate the data of another holocron or track down the location of certain Force-sensitive individuals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If a Jedi holocron and a Sith holocron were opened together by a lightsider and a darksider, they would fuse and be able to answer any question the users desired. Holocron fusions were incredibly uncommon, due to the rarity of having a lightsider and darksider work together, and by the Galactic Civil War knowledge of the practice was mostly lost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The earliest holocrons were attributed to the Dai Bendu, the precursors of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the centuries hundreds of Jedi holocrons were made.

After Darth Sidious founded the Galactic Empire and ordered the Great Jedi Purge, holocrons became scarce remnants of a bygone era. However, Imperial agents trained in the dark side of the Force, such as the Jedi-hunting Inquisitors and Darth Vader, occasionally sought both Jedi and Sith holocrons in hopes of obtaining information that would aid in the destruction of their adversaries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after the Clone Wars, Grakkus the Hutt obtained a number of Jedi holocrons that he kept on Nar Shaddaa.
