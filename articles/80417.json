Goode received the role for having the same measurements as Dukes, and began filming in April 1976 as one of the stormtroopers invading the blockade runner. Later, he performed scenes on the Death Star, recalling one scene where he banged his head on a gantry, leading many to believe that he may be the actor responsible for one of the film's most famous goofs. Later on, Goode took up the role of one of the two Saurins in the Cantina (Hrchek Kal Fas), after the unknown original actress was out sick and unable to film the required scenes. On January 22, 2016 Goode released a song titled Who Was the Stormtrooper Who Banged His Head!? on iTunes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
