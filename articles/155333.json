The Venator-class Star Destroyer was stolen by the Confederacy of Independent Systems and stationed above Abafar, where it was loaded with rhydonium to be used in an attack against the Valor space station in the Carida system, the location of a Republic strategy conference. After escaping Abafar, the Republic unit known as D-Squad boarded the Star Destroyer, unaware of its involvement in the Separatist plot. D-Squad managed to prevent the Venator from reaching its destination, and the vessel was destroyed at a safe distance from the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
