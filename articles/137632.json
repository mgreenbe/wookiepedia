The treacherous course included potentially deadly jumps over gaps in the Ugnaught Surface exoskeleton, where multiple racers had perished. The race brought many tourists to Bespin to watch the racers in their custom skimmers, but some ufflors feared it could attract unwanted criminal attention from the Hutts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
