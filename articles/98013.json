On one occasion, he was ordered by Wilhuff's parents to remove their child's meal during a family dinner, after which the Tarkins questioned their son on what he would do if he were to lose everything. They then spoke about sending Wilhuff to the Carrion Plateau, a region of Eriadu where the males of the Tarkin line, including Wilhuff's father, were sent for testing during childhood. Wilhuff questioned if Nomma had been to the plateau, and was told the Carrion would show him the difference between people like the Tarkins and Nomma, and how to show lesser beings like Nomma to be content with their station. When Wilhuff claimed he would serve food to Nomma, his mother claimed he would not be allowed to in their house."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nomma first appeared in a flashback to Wilhuff Tarkin's childhood featured in the James Luceno novel Tarkin, which was released in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
