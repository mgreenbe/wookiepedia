It was boarded by six Stormtroopers cloned from Sa Cuis's genetic template led by the treacherous Emperor's Hand Sheyvan, who intended to usurp Emperor Palpatine during his rule. Vader, alongside Lieutenant Erv Lekauf and cloned Stormtroopers derived from the latter's template, fought back, resulting in Vader killing Sheyvan in a quick duel. Lekauf, however, was severely burned from the fires aboard the vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the Imperial Period and the Galactic Civil War, Vader utilized the shuttle for instances that required him to make a personal appearance to motivate the Imperial forces. In 1 ABY, Vader\u2014accompanied by a unit of Triumphant-class dark troopers\u2014used this shuttle during the operations Molecular Clamp, Sieve, Green Light and Take Down to travel to the cities of Bestine, Coronet and Theed, respectively. In addition, he also used the shuttle to travel directly to Theed during Empire Day Festivities to personally present several dedicated Imperial officers with awards for acts of service and loyalty to the Empire. A year later, Vader later used the shuttle to travel to Bespin during its occupation by Imperial Forces to coerce its administrator, Lando Calrissian, who was also a former acquaintance of Han Solo, into delivering him, Leia, and Chewbacca to him. After losing Luke Skywalker during their duel, he used the shuttle to return to the Executor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Battle of Endor, the ST 321 brought Darth Vader from the Star Destroyer Avenger to the second Death Star.
