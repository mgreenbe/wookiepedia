Because they were harmful to their environments, siphon generators were often used on isolated worlds in extreme situations. During the Clone Wars, the Techno Union constructed a base on Nelvaan powered by a siphon generator, which fed off a geothermal crystal. While the generator was active, the planet's thermal energy was lessened, keeping it in a wintry state. The generator was destroyed by Anakin Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
