Dana had information that Adar Tallon, long believed to be dead, was in fact alive and hiding on Tatooine. Captain Parlan, commander of the Relentless, had hired bounty hunters including Jodo Kast to apprehend Tallon. Before the crew could meet with Dana, however, she was killed by Kast. The crew of the Alabak's Gold retrieved the agent's body and found an encrypted file on a datapad with the information regarding Tallon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crew of the Alabak's Gold went to Tatooine to try and find Tallon.

They returned to the freighter days later, with Tallon. They were pursued to the docking bay by bounty hunter droid IG-72, but the crew defeated IG-72 and left Tatooine aboard the freighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
