Impressed by his Force-potential and his brilliant mind, Jinn decided, after some brief hesitation, to bring Xanatos to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to see if he could be trained. In doing so, Xanatos was taken away from the three things he loved most at an early age: Crion, his father; Nason, his sister; and Telos IV, his home planet. Crion gave his consent for Xanatos to leave for the Jedi Order. Once Xanatos arrived to Coruscant, he tried to impress other younglings with his powerful background.

He encouraged Xanatos to help him proving that the Toprawans and the Antarian Rangers were involved in the recent events, though Xanatos had still resentment towards his father, perceiving that he left him behind and he neglected. He spent some time with his sister, Nason, meanwhile, Qui-gon was investigating the incident after sensing that Liora's killer was a Jedi yet not a Jedi, during a main event Nason was murdered by the insurgents that tried to raid the place, this angered Xanatos towards not only the insurgents but towards his master too since he wasn't able to stop anything. On top of that a lightsaber was found in one of the insurgents corpses making the connection with the Antarian Rangers more believable, unknown to Qui-gon the lightsaber was placed there by a collaborator of none other than the failed Jedi Dairoki, who at the same time was not only Liora's killer but Crion Benefactor. Crion tried to convince his son to join him once again, telling him about his desire to unite Telos and the pride of their family, Xanatos sided with his father in the civil war, thus failing his final test. Under Crion's direction, he sabotaged the first meeting to rally the Telosians against Toprawa. But as Dairoki accidentally confirmed having committed crimes in Crion's name, Hukowl An Devi, one of the governor's top advisers, revealed the truth to the people of Telos. Civil war soon broke out.

Crion died instantly. Jinn tried to apologize, but Xanatos' inextinguishable anger at his father's death caused him to turn to the dark side. He picked up his father's burning right hand from the nearby fireplace and pressed the ring (which had been cut by Jinn's lightsaber) to his right cheek. The broken-circle scar later became his \"trademark\" and the symbol for the Offworld Mining Corporation, a company he took control of through deceit and conspiracy. Before Xanatos and Qui-Gon could fight each other, the rioters stormed the palace and Xanatos was forced to escape. He stole the Telosian treasury and fled the planet on a transport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn told the Council that he had \"died\" in the fighting on Telos.

He distracted the citizens with a gambling project supposedly controlled by the government called Katharsis, which would provide \"tax breaks.\" The profits from Katharsis were supposedly used for the restoration of Telos; he supported libraries, parks, medcenters, and founded a healing institute named after him in Thani. In truth, Offworld, under the name of UniFy, controlled Katharsis, which was fixed so the winner was only given a fraction of the credits and the rest, including profits, were used by Offworld to conduct its mining programs. Any political group who spoke out against UniFy, such as the POWER party, was outlawed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 45 and 44 BBY, Xanatos learned from Treasurer of Telos Vox Chun that the latter's son, Bruck, was training at the Jedi Temple.

Tura worked at a refueling station to support Granta. Xanatos confided his past\u2014his pure hatred of the Jedi and Qui-Gon Jinn\u2014to Granta and taught him a few of his tricks, such as the \"back door\" strategy and his own modus operandi: Disruption + Demoralization + Distraction = Devastation, a maxim inspired by a tyrant in a previous mission that Xanatos underwent with Jinn at age sixteen."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Final Campaign"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Bandomeer"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 44 BBY, Xanatos was contacted by VeerTa, head of the Home Planet Mine on Bandomeer. Hoping to make a profit, the Meerian told Xanatos that she had discovered ionite. In return, Xanatos said that if Offworld took control of the mines, it would be \"for the good of Bandomeer.\" But it was far from the truth. While \"galactically insignificant,\" Bandomeer would make him and Offworld very wealthy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeing an opportunity to enact his revenge on Qui-Gon Jinn, Xanatos arranged a backup plan, in case his scheme for profiting off Bandomeer didn't succeed. He arranged VeerTa to sneak Offworld mining supplies into storage rooms of the Agricultural Corps's Enrichment Zones and hid it with coated transparasteel made from his homeworld of Telos IV. What VeerTa didn't know was that among the items were ion bombs, which encased in boxes imprinted with the broken circle. Xanatos then set up a series of charges to ignite a chain reaction around Bandomeer, planning on killing Jinn. More importantly, he wanted to see Jinn die knowing that he could not save Bandomeer's citizens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Xanatos forged a message to Supreme Chancellor Kalpana that looked like it came from Bandomeer's governor, SonTag, requesting Jinn to act as a diplomat for the peace meeting between Offworld and its rival company, the Arcona Mineral Harvest Corporation. He also sent a somewhat taunting message to Jinn that read: \"I have been looking forward to this day.\" Beside his name was a drawing of the broken circle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since Jemba the Hutt had recently died, Xanatos would have to take his place as Offworld's representative. Before attending the meeting in Bandor, the capital of Bandomeer, he arranged for a bomb to placed in the Home Planet Mine, where its sensor was sabotaged. Arriving late, he found Jinn with Arcona Mineral Harvest chief operations manager Clat'Ha, Governor SonTag, and VeerTa; he adopted a cheery disposition to his former master and went on how he \"went astray\" from the Jedi teachings before going to Offworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moving on to business, Xanatos claimed that he desired peace between Offworld and Arcona Mineral Harvest. To further his ruse, he proposed sending ten percent of Offworld's profits for the Bandomeer reclamation effort. Then, the bomb went off in the Home Planet Mine. VeerTa, suspecting Offworld, lunged herself at Xanatos, but was stopped by Jinn. Xanatos, feigning surprise, denied all involvement. SonTag sent VeerTa off to help the miners out of the wreckage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the rescue was completed, Xanatos sent SonTag an offer to rebuild the mine: not only would he send credits, droids, and anything else Bandomeer would need, but also put recently unemployed miners to work at Offworld. Sure enough, Offworld was as good as its word\u2014they even cleared the tunnels of debris before starting to repairing them\u2014but only to sell the deception."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Xanatos traveled at the Eastern Enrichment Zone with five members of the Offworld Security Force, intent on capturing the failed Jedi Initiate, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Entering alone, he traveled to the Dome and found Kenobi inside the secret storage compartment. He ensured Kenobi that he was a \"friend\" and warned him that the boy would not make it as Jinn's apprentice, thanks to his cold nature. It was enough to fill Kenobi's mind with doubts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Then, as if signaled by Xanatos, the guards stormed in while pretending to identify their employer and Kenobi as thieves. Xanatos activated his lightsaber and made a feigned attack on the guards, with Kenobi on the defensive: neither were willing to kill the guards. After Kenobi dealt with three guards, a fourth raised an electrojabber against Xanatos, under the feigned intent to strike the Dark Jedi. Kenobi rushed to apprehend the guard, only to be shocked in the ribs. He was then knocked unconscious from behind, either by Xanatos or another guard. Xanatos then sent Kenobi off to the mines within the Great Sea of Bandomeer, but not before taking the boy's lightsaber and comlink."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once that was out of the way, the Dark Jedi returned to Bandor to oversee operations at the northern azurite mining quadrant, which was the largest in the outskirts of the city. It was nightfall when he started leaving the administrative building. The shifts had been changed and all miners vacated the vicinity. Just as Xanatos passed the yard, Qui-Gon Jinn emerged from the shadows of surrounding slag piles and blocked his path."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xanatos did not show any surprise; whether he was inwardly startled that Jinn had been waiting for him or he had just felt his former mentor's presence and deliberately came to meet him, it was hard to say. After Jinn declared Xanatos' plans for Bandomeer put to an end, the latter revealed his lightsaber. He was angered when told that he had disgraced the weapon he carried, but smiled with mirth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two men circled each other, verbally clashing on who betrayed who and which one relished over the other's misery. As Jinn explained that Yoda foresaw that Xanatos would fail back on Telos, the Dark Jedi seethed in anger. To him, Yoda did not understand a tenth of true power: the power of the dark side. Xanatos reasoned that Jinn would've been rich by now, if he had not been made \"too good\" by the Jedi teachings. Jinn countered that Xanatos would never own Bandomeer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the time for words had passed, Xanatos activated his lightsaber and attacked. Jinn measured up a sterling defense, managing to block and evade his former pupil's strikes. Knowing he could not wear Xanatos down, he went to the offensive, but Xanatos just laughed, countering Jinn's every move. The two combatants appeared to be evenly matched. Xanatos proclaimed that because of the suffering Jinn had caused him, he had surpassed him. But then, a mistake with his footwork caused Jinn to wound his shoulder; the Jedi Master pointed out that he was only deluding himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suddenly, Xanatos drew out Kenobi's lightsaber with his other hand, causing Jinn to lose his focus momentarily. The Dark Jedi taunted him on the whereabouts of his \"new apprentice\" before lashing out with both weapons, hoping to intensify the duel. But Jinn remembered Xanatos' moves while training him in the Jedi Temple and evaded his attacks. He grabbed Kenobi's lightsaber from Xanatos and escaped the mine to search for the missing Padawan; this was the first time he had ever fled from a fight. Xanatos called out after him, claiming that the Jedi had only escaped for now."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two days later, Xanatos learned of a deactivated transmitter in the Offworld loading dock on Bandor's harbor. He knew that Jinn was there. He mounted a speeder bike and traveled to meet his former Master, planning to chase him all the way to the Home Planet Mine. There, he would trap him and activate the ion bombs to enact his revenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xanatos found Jinn and an escaped Kenobi on an Offworld landspeeder entering Bandor's outskirts. He fired with his speeder bike's laser cannon, driving them to his trap. As they reached the Home Planet Mine, Jinn and Kenobi jumped from their speeder. Xanatos sped toward them and narrowly missed a fatal blow from Jinn, all the while causing the elder Jedi to hurt his own shoulder. Knowing that Xanatos was too fast while mounted on his speeder, the Jedi fled into the mine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xanatos followed his quarry down the mine levels. On the way, he overheard Jinn telling Kenobi in Core 6 of what he had been told by VeerTa: Xanatos had no knowledge of the north turbolift leading to Core 5. The Jedi would be able to either catch the Dark Jedi by surprise or escape from the mine. But Xanatos caught up with the Jedi and blocked their path, proving Jinn's assumptions wrong, all the while rubbing all the elder Jedi's mistakes in his face. When he started referring Kenobi as \"clumsy,\" the boy leapt over Xanatos and wounded him in the lightsaber hand. A brief duel started between Xanatos and the Jedi before the former broke off and ran into Core 5, luring the latter into his trap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Jedi entered Core 5, Xanatos set the ion bombs on a timer, blocked the tunnel with a hidden panel, and shut off the lights. He used the dark area to his advantage, attacking and withdrawing at a very fast, vicious pace. But Jinn and Kenobi barely managed to defend themselves and each other from Xanatos' onslaughts. As the Jedi's Force bond grew stronger, they drove Xanatos into a corner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But Xanatos knew that the wall was a coated transparisteel door to a hidden turbolift. He slipped inside and shut the door before Jedi struck the impervious transparisteel. He told the Jedi through an amplifier that they were going to die, lying about there being mixed gases to disguise the bombs. Then, the Dark Jedi ascended to the mine, wishing Jinn a painful death. He prepared to immediate takeoff from Bandomeer, believing Bandomeer and the Jedi to be now doomed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, with the help of Kenobi, Jinn had enough time to deactivate the bombs, ending Xanatos' plans. When Xanatos had heard about this, he returned to Bandomeer. He infiltrated Governor SonTag's quarters, sneaked into Jinn's guest chamber, and stabbed a message through the Jedi's sleep-couch with a vibro-shiv. In the message, he vowed never to underestimate Jinn again, while looking forward to their next meeting. Then he had likely returned to Telos, where he planned to stripmine the planet to obtain wealth."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Gala"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For some time, Xanatos had been involved in the changing political climate on Gala. When head of the Ministry of Councilers Lonnag Giba feared that Prince Beju would lose the gubernatorial election, he secretly asked Xanatos to lend Offworld financial support for Deca Brun, who was another candidate, and many Galacian industries. In return, Brun had created a company called Galacian Mining Corporation, a front for Offworld's activities, which would include the enslavement of his own people. Half of Gala would be under Xanatos' control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the plans in Brun's records and exposed the conspiracy to Queen Veda, the ruler of Gala, resulting in Giba's arrest and the election of Wila Prammi as governor. At first, when he had been captured by Brun's men, Kenobi feared that Brun would contact Xanatos about the boy's and Qui-Gon Jinn's presence on Gala; Xanatos would use him as bait for his former master. Now that the elections had brought a peaceful transition to Gala, Jinn knew that he would place everyone on the planet in jeopardy, if and when Xanatos came after him there. He and Kenobi left as quickly as possible."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Attack on the Jedi Temple"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elsewhere, things were looking bad for Offworld. A mining operation on an \"inhospitable world\" was proving futile, but Xanatos stubbornly kept pouring more money into it, putting the company into a financial crises. When he had learned that the Jedi Council was holding a ship full of crystalline vertex for safekeeping in the Temple's Treasury Room, he sensed an opportunity and personally traveled to Coruscant. He infiltrated the Temple through its water tunnels, hiding his airspeeder there for his means of escape. He had also brought along a waterproof satchel for his back. When he discovered Bruck Chun feeling his chances of becoming a Padawan destroyed, he manipulated the young Initiate into becoming his apprentice, teaching him the ways of the dark side. To make sure that Chun was firmly put under his control, he slipped a listening device planted into the hilt of his accomplice's lightsaber. The Dark Jedi planned to see the whole Temple be destroyed and walk away with all the vertex in his possession."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To carry out his plan, Xanatos instructed Chun to steal a number of items: a toolbox from the servo-utility unit for him to bypass security and sabotage the systems of the Temple; holographic files and computer records containing the names of students from A to H, which contained Chun's file; the meditation robe of a Jedi instructor, which Xanatos could blend in with the other Jedi undetected; a fourth-year student's sports activity kit full of rebreathers to use underwater; every single lightsaber from the senior training rooms, thus rendering all older Padawans defenseless for an attack; and the Healing Crystals of Fire, which Xanatos would plant into the Temple's fusion furnace for its destruction. That had put all the classes and activities to a halt. At the training facility, Xanatos had a threatening message intended for Yoda written on the wall: COME YOUR TIME WILL. BEWARE YOU MUST, TROUBLE I AM."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xanatos prodded Chun to bring him updates on Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn. It was through this method that he had learned of Obi-Wan Kenobi's leaving the Order to support a rebellion on Melida/Daan. Chun had also told Xanatos of his rivalry with Kenobi, which, in one instance, led to a brawl in the Temple. At the same time as the thefts began, Xanatos discovered that Yoda was supplying a blinded Tahl with a navigation droid 2JTJ. He stealthy placed a transmitter inside TooJay to spy on Tahl and Qui-Gon Jinn, who were in charge of the investigation. He would always keep an eye on them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chun hid most of the stolen artifacts into a crate, which he hid in the Jedi Temple Lake Level. Unknown to him, Qui-Gon Jinn and a blinded Tahl had found the chest and were waiting in the darkened level to trail the thief. When Chun came back to retrieve the chest, Xanatos had already been aware of the trap and concealed his presence from the Jedi. He started following Jinn, who was trailing Chun; his intention may have been to assassinate his former Master from behind. However, while blind, Tahl could make out the intruder by his heavier boots and the brushing of the icus leaves. Suddenly, TooJay accidentally alerted Chun, causing him and Xanatos to disappear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, when Jinn left for Melida/Daan to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi, Xanatos made a false assassination attempt on Yoda to strike a blow into the Jedi's hearts. Disguised in the stolen meditation robe, he had placed a bomb under a footbridge in the Room of a Thousand Fountains, where Yoda would usually meditate. He gave off a surge of his dark side power, alerting Yoda to the bomb before it exploded. Satisfied, he ducked into a waterfall to escape and left a scaring message for the Council members in a meditation chamber: MEDITATE ON THIS, MASTERS: NEXT TIME I WILL NOT FAIL."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time Jinn and Kenobi returned, Xanatos had entered the Tech Center via the water purification tanks and tampered with the cooling unit as well as the lighting and communication systems; the disruptions frustrated the efforts of his old rival Miro Daroon, who was now the Tech Center supervisor. Later, he slipped into the lake level and placed a time bomb into all but one of the repulsorlift engines in the horizantal turbolift, which was carrying caretaker Ali-Alann and a bunch of younglings. In addition to this, he placed a bug on the Temple's central core to shut down every single comm unit and turbolift in the Temple. All of his were designed to divert the Jedi's attention away from him. Furthermore, with all the danger going on, wing after wing had been down, placing every Jedi in the central building; Xanatos' job of destroying them would be much easier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Xanatos heard Jinn and Tahl had finally identified him as the intruder and that a Mon Calamari Padawan named Bant Eerin discovered how he accessed the Temple, he submerged in one of the purification tanks to await the Jedi, cloaking his presence for a surprise. As he sensed Jinn, Kenobi, and Eerin arrive on the platform above the tank, he emerged from the water.

He jumped up after the Jedi, causing Eerin to dive and swim for help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xanatos engaged Kenobi and Jinn, hoping to lure them away from his airspeeder.

He demanded that the Jedi give back his airspeeder, have it fueled and placed in the spaceport, and hand over the vertex in fifteen minutes. If they refused, Eerin would die.

As Den turned toward the crowd, he asked the Governor to read aloud the durasheet he had given him before the final Katharsis round. The Governor complied, quoting ever last detail of Den's wager, which foretold what exactly happened in the ring. Den revealed to the crowd that he had rigged the Katharsis computer to win the lottery; in fact, every last contest had been fixed. He went on, shouting on how everyone on Telos had been played by UniFy, Offworld, and the \"mighty Xanatos.\" As a result, the crowd was in an uproar, calling for Xanatos' arrest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Xanatos had motioned the crowd to hush again. Instead of offering any more defense, as everyone expected, he simply smiled and scolded them for being \"pathetic fools.\" He fled aboard the winning contestant's swoop, which was the fastest of all three at the round, all the while dogging the Jedi as he headed for the Sacred Pools. Unfortunately, the swoop ran out of fuel and he was forced to use a gravsled. He neared Tech Dome D, where transport could take him off Telos. Jinn cut off his escape route, thus causing the frustrated Dark Jedi to veer toward a landscape filled with pools of black acid. Xanatos leaped from his gravsled and forced Jinn into a final showdown."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they fought, Jinn assured his former apprentice that he only wanted to bring him to justice, not kill him. But Xanatos' hatred for the hard man he had believed Jinn to be blinded him to reason. Moments later, Kenobi arrived to join Jinn in the duel. Xanatos taunted Kenobi on how he felt when he \"killed\" Bruck Chun, catching the Padawan off-guard long enough to kick him to the ground. He leaped in to finish Kenobi, but Jinn rushed to the rescue, catching the Dark Jedi in a midair blade-lock. Both combatants landed on their feet and Xanatos resumed his taunting of Kenobi. Jinn countered that it was Xanatos, not Kenobi, who was responsible for Chun's death by turning him to the dark side. Then, after silent encouragement from Jinn, Kenobi attacked Xanatos with renewed conviction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Together, the Jedi drove Xanatos toward the edge of one of the acid pools.

This compelled Senator Sauro to eventually come up with a plan to use Force-sensitive children to train pilots for the Galactic Empire so within a decade, the Empire would have an invincible fleet.

He always had a dual reason for every action and always seemed to be one step ahead of his adversaries. He was manipulative, deceiving when he wanted to be, and of course, like all Dark Jedi, pursued his own interests. He could also be overconfident.

He may have been greedy for money, but he wanted something more: revenge. He was willing to sacrifice a fortune or destroy a populated world to see Jinn die. As much as he hated the Jedi Order, he despised Jinn even more. He employed the dark formula for destruction very effectively and while his overconfidence and his singular hatred for Jinn were strong, they didn't prove to be fatal weaknesses.

He may have also studied Makashi, as he had perfected his dueling capabilities over time, bringing what Jinn had described as \"economy and grace\"; he would not tire so easily, a sign of Makashi's conservative approach. In a few instances, he would adopt a reversed Shien grip. Xanatos had enough strength to send shockwaves up Jinn's arms, suggesting that he was efficient with Djem So. He used a blue lightsaber crystal for his blade, before turning to the dark side of the Force and replacing the original crystal with a synthetic red one. Xanatos often utilized Dun M\u00f6ch in his duels with Jinn; he even succeeded into breaking Obi-Wan Kenobi's will, albeit temporarily.

Xanatos could delve into Force rage, increasing the strength and speed in his attacks.
