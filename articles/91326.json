These were lifeforms considered so dangerous that even the Galactic Empire would not consider weaponizing them. She used the parasitic symbiotes to maintain a hive mind over the inhabitants of a nearby village, enslaving them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Queen's hive-mind welcomed a wide variety of species including humans, Ezaraa, Twi'leks, Toydarians, Bith, and Rodians, she did not welcome Wookiees because the symbiotes did not like to be implanted in certain species. The Queen was assisted by at least three disciples including Bombinax, Varroa, and Vespinax. The Queen and the disciples also fed on the life energies of their subjects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the years, the Queen of Ktath'atn became known for her knowledge of the dark arts and interest in unusual organic lifeforms. Each year, the Queen would hold a special reception to receive unusual organic lifeforms including alien \"oddities\" and Force-sensitive beings.

Dr Aphra managed to convince Skywalker to accompany her to Ktath'atn by claiming that the Queen could help them to unlock the Rur crystal, claiming that Eternal Rur was an ancient Jedi Master who could teach him the ways of the Jedi. Dr Aphra and Skywalker traveled to the remote world with the Wookiee Black Krrsantan and the droids Triple Zero and Beetee aboard the Ark Angel II."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Dr Aphra and Skywalker were permitted to the Queen's reception, Black Krrsantan was not invited since the Queen was \"allergic\" to Wookiees. During the reception ceremony, Skywalker managed to gain the Queen's favor and attention when he used the Force to shove an Ezaraa that accosted Dr Aphra.

However, Skywalker and Dr Aphra realized the trap. As a precaution, Dr Aphra planted a detonator under the Queen's dining table, allowing them to flee inside the castle.

They fled deeper into the Screaming Citadel where they discovered a laboratory filled with tanks containing Abersyn symbiotes. Despite their attempts to secure the exits, the Queen and her forces forced their way into the corridors around the laboratory.

Before Solo could infect her, Starros managed to stop them. Starros was aided by the droids Triple Zero and Beetee, whom she had convinced to help her save her friends in returning for killing Dr Aphra.

However, Skywalker rejected Eternal Rur's offer of help because the artificial intelligence was not a Jedi and let go of his symbiote, allowing the Queen to kill his parasite."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the Queen was initially jubilant, she was horrified to discover that Skywalker had separated himself from the parasite. Having regained control of his body, Skywalker struck down the Queen with his lightsaber, ending her control over the hive and weakening Varroa and Vespinax.

Excited, Solo remarked that he wanted to do the Kessel Run in eleven parsecs, prompting Leia to order Triple Zero to tranquilize him and remove the parasite from him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knowing the danger of the Abersyn symbiotes, Dr Aphra ordered Beetee to burn the laboratory and Screaming Citadel.

He warned the rogue archaeologist to stay away from him and his friends."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dr Aphra, Black Krssantan, Triple Zero, and Beetee then departed on the Ark Angel.
