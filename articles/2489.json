They could understand instruction given in Basic, but had the tendency to be exceptionally literal-minded. Their rudimentary vocabulator allowed them to speak Basic, but their voice was harsh and buzzing and obviously synthetic. Those droids had a vocabulary of only 300 words. AR-2Bs were equipped with a C3-DD NeuroNet brain which was incapable of abstract thought of understanding hypothetical reasoning."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
