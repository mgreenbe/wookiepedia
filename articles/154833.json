The subject of the prophecy was featured prominently in the lore of the Sith Eternal, a cult of Sith loyalists. The dyad from the prophecy was formed by Ben Solo and Rey. Solo was a former Jedi who fell to the dark side of the Force and became Kylo Ren, the master of the Knights of Ren and Supreme Leader of the First Order, whereas Rey was a Jakku scavenger who became the last Jedi in existence after Luke Skywalker's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
