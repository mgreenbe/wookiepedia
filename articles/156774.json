The pilot received severe burns, and the resulting pain drove him mad. The pilot's friends took him to Caleb, a healer on the planet Ambria. There, Caleb injected the pilot with senflax, a neurotoxin that disrupted the nerves of the primary muscles, paralyzing them, but still allowing the patient to talk. After the toxin eased his pain, the pilot was able to tell Caleb about the chemicals he had been transporting, allowing the healer to administer proper treatment. Caleb's daughter was also present during the event, and she took notice of the effects of senflax. The girl went on to become Princess Serra of the planet Doan, and she used senflax to capture the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Bane in 980 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This pilot was briefly mentioned in Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil, a 2009 novel by Drew Karpyshyn.
