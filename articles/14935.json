One of the many pointless conflicts between the warring tribes of the Melida and Daan, it began when the Daan launched an assault against the Melida sector of the city. The cousin of the Daan child Nield was forced to fight, and she was killed in the battle, leaving eight-year-old Nield, whose parents had died in previous battles, on the streets by himself. About five years later, Nield's friend Cerasi would recount the struggles of his childhood, including this battle, to Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This battle is briefly mentioned in the 1999 young readers book The Defenders of the Dead, the fifth entry in Jude Watson's Jedi Apprentice young readers series.
