They were arranged thousands of years in the past in a large field before the Skull Queen's fortress on Mount Octan by Nallastia Octan, wife of the Margrave Octan, the moon's original colonists. Each megalith stood eight meters tall, separated from each of the other massive stones by a distance of three meters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Positioned in a triangular configuration, they created a powerful magnetic field (a lunar gravity vortex) that could only be broken by the countervailing effects of the Margrave's ancient power gems, which later came to be known as the Lost Stars of Nallastia, hidden by Nallastia deep within the Cavern of Screaming Skulls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fifty Nallastian warriors guarded the Trinity Stones, for if even one of them was toppled or damaged, the release of energy would be cataclysmic to the jungle-moon. But after Fondor had been liberated by the Jedi from the destructive machinations of Groodo the Hutt, the Skull Queen shut down the force field between the Trinity Stones, for the general good of Nallastians and \"outlanders\" alike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
