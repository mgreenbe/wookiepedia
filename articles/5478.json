During the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic and Commerce Guild both employed vehicles equipped with light ion cannons as antiaircraft weapons: the Self-Propelled Heavy Artillery walker and the OG-9 homing spider droid, respectively. Years later, the Galactic Empire converted a small number of its AT-AT walkers into mobile ion cannons, which became known as All Terrain Ion Cannon walkers.

The Kenner design team developed a number of new vehicle model prototypes for The Epic Continues through a kitbashing process, which involved taking pieces of existing toy models and combining them to create an entirely new model. For the AT-IC prototype, the Kenner designers took a full-size AT-AT toy model and replaced a large portion of its aft section with a rear-mounted ion cannon, calling it a \"heavily armed A.T.A.T used exclusively for mobile defense of strategic Imperial locations.\" However, Lucasfilm rejected Kenner's proposal for The Epic Continues, rendering the AT-IC outside the realm of Star Wars canon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Details of the AT-IC and the background story behind the failed The Epic Continues toy line were first revealed in the 1995 article Tales of Phantom Toys from Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 2, written by Stephen J. Sansweet. The AT-IC first officially entered Star Wars canon through the 2004 reference book The New Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology, co-edited by Sansweet, which provided a brief mention of the AT-IC among other ground vehicles equipped with ion cannons. In 2008, the AT-IC was provided an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, co-written by Sansweet, which included the Kenner design team's original description of the vehicle as a \"mobile defense of strategic Imperial locations.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At present, photographs of one of Kenner's original presentation binders for The Epic Continues are hosted on The Star Wars Collectors Archive website, including a picture of the original All Terrain Ion Cannon prototype model. The website notes that the AT-IC prototype's ion cannon was recycled from Kenner's original Death Star playset. However, despite mentions in Star Wars reference material, no image of the AT-IC was ever officially included in Star Wars Legends."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
