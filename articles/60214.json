Finding the item to be attracting to much of the wrong kind of attention\u2014thugs and soldiers who wanted the item but did not want to pay\u2014Ginder contacted a group of freelancers he felt would be more able to deal with the situation. He planned on leaving the head with them and washing his hands of the affair, but as he was telling his tale of woe to them in the Falling Rodian cantina, first the soldiers and then the criminals approached their table to try to claim the head. A three way battle between the factions ensued, but Ginder's allies were able to make their exit from the cantina with the head."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moments later on the street, they were approached by a protocol droid representing the droids of Uffel, which asked for the head. The freelancers again refused, and the protocol droid pressed a key on a datapad, arming explosives within the head, but quick action on the part of Ginder's allies was able to stop the explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
