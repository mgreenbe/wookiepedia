Around 32 BBY, the Circus was involved in an illegal smuggling ring of akk dogs which was exposed by Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Depa Billaba."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a particularly nasty controversy where an arqet escaped and killed twelve audience members in the lower levels of Nar Shaddaa, the Circus all but faded into obscurity.

During their stay, the Circus staff apparently \"misplaced\" some sick animals. Some time after their departure, the Corellian Defense Force got reports that these creatures miraculously recovered from their illnesses and were threatening the safety of nearby farmers. As tracking and removing these creatures could have turned into an time-consuming endeavor, Captain Peers hired a civilian hunter to deal with the beasts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
