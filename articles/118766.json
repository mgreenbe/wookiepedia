In passive mode, this device generated a 360-degree field in a five-meter radius. Sounds emitted outside of the \"bubble\" could not be heard inside of it. In active mode, a 60-degree arc was produced out to ten meters. Sound waves were dampened within this arc, preventing aural vibration form being heard, whether by live or automated detectors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
