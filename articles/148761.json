At some point in his life, Travgen lost his way and strayed down the path of the dark side of the Force. Surviving the disbanding of the Order and the collapse of the Republic, Travgen fled to the abandoned world of Ossus where he lived out his exile ruling over the Ysanna people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Force-sensitive, Travgen received instruction in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order and had ascended to the rank of Jedi Knight by the time the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Travgen's role in the war is unknown; though it is known by historians that the Jedi had fallen under the sway of the dark side of the Force and left the Order before the end of the war. When Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, truly the alter-ego of Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious issued Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army of the Republic, the Jedi Order was effectively disbanded and most of its members slaughtered. Because he was not directly involved with the Order or the war, Travgen survived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wandering the galaxy, Travgen discovered the ancient Jedi fortress world Ossus, a planet on which he would make his home. With his superior mastery of the Force, Travgen easily took control of several local tribes of Ysanna, the world's native people. As their ruler, he agreed to protect the ruins of the ancient Library of the Jedi, a looming structure located on the Eocho Mountains. Taking up residence in a dilapidated government building, Travgen occupied the world since around 9 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the fall of the Galactic Empire, Travgen would eventually be redeemed when he sensed the arrival of Luke Skywalker and Kam Solusar, who had ventured to Ossus in 10 ABY in hopes of finding documents in the library that would help rebuild the Jedi Order. Remaining hidden from these Jedi acolytes, Travgen allowed them to enter the Great Library and did not approach them during their visit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
