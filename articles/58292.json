After the Battle of Yavin, he was part of a group of thugs who lived in the slums of Mos Espa. This group also included Hilbrun, Eyleen and Tiomvo. Circa 1 ABY, they bought the booster controller of the R2 unit motivator to the junk dealer Watto. One of them left his swoop bike as collateral but they never paid Watto for the booster controller. Since this R2 unit was wanted by both Imperial Commander Barrezz and Rebel Captain Bastra, a spacer later tried to recover the motivator booster controller. Guz'Ordnak and the thieves attacked the spacer on sight but the spacer managed to retrieve the booster controller from Hilbrun's USV-5 Modified Landspeeder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guz'Ordnak was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
