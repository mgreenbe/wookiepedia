A native of the planet H'ratth, Sunrider was born in 4000 BBY as the daughter of Jedi Knight Andur Sunrider and his Force-sensitive wife, Nomi Sunrider\u2014as a consequence, Sunrider was born with considerable Force potential. However, in 3999 BBY, when Sunrider was still an infant, her father was killed by thugs on a delivery mission. Sunrider and her mother continued the trip without the slain Knight, delivering a shipment of Adegan crystals to the venerable Tchuukthai Jedi Master Thon on the planet Ambria. Thon took the two on as his Jedi apprentices, and the young Sunrider learned to control the Force in the ensuing years. During her training, Sunrider encountered many famous Jedi Masters, including the Krevaaki Vodo-Siosk Baas and the Draethos Odan-Urr, all of whom predicted that she would become a great Jedi Master. Vima Sunrider grew up in very unstable times, and she was frequently separated from her mother, who went on to become a prominent Jedi Knight, as she was forced to attend to business in a particularly violent period in galactic history. Sunrider was put in danger several times in her childhood\u2014she was nearly kidnapped by a hostile war droid during a clash on Deneba, and was caught in the middle of battles on Ambria and Ossus\u2014but ultimately emerged unscathed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Sunrider grew older, her mother took over her Jedi training, although she was too busy with her expanded role in the Jedi Order's leadership to attend to her daughter. As a result, Sunrider, who desperately wanted to be a full-fledged Jedi, became extremely frustrated with Nomi. Things came to a head in 3986 BBY, when Sunrider ran away from a Jedi conclave on Exis Station in order to find her own way to become a Jedi. Sunrider decided to seek out Ulic Qel-Droma, a once-famed Jedi Knight and lover of Nomi Sunrider who had been stripped of his connection to the Force after falling to the dark side and battling the Jedi during the Great Sith War about a decade prior. She eventually found Qel-Droma on the remote planet Rhen Var and convinced the initially-reluctant former Jedi to take her on as an apprentice. Sunrider proved herself to be an exceptionally dedicated student, and constructed her first lightsaber during her tutelage under Qel-Droma\u2014the two grew to have an almost father-daughter relationship. However, Nomi found out about her daughter's training with Qel-Droma, and worrying for her daughter, tracked her down to Rhen Var. Also arriving on the world was the Cathar Jedi Sylvar, who had lost her mate Crado during the Great Sith War and desired revenge against Qel-Droma. Although Sunrider helped facilitate a peaceful solution between all the Jedi involved, Qel-Droma was shot in the back by a spacer named Hoggon, who wanted to be a hero for killing the man he saw as one of history's greatest war criminals. As Sunrider grieved, the mortally wounded Qel-Droma pronounced her to be a Jedi for the first time.

Descended from a long line of Jedi, Sunrider was born on the planet H'ratth while her father was training in the Jedi way under Master Chamma. Sunrider's Force-sensitivity was quickly discovered\u2014along with her Jedi father, Sunrider's mother Nomi also possessed as-yet-unrealized Force potential. Shortly after Sunrider's birth, her father was sent on a mission to deliver a package of Adegan crystals to the Tchuukthai Jedi Master Thon on the planet Ambria in the Stenness system. It was determined that Vima and Nomi Sunrider would accompany Andur on his journey, alongside the protocol droid A-3DO on their starship, the Lightside Explorer. The group left for Ambria shortly afterward. The Sunrider clan made their way to the Stenness Hyperspace Terminal, a space station in the same system as their final destination, Ambria. However, their presence on the terminal caught the attention of Bogga the Hutt, a notorious crime lord who learned of the Sunriders' valuable cargo and sent several of his enforcers to take it for himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Sunrider and her parents settled down to eat a meal, the family was accosted by several of Bogga's thugs. During the struggle, Andur Sunrider was fatally bitten by a gorm-worm wielded by one of the enforcers, Gudb. Almost immediately after his death, however, Sunrider and her mother observed Andur's Force ghost appear\u2014as they were Force-sensitive, Sunrider and her mother were the only ones who were able to see the Jedi Knight's spirit. Andur directed Nomi to take up his lightsaber and defend Sunrider from the attackers. After Nomi drove the enforcers off with a display of lightsaber skill, Andur's spirit reappeared to Sunrider and her mother and directed them to continue the voyage to Ambria. The remaining Sunriders eventually made it to Ambria in the Lightside Explorer, and Sunrider traveled the rest of the way to Master Thon's compound asleep in her mother's arms. The Sunriders were invited into Master Thon's home by his Vultan apprentice, Oss Wilum, although they did not initially recognize the large, beast-like Thon as the Jedi Master whom they had been seeking. Soon after they arrived at the compound, they were attacked by Bogga and his thugs, who had come to Ambria in pursuit of the valuable crystals. It was there that Master Thon revealed himself, and he leaped into action and drove the gang away."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early apprenticeship"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Sunriders remained with Master Thon during the coming months, as the Tchuukthai had taken Nomi as his new apprentice. Sunrider's Force abilities grew over this span, as she learned to exert influence over the neek lizards with whom she often played. On one occasion, Sunrider followed the neeks to Lake Natth, a body of water that had a significant dark side taint. Upon reaching the lake, Sunrider was approached by a fierce hssiss dragon, a creature that had been mutated into its present form by the waters. Sunrider was frozen with fear by the hostile beast, but she was quickly saved by her mother, who warned Sunrider never to wander near Lake Natth again. Sunrider and her mother soon had to bid Oss Wilum, whom they had grown close to during their months on Ambria, goodbye, as the Vultan was called to support Jedi efforts during the Freedon Nadd Uprising on Onderon. After Wilum's departure, Thon decided to begin the Jedi training of not only Nomi Sunrider, but the young Sunrider as well. At the Tchuukthai's behest, the Sunriders set out on a trip across Ambria on their new Jedi Master's back. The three traveled through the Ambrian landscape, including an excursion near Lake Natth; all the while, Thon engaged in a debate about the Force with Nomi. During this discussion, Thon activated a Jedi holocron, which projected the image of the Neti Jedi Master Ood Bnar. Sunrider, unfamiliar with what she was seeing, was frightened by the holographic forms displayed by the holocron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they returned to Thon's compound, Sunrider and the others found it besieged by pirates sent by Bogga the Hutt to steal the Adegan crystal shipment. Helpless amidst the attack, Sunrider was shielded by her mother during the pirates' initial salvos. Nomi entrusted Sunrider's protection to A-3DO, and left to join the fight. The combined efforts of Nomi and Thon decimated the invading force, and Vima made it through the skirmish unscathed. The three soon left Ambria and traveled to the Great Jedi Library on Ossus to further the Sunriders' training in the Force. The group met with the respected Krevaaki Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas, who recognized young Sunrider as a future great Jedi. As Baas focused on training Nomi, Sunrider passed the time by playing with the other children of Jedi staying on the world. However, Sunrider and her mother were only on Ossus for a short time before Nomi was chosen to fight alongside Jedi forces in the Freedon Nadd Uprising. While her mother journeyed to Onderon, Sunrider stayed behind on Ossus, taken care of by the Jedi Order.

Vima Sunrider, still quite young, attended the convocation with her mother, who carried her to the gathering's location atop Mount Meru in her arms. However, the conclave soon descended into battle, as a massive force of Krath war droids and modified servant droids attacked the Jedi. Caught in the midst of the fighting, a terrified Sunrider was scooped up by an enemy droid, but she was saved and returned to her mother by the Cathar Jedi Sylvar. The Krath force was repelled, and Sunrider ultimately made it through the battle unscathed. After the fighting ended, Ulic Qel-Droma\u2014a Jedi whom Nomi had grown extremely close to over the past few years\u2014decided to infiltrate the Krath and bring them down from within. Although still a child, Sunrider realized even then that her mother was in love with Qel-Droma, and accompanied Nomi and Qel-Droma on a trip to the Great Jedi Library during Qel-Droma's preparations for his mission. When Qel-Droma was ready to embark on his quest, Sunrider and her mother saw him off, and Sunrider embraced a sorrowful Nomi after Qel-Droma's departure.

Odan-Urr saw considerable potential in Sunrider, and predicted that she would become a great Jedi Master who would train many apprentices. The galaxy was soon thrown into turmoil\u2014Ulic Qel-Droma returned from Empress Teta as a conquering Sith Lord alongside his Sith Master Exar Kun, and led a resurgent Sith Empire against the Republic. After a duel in the Galactic Senate that resulted in Vodo-Siosk Baas's death, Sunrider, her mother, and Sylvar traveled to Ambria to be with Thon. It was a joyous reunion for Sunrider, as she was once again with her Jedi teacher and friend. But almost immediately after their arrival, the Jedi were attacked by a pair of fallen Jedi\u2014Oss Wilum and Sylvar's mate Crado, who employed native hssiss dragons bent to their will.

A Sith-inflicted supernova in the nearby Cron Cluster had created a shockwave that promised to destroy the Jedi world. A mad scramble ensued as the Jedi on Ossus desperately tried to save whatever they could of the planet's ancient Jedi treasures in what few hours remained. Nomi entrusted Sunrider to Thon, who swore that he would get her to safety, while she and the others joined the preservation efforts. While sitting on Thon's back, Sunrider's attention was drawn to battling ships in the skies above\u2014among them were the vessels of Ulic Qel-Droma and his brother, Jedi Knight Cay Qel-Droma. Ulic had come to Ossus in a attempt to steal the Jedi treasures for Sith purposes, and after an aerial dogfight, he killed his brother in a lightsaber duel. Sunrider, still on Thon's back, witnessed the climax of the duel and her furious mother cutting Ulic off from the Force. A stunned Qel-Droma, realizing his actions, agreed to help his former friends to defeat Exar Kun and end the war. Sunrider and her mother left Ossus with Qel-Droma in his starship, and traveled along with thousands of other Jedi to Kun's base on Yavin 4, only to witness the moon engulfed in flames.

In 3986 BBY, Nomi called a Jedi Convocation on Exis Station, an ion mining facility in the Teedio system. Sunrider attended the Exis Station conclave along with her mother, and was overjoyed when she met Master Thon at the station. Still, Sunrider found herself intensely bored by the proceedings, and left the main chamber to observe the ion miners depart for work in a nearby hangar. On a whim, Sunrider decided to take control of one of the ion mining ships and join the convoy. Sunrider's inexperience with those craft nearly spelled her doom, as she became caught in a magnetic loop and her ship's instruments went dead. With her hull melting from the heat of the nearby sun, Sunrider escaped the craft in an escape pod. Although she was still in serious danger of her pod being drawn into the star, a nearby starship\u2014flown by the Twi'lek Jedi Tott Doneeta, who was late to the Jedi congregation\u2014rescued her by attaching a cable to her hurtling life-pod and pulling her out of harm's way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sunrider was returned safely to Exis Station, and the convocation continued as scheduled.

Sunrider realized that she wanted to learn under him during the Jedi conclave, where she heard a tirade against Qel-Droma by the Cathar Jedi Sylvar. At the time, Qel-Droma, who had escaped prosecution for his actions during the Great Sith War, was wandering the galaxy, his location unknown. Feeling that something in the Force compelled her to seek Qel-Droma out, Sunrider stowed away aboard a starship docked in the Exis Station hangar, trusting the Force to take her where she needed to go. She was soon discovered by the ship's pilot, a spacer named Hoggon. By chance, Hoggon had recently flown Qel-Droma to the icy planet Rhen Var, and Sunrider promised to pay him handsomely if he took her to the reclusive former Jedi. Hoggon took the offer and dropped her off at Rhen Var, directing her to a frozen fortress in which Qel-Droma was holed up. Although Sunrider was determined to find and learn from Qel-Droma, Hoggon worried for her safety in the harsh Rhen Var landscape, and he gave her a transmitter that she could use to contact him."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Meeting her teacher"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sunrider braved the frozen tundra of Rhen Var and managed to make her way to Qel-Droma's fortress.

Sunrider took this form to be Qel-Droma and ran to it as fast as she could. It was indeed Qel-Droma\u2014however, the former Jedi mistook the younger Sunrider for her mother, and began to walk away, thinking that he was going mad. Sunrider chased after him, introduced herself, and revealed her desire to learn the Jedi way from him. Qel-Droma abhorred the idea, as he couldn't even feel the Force, and forced the tearful Sunrider out of the fortress. In the midst of a heavy snowstorm, Sunrider found that her transmitter was not working and that she was stranded. Qel-Droma returned, and brought her to shelter in a pile of wreckage. During the blizzard, Sunrider and Qel-Droma engaged in a conversation about whether she truly wanted to learn from him\u2014despite his disbelief that anyone would want to be his apprentice, and his attempts to talk Sunrider out of it, Qel-Droma agreed to take her as his Jedi learner.

Sunrider had brought along the Adegan crystals that had once belonged to her late father, and when Qel-Droma believed the time to be right, Sunrider built her first lightsaber using the crystals. Sunrider promptly embarked on a series of training duels with Qel-Droma, who still retained his skills with a lightsaber even without the Force to guide him. In relatively short order, Sunrider became adept with the weapon. After gaining proficiency with the lightsaber, she put her newfound abilities on display in front of Qel-Droma\u2014it was then that he told Sunrider that he could no longer continue to train her in the Jedi way. Sunrider protested, but Qel-Droma insisted on behalf of his lack of a connection to the Force, comparing his situation to a blinded painter. In response, Sunrider suggested that he become like a sculptor, to use his talent to feel his way where he could no longer see. Qel-Droma took her idea literally, and decided to start a sculpture project with Sunrider. The two worked together to build a large scaffold near an ice-covered mountain and began their respective pieces, using their lightsabers as carving tools.

Nomi confronted Sunrider and Qel-Droma in the latter's citadel, and demanded that Sunrider return with her. Although Sunrider vehemently espoused the merits of her tutelage under Qel-Droma to her mother, using her newly-constructed lightsaber as evidence in his favor, Qel-Droma left the final decision up to Nomi. She was initially reluctant, but Nomi granted her daughter the chance to prove that her training with Qel-Droma was a good thing. Sunrider chose to show her mother the sculptures that she and Qel-Droma had created, although they had already begun to melt. The image of her late husband stirred emotion in Nomi, and the mother and daughter embraced. This tearful moment was quickly interrupted, however. Sunrider and her mother sensed a struggle between Qel-Droma and a presence that they recognized to be Sylvar. Sunrider rushed to the source of the trouble as fast as she could, and found the two fully engaged in a lightsaber duel. As Sylvar, who blamed Qel-Droma for the death of her mate Crado in the Great Sith War and had not gotten over the past, furiously attacked Qel-Droma, Sunrider's teacher shut off his lightsaber and refused to fight the out-of-control Cathar.
