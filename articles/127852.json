The runway was decorated by Sari Nadle, and AG-90 provided music. The ceremony was disturbed when the crackling pudding cooked by Mattis Banz had anilam added to it by Klimo, which caused Dameron, the bride and groom, and most of the attending guests to erupt in noisy flatulence. However, they all ended up laughing it off. At one point, General Organa wished that the Force be with the bride and groom. Wedge Antilles gave Wexley a pair of flight gauntlets as a wedding gift."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The wedding was first mentioned in the 2017 young-readers book Join the Resistance: Escape from Vodran by Ben Acker and Ben Blacker, and was portrayed a a year later in the comic Poe Dameron 25 written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Angel Unzueta. However, the two sources are incongruent in terms of the attendees, a result of the authors working on the same event from two angles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
