For Tarkin, then-recent loss of the Negotiator, the near catastrophe caused by the explosion of the rhydonium-laden Renown Venator-class Star Destroyer and the decision to entrust an unexperienced military tactician and a group of droids with the task of retrieving something as critically important as the Separatist encryption module were worrying signs that the Jedi Order could cause the Galactic Republic's defeat in the Clone Wars. Tarkin thus suggested the relief of command from the Jedi, citing their ever-present reluctance to accept their military role."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Full Text"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The document appeared in a Facebook post for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series two days after the episode \"Point of No Return\" aired in Canada; and three days after its airing in the United States.
