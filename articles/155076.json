During the siege, the droid's brain was not able to determine how to go about its duties in light of the battle, and it attempted to issue a parking ticket to what was in fact a live bomb planted by the Mandalorians in the planet's Middle City. The act caused the bomb to detonate, injuring nobody and amusing many beings nearby. The Taris Holofeed reported on the incident afterward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The surveillance droid is mentioned in the in-universe news organ The Taris Holofeed: Siege Edition, which was written by John Jackson Miller and included in the fifteenth issue of the Knights of the Old Republic comic-book series, which was released on April 4, 2007."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
