The source of the crystals was Aeten II, a planet also located in the Dreighton Nebula. While the Stygium mines on the planet had long before dried up, Batch was able to obtain previously unreachable crystals by using the Tarkin superweapon to destroy the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY Rebel operatives Ru Murleen and Rookie One discovered the facility after the destruction of the Star Dreadnought Terror and moved in to ultimately disable its production capacity. The facility was destroyed when its reactor was damaged by the two Infiltrators and went critical. The resulting explosion destroyed several Star Destroyers docked with the station, a large portion of Imdaar Alpha's surface, and the Empire's entire surplus of TIE Phantoms, effectively ending the project."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
