In fact, many noble families had a proud history of military service, and more than a few of those houses had laid the foundations of their business empires by working as part of mercenary units.

Privileged noble youth were expected to enroll in the New Order's programs, such as the Sub-Adult Group of COMPNOR, in order to better prepare themselves as future Imperial leaders, such as future Moffs, or join the ranks of the Imperial Military.
