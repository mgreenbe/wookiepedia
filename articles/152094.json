Their homeworld, which was located on the Pinooran Spur hyperlane of the Gordian Reach sector, between the Mogoshyn and Kli'aar systems, was scouted by colonists from Setor looking for possible sites for a colony. The species went unnoticed during the initial survey of the planet, but were discovered upon the first major landing on the planet's surface. Their sentience rendered void the Colony's title to the planet, a fact later celebrated by the scout Lile Gorsek, who found the swamp-planet dismal and so was relieved not to have any ongoing connection with it. The species had developed to a pre-industrial technology by the time of the Galactic Empire. The Empire interdicted their homeworld, but never actually exploited the species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jonatha Caspian created this species in 1989 for West End Games's Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin.
