At some point, the pilot was on patrol in a B-wing starfighter, along with Hootkins. The two Rebel pilots did not detect anything on their patrol route and were preparing to return to base when the pilot detected some unusual readings on his starfighter's sensors. Hootkins, however, did not initially detect anything and the two pilots were closing their B-wings' S-foils when they came under attack.
