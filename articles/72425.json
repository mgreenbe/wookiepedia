The citizens of Jundland Station asked Echuu and his clone trooper forces to destroy the Tusken Raiders that have been harrassing the settlement. Aggreeing to help them, Echuu and his troops wiped out the nearby Tusken village, destroying all of their tents and killing all men, women, and children. In their gratitude, the villagers have rewarded the Republic forces with resources and Kaminoan droids, allowing the Republic to set up a base and prepare for the battle against Boorka and Confederacy's forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jundland Station was a location in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its expansion pack, Clone Campaigns. It is encountered in the third Galactic Republic campaign mission, \"Never Trust a Hutt\". Although technically a side quest, the Jundland Station's request to destroy the Tuskens must be completed to get the necessary resources to create enough forces to win the mission without the use of cheat codes. To complete the side quest the player is required to either wipe out or turn every man, woman, and child in the Tusken village to the east of Jundland Station, and also destroy their buildings. As such, it may be presumed that the whole Tusken settlement was wiped out by Echuu's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The other version of the \"Jundland Station\" was accessible via a bonus mission in the Liberation of Kashyyyk mission of the Wookiee Campaign.
