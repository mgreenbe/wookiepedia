They lived in a castle named the Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux. The family was known for developing the Malreaux rose. The Viscount Malreaux performed experiments on midi-chlorians that drove the populace of Vjun insane, leading to them murdering each other in 29 BBY. One of the few survivors was the Viscountess Whirry Malreaux, who gave her son, Whie, to the Jedi Order so he could escape the horrors of his birthworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
