This pilot instructed the transport to follow them away from the battle and down to the planet and to land in a Rebel hangar where she believed they would be safe. Her squadron escorted the vessel, attempting to guide it to the hangar, but they were ambushed by droid fighters along the way and the transport had to continue alone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
