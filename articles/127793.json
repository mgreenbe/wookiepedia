If the plans were recovered, the star cruisers could be used against Imperial Star Destroyers. However, a frontal attack against such a heavily guarded planet would be suicidal. Instead, the rebels opted for a smaller raid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mon Mothma put out a call for smugglers, saying there would be a paying mission, although not saying what the mission was. As expected, Han Solo and Chewbacca, who she had had previous experiences with, answered the call. After they demanded extra payment in return for damages to their ship during previous rebel operations, Mon Mothma said there would be no reason for the Millennium Falcon to leave the ground at all. Instead, the duo of smugglers were shipped on an imperial transport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After getting off the ship, Han Solo decided the most likely place for the designs was in a cargo area.

The power generator, along with an uplink station, was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Going the rest of the way on foot, the duo captured the plans, and decided to steal a transport to escape.
