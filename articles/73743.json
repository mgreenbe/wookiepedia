They also had black teeth, and yellow eyes. Developing from a feudal, tribal people with a defining sense of battlefield honor, the Kalzerians had not yet reached the atomic era by the time of the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Kalzeron was subjugated by the Galactic Empire, some Kalzerians such as the mercenary Azuroth Khell joined off-planet resistance movements, intending to gather equipment and training enough to return and liberate their planet in a glorious revolution. Before this came to pass however, Kalzeron was freed from the Empire's yoke following the Battle of Endor, when Imperial forces were withdrawn. Those Kalzerians who had left the planet were branded as cowards by their fellows on their homeworld's resistance and a formal charter from their over-council decreed them as traitors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
