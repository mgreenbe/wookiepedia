In 20 BBY, during the Clone Wars, CT-802 served on the planet Drongar, where the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems fought for control of the planet's fields of bota, a highly-valued plant with exceptional medicinal qualities. As the brutal fighting raged on between the two sides, CT-802 was injured and was struck with a deadly infection contracted via a local mutated microbe. Unconscious, CT-802 was brought to the Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7 to undergo treatment. However, the infection was unknown to the RMSU's doctors, and none of their medicine seemed to work, not even spectacillin, which usually helped against most of Drongar's microbe-carried diseases."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "CT-802's condition worsened with every minute: he had a fever that the doctors were barely keeping down with analgesic suppressors and coma induction; his liver was working overtime and was getting tired; his white blood cell count was off the charts; fluid began to fill his lungs; and his kidneys started to shut down. In addition, he had an erratic heartbeat secondary to cardiac tamponade, an emergency condition caused by the accumulation of fluid in the sac that contained the heart. Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee, who was stationed at the RMSU, was able to stabilize the trooper with the Force, but she was not strong enough to sustain him for long."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The only thing that could potentially save CT-802 was bota, but the doctors were prohibited from using it, as the Republic had deemed the plant too expensive to waste on clone troopers. However, surgeon Jos Vondar possessed a secret supply of bota, inherited from his deceased friend and colleague Zan Yant. Having recently changed his views regarding the value of clone troopers' lives, Vondar was determined to save CT-802. Violating his orders, Vondar provided some of his bota for CT-802's treatment. After an intramuscular injection of bota extract, CT-802 got better. His fever was gone, and his organ systems were on the mend. All in all, the trooper was fully awake and nearly well, although his white cell count was still slightly elevated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all of Jango Fett's clones, CT-802 stood 1.83 meters tall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "CT-802 first appeared in MedStar II: Jedi Healer, a 2004 novel written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry.
