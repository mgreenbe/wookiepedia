They consisted of substances such as scorched alloys or flash-frozen hunks of dirt and rock. Scientists believed that the shards were the remnants of a shell that once encapsulated Penegelen. The shell was thought to have potentially been a creation of an ancient species known as the Celestials."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Penegelen Shards were originally meant to be mentioned in the 2012 source book The Essential Guide to Warfare by Jason Fry and Paul R.
