The remnants operated a secret refinery dedicated to the refinement of rhydonium, a valuable but volatile fuel source used in starships. Their operations were halted when Din Djarin, accompainied by a mixed group of experienced combatants including Boba Fett and Carasynthia Dune, infiltrated the refinery in order to find the location of an Imperial remnant group commanded by Moff Gideon. In the ensuing skirmish, former Imperial sharpshooter Migs Mayfeld used Boba Fett's cycler rifle to destroy an Imperial Combat Assault Transport laden with unrefined rhydonium, setting off a chain reaction that heavily damaged the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A group of Imperial remnants operated a secret rhydonium refining facility on the jungle planet of Morak. Their forces consisted of at least one platoon. They fielded a number of stormtroopers, shoretroopers, Juggernaut Pilots, Imperial weapons technicians, and Imperial officers. In terms of vehicle support, they were equipped with at least two TIE fighters and at least four Imperial Combat Assault Transports, the latter of which were used to transport the shipments of rhydonium to the refinery. Its command structure included the number of aforementioned officers, including Valin Hess, a veteran of Operation: Cinder operations on the planet Burnin Konn. Hess stated the remnants would use the refined rhydonium to bring havoc to the galaxy, hoping such destruction would allow for the rebirth of the Galactic Empire. The facility was run by ex-Imperial Security Bureau personnel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The remnant groups were active by around 9 ABY and located on the forested planet of Morak. They were formed around a secret mining facility and refinery that processed rhydonium, a starship fuel source that was extremely unstable in its unrefined form. When elements of Moff Gideon's Imperial remnant captured Grogu, Din Djarin enlisted the aid of New Republic Marshal Carasynthia Dune, bounty hunters Boba Fett and Fennec Shand, and ex-Imperial sharpshooter Migs Mayfeld to assist him in locating the child and freeing him from Gideon. Mayfeld led the motley group to Morak, stating that an internal Imperial terminal was necessary to locate Gideon's fleet. Mayfeld and Djarin commandeered an Imperial Combat Assault Transport designated Juggernaut Five laden with rhydonium, and successfully drove it to the refinery, where the duo were hailed as heroes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon entering the base, Djarin successfully accessed the terminal and obtained the location of Gideon's fleet, but was stopped by Valin Hess, a former superior of Mayfeld's. Hess congratulated the disguised infiltrators, and invited them to have a drink. When Mayfeld confronted Hess about the loss of the latter's division during Operation: Cinder, Hess stated that the lives lost were for a good cause\u2014the Empire. Taken aback by the response, Mayfeld broke cover, shooting and killing the officer. The duo was forced to fight their way out of the facility, covered by Dune and Fennec's expert precision with sniper rifles. Djarin and Mayfeld successfully escaped in Slave I, piloted by Fett. As Slave I flew away from the facility, Mayfeld used Fett's cycler rifle to fire upon one of the Assault Transports, which destroyed its rhydonium payload, setting off a chain reaction that caused heavy damage to the base. Two TIE fighters attempted to shoot down Slave I, but were destroyed when Fett deployed a seismic charge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Morak Imperial remnants appeared in \"Chapter 15: The Believer\" of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Rick Famuyiwa and released on December 11, 2020.
