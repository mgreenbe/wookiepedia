A holy place for the local Coruscanti, the Republic hoped by granting the Order land they would build a massive fortress like those they had established on Ossus, Falang Minor, and Haashimut. However, the Order did not wish to entangle themselves with the politics of the capitol or become a symbol of war and opted to build only a small meditative enclave. It wasn't until the Old Sith Wars saw the devastation of Ossus and the Great Jedi Library located there that the Order decided to re-establish its academy at the sacred spire. At the behest of the Order's wisest thinkers, the Four Masters began the painstaking task of building the Temple Ziggurat.

Marching up to the gates of the Temple, a raiding party of Sith led by Darth Malgus entered the Temple and slaughtered the complex's main line of defense in order to shut off Galactic City's security network. Once dismantled, Malgus' assault team planted bombs within the Temple and detonated them when the Sith fleet opened fire from the skies.

Discovering Commander Gin Lesl amongst the rubble, Zym assumed that she was prepared to tell him something. However she was just as confused as the Kel Dor Jedi. It was at that point the bounty hunter Braden revealed that he had information regarding the Sith assault on the Envoy and the subsequent death of Master Dar'Nala. Commander Lesl was confused as to why she had been summoned before Braden shot her for having him arrested on Dantooine.

It was only after the defeat of the Brotherhood of Darkness during the New Sith Wars and the end of the Republic Dark Age that the Temple would see its reconstruction completed with the refocusing of the Order at the Ruusan Reformation. Consolidating most of their efforts on Coruscant, the Order closed most of their satellite facilities and dismantled the Army of Light and began getting away from the militaristic teachings left over from the war with the Sith. With the Sith believed to be extinct, the Order and the Republic entered into a time of peace and prosperity known as the Golden Age. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, the Temple had been infiltrated by one of the last Sith following the Reformation.

The Lake Level, and an expansive menagerie beneath the Temple brought additional places of natural beauty and study to the Temple's halls. The Detention Center was built above the Fountain room and used to contain the Sith Lords and their creatures that ran rampant during the early Republic era. The Temple's architects brought in recovered materials from Ossus that had been stored at Exis Station and incorporated them into the Temple's design. Marble tiles were placed in halls and chambers while a portion of a recovered stained-glass arcade were placed in the Meditative Walkway that ran the perimeter of the Temple's base. At each corner, chapels were built to mirror the aspects of the Force reflected in the towers that would be constructed upon the Temple rooftop later in its history."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While there were many attacks on the Temple during the early years of the Republic, it would continue to be restored and rebuilt stronger than before. Following the rebuilding of the Temple in 3500 BBY, several decades after the Sacking of Coruscant, the Temple was once again home to the Order and its academy which had previously transferred to the Order's homeworld of Tython. Repurposing of architectural treasures saw the old library and its study halls transformed into a museum of Temple history and a formal banquet hall after the Jedi Archives were established in 2519 BBY. The Temple's structure continued to expand through 2000 BBY and eventually the Temple's spires were rebuilt in 1019 BBY signaling the end of all major expansions to the Temple. The pale stone exterior finished, the Temple now shone out as a bright beacon of hope and a firm reminder of the strength of the Order. Statues, memorials, and gardens covered the roof of the Ziggurat, along with wide open plazas which doubled as landing platforms for visiting diplomats. Clerestories were incorporated into the roof to allow natural light to spill into the Temple's halls and gardens, while the rest of the Temple was lit with a soft, soothing blue light. The accommodation sector of the Temple was crafted so that the rooms could be adjusted to make the many species of Jedi comfortable through the use of specialized atmosphere adaptors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of the Jedi Service Corps research operations, the Agricultural Corps maintained a laboratory at the Temple. The Medical Corps had a presence in the Halls of Healing, with an express turbolift connecting the Temple to the Republic Central Medcenter. The Healing Halls was the place where the Jedi healers practiced the most sacred techniques of the Order, saving the lives of countless Jedi over the years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the years leading up to the Clone Wars, it was noted that the Temple, particularly the exterior, was suffering from neglect. Flaking paint was evident around the mid to lower levels and long green streaks from bronzium gutters ran down the sloping walls. Electrochemical corrosion was occurring where molded metal sheets had lost cathodic insulation buffers. The massive architecture of the Temple was capable of concealing many of the transparisteel windows, imbued with permem to help maintain a constant gravity balance, and balconies that stemmed from the structure. The ventilation system of the Temple funneled all outward air out through ray shield-protected vents that were hidden in an overhang near the roof. Plumbing concerns were run through municipal water ways, with small alcoves for access to the machinery built into the walls of the tunnels. During the Separatist Crisis, hangars were constructed in each of the four Council towers to house Delta-7 Aethersprite interceptors, and the later Eta-2 Actis interceptor model. The hangars each had an extendible landing platform"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While war broke out around it, the Temple managed to maintain some of its normality. The rooftop gardens continued to fuel the Order through the refectories and kitchens. Located near the Tower of Reconciliation were the gardens overseen by Master Yoland Fee. All food that Fee could not grow was shipped into the Temple by food companies and deliver in lower level hangars. The Jedi academy held an annual Apprentice Tournament along with other special tests open to all members of the Order in a specialized sparring arena. The tests held here were used to monitor a students abilities as well as expose them to the scrutiny of Jedi looking for potential candidates for apprenticeship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Temple was raided and ruined, the interior architecture was pock marked and riddled with blasterfire. The ceiling was collapsed in areas and pillars crisscrossed ancient halls. Marble floors were cracked and bookshelves toppled. The stormtroopers stationed at the Temple had blocked off areas by erecting large blastdoors, sealed off to all but the Emperor himself. On the outside the Temple simply looked like a burnt-out husk of its former self, a testament to fighting the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Temple first appeared in 1999 with the release of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
