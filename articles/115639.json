Only five were created before they were replaced with Master Replicas in 2003/2004, which included Darth Vader's helmet, which also had both the mask and helmet removable, as in Return of the Jedi, Boba Fett's helmet, a ROTJ-era Stormtrooper helmet, Luke's X-wing helmet, and C-3PO's head. The stormtrooper helmet was the rarest, with Boba Fett being second rarest.
