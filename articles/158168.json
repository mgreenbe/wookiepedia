Although they were shorter, they were evolutionary relatives of the Geonosians, but unlike their genetic cousins, they were only semi-sentient. The ur-greedles were attracted to shiny objects, and made off with a few lightsabers after the First Battle of Geonosis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The species had a hard, crimson-colored exoskeleton, three digits with talon-like claws that could be used for digging, and six wings that gave ur-greedles the capability to fly.
