Thousands of years after Systech went out of business, the blaster's original design was revived by SoroSuub Corporation as the SSB-1."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The blaster fired a powerful bolt of electricity generated by high-energy piezoelectric crystals within the weapon. It was only useful at closer ranges, but a couple of blasts from the weapon were capable of bringing down a Wookiee or even a full-grown gundark. Due to the low energy requirements to supercharge the crystals, energy packs in static pistols could power the weapon through thousands of firings. However, the internal alignment of crystals was very exact, and the pistol was prone to stop functioning if damaged or roughly handled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
