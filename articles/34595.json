Already a member of the ruling Dark Council, Baras desired to rule the entire Empire alone, and therefore he imprisoned the true Emperor's Voice\u2014the host of the Sith Emperor's essence\u2014on the planet Voss and attempted to proclaim himself the Voice. However, he betrayed his apprentice in the process, and the Sith Warrior was granted the position of Emperor's Wrath by the Emperor's Hand and pursued Baras's power base. The coup ended when the Wrath killed Baras in their duel before the rest of the Dark Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
