He invested all his small finances into a small sector of Nar Shaddaa, from which he planned to grow into a larger criminal organization. He mostly dealt with information and setting up meetings for others. He also had rented out apartments to up-and-coming smugglers in hopes he could come across some information he could use against them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many of his schemes involved setting old rivals against each other for his profit. However, instead of reinvesting his money wisely, he spent it on pleasure chambers, insidious death traps and security systems rather than ships, spies and enforcers. He was most proud of the Falleen Lady, a casino and pleasure house with pheromone-enhanced hostesses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
