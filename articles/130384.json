The term year often referred to a single revolution of a planet around its star, the duration of which varied between planets; the standard year was specifically a Coruscant year, which was the galactic standard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The length of a planetary year was determined by the orbital radius and speed of the planet. Satellite planets\u2014moons orbiting a gas giant\u2014were almost always tide-locked to the gas giant they orbited, and may have had days several dozen hours long (as long as it took the satellite to orbit the gas giant). The local year of a satellite depended on the orbit of the gas giant and may have been several standard years long."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game originally established a year that contained ten standard months (of seven standard weeks consisting of five days) plus three Fete Weeks and three more holidays, though this was overridden in favor of a 12-month dating system in later sources."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
