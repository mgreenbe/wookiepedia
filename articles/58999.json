The Hall was a trompe l'oeil, vanishing at the hau polyp throne built for the Supreme Overlord. The walls were built of chitin marble, with four entrances for each of the Ruling Castes. It was supported by pillars made of the bones of some large beast, with laces of yorik coral across the arches of the roof. Special dovin basals gave the room a peculiar sense of gravity: as one got closer to Shimrra's throne, it would feel as though they were walking \"up hill\", as though approaching the Supreme Overlord was in of itself a great task. Special seats and pews were made for the Great Council that compensated for the gravity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
