An ambulatory fish, the firehead used its high body temperature to burrow into the ice, and could be found on the surface of the Zirfan Glacier. Their knobby upper jaw was used to melt and scrape the ice, and also used to kill the firehead's prey. These creatures served as sources of both heat and food for the native Rhinnalians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
