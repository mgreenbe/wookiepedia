He contacted Genasys, to try and make a commercial deal with them, to allow him to enter the company and develop the drug. Genasys responded by sending a group of soldiers from the Genasys Security Division to meet with Sethven in the shop Natural on the planet Cularin, where he was based. However, Culpharm, a rival company, were tipped off about the deal, so sent a group of operatives to the shop, to stop the deal from taking place. The Culpharm operatives attacked the Genasys team, resulting in a firefight between the two. The issue was eventually resolved and Sethven took up a position in the Genasys R&D department."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Genasys also had close links with the Metatheran Cartel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
