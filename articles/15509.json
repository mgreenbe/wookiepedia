The beam cannon fired a steady red laser beam at a direct target for about two to three seconds and afterwards it would have to take three seconds to recharge. In those few seconds it could do a large amount of damage to any infantry unit, and could even take down a destroyer droid's shields in one blast. The turret was often used against infantry units, but it could also do some minor damage to armored tanks during a battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
