The Ewok grew depressed, and his friends\u2014Teebo, Latara, and Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka\u2014forced the lucksprite to confront him and admit its manipulations.

The lucksprite accompanied Teebo to Bright Tree Village, where he helped Warrick fire three arrows directly into a bullseye, even splitting the tree on which the target rested."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lucksprite had merely been hiding its true nature, however: it was really a bad lucksprite. When Warrick took his warrior's test, the lucksprite barraged him with bad energy. The Ewok's vaulting pole snapped, he grabbed a spiny creature from a tree instead of a doll, and he landed on a log, which rolled into the judges' platform and caused it to collapse. The village chief, Chirpa, declared Warrick fit only to be an assistant bordok stable sweeper. With Warrick in the depths of despair, the lucksprite admitted its true nature to the Ewok's friends, Teebo, Latara, and Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, and then escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before long, Teebo found the lucksprite and coerced it to come and admit its meddling to Warrick, who was moping in the Cavern of Broken Dreams. As Kneesaa tried to coax Warrick out of his stupor, an arachnid creature attacked her, and the lucksprite saw its chance to wreak more havok. The sprite caused Kneesaa to drop her lasso, without which, she tumbled into the arachnid's web, strung across a deep canyon. The lucksprite dodged an attack by Teebo and Latara. It then saw Wicket W. Warrick emerge from the cavern and attempt to rescue Kneesaa by snatching her up and tightroping walking with her on his shoulders. The lucksprite zapped the rope, though, forcing the Ewoks to swing to the safety of the canyon side. Before the lucksprite could strike again, however, Teebo pulled its hat over its head and put a stop to its mischief. The Ewoks managed to defeat the arachnid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeing its bad luck work foiled, the lucksprite cried in despair.
