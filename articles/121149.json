Handheld, it fired a blast that caused a droid to go completely dead. The droid could not be reset; it would require a microprocessor cleansing and would lose all vestiges of its old personality."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the moon Telti, the Dark Jedi Brakiss was equipped with a scrambler while overseeing a droid construction facility in 17 ABY. The Warden 10-24 security droids of the Red Terror also brandished them, and one security droid attempted to fire one at the protocol droid C-3PO during a droid uprising. It missed and hit another security droid, and Brakiss later threatened to scramble both C-3PO and his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2. However, he was thwarted by an army of angry astromechs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
