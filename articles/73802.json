Shortly prior to the battle when Republic reinforcements arrived to bolster the orbital and planetary defense, Prime Minister Lama Su stated in response to Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi that the Republic blockade was far too strong, and that the Separatists would not dare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kamino blockade made its first appearance in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"ARC Troopers.\" Later, the magazine \"The Beginning of the Clone Wars\" stated the blockade was formed by General Shaak Ti in response to learning about Grievous's invasion plans; however, Arc Troopers itself establishes the blockade to be in existence before she and Lama Su are made aware of Grievous's plans.
