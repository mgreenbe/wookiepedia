Thousands of years after Nastuonodon had passed away, the Electric Caliphs lay in wait, unused for millennia. Unable to defeat or to come into negotiation with the Gargantelles of the neighboring planet Boz Pity, the Hutts hired a team of Nimbanese lawyers to persuade the sultan's droids to wage war and destroy the Gargantelles. Having accomplished their work, the Electric Caliphs then immolated themselves by igniting Mourn's crust."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
