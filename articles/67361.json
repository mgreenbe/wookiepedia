As with other ion weapons, it fired ion energy which disrupted electrical systems, but was not very effective against organic targets. It was similar to an ion rifle, however it had the advantage of shooting in autofire mode, that is, rapid automatic fire, allowing the user to take down several droids at once."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Great Sith War saw the rise of assassin droids and war droids, which compelled the creation of advanced ion weaponry such as the ion carbine.
