It was created using the power and materials extracted by the Sun Razer in the Vesla system. One of its notable designers was Colonel Rebus. Using the Sun Razer, the resurgent Sith Empire was able to complete its creation in years instead of decades. All the projects fueled by the Sun Razer were overseen by Darth Mekhis and discovered by Theron Shan and Jedi Master Ngani Zho upon their infiltration and capture in the Vesla system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the Cold War, the Republic became aware of the Gauntlet's existence and the Empire's intent to mass-produce it. Thus, they prepared a joint strike force to take it down. While a Republic fleet engaged the Gauntlet, Havoc Squad and the Safecrackers infiltrated and sabotaged the superweapon from within and escaped before it was destroyed. Unfortunately, General Arkos Rakton used the Gauntlet's destruction as an excuse to launch a campaign against the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
