UnuThul failed to notice the trap, but he was later warned by Partial Joiners Jaina Solo and Zekk, thus the Great Swarm ceased their pursuit and instead regrouped beneath the southern pole, foiling the Bothan fade. Also, Jedi of the New Jedi Order learned about Bothan fade during tactic lessons in the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
