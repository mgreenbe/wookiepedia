The droid then threatened Katarn and tried to have him decipher the information on a disc he found in Morgan Katarn's home. Katarn retaliated, but 8t88 had already escaped, forcing Katarn to hunt down 8t88 and the disc. Katarn chased 8t88 over the Nar Shaddaa cargo docks and caught up to the droid when he was about to leave in his shuttle. Before 8t88 could escape into his shuttle, Katarn fired his blaster at the droid's right shoulder, which severed the arm that held the disc. After 8t88's shuttle left, a TIE bomber appeared and started firing at Katarn, but immediately after that Jan Ors in the Moldy Crow shot down the bomber. Katarn informed Jan that he plans to meet her at the top after he retrieves the disc.

To Katarn's disbelief, he found house crawling with Grave Tuskens. Despite the uninvited guests, Katarn made his way through his old home, but found the path to his father's workshop caved in. Kyle did not despair, for there was another way into the workshop, located beyond their water supply. As Kyle entered the workshop, he saw it in disarray, but immediately spotted the family droid WeeGee. After Kyle turned the droid on, he inserted the disc he got from 8t88, and was shown a recording of his dead father, Morgan Katarn. In the recording, Morgan told his son that he had left two very important items for him. The first is a lightsaber that had belonged to the Jedi Qu Rahn, and the second is the map to the Valley of the Jedi, which had been embedded in the stone ceiling. The ceiling was, however, what the Dark Jedi had loaded onto their ship, so Katarn made it his next mission to locate the map. He was, however, unable to take the same way back since he had entered the room from the ceiling, and the exit was blocked.

The city had been forcefully taken over by the Empire and had a giant fortress constructed in the middle of the city. Kyle assumed 8t88 was in the top of the fortress tower and started making his way through the city. After a difficult time getting into the fortress tower, Katarn used the elevator to reach 8t88's chambers. The droid has just finished sending the deciphered map to Jerec, and was told his payment awaited him on the starship Sulon Star. Katarn entered the room and demanded the map back, to which 8t88 replied that it is all his for the taking. However, immediately after that an elevator descended from the roof with one of the Dark Jedi. Yun, the newest of the Dark Jedi, proceeded to make short work of the map by destroying it. He blasted Katarn with his Force powers and exclaimed that he had expected more from the light side. Kyle defeated the young Dark Jedi who then told him to finish him off. Katarn spared Yun's life, however, which confused the young man. Yun escaped through the roof, and Katarn set off after 8t88. But Katarn is too late.

To avoid alerting the Imperials of their presence, Katarn sneaked aboard the ship through the giant fuel lines of the station. Once aboard, he traversed down to the docking bays on the lower deck. As Katarn came upon 8t88's shuttle, he opened the door behind it, and to his joy, found 8t88 standing right there. But when Kyle touched the droid, its head fell off, alarming the Jedi in-training. From behind him emerged the so-called twins of the Dark Jedi, the small Pic and the much larger Gorc. Boodle informed Katarn that he would not be lucky to experience the Valley of the Jedi, and attacked Kyle. Despite having to face two foes at once, Katarn defeated them and claimed 8t88's head.

The Moldy Crow landed in the mountainous area nearby in order to conceal its presence. Katarn made his way through the rocky surroundings to an elevator that would take him up to the Sulon Star's landing platform. He was, however, attacked by Maw as soon as he stepped out of the elevator. Katarn battled the levitating half that was Maw to the Sulon Star and defeated him there. In his final moments Maw provoked the Jedi by telling him how he gave Morgan Katarn a slow sweet death and thrust his head on a spike. Katarn slashed Maw to death in anger with his lightsaber. Behind him Jerec approached and commended Katarn for going down the path of the dark side, which he claimed was Kyle's true calling. The Dark Jedi had also managed to capture Ors, and as a final test he demanded Katarn to strike her down. The Jedi refused and was sent flying by Jerec's Force push to a catwalk connected to the Sulon Star. The force of Jerec's attack caused enough damage for the cargo ship to lose its hover capabilities and start to descend, pulling some of the landing platform with it. Katarn jumped on board the Sulon Star, and in a desperate fight with time made it to a lower docking bay where the Moldy Crow was being held. Katarn took control of the Moldy Crow and managed to narrowly escape the crashing cargo ship, but he was unable to straighten the ship properly and crashed a stabilizer into a rock formation. Without its proper flight capabilities, the Moldy Crow crash landed. The three Dark Jedi\u2014Boc, Yun, and Sariss\u2014pulled the incapacitated Katarn out of the wreckage and waited until he started to regain consciousness. Boc smashed Katarn's lightsaber with a rock while making fun of it and left to assist Jerec. Sariss took out her lightsaber and was just about to strike Katarn down when Yun intervened. By instinct Sariss lashed out at the young Dark Jedi, inflicting a deadly wound. As she asked why, Yun replied that Katarn was a Jedi and deserved a battle. As Yun passed away, Katarn regained complete consciousness and took the dead man's lightsaber.

Katarn found himself inside ancient ruins and stumbled upon traps and Kell dragons. Eventually, the Jedi reached the center of the valley where he found Ors tied to a pole. After Kyle rescued Jan, Boc surprised them from behind, having concealed himself as a statue. Brandishing two lightsabers, Boc attacked Katarn, but was defeated by the latter. At that time, Jerec awoke from his meditation inside the center of the valley. Having mastered a great amount of power from the valley, he attacked Katarn. As they fought, Jerec set in motion ancient machinery that would have eventually granted him the full power of the valley. The Dark Jedi was, however, stopped at every turn and soon lay at the mercy of Katarn. Jerec remarked that he was defenseless and implored Katarn to finish him off. To further entice Katarn to the dark side, he reminded him that he was the one who killed his father. Katarn used the Force to grab Jerec's deactivated lightsaber off the ground and told Jerec that he has not forgotten, then threw the saber back at Jerec's feet. The Dark Jedi charged for one final attack but was cut down by Katarn. The spirits that had been trapped in the valley for a long time were finally released and started flying around in the chamber in a spectacle of light. As a tribute to his father and Qu Rahn, Katarn erected two statues in the valley.
