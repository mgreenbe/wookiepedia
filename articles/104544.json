It participated in the Battle of Scarif in 0 BBY, where it was completely disabled after being subjected to an attack run by a Blue Squadron X-wing, Blue Four Barion Raner, that destroyed its starboard-side bridge-mounted deflector shield generator, followed by a bombing run of ion torpedoes from the Y-wings of Gold Squadron. The crippled Star Destroyer was then pushed by the Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvette Lightmaker into the Star Destroyer Intimidator, shearing it in two. The wreckage of all three ships subsequently crashed into the Shield Gate and destroyed it, allowing Rogue One to transmit the Death Star plans to the Rebel flagship Profundity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Persecutor first appeared in the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
