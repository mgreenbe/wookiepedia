At one base where the Wookiee leader Chewbacca was preparing troops to attack a Trade Federation outpost, two troop centers were built to train dragon troopers as well as bowcaster troopers and grenade troopers. A force of twelve Wookiees, including Chewbacca, boarded transport ships and crossed a river to reach the outpost. The dragon and grenade troopers used their weaponry to bring down the light wall surrounding the oupost and the central troop center, while Chewbacca and the bowcaster troopers brought down the B1-Series battle droids guarding the outpost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One dragon trooper was present in Chewbacca's camp when it was attacked by a Trade Federation strike force commanded by LUH-989.
