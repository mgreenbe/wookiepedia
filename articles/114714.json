On Exegol, the Resistance faced the full might of the Final Order, led by Allegiant General Enric Pryde. Although the Resistance was initially vastly outnumbered and nearly beaten, General Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca arrived with reinforcements in the form of a citizens' fleet. A healed Emperor Palpatine attacked the Resistance and galactic forces, but he was stopped by Rey. While General Dameron led the air team, General Finn led the landing team onto Pryde's command ship after he switched the source of the navigation signal needed for the Sith fleet to deploy off of Exegol from a navigation tower on Exegol to his ship's beacon. Finn and Jannah turned Pryde's turbolasers against his own ship, destroying it, and with it, the navigation signal. With the remaining ships of the Sith fleet trapped on Exegol, the Resistance and galaxy fleet retreated back to Ajan Kloss, where they celebrated their victory.

An organized group, the Resistance had a designated rank system for members in both the army and navy. The ranks were simple but often had variations. The Army used the following ranks in descending order: General, Colonel, Commander, Major, Captain and Lieutenant. The Navy used similar ranks listed here in descending order: Admiral, Vice Admiral, Colonel, Commander, Major, Captain, Lieutenant. An additional rank, lieutenant commander, was used by Nien Nunb after the Battle of Crait. Rank badges with rank symbols indicated a soldier, officer, or pilot's rank.

Owing to its lessened pool of manpower, the Resistance placed a greater emphasis on treating the wounded and returning them to duty, and as a result finding medical equipment was a high priority. Resistance troopers commonly utilized the BlasTech EL-16HFE blaster rifle and were ferried into combat on Resistance transports, which were heavily modified transports assembled from varying vessels from previous wars. Gian-211 patrol speeders and an army of droids helped keep the Resistance up and running, with many robotic workers given more responsibility and independence than elsewhere in the galaxy and seen as more than just droids, which was a continuation of the ideas of the Rebel Alliance. Many protocols of the Rebel Alliance also remained in use, with code K-one-zero signaling the evacuation of a base, which was most notably used during the Battle of Hoth.

Many of the youngest kids were used to fill out the ranks of the Starfighter Corps and were recruited from local planetary defense forces.

The symbol adorned the helmets of Resistance starfighter pilots, who were known to use T-70 X-wing starfighters in combat, which were older than the New Republic T-85 X-wing. Owing to New Republic demilitarization efforts, acquiring capital ships was near impossible. Consequently, the Resistance base on D'Qar contained two starfighter wings, code-named Red and Blue.

While the Republic officially tolerated the Resistance, some military commanders like Major Lonno Deso disliked the Resistance for allegedly exaggerating the threat posed by the First Order. While the Republic believed that the First Order were a minor but troublesome Imperial remnant that exaggerated their strength and power, the Resistance saw the Order as a threat to the New Republic and the galaxy. Some in the New Republic saw the Resistance as extremists, and others regarded General Organa, who had been sidelined from the political process by a new generation of political leaders, particularly after the revelation of her father being Darth Vader, as an alarmist at best and a warmongerer at worst.
