The Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster's eatery, Dex's Diner, which was located in the CoCo Town district of the planet Coruscant, used it to flavor several dishes. A 12.5 breakfast dish consisting of Nerf steak and two gartro eggs used the pepper as part of a special seasoning which had been passed down in Jettster's family for generations and consisted of the pepper, Serrian salt, punctil, and tertium. Gartro egg salad sandwiches, a lunch dish costing 5.5, also used the pepper along with Serrian salt as seasoning for gartro egg salad with emulsauce, Boontaspiced mustard and taba leaves all served on therm-zapped Pseudograin bread. As a dinner meal Dex's served grilled Opee sea killer fillet seasoned with the pepper and Roonan lemon, then served with celto and Iskalonian tartar sauce all for 9.7.
