The gang, one of the most well known on that ecumenopolis, was known for the thuggish demeanor of its members. During the lead-up to the Mandalorian Wars, the gang was led by a sentient named Benno, a being who did not like to be well known. In the wake of the planet's liberation by Revan and Malak, a former member of the Hidden Beks, Brejik, took control. Disgruntled with not having been made leader of the Beks following Gadon Thek's blindness, which had been caused by a swoop accident, Brejik left his former gang and took over the Vulkars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This change in leadership brought about a drastic change from the gang's earlier reputation. Through the use of coercion, threats of force, and pure iron will, Brejik molded the group of petty thugs into a group of zealots, mobilizing them for a brutal street war against the Hidden Beks. As the Sith Empire under Darth Malak conquered Taris, the war continued, claiming the lives of anyone who got in the Vulkars' path. The Vulkars also refused to accept the Tarisian underworld's hierarchy, openly defying crime lord Davik Kang, who was in charge of Exchange operations on that world. When the reprogrammed former Dark Lord of the Sith, Revan, who had been trapped on Taris by the Sith quarantine, arrived in the Lower City, he sided with the Hidden Beks. He believed that they could help him to find and free the Jedi Padawan Bastila Shan. Unbeknown to him, she was captured by the Vulkars after crash landing in the Undercity of Taris. After Revan and Shan's actions at the Tarisian Season Opener, including killing Brejik, the gang became less intrusive in the Lower City."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "During the Mandalorian Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Black Vulkars attained recognition as a swoop gang within the Lower City of Taris at some point prior to 3964 BBY, the level of Taris already known for poverty and lawlessness. At this time the gang was lead by a being known as Benno. However, in comparison to other swoop gangs, such as the Hidden Beks, the Black Vulkars were known for acts of recklessness and idiocy, and cast an overall negative impression on residents of Taris. One known incident involved a number of Vulkars, including Wargo and Frazznik, attempting to apprehend the fugitive Jedi Padawan, Zayne Carrick and his Snivvian companion, Marn \"Gryph\" Hierogryph. Hoping to claim the bounty on their heads for their alleged involvement in the Padawan Massacre of Taris, Gryph convinced the Vulkars to attempt to rob a nearby group of Wookiees, claiming that they had stashes of spice, letting him and Carrick escape from the area. Another instance involved the young Mission Vao, when she first met the Wookiee Zaalbar, who was being taunted by a trio of Vulkars. According to Mission, when later telling Revan of the story, she attempted to make the gang members back off, but they instead focused on her. Furious, Zaalbar attacked the Vulkars, frightening one into unconsciousness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Taris Siege, a siege of the planet by Mandalorian forces, the Black Vulkars fought against the invaders, but generally employed uncoordinated strikes and avoided uniting with the resistance during the occupation, preferring to spend the rest of their time looting."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New leadership"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after the Mandalorian occupation was ended, in the wake of the Second Battle of Taris, the Black Vulkars changed leadership. Brejik, a former member of the Hidden Beks, had hoped to attain leadership of the gang after their current leader, Gadon Thek, lost his eyesight in a swoop bike accident, but Thek still believed that Brejik was not yet ready for such responsibility so he stayed on. Feeling enraged at not being promoted to the position he thought he was so close to claiming, Brejik, along with some of the younger Beks, left to take over the running of the Vulkars. Though already having a grim record, the gang became even more wanton in their violence under Brejik's control, becoming heavily involved in the illicit drug trade, as well as dabbling in interstellar slavery. They also took to open war against the Beks on the streets of the Lower City, and even attacked civilians and Sith troopers during the Sith occupation at the height of the Jedi Civil War."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Blockade of Taris"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was the Vulkars who captured Bastila Shan after her ship was destroyed over Taris by the Sith. This was the main reason for the Sith occupation and quarantine, to prevent Shan from escaping. The former Sith Lord, Revan, and his fellow crewman and survivor from the Endar Spire, Carth Onasi, were pushed to find Shan as she was a highly important figure for the Galactic Republic, using her abilities in battle meditation to assist in the war effort. When Revan first visited Javyar's Cantina, he witnessed Calo Nord, a notorious bounty hunter infamous for his 'no nonsense' attitude and his shortness who worked for Davik Kang in the Exchange on Taris, killing a trio of Black Vulkars, and then witnessed a group of Black Vulkars picking on Mission Vao, who were scared off by Mission's friend, Zaalbar. Later, Revan was able to secure the aid of Gadon Thek during his mission to rescue Shan, Revan had to infiltrate the Vulkars' base to steal back the Beks' prototype accelerator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base was located to the West of the Hidden Bek Base in the Lower City and was used primarily as their base of operations and the area for storing and maintaining their Lhosan swoop bikes. Revan was aided by Mission who managed to deactivate the force field in the Taris Sewers with a keycard that she had stolen from a drunken Vulkar at the cantina. When in the base, there were many Vulkars, but they were all killed by Revan's party. Revan did however choose to free a slave, Ada, from the base as well as let a Twi'lek Vulkar go free after he said that he did not like the new direction Brejik was taking the gang. Revan succeeded in retrieving the accelerator that the Vulkars had intended to use themselves, and Kandon Ark, the Vulkar garage manager, had even offered a deal for Revan to kill Gadon in return for Shan, but Ark was killed by Revan. Revan finally rescued Shan by winning a major swoop race. Bastila had been offered as the prize and was present at the event albeit restrained by the Vulkars with a neural disruptor. Furious at losing her, Brejik reported that Revan cheated in using a prototype accelerator in his swoop, but the head of the swoop race refused to acknowledge the move and said that the tradition was, once something was anted up, it could not be returned once the race was over and that the decision could not be changed. At this point Shan used the Force to overload her restraints and pull her Vulkar guard to her making him smash into the cage, releasing the lock. As the guard tried to get up, she swiftly roundhouse kicked his head, killing him, and took his weapon, a vibro double-blade, to use in her own defense. The Vulkars, including Brejik, then attacked Revan, but were killed by him and Shan. A considerable number of Vulkars fled the skirmish too afraid to fight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Viewpoint"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Benno was in control of the gang, the Vulkars were little more than common thugs on Lhosan swoop bikes harassing the locals. They were usually found trying to acquire spice in some way or another among other crimes such as looting and muggings.\nHowever, when Brejik seized control of the gang, he turned their focus to the destruction of their rivals, the Hidden Beks. He also brought the gang deeper into the illicit drugs and slavery trades. The Vulkars went about their business so vehemently that even the Exchange, an interstellar crime syndicate, started to notice them giving Davik Kang, the head of the Exchange on Taris during the Jedi Civil War, cause to hire mercenaries to keep the Vulkars out of his affairs. One particular mercenary was Canderous Ordo. On one occasion, an Exchange member was confronted by a pair of Vulkars.

These two Vulkars were later captured by the Mandalorians and taken to Jebble where they became Neo-Crusaders. Doba was a Rodian member and a less skilled swoop pilot than Redros was.
