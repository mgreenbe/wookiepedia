Such weapons were useless against the armor worn by the Imperial stormtroopers, though the stormtrooper charger wielded stun batons as part of their specialization. Charging droids used by the rebel cell Spectres at Haven, a hideout of theirs, to train against these troopers were also equipped with stun batons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
