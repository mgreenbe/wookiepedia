Within the hour the Healing Crystals of Fire had been stolen by an unidentified thief and the two Jedi were tasked with finding him. Later, after it was revealed that Padawan Chun was responsible, Yoda summoned Jinn back to the chamber to receive a message from his ex-Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi who was currently on Melida/Daan. Kenobi had left the Order in an attempt to assist the Young, a resistance group trying to end the conflict that threatened to destroy the entire population to the last man and woman. However one of the Young's leaders, Cerasi, was dead and Kenobi needed help. While Yoda sent a response, Jinn left the Temple to go to Kenobi's aid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to the Temple with Kenobi, Jinn went to the conference chamber to be informed that the High Council was holding a shipment of crystalline vertex for the Galactic Senate.
