This system was comprised of two components. Firstly, the aiwhas had \"buoyancy chambers\" in their skull that would fill with water when diving under Kamino's oceans and empty when on the surface. Secondly, thick layers of porous tissue were found on the ventral sides and wings of the creatures that retained and released water as was necessary in order for them to regulate their internal ballast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
