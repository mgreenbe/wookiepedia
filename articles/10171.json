The aim was to secure coaxium supplies and to destroy the insurgents that were near the area. Ahr sent out V-wing starfighters to annihilate them resulting in most of the insurgents dying. As Ahr saw the coaxium supplies, he recalled all of his fighters though Vader in his starship attacked, causing the destruction of the coaxium that Ahr wanted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
