During the Galactic Civil War, Berserker groups remained in hiding due to the Empire's Human High Culture. They typically entered battle wielding two extremely large Ryyk blades, although they could also use bowcasters as ranged weapons, and were equipped with light armor for maximum mobility on the battlefield. Advanced Berserkers from Ittummi were used to great effect during the latter parts of liberation of Kashyyyk. Six Advanced Berserkers joined in the raid on Avatar Orbital Platform. Legendary stories told of the Berserkers' exploits, speaking of their ability to single-handedly decimate mercenary cadres. They were fierce combatants, fast-moving and very quick in their attacks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aron Peacebringer compared the Calian Battle madness to \"berserker rage.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Berserkers and advanced Berserkers appear in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack.
