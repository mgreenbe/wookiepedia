In 11 ABY, he founded the New Jedi Order, and began teaching Force-sensitives about the ways of the Force at the Jedi Praxeum, fulfilling his destiny as the first of the new Jedi. In the midst of this rebirth came numerous challenges for Skywalker and his apprentices, including the Black Fleet Crisis, the Almanian Uprising, and the lure of Waru, but Skywalker, aided by fellow Jedi and his friends, was able to overcome each trial.

Skywalker endured countless battles as the New Republic was first pushed back, including the fall of his home on Coruscant. However, the newly reformed government, labeling itself the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, regrouped and helped push back the alien invaders. In the final stages of the war, Skywalker sought out the living world of Zonama Sekot, convincing the planet to join the Galactic Alliance in a final battle on Coruscant, in which Skywalker personally led the assault on Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane's citadel and slew Jamaane.

Despite the successful handling of the Dark Nest Crisis and the Swarm War, lasting peace was yet to be achieved, as the Second Galactic Civil War broke out a few years later. Skywalker was plunged into a dark time as his nephew, Jacen Solo, became a Sith apprentice under his old adversary Lumiya and slew his beloved Mara. His grief was further compounded by his son's treading near the dark side as well, but he continued to lead the Jedi, forming the Jedi Coalition to oppose the rule of the Alliance by his nephew, now a Sith Lord by the name of Darth Caedus.

The twins' mother had been choked by her husband on Mustafar after Skywalker believed Amidala to have betrayed him, causing Amidala to lose the will to live and die not long after giving birth to Luke and Leia. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda knew that the children, both having a natural affinity for the Force, needed protection from Palpatine and their father. Deciding it would be best if they were separated, the two Jedi Masters agreed to send the infant boy to live with his father's stepbrother, Owen Lars, and his wife, Beru, on Tatooine.

They soon discovered a Sand Person buried in the sand, and took his gaffi stick. They then sought shelter in a nearby cave but a pack of womp rats drove them back out into the storm, where they stumbled upon a red and white astromech droid. Annie rigged up the astromech's motivator to explode, causing a flare. Unfortunately, the flare attracted the attention of a krayt dragon that attacked the two boys. Skywalker lost sight of Annie, but on instinct, he killed the dragon by throwing the gaffi stick at its throat. Exhausted, Skywalker fell unconscious but, fortunately, Owen and a rescue party found him. Once they did, there was no sign of the krayt dragon or Annie.

When prompted with inquiries about his father's involvement in the Clone Wars, Lars told him that his father had been \"a navigator on a spice freighter.\" Despite this mild deception, Skywalker became an adventure-seeking youth, piloting his Incom T-16 Skyhopper through Beggar's Canyon and racing his landspeeder with little regard for his own safety.

Darklighter was perhaps Skywalker's closest friend, whom he looked up to as a brother. Biggs left for the Academy in 1 BBY, much to Skywalker's pride, jealousy and dismay.

There, the Jedi faced more danger, to Luke's dismay, but showed signs of their continuing growth in the use of the Force, leading the Jedi Master to believe that they would become powerful Jedi Knights.

Dreaming of becoming an adventurous Jedi, Uldir demanded to be brought before Luke Skywalker. Luke agreed to test the boy, but did not find much, if any, Force potential within him; however, he allowed Uldir to stay at the academy for several months with his parents' permission. After a conversation with Ikrit, Luke realized that Anakin was upset by thoughts of who he really was inside. At the Kushiban Jedi's suggestion and the approval of the Solos, Luke allowed Anakin to go to Dagobah with his friends, in order to give the boy time to explore his inner self. After the kids returned, including Uldir, who had once more stowed away, Luke met with each individually in his office to discuss their encounters, before sending them on to talk to Tionne.

According to Tionne, a Hutt information broker located Kenobi's lightsaber in an abandoned castle on Vjun. From Tionne's description, Luke quickly recognized the castle as Darth Vader's former fortress, Bast Castle.

Discovering the theft of the objects, and the disappearance of Uldir and Ikrit's Sunrider, Anakin, Tahiri, Tionne, Ikrit, and R2-D2 flew to Exis Station. There, they rescued the artifacts and Uldir, who had nearly been corrupted by the false magician Orloc.

She had since been cured by the Theran Listners and accepted into their ranks. Luke warned Sel about Abeloth and expressed interest in learning the Listener technique Mnemotherapy. Sel informed the group that Abeloth's Ship had been spotted near Bleak Point Station. Sel then brought the group to Listener-Master Taru Durn who taught Luke mnemotherapy.
