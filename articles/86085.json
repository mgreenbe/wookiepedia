Situated in the planet's capital city of Keldabe, the MandalMotors tower stood one hundred meters tall, and was adorned with the corporation's large mythosaur skull logo. The tower's size made it a Keldabe landmark, and pilots would use it as a point of navigational reference when approaching Keldabe's spaceport. Around the tower's base stood a series of additional engineering workshops, in addition to a private landing strip, and a research wing consisting of a number of interconnected sheds and hangars that, while run-down and unassuming on the outside, housed advanced technology and company prototypes within. The tower also housed a portion of the company's production facilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "MandalMotors tower was built years before the galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems known as the Clone Wars. By this point, the tower had already become an easily recognizable facet of Keldabe's skyline, and had been in used in the business of creating quality starships for a significant time. MandalMotors customers could collect parts and equipment from the company headquarters. After the foundation of the Mandalorian Protectors in 20 BBY, the newly risen Mandalore the Resurrector led his troops to capture the facilities of MandalMotors for exclusive use by the Confederacy, with whom he had recently allied the Mandalorians with. Despite the habit of using the tower as a navigational landmark many Mandalorian pilots had adopted, when the Republic was transformed in the Galactic Empire and Imperial forces arrived on Mandalore to establish a garrison on land leased out by the clans, Imperial gunships nearly clipped the top of MandalMotors tower during a low-flying sweep over the capital city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 29 ABY, long after the Empire had fallen and Imperial forces were driven from Mandalore, the planet was attacked by the extra-galactic invaders known as the Yuuzhan Vong.

However, with the fresh lode of beskar iron ore found on Mandalore in 40 ABY, the company redesigned the Kyr'galaar as the new Bes'uliik-class assault fighter, and MandalMotors CEO Jir Yomaget met with reigning Mand'alor Boba Fett at the tower's research wing to debut the new starfighter. With Fett's approval of the designs, the production of a series of Bes'uliik prototypes was brought underway at MandalMotors tower's manufacturing facilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "MandalMotors tower was first introduced to the Star Wars univeres in the 2006 e-novella, Boba Fett: A Practical Man by author Karen Traviss.
