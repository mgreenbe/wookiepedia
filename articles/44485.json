The Solo theme was recorded in March of 2018 with a 98-piece orchestra in London's Abbey Road Studios, and features the 36-voice Vanya Moneva Bulgarian choir."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Powell stated that his intention in composing the theme was to add in a novel, exotic voice to the film's soundtrack. Powell took inspiration from John Williams' choral writing in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, establishing the new choral sound while harkening back to Williams' style. Knowing that the orchestration would be very aggressive, Powell brought in the Vanya Moneva Bulgarian choir for their particular sound, since they do not sing vibrato and contribute a \"real aggression.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Solo: A Star Wars Story, the theme is first played when Enfys Nest and her Cloud-Riders arrive at the train heist on Vandor to take coaxium from Beckett's gang, with Powell using the Bulgarian choir to change the musical movement to frighten audiences. At the climax of the film, when Enfys Nest and her crew are revealed to be vigilantes helping out the innocents of the galaxy and take over the Savareen outpost, Powell again uses the choir to change the musical movement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
