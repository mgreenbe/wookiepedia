During his captivity, he befriended with Vermon Skeetz, a mentally sick man who managed to be fine as long as he took his medication. Circa 1 ABY, Vermon Skeetz escaped the bunker with a group of slaves led by Kyran Silene but he lost his medicine during the escape. A spacer later infiltrated the bunker to find evidence of the slaver operations for the Corellian Security Force. The spacer met Akers Radch and explained that Vermon was experiencing a psychotic episode, ordering to assassinate Akers. Nevertheless, Radch agreed to help the spacer to retrieve Vermon's medicine. The spacer eventually broadcasted the slavers' records on the CorSec emergency request channels, leading dozens of CorSec agents to quickly move to the slaver bunker and free all the slaves. After he escapaded the bunker, Akers brought the medicine to Vermon who quickly recovered from his crisis and apologized for his aggressive behavior."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Akers Radch was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
