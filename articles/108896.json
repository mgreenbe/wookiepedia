Shaped like the letter \"Q,\" the Q-wing was oval-shaped, with the ship's round structure enveloping an empty oval area of space into which the cockpit, affixed to the inwards-facing walls of the ship's main structure, protruded. An engine, which was dark in color and emitted orange exhaust, was located directly behind the cockpit, jutting out from the ship's outwards-facing walls. The ship bore white plating with red markings, and its cockpit housed a seat that held a single pilot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
