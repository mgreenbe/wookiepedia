It was led by Wyl Lark's squadron and the 61st Mobile Infantry, to attack Colonel Soran Keize's forces at the Core Nine mining megafacility on Troithe. General Hera Syndulla later arrived with reinforcements, that included the Temperance and X-wings from Vanguard Squadron, following a distress call received from Chass na Chadic. Keize gathered all surviving TIE fighters aboard a bulk freighter. Using missiles recovered earlier from the Edict's crash site, Keize launched them toward the city below, leaving Wyl Lark to call off their pursuit of the freighter and prevent the missiles reaching the ground. Just before Keize's freighter entered hyperspace, Yrica Quell, onboard a cloaked starship she had found while trapped on an asteroid, secretly attached her ship to the hull of the freighter and escaped with Shadow Wing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
