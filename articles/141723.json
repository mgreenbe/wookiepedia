As dictated by the Rules of the Blade, the tente was a non-lethal duel used to settle internal disputes among themselves. The result of the duel resolved the dispute in favor of the winner, with the loser having the choice to either agree or be marooned. By far, most pirate dueling was done according to tente rules. The objective was to cause the opponent to fall unconscious. Use of energy blade weapons was strictly prohibited and punishable by mutilation or death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
