He had been a Senator for Dac in the Galactic Alliance Senate and by 130 ABY, he was a member of the Triumvirate.

There, he announced to both the council and holonet that one-tenth of the Mon Calamari population would be eliminated. He then had the entire Mon Calamari Council, Calamari and any Quarren who disagreed, slaughtered. Gahan furiously protested this, saying it was genocide, and Krayt agreed and proceeded to execute Gahan personally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
