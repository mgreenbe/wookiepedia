When the Galactic Empire claimed the world, the Ssither were used as labor in the rutgar-4 mines, along with imperial laborers and Sla Kar from nearby Demophon.

When the Galactic Empire first opened the rutgar-4 mines Ssither were used as forced labor, but the explosion that led to the mine's automation also destroyed all records of the Ssither. The species became unknown to most, even on their own planet. Doctor Soron Hegerty of the Imperial Species Identification Bureau re-established contact with the Ssither, but realizing that the Empire would never stop their mining operations because of a native species she kept their existence a secret. Afterward she led the Ssither in raids against the mines. As the Demophon supernova approached, she called on the Alliance to Restore the Republic to help the Ssither evacuate Jatee before its destruction. Those Ssither who were evacuated were relocated to Butler's Cove in the Stribos system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
