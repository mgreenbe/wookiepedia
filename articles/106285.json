One of the first factory builds created, the Mammoth was notable for its Split-X turbojet engine, which was chem-boosted to make it one of the fastest turbines used in the sport. Extremely fragile and dangerous, the engines were fueled by tradium pressurized with quold runium, activated with ionized injectrine, to give the pod an extra speed boost. Because of these attributes, the pod had a loud, unique, fast-paced, high-pitched engine rumble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The maneuvering jets and advanced variable control surfaces allowed the Mammoth to fly easily in the air, making it one of the top five best-selling factory customs for decades.
