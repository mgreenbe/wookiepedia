After the death of the Emperor, Fyyar fell in with former Procurator of Justice Hethrir and his Empire Reborn faction. Fyyar became one of Hethrir's top lieutenants. He worked closely with Desann, another of Hethrir's lieutenants, to develop methods of infusing non-Force-sensitives with the Force. The pair carried out their experiments on Kejim until the outpost was destroyed by Kyle Katarn. Desann and Fyyar managed to turn this to their advantage, tracking Katarn to the Valley of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There, the pair put their research to use. Artusian crystals focused the Valley's power into minimally Force-sensitive recruits, creating the dark Jedi order of Reborn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fyyar also created a cortosis-based armor, resistant to lightsabers.

The New Republic saboteur contacted Rogue Squadron, which attacked the Doomgiver upon its exit from hyperspace. Fyyar, in his battle suit, managed to surprise Katarn as he was in the process of destroying the ship's shield generator. Fyyar was too slow, however, and Katarn took out the generator with a lightsaber throw. Enraged, Fyyar attacked Katarn, but even his shielded cortosis armor proved no match for Katarn, who fought and struck the admiral down with his lightsaber. The suit malfunctioned and exploded, vaporizing Fyyar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galak Fyyar was voiced by Steven Jay Blum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During combat, Galak's shield generator can be disabled by destroying his armor's antenna with weapon fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There are three ways to defeat Galak in his Cortosis armor, after the shield is brought down. The first one is to use force speed and your lightsaber combined to deliver extra fast strikes while his shield is recovering. Since force speed slows down the action and speeds you up, it will take a seemingly long time for his shield to regenerate, and you can deliver strikes much faster. The second way is to pummel him with force lightning. His armor seems to be highly vulnerable to that attack. This is also effective against his shield. The third way is to use saber throw on him. This will only work when the shield is down because if the player tries to hit the shield with saber throw, the saber will just go inside the shield, and the player will lose control of it on entry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rank plaque on Galak's uniform has a different layout than most others.
