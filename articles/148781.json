A Yuuzhan Vong officer joined the warrior and ordered the sisters to return to their room, but they told him it was impossible, since certain parts of the ship were locked down. When the Yuuzhan Vong brought an engineer to verify Alema and Numa's story, Alema used the Force to persuade the engineer that Travot did exist, though worked with a work crew other than that of the engineer's. Alema and Numa then were allowed to continue onward to their objective with the warrior as their escort. However, the voxyn managed to track the sisters down and Alema was ultimately the only one of the pair to escape from the Nebula Chaser alive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
