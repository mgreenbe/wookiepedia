After Manech hired the Mandalorian bounty hunter Boba Fett to deal with the rebellious Kyber Royal Family on the planet, during which Fett destroyed their fuel Refinery Six-Two-Two and killed the crown prince, Torino Kyber, Kelmont reported the events to Buzk, not knowing it was planned by Manech. The furious Buzk then ordered his men to attack the royal palace.
