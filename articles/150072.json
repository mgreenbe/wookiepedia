For safety reasons, the tulrus usually traveled in small packs of two or more, and were very protective, and therefore aggressive if provoked. Their tusks were made from ivory. Legends claimed that a tulrus was trapped in an ancient Republic facility and had grown to a great size and strength. It was never proven true, for everyone who had entered the facility never came out alive. Swords could also be constructed from their bodies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to their sheer size, the tulrus were very dangerous creatures, but they were not particularly smart. Due to their poor eyesight and bad temper, they often charged the instant they detected the presence of anything other than themselves. When attacking they used their large mass to knock their enemies off their feet, and then trample them to their death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime following 0 BBY, one particularly ferocious tulrus named Foehorn attacked several miners.
