The Bith culture notably produced operas, and some Bith operas from the Middle Era of the Old Republic were highly regarded during the Age of the Empire. Such works were performed in theaters called opera houses. Attending operas was regarded as a cultured activity. During the last decades of the Galactic Republic, many politicians and other wealthy citizens of Coruscant often took in operatic performances at the Galaxies Opera House. Opera-goers of that time included Palpatine, Supreme Chancellor of the Republic and secretly a Dark Lord of the Sith, Baron Rush Clovis, and Padm\u00e9 Amidala. After Palpatine revealed his true colors and reorganized the Republic into a dictatorial Galactic Empire, operas remained a common form of entertainment among the new government's elite. Imperial opera-goers included Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit of the Naval Intelligence Agency, and Kren Blista-Vanee of the Imperial Ruling Council. Gallius Rax was a fan of opera and tried to cultivate a taste for it in Rae Sloane. After her first term as queen of Naboo ended, R\u00e9illata went on to be a moderately successful opera singer before she was elected into office again in 28 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
