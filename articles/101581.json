Long before the birth of Jova Tarkin and his nephew Wilhuff Tarkin, a group of developers coveted the Tarkin family's holdings in the plateau and the surrounding territory. The Tarkin family attempted to resolve the matter peacefully and placate them with credits. They even offered to give the developers all the lands north of the Orrineswa River up to Mount Veermok but were rebuffed. In response, the Tarkin family lured the conglomerate to the bargaining table and assassinated them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
