It contained the Outer Rim Communications Center, Sector Headquarters, and the sector's starfighter base. The base lacked sufficient mechanics and spare parts, and, as it was not originally designed for starfighters, it had primitive maintenance facilities. Generis base was located at the planet's southern pole, next to an outcrop of hiridui crystal. The base also contained a number of supply depots for the sector. The Communications Center was captured intact by Grand Admiral Thrawn and later regained by the Republic, who did some further expansion on the site."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
