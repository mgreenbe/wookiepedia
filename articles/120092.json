The two mercenaries soon attracted the wrath of Jabba, the resident Hutt crime lord of Tatooine. Bib Fortuna, Jabba's chief of staff, contacted him and his companion several times, and even though he warned them about Jabba's revenge, they still ignored it, possibly believing Jabba would forget or simply not bother. In retaliation for the death of six of his henchmen, Jabba had Saponza's homestead razed to the ground. Realizing that they could not defeat the Hutt on their own, Saponza and his partner were forced to pick a side in the Galactic Civil War and chose to join the freedom fighters of the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of the Galactic Civil War, Saponza was an older, yet broad-shouldered human sporting white hair.
