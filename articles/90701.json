Her wingmates were killed, and her own starfighter was damaged. She crashed on the planet Saijo shortly after contacting the local control tower; her distress call was heard by Rebellion heroes Leia Organa, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker, who flew to her aid and neutralized the Y-wings.

More Cantrosian Y-wings appeared and damaged the Falcon, forcing the ship to land in a gully.

The members of the faction, suspecting the intruders to be Imperials, opened fire. Minka returned fire while keeping her blaster set to stun; however, the members of the faction were calmed by Niru.
