As speaker of the Senate, the vice chair was tasked with maintaining order among the galaxy's senators. During the Republic's final years, the Senate was made to follow protocol and procedures to the letter, under the stewardship of Vice Chair Mas Amedda. Although the Chagrian politician believed that he kept the government functioning, in truth bureaucrats like Amedda often slowed down the process to the point of rendering the Senate ineffective."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Chancellor Lina Soh's administration, Larep Reza served as her Vice Chancellor.
