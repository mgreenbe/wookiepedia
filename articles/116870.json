In 22 BBY, Wodrata attended a summit in the Stalgasin hive on the planet Geonosis in which the members of the Executive Separatist Council pledged their allegiance to Count Dooku, the head of the Confederacy. Shortly after the summit ended, the First Battle of Geonosis broke out between the Separatists and the Republic, beginning the Clone Wars. Wodrata was an alien with black eyes and brown skin and hair. On Geonsosis the senator wore a black robe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rogwa Wodrata first appeared in the 2002 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. Originally the character Toonbuck Toora appeared in the summit scene on Geonsosis, but director George Lucas was not satisfied by the Toora costume's lack of expression and so had the character replaced in post production with the more fearsome looking  Wodrata, a computer generated character that the production staff nicknamed \"Gator Head\". In the new Star Wars canon, Wodrata was identified in the 2016 magazine Star Wars - The Official Magazine 84. The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used in the \"Star Wars Q&A\" section of Star Wars Insider 65, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and published on January 21, 2003."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
