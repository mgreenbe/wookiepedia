When George Lucas was recruiting people for the special effects work on the original Star Wars film, he approached Trumbull who pointed him towards Dykstra. Dykstra led the development at Industrial Light & Magic of the computer controlled motion capture camera system, Dykstraflex, that was responsible for many of the film's groundbreaking effects. The system was made possible by the availability of off the shelf micro-processors at relatively low cost and secondhand VistaVision cameras."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, there was tension between Dykstra and Lucas, who later complained that too much of the special effects budget was spent on developing the camera systems and that the effects team did not deliver all the shots that he had wanted. Regardless, following the release of Star Wars Dykstra secured his status in the industry with Academy Awards for best special effects and special technical achievement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dykstra had a production credit for the television series Battlestar Galactica and contributed to the series' effects, but after Star Wars these stock shots were a bit of a disappointment. Universal Studios, the producers of Battlestar Galactica, also got into a legal dispute with George Lucas. As a result, when work started on The Empire Strikes Back Dykstra was not invited back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
