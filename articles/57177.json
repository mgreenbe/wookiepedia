The Grehollo system contained the small terrestrial moon Captivity as well as the Grehollo station, a military base of the Galactic Empire. Captivity was covered in a layer of clouds and had frequent and violent storms, and its surface featured high mountains and jagged rock formations.

Jason Fry, co-author of The Essential Atlas, noted on the Jedi Council Forums of TheForce.net that the Manoe system was created for \"bookkeeping purposes\" so that every sector listed in the Online Companion would have at least one corresponding system, although Grehollo was also placed in the Manoe sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
