Two months after her election by lottery, the Tynna Central Government Building in Lutris collapsed due to a stone mite infestation. Razelfiin attributed the collapse to a terrorist attack and, angered by a lack of Republic and Jedi intervention, she subsequently declared her intention to contact Confederacy of Independent Systems leader Count Dooku as soon as she could procure a new building from which to govern. Razelfiin eventually pushed Tynna into the Confederacy, but the planet rejoined the Republic before the end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Razelfiin first appeared in HoloNet News Vol. 531 #53, an article on the HoloNet News website in 2002.
