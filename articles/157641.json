He was killed when he and the other thugs attacked Ki-Adi-Mundi during a sandstorm, which they hoped would bury his body once they killed him and threw him from the skiff they were using as transport. During the battle, the skiff crashed due to the death of the driver and so, ironically, the thugs ended up buried beneath the sands, while the Jedi escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
