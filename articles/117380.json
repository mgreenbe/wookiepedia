By the year 22 BBY, Vess wore a tattoo that was traditionally used to identified zealots of the cult known as the Disciples of Psusan. In that year she visited the Outlander Club on her homeworld with two of her friends, Nyrat Agira and Immi Danoo. While the trio were at the club, they witnessed the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker apprehend the bounty hunter Zam Wesell. While at the club Vess wore revealing clothing and had pink hair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rosha Vess first appeared in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones in which she was played by an uncredited extra. The character was first named in \"Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night\", an article written by Daniel Wallace and published in Star Wars Insider 75. The article suggests that Vess might only wear the tattoo because Agira does and so not actually be a Zealot herself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
