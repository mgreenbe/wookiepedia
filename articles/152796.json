The Gotals tracked Tane to the Homestar cantina in Coronet City on Corellia, and after a brief skirmish with Jedi Aayla Secura and Ylenic It'kla, the Gotals escaped the cantina with Tane captive. The two Jedi tracked the Gotals to Tendir Blue's headquarters, where the Gotals met another Jedi named Nejaa Halcyon.
