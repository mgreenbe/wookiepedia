Born the daughter of General Cham Syndulla and Eleni Syndulla on Ryloth with a brother who died young, she saw firsthand the devastation of the Clone Wars and the reign of the Empire on her homeworld. Syndulla became an expert pilot and left her homeworld and her father's planetary resistance behind, setting off across the galaxy to build her own resistance movement against the Empire aboard her starship, the Ghost. Kanan Jarrus, a Jedi who survived Order 66, joined her during the Gorse conflict and eventually became her lover and father of her son. Her crew, the Spectres, mounted an insurgency on Lothal and was eventually comprised of Mandalorian warrior Sabine Wren, Lasat survivor Garazeb Orrelios, Syndulla's life-long astromech droid Chopper, and Padawan Ezra Bridger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The small rebellion Hera led on Lothal gained the notice of Senator Bail Organa and his efforts to coordinate activities between various rebel cells across the galaxy. Hera and the Spectres joined one of these cells, Phoenix Cell, and she eventually became Phoenix Leader. With Phoenix Cell, Syndulla helped expand their forces, gain new allies, and establish a base of operations on the remote world Atollon, though they were unable to help Lothal as the Empire strengthened its grip on the planet. As the rebellion began to grow larger and become more of a threat, the Empire selected Grand Admiral Thrawn and gave him the task of dismantling the rebels. Hera continued to lead Phoenix Cell and became an influential leader of the rebellion. Hera's cell was among the first to join the formal Rebel Alliance upon its creation. Thrawn, however, located their base and launched an offensive against them on Atollon. Although they were significantly weakened and their base was destroyed, Hera, the Spectres, and several starships managed to escape the onslaught."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With their base gone, Hera and Phoenix Cell joined the Massassi Group on Yavin 4, where Hera continued to lead the rebellion against the Empire. Hera and the Spectres returned to Lothal not long after, seeking to finally free the planet from the Empire. Despite initial setbacks in gaining support from the Alliance, Hera led a squadron of fighters to destroy the Imperial Armory Complex on Lothal, but Thrawn's fleet managed to crush her forces and take her prisoner. Without Alliance support, the Spectres led a rescue mission to free her. As they made their escape, Kanan sacrificed himself to save Hera and the others from the explosion of the Imperial fuel depot. With newfound determination following Kanan's death, Hera, the Spectres, and various allies they made along their journey managed to defeat Thrawn and free Lothal from the Empire. Sometime after the liberation, Hera gave birth to Kanan's son, Jacen Syndulla."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the following years during the Galactic Civil War, Hera continued to be one of the most crucial leaders in the Alliance. Hera took part in the Alliance's pivotal moments on Scarif, Mako-Ta, Hoth, and eventually, Endor, the battle which saw the death of Emperor Palpatine and the fracture of the Empire. Following the battle, the Alliance reorganized into the New Republic, with Syndulla as one of its top military leaders.

Eleni hid her underground while the Separatist Droid Army occupied her homeworld. When the Republic's Clone Army came, Hera looked up at their ships and decided to become a pilot, prompting her to leave her family and home to pursue what she loved. During her childhood, Hera grew up on tales of how the purrgil, large space-dwelling creatures, had inspired people to develop the hyperdrive. As she grew older however, Syndulla came to regard the purrgil as a menace because they endangered hyperspace travel by crashing into ships. While working as a pilot, she lost more than one friend to collisions with purrgil."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Ryloth, A BTL Y-wing starfighter crashed in front of her home.

Hera, along with Chopper, decided to aid her \"Uncle\" Gobi in spying on a new Imperial refinery. However, her dreams of flight led her to be caught by the clone troopers and she was taken home by Captain Howzer, who declined to report the incident. Hera was scolded by her father, but her mother was more sympathetic to Gobi's misgivings about the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That night, Gobi talked Hera into accompanying him to make a supply run by allowing her to pilot the ship.

Chopper infiltrated the factory but was captured, prompting Hera and Omega to steal a Nu-class attack/transport shuttle to rescue him. Hera's first solo flight was less than impressive, but very effective, sowing great confusion among the Imperial ranks until the clones' shuttle, the Havoc Marauder arrived.

Viewing him as a potential ally, Hera decided to break him free and tracked him down to Moonglow Polychemical's refinery in Shaketown.

Later, using a tracking device she had slipped into Skelly's utility pocket, Hera tracked down Skelly to his apartment to his home in Crispus Commons, a housing project for homeless Clone Wars veterans.

Before his arrest, Hetto arranged for his Sullustan colleague Zaluna Myder to meet up with Hera and gave her a data cube containing the information she wanted to pass to Hera.
