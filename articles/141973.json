A large amount of terrorists deployed in a full district of the city and placed chemical bombs in the streets. Major Franchels was the RSF officer in charge of the situation during the attack in Theed. Even after the initial attack, many terrorists remain in the part of the city that suffered the attack. Major Franchels tasked his agents to eliminate the remaining terrorists, disarm the bombs and deliver medical supplies to use on victims of the attack. After the situation was fixed, RSF Intelligence Sergeant Bragg was charged to investigate the attack to find the identity of the culprits as nobody had claimed responsibility. He discovered that the Mummers were responsible, leading to a RSF raid on the Mummer bunker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
