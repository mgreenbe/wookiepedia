Otherwise congruent to the appearance of a standard TIE/ln space superiority starfighter, the Outland TIE fighter's wings folded when landing on a levelled surface, allowing for ease of access to the cockpit and creating a distinctive form not dissimilar to that of an X-wing starfighter with its S-foils in a open position. In addition, landing gear was concealed inside the bottom of the cockpit allowing for ease of use and stability. The personal starfighter of Moff Gideon, at least one Outland fighter, flown by the Moff himself, was used by his Imperial remnant during the New Republic Era, though the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin took down the starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A model of the Sienar Fleet Systems' TIE line, the Outland TIE fighter had model-specific landing gear similar to that of the T-65B and T-70 X-wing starfighters flown by the New Republic Defense Fleet. The starfighter had an outward appearance very similar to the TIE/ln space superiority starfighter when in flight, but its solar collector panel wings had the additional capability of folding at the center to form a V-shape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once folded, it allowed the Outland TIE to land on a surface utilizing its recessed landing gear, permitting easy access to the pilot without a hangar rack armature or a specialized landing pad. Accordingly, the tripodal landing gear and configurable wings allowed the pilot to land on uneven ground or in wilderness conditions. It also featured other accoutrements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During most of the Galactic Civil War, a galactic conflict fought between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic/New Republic, the Empire's TIE/ln space superiority starfighters were launched from dedicated military installations like well-stocked hangars, carrier craft, and base facilities. However, as the Empire lost more of its territory, TIEs were adjusted into the Outland fighters to make it easier for the starfighter to land in non-ideal locations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least five Outland TIE fighters were used by Gideon's Imperial remnant by circa 9 ABY. Moff Gideon, the leader of the remnant, used a personal one to travel to Nevarro with his forces and then landed the starfighter on the ground, exiting out to speak with the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and his allies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Djarin, Carasynthia Dune, Greef Karga, IG-11, and the Child escaped the Nevarro cantina and the city, Gideon used his Outland TIE fighter to engage the group with laser cannon fire. Before he returned for a second strafing run, Karga tried to get the Child to use his Force powers but the Force-sensitive was unable to. Djarin then started up his jetpack and chased the starfighter. He then used his grappling line to secure himself on the TIE fighter. Unable to force his way into the cockpit, Djarin tried to plant an explosive but the Moff jiggled it off his starship. The Mandalorian planted a second explosive on the left joint, causing the ship to spiral out of control, which bought the Outland TIE crashing to Nevarro's surface. Gideon then used the Darksaber to escape the wrecked hull."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outland TIE fighters were later stationed at the Imperial base on Nevarro, which were destroyed by the Razor Crest during a mission undertaken by Din, Cara, Greef, and a Mythrol to destroy the base by disabling a security feature that prevented lava underneath the base from rising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Outland TIE fighter was first depicted in the mobile app Star Wars: Card Trader as part of the set Illustrated Outlaws released on October 4, 2019. It appears in the final two episodes of the first season of The Mandalorian, a 2019 Disney+ television series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was originally designed by Industrial Light & Magic concept artist Doug Chiang for the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, though it went unused in the film itself. Later, during the development of The Mandalorian, series creator Jon Favreau and his team saw Chiang's concept and decided to incorporate it into their project. To bring the vehicle to life, a physical prop of the ship was built on the show's set, whereas the TIE's folded wings were realized through computer-generated imagery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
