In one of Godera's labs, Watcher One's forces encountered a Jedi Knight who was also looking for the doctor. Watcher One attempted to undermine the Jedi's confidence and resolve by revealing his knowledge of the Knight's exploits on Tython, but the Jedi remained determined to find Godera."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Knight defeated an ambush by the agent's forces, they helped Godera's droid RE-M0 repair the facility's computers so that they could track Godera's biosignature. By resetting the tracking relays, the Knight was able to track the Imperials to a base south of Lake Brell, in the ruins of an old chemical plant. The Jedi encountered a Rodian named Vulaa in the entrance, whose friend was injured. They told Vulaa to hide and keep his friend safe, while they headed deeper into the facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the base, the Jedi found Doctor Godera lying dead at Watcher One's feet. However, RE-M0 arrived and revealed Watcher One's deception, and \"Watcher One\" and his assistants wavered and disappeared\u2014leaving an Imperial shadow squad in their place. After they defeated the ambushers, the Jedi was contacted by Watcher One: he had been Vulaa, and his \"friend\" was the unconscious doctor. Watcher One then made a trade with the Jedi\u2014he would reveal the location of a certain Sith assassin that was about to destroy a Republic colony in exchange for time to interrogate the doctor. The Knight was forced to accept, but continued to pursue Watcher One after defeating the assassin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time the Jedi caught up with him, Watcher One had gotten his information from the doctor and transmitted it to his superior, Darth Angral.

The Jedi defeated Watcher One, but allowed the agent to leave in peace. Knowing that he could not return to the Empire and would be killed by Darth Angral for failing, the Knight suggested that he make a new life for himself in the Republic; perhaps the agent would find that the Republic was not the enemy he thought they were. Watcher One was surprised at the Jedi's generosity, but gratefully accepted the offer and departed. This also allowed the Imperial to fulfill his original deal to the Knight in handing over Godera, who was brought back to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Watcher One would send a farewell message to the Jedi, saying that while he still didn't understand why he was spared, he had not betrayed the Knight's trust. Having created a new name and life for himself as a Republic citizen, his skills in espionage had given him opportunities in the corporate sector and was surprised to find his new life as compelling as his old one.

The Imperial agent forces the Knight to give him time to interrogate Godera by revealing the location of a Sith assassin named Rora Seake, who was preparing to destroy a Republic colony.
