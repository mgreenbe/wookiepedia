All citizens of Naboo were required to attend one of the many schools on the planet, but only the most wealthy or gifted students were accepted at the Learning House."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The institute was so well respected that even members of the Jedi Order sent their Padawan apprentices to the school for specialized teaching. Jedi Padawans Rann I-Kanu and Sia-Lan Wezz were enrolled at the academy in 32 BBY when the Trade Federation launched an invasion of the planet. Along with the Jedi, several students including Dan\u00e9, Galak, Arani Korden, Rorworr and Deel Surool led a resistance movement in Theed and helped take back the city as well as the planet during the attack led by Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala. The group of students was also responsible for the rescue of Professor of Archaeology, Tasrah Boh, who had been abducted by a group of veermok smugglers. At the time, Lucos Dannt served the institution as headmaster. Daant would serve as leader of the Naboo Underground during the invasion and was assisted by many of his students."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
