These pseudo-assassin droids were held aloft by three repulsorlifts, armed with a stun blaster and a dart launcher, and were protected by an electrically-charged covering. The Mark 3 was designed to capture rather than kill its prey, in compliance with the laws of the Galactic Republic, which prohibited the use of assassination droids. The Mark 3's predecessors, Marks 1 and 2, were outlawed for their capability to kill; units of those types were used mostly by bounty hunters and Separatist agents for assassinations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
