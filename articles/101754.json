Circa 21 BBY, Osia was among a group of six Believers summoned to rendezvous at a bar in the floating city Tolea Biqua on the planet Genarius in preparation for an upcoming mission. Two weeks prior, the cult had staged the release of an experimental new virus fatal to the Caarite species at a secret base of the Metatheran Cartel trading concern on the moon Tilnes. Osia and his comrades were tasked with review the results of the virus on the inhabitants of the base; Osia was briefed only on the essential details of the assignment and was left unaware of how the group to communicate the strike team's findings or of the Believers' wider plans to use the virus to cripple the Metatheran Cartel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cultists journeyed to Tilnes aboard a starship and made their way to the Cartel facility, which was situated within a tunnel network deep beneath the moon's surface. Shortly after their arrival at the base, an electromagnetic pulse emitted from the core of Tilnes struck the facility, activating an emergency a security protocol that sealed the doors, trapping Osia and his comrades within. The Believers soon found that not all of the base's inhabitants had been killed by the virus; the Caarite Ko Bas had been transformed by the contagion into a grotesque mutant being and attacked Osia and the other cultists. Bas killed four of the slower members of their party, while Osia and the Believer Aris evaded his clutches and fled into the depths of the Cartel facility in search of a safe place to hide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Osia and Aris took refuge inside a concealed security office and encountered there two other mutant Caarites, U and G. Through use of the Force to influence their minds and also by speaking to the mutants in their native Caarite language, the two Believers subdued the mutants and brought them under their control. Osia and Aris subsequently tried to bypass the base's security system to allow them to leave the Cartel facility, but their attempts were unsuccessful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three hours after Osia's arrived at the Cartel base, the heroes of Cularin\u2013a renowned group of freelance agents\u2013entered the facility while investigating a distress signal.

The Believer pair resolved to prevent the operatives from leaving the base so as to ensure that knowledge of the pathogen remained a closely guarded secret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Accompanied by U and G, Osia and Aris confronted the heroes of Cularin at the entrance to the base as the agents attempted to leave.
