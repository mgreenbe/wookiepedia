This trading post was attacked by a team of Imperial saboteurs after its defenses were destroyed by a sandstorm, but the saboteurs were stopped by a Republic-allied individual. This individual, who had been asked to help out by the former Jedi Galen Besk, traveled to Camp Karnori and informed Mayor Airen about the Imperial attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Airen was grateful for the individual's help, and asked them to speak to Galt.

After they returned to Galt, the group received a distress call from the militia's nearby Manister Base, which had been overrun by a Geonosian hive.
