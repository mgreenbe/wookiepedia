Suspecting pirate activity, Sipal sought to contract an individual as part of a loss prevention program to hunt down the pirate and recover the stolen cargo. Arranging to meet an interested party at the Paradise cantina, Sipal and her personal assistant Porel explain that a pirate organization known as the Veiled Sorority is behind the attacks.
