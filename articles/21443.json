Imperial Governor Ubrik Adelhard's Iron Blockade of the Anoat sector forced the citizenry of Burnin Konn to resort to acquiring much-needed goods from local crime bosses.

In time, it became one of the four Mining Worlds of the Anoat sector. Eventually, chromium and dolovite mining operations ended up destroying the planet's indigenous flora, transforming Burnin Konn into a nearly uninhabitable wasteland."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the end of the rein of the Galactic Empire, Burnin Konn was one of the worlds subjected to Operation: Cinder. A division commanded by Valin Hess was ordered to attack a city on the surface, but the inhabitants of the city resisted and fought fiercely to defend their homes. Undaunted, Hess ordered the entire city wiped out whilst his division was there, exterminating around 5,000-10,000 soldiers in addition to the civilians. One of the few survivors of the atrocity was Migs Mayfeld, who had been serving as a sniper in the division and was left traumatized by his experience. Hess himself survived the ultimate fall of the Empire and joined the remnants based on the planet Morak, where he oversaw a refinery for producing rhydonium to perpetuate acts of destruction even worse than Burnin Konn. When Mayfeld, who was part of an infiltration of the refinery, encountered his former commanding officer, he confronted him over the massacre on Burnin Konn and, when Hess proved unrepentant and unsympathetic towards his comrades' deaths, shot him dead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All of Burnin Konn's inhabitants were originally off-world immigrants, mostly humans and Nothoiins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Star Wars canon, Burnin Konn first appeared in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising.
