Favored by the Commerce Guild, it was first used against renegade miners in skirmishes that took place deep underground. The unit was also known as the burrowing spider droid for its ability to invade narrow spaces, it was armed with a powerful laser cannon capable of both rapid-fire and high-intensity burst."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the dwarf spider droid became a mainstay in the droid army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems against the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. Its underbelly was vulnerable to explosives, as demonstrated when Clone Captain Rex destroyed a dwarf spider droid by planting a thermal detonator on its stomach during the Battle of Teth. Many were equipped with a self-destruct mechanism that, when threatened on the battlefield, would detonate. The droids saw action in the early stages of the war, including the Battle of Devaron, all the way up until some of the final engagements of the war, such as the Battle of Anaxes and the Battle of Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
