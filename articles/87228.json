The heavy cruiser was characterized by a rounded and bulbous hull with several modules on its framework. At the aft of the cruiser was an extended structure with another module at its tip. The heavy cruiser was equipped with laser cannons and engines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the age of the Galactic Empire, a number of Marsheem-class heavy cruisers were owned by the government of the Ishi Tib, a nonhuman species native to Tibrin. When Luke Skywalker, a hero of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, was captured by the Empire during an undercover diplomatic mission to Tibrin, he was briefly detained aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Stormbringer. Although his fellow Rebel Princess Leia Organa singlehandedly infiltrated the Star Destroyer, freed Skywalker, and led him into an escape pod, they would have been disintegrated without the intervention of Mariod Govi, who convinced the Kalikeedan to send three Marsheem-class heavy cruisers against the Imperial warship. Since the heavy cruisers abruptly came out from the dark side of Tibrin's moon, Imperial Captain Davin Bryce could not issue the order to raise the deflector shields in time, and the Marsheems destroyed the Stormbringer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
