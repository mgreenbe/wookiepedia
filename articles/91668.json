The experiments were carried out in a small research lab, while the breeding was carried out in a separate, more heavily defended base. Both practices caused the local womp rat populations to become more aggressive, leading to increased attacks by the vermin on locals. The mercenary Saponza, who had recently set up a gang with his partner on Tatooine and chosen to help the Rebellion in the Galactic Civil War, was asked by an old friend to look into the increase in womp rat attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The cull"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saponza and his partner began the mission by traveling to the location of a group of womp rat nests, where they deployed troops to destroy the vermins' homes.

The gang then discovered the mercenary research lab, and Saponza piloted his starship the Strix in for a strafe of the lab's defenses before the his partner deployed troops which were attacked by five womp rats and an autoturret but managed destroyed the entire lab and a pair of womp rat nests nearby. After the lab was demolished, Saponza and his partner were contacted by Jennica Pierce, who informed them of the mercenary base were womp rat breeding was taking place.
