After destroying the Star Destroyer Resolute with her craft, Ventress engaged the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, although she was forced to crash in the Separatist command ship's hangar.

It was equipped with life support systems, airscoop thrusters, a class 1 hyperdrive, and a deflector shield generator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fanblade fighter's fuselage was gray in color with the cockpit situated at the front and encased in a clear glass dome. Within the cockpit was a single seat for the pilot as well as a number of screens used to display information on enemy starships. The fighter was flown with the use of a yoke, in the center of which was a targeting computer. The yoke was also capable of displaying holographic transmissions, which were colored red."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was equipped with a large, vertically-aligned solar sail, which appeared as a translucent red semicircle and connected to a retractable boom which could be folded inward for when the craft was in flight or landing. The fanblade fighter was also equipped with a backup sail, which could be deployed in place of the primary one. At each tip of the solar sail was a laser cannon, which would rotate to face forward when the sail was retracted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A rare and expensive ship, the starfighter combat-capable Ginivex-class fanblade fighter was incredibly fast thanks to its solar sail. The sail, when deployed, would better spread the ship's deflector shield pattern, thereby strengthening its shielding, although the resulting energy output allowed the starfighter to be detected more easily by other vessels' sensors. When flown by a Force-user, the fighter could perform turns and flips which showcased the joint capability of both the craft and its pilot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Sullust"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Only six Ginivex-class fanblade starfighters were constructed for Asajj Ventress, a Force-sensitive Dathomirian loyal to the Sith who was apprenticed to Count Dooku. A commander in the Confederacy of Independent Systems as well, Ventress flew one of her fanblade fighters against the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars' Battle of Sullust in 20 BBY. With the aid of two groups of droid tri-fighters from her fleet, Ventress took aim at Jedi General Anakin Skywalker's flagship, the Resolute, dealing substantial damage to the Star Destroyer's bridge and resulting in the cruiser's destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ventress and her tri-fighters then targeted Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Skywalker himself, both of whom were piloting their Jedi starfghters. After damaging Kenobi's craft with her fanblade fighter's lower laser cannon, the two Jedi split up, leaving Skywalker to contend with the droids while Ventress gave chase to Kenobi. As the Jedi Master approached the Separatist flagship, Ventress managed to score a second shot on Kenobi's ship, forcing him to head for the command ship's main hangar in order to make a landing. Ventress stayed on Kenobi's tail, but she was intercepted by Skywalker, who damaged the hull of her fanblade fighter and forced her to crash in the hangar."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ventress betrayed"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With her solar sail disabled and her ship aslant in the hangar, Ventress communicated with Dooku via hologram in the fighter's cockpit, requesting the Count's assistance. Dooku, however, informed her that she had failed him and was no longer his apprentice. Embittered, Ventress emerged from the cockpit and briefly dueled Kenobi and Skywalker as Dooku ordered the remaining Separatist forces to destroy the flagship. After a Hyena-class Droid Bomber crashed into the hangar and exploded, Kenobi, Skywalker, and Ventress each returned to their own craft and narrowly escaped before the command ship's total destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, Ventress was found adrift and unconscious aboard her fanblade fighter\u2014sustained by its life support systems\u2014by a crew of scavengers, who brought the ship aboard their salvage freighter, the Raider. After placing the fighter in the freighter's hold, the crew removed the cockpit dome and revitalized Ventress, who used the Force to strangle them soon after.

In the 2018 reference book Star Wars Encyclopedia of Starfighters and Other Vehicles, written by Landry Q. Walker, the fanblade fighter's length is given as 13.1 meters, while the nineteenth issue of the Star Wars: Build Your Own X-Wing magazine, published later that same year, lists the fighter's length as 13.05 meters.
