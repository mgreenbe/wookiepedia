Neither his children Phi-Ton and Yana-Ton, nor even his brother Therod-Tonever suspected anything. Around 3640 BBY another Imperial Agent, Cipher Nine, made several visits to the teahouse and pretended to become friends with the family. In reality, Cipher required contact and assistance from the Bas-Ton's impostor in their joint mission to track the Shining Man. Bas-Ton's impostor was later killed by Cipher's old enemies and Therod-Ton grieved at the loss, never knowing his brother's true fate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
