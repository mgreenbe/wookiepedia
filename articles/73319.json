The objective of the research conducted in the lab was to develop an all-terrain hunting beast. Imperial scientists successfully generated a new animal species, the kahmurra, a genetically engineered creature derived from the goat-like murras from Corellia. However, the Empire considered the project a failure and cancelled all funding. The research facility was officially closed and the kahmurra specimens then ran wild on Talus. Nevertheless, several bio-engineers continued to work in the Kahmurra Biogenetic Research Station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, a commoner living in Dearic bought a khmurra to a scientist working at the biogenetic research station in order to guard his house. However, the creature killed his whole family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, Jabba the Hutt dispatched an assassin to eliminate the scientist leading the kahmurra project but the assassin failed in his mission and was captured in the bio-genetics laboratory.
