Eight months after the Rebel Alliance's victory at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Black Fleet\u2014comprising the Intimidator and all warships present, along with their crews\u2014was seized by N'zoth's native Yevetha workers under resistance leader Nil Spaar as part of their mutiny against the Imperials, who had been in the process of withdrawing all military personnel and equipment from the Cluster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Renamed the Pride of Yevetha, the Super Star Destroyer served as Spaar's flagship as he was elevated to Viceroy of the Duskhan League during the Black Fleet Crisis, which pitted the Yevethan government against the New Republic under Chief of State Leia Organa Solo.

In an effort to determine the strength of the Duskhan League's forces, several New Republic reconnaissance flights were sent into the Cluster, leading to the discovery of the Pride of Yevetha in the N'zoth system.

However, unknown to the liberated Imperials, Byss had been destroyed six years earlier. The Black Fleet arrived at the remains of the planet and, after a month, had gradually dispersed.

The Intimidator was modified beyond its stock statistics; among its improvements was an additional shield generator mounted on the ship's midline. During the vessel's time in the hands of the Yevetha, the Imperial captives of Camp Pa'aal Squadron installed slave circuitry\u2014a feature that enabled one person to assume remote command of an entire fleet's worth of enslaved ships\u2014into the Intimidator and the other ships of the Black Fleet. The installation of the slave circuitry had been done piecemeal during their years of captivity, and the last necessary components were assembled and delivered to their respective ships in 17 ABY in preparation for an Imperial revolt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yevetha also made several modifications to the Intimidator. Darama Nil Spaar had three of the warship's detention blocks transformed into breederies for his offspring, each possessing forty-eight alcoves serving as birth-casks.

Out of the nine ships undergoing repairs at the Black-15 dock, only the Intimidator was spaceworthy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Imperial garrison commander Jian Paret received an order to withdraw all military personnel from the system and destroy whatever had to be left behind, Paret used the Intimidator as his command ship during the evacuation, having moved to it within an hour after receiving his orders. With only one-third of a crew aboard, and the need to transfer all of the garrison's assets and personnel to the warship before destroying the repair yard, Paret was unable to leave as quickly as he had wanted. To avoid any potential hostile moves from the predominantly Yevetha work force, Paret hid the true nature of the Imperial evacuation behind the facade of a departure drill."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Yevetha underground leader Nil Spaar knew of the imminent Imperial withdrawal and had chosen the time to seize the Black-15 shipyard and all of the vessels present as part of a plan to revolt against the Imperials five years in the making. With the transfer of the Victory-class Star Destroyer Harridan from patrol duty to active service at the battlefield at Notak, Spaar saw that the Imperials were essentially defenseless. In Sections 17 and 21 of the Intimidator, over a dozen external hatches were rigged to report their status as secured and sealed during an emergency battle-stations lockdown. The Yevetha leader had taken additional precautions should the ship attempt to escape\u2014a package of explosives, disarmed only by a constant signal, would destroy the ship if the shields were activated, blocking the signal and detonating the bombs. With these measures in place, two Yevetha commando teams\u2014one led by Spaar and the other by his second-in-command, Dar Bille\u2014boarded the Intimidator through the rigged hatches. Silently and quickly, the two teams converged on the bridge without having to fire a single shot.

When the transports began decelerating in preparation for docking, Spaar ordered all of the warship's autotargeting batteries to open fire on the inbound ships, a move that killed 20,000 Imperials: soldiers, technicians, bureaucrats, and families. Spaar concluded the bloodshed by executing Paret with his dew claw, a retractable blade that emerged from a Yevetha's wrist. The Yevetha leader wasted no time in announcing that the remaining crew were now the prisoners of the Duskhan League, the Yevethan government. The other eight Star Destroyers present at the shipyard were also captured. The captive Imperials, approximately 300,000 crew members from the Intimidator and the Victory-class Star Destroyer Valorous, were transferred to Pa'aal, the primary moon of N'zoth, to serve the Yevetha in operating and constructing their warships."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In the service of the Yevetha"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 16 ABY\u2014twelve years after the failed Imperial evacuation of N'zoth\u2014the Yevetha had learned how to operate the captured ships from their onetime oppressors, who were now prisoners themselves. However, unbeknownst to their overseers, the Imperials had begun the installation of slave circuitry in all the former Imperial warships, work done piecemeal over the years in preparation for a counter-revolt. The Intimidator was renamed Pride of Yevetha and was pressed into service as the flagship of Darama Nil Spaar, viceroy of the Duskhan League. At the time, Dar Bille served as the primate of the warship. Spaar's personal staff\u2014including his primary and secondary mates; his first attach\u00e9 Eri Palle; and Vor Duull, the proctor of information science from the thrustship Aramadia\u2014were transferred to the Pride of Yevetha as well. It was from the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer that Bille, acting on an edict from Spaar, ordered the Yevethan warships to begin the Great Purge, an ethnic cleansing of the Koornacht Cluster. The Pride of Yevetha participated in the extermination of a colony of Kubaz at Morning's Bell and the capture of a former Imperial factory farm at Pirol-5, while the rest of the Black Fleet succeeded in ridding the Cluster of the foreign \"vermin.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though New Republic Chief of State Leia Organa Solo was appalled by the Duskhan League's actions, the New Republic could not defend the conquered worlds of the Koornacht Cluster, as they were not members of the galactic government.

Spaar would not back down, however; the New Republic was unaware of the League's full military strength and the existence of the Intimidator, which Spaar could use to his advantage. The New Republic made the first move with a blockade of Doornik-319 that proved disastrous and prompted members of the Senate to move against their Chief of State."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While this internal strife continued, several New Republic reconnaissance flights were made into the Koornacht Cluster to ascertain the Duskhan League's military strength. Lieutenant Rone Taggar of the New Republic Fifth Battle Group's 21st Recon Group was dispatched in his Recon-X starfighter Jennie Lee to the N'zoth system to record statistical data on the Yevethan forces present.

Taggar's data, along with that of the other recon flights throughout the Cluster, was transmitted to the New Republic Defense Force headquarters, where it was reviewed by Organa Solo, Admiral Ackbar, and others. The Tammarian officer Ayddar Nylykerka from the Asset Tracking office, who was on hand to identify the warships of the Black Fleet, was the one who confirmed the presence of the Intimidator, knowing it only by its Imperial name. Nylykerka deduced the ship's identity from the additional shield generator tower on the warship's centerline\u2014a trait common to all late-production Executor-class ships.

Piloting the light freighter Millennium Falcon, Chewbacca utilized firecracker mines to blind the Super Star Destroyer's sensors, allowing him to perform a quick in-system hyperspace jump that brought him to 1,100 meters off the Pride of Yevetha's starboard bow without the gun batteries being able to track him. The Wookiees utilized a hull-cutting ring to board the warship, and Chewbacca, Shoran, and Lumpawarrump traversed through the Super Star Destroyer's converted detention blocks, severely damaging the breederies in the process.

After inflicting heavy casualties, the Yevethan force was obliterated, and the Black Fleet Crisis came to an end.
