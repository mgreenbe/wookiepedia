She was a valued adviser to the Jedi High Council, the Supreme Chancellor, and the Galactic Senate. During the Clone Wars, she fought with her last Padawan, Barriss Offee, and she was a common and formidable presence at points of crisis, on worlds such as Ilum, Nadiem, and Geonosis. She was killed during the Battle of Kashyyyk when Contingency Order 66 was enacted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luminara Unduli was born on the planet Mirial, a cold, dry, and despondent world oppressed by the Trade Federation.

Selected as a Padawan by a fellow Mirialan, as had many other Mirialans for several hundred years, Unduli constructed a green-bladed lightsaber and grew strong in the Force. Upon achieving the rank of Jedi Knight, she dedicated herself to physical disciplines; her patterned tattoos were a traditional Mirialan reflection of this somatic commitment. She trained heavily to improve her corporal prowess, working over the course of years to enhance her flexibility and agility in combat and mastering the third form of lightsaber combat, Soresu. Adorning in traditional Mirialan robes, Jedi Unduli trained independently as a Jedi Guardian, though she was a skilled and respected Diplomat and adviser to high-profile senators in the Galactic Senate. She was also part of the Jedi escort accompanying then Lytton sector senator Finis Valorum to Troiken during the negotiations with Iaco Stark. She then fought against Stark's faces alongside Master Plo Koon there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Jedi Unduli became a Master in the years prior to the Invasion of Naboo.

Recognizing the systematic precision in which Ansion was being attacked politically, the Jedi High Council dispatched Master Unduli and Padawan Offee, to the previously insignificant world, where they were met by Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker. The four Jedi were charged with forestalling any incipient local separatist movement, and encouraging them to remain within the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their mission was made difficult by the cultural division which gripped Ansion: one part of the planet's population dwelt in cities and towns and engaged in trade with other worlds in the Republic; the other part lived in a loose confederation of nomadic clans on Ansion's vast, windy plains. The two factions were bitterly mistrustful of one another, and had been in conflict for more than a thousand years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Unduli and her Padawan were ambushed not long after they arrived in the modest Ansionian capital, Cuipernam, by employees of Soergg the Hutt, a local crime lord whose services had been retained by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Cornered against a wall, Unduli sustained a minor blaster graze before Jedi Kenobi and Padawan Skywalker arrived and defeated her attackers, who had expected only two Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Secure in their persons for the time being, Unduli and the other Jedi proceeded to the Ansionian council building, where they conducted initial negotiations with the Unity of Community Council, which represented the city-dwelling Ansionians. Like Ansion, the council was deeply divided. Roughly half its membership favored the Separatists, having been promised a quick and forceful end to the conflict with the prairie-dwelling Alwari nomads by the Separatist leadership and an escape from Republic taxes and regulations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a particularly unorthodox demonstration of the Force on the Armalat delegate Tolut, and a promise of a very favorable settlement with the Alwari, Luminara was able to persuade the Council to provisionally agree to remain in the Republic\u2014so long as the Jedi delivered on her promise. The quartet's new focus was interrupted when Padawan Offee was captured by two mentally disabled Ansionian gangsters in the employ of Soergg, Bulgan and Kyakhta. The young Padawan was able to convince her captors to help her escape Soergg's men by offering to heal them of their injuries. Restored to their former selves, the pair quickly aided Offee in eluding the Hutt's clutches. Unsurprisingly, Master Unduli located her escaped Padawan before Kenobi or Skywalker sensed her presence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bulgan and Kyakhta, grateful to and in awe of Offee\u2014and sensing an opportunity\u2014appointed themselves guides to the four Jedi. Unduli and her colleagues accepted the aid of the Ansonian pair, not least because the two were both outcast members of Alwari clans. In short order, the Jedi set out on an expedition to locate the scattered Alwari clans, particularly the Borokii overclan. Unduli, Offee, their two colleagues and their guides, crossed out of Cuipernam into Ansion's vast prairie, riding on magnificent suubatar animals recommended by Bulgan and Kyakhta as much for their prestige among the Alwari as for the very practical advantages of the beasts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the expedition progressed, Unduli noticed a clear tension between Offee and the confident Skywalker, and discussed the brash Padawan's unusual case with Kenobi. On the way, they had to fend off attacks by gairk at a river crossing, and seek shelter from a large flock of suicidal kyren. At the camp of the first Alwari clan they encountered, the Yiwa, Unduli and the others were welcomed, but were required to provide entertainment that evening. After gaining a deeper understanding of the Alwari sense of tradition, Unduli contrived an entertainment that would satisfy the Yiwa. Taking a handful of sand from the ground, she let it fall through her fingers, but against the wind. Turning the stream of sand into a coil with expert manipulation of the Force, Unduli lifted twirling columns of sand around her in glittering spirals. Then she also began to twirl herself, until she was rapidly whirling around with spirals of sand forming a vortex around her as she rose off of her feet into the air. Climatically, the sand was formed into a globe around her as she spun in mid-air. Her dizzying performance completed, she returned to her place among the other Jedi amid the Alwari equivalent of applause. Even her companions were impressed by this feat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Unduli again had cause to worry about Offee when the Padawan disappeared chasing a Gwurran thief, Tooqui. However, the Padawan was found, this time surrounded by rambunctious, inquisitive Gwurrans. Tooqui insisted on coming along with them, and Unduli reluctantly agreed, passing off responsibility for him to Offee. The Gwurran would prove his worth when he rescued all four Jedi and the two Alwari after the Qulun clan used a scented perfume to send the Jedi to sleep and capture them in order to receive a payment from Soergg. After they escaped with their mounts, Unduli would later save Skywalker's life when he was attacked by two predatory shanhs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being led to the Borokii clan, the Jedi were required to retrieve a tuft of wool from the exceedingly rare albino surepp herd animals without modern technology. Unduli went into the herd at night, bouncing off the top of each animal and retrieved the wool. On the way back, she slipped and was knocked unconscious. The other Jedi brought her out of the herd and the negotiations proceeded. The Borokii agreed to the settlement, but the Jedi were required to deal with their traditional enemies, the Januul clan. Under the leadership of Kenobi, the Jedi agreed, although Unduli was flabbergasted. When the two clans drew up to engage each other, the Jedi went in between them and declared their intention to not fight either side. Unduli and the other Jedi then fended off attacks launched against them by both sides, but they parried only weapons, injuring and killing none of the combatants. Stunned, both clans agreed to the Jedi's proposition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to Cuipernam to inform the Unity Council, Soergg again tried to ambush the Jedi, who were then aided by an honor guard of both Januul and Borokii clans. Unduli then proceeded to the negotiations, where Ansion\u2014a vital hub of alliances\u2014agreed to stay in the Republic.

The pair slipped past the planet's significant anti-orbital defenses and commandeered newly landed TX-130S fighter tanks which they used to destroy Geonosian gun emplacements blocking the way to the looming Petranaki arena. Housed within the packed arena were Jedi Kenobi, Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who were to be tried and executed by the Confederacy leaders assembled on the world. As over two hundred Jedi crept into the arena, they ignited their lightsabers in challenge to Count Dooku, the leader of the Confederacy, who was personally overseeing the planned execution. Entering the arena and standing beside fellow Jedi Master Shaak Ti, Luminara ignited her lightsaber and engaged the Separatist droid forces in the heated but short battle that followed; over half of the assembled Jedi Knights fell in battle before the observing Count Dooku called a temporary halt and offered the Jedi clemency if they surrendered, only for the offer to be rejected by Master Windu, prompting the droids to resume their attack. Luminara raised her lightsaber, prepared to fight and die, but this was rendered unnecessary by the arrival of Grand Master Yoda, accompanied by the newly-created Grand Army of the Republic in several LAAT gunships. Master Unduli boarded a gunship with Masters Shaak Ti, Saesee Tiin, and Roth-Del Masona and presumably led clone troopers into battle in what would be the first conflict of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Jedi General"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the conclusion of the battle, Master Unduli reported back to Coruscant where she took up the mantle of Senior Jedi General in the Grand Army. Units under her command included the 41st Elite Corps and a Republic naval task force. During the war, Unduli commanded a Republic task force during an engagement with a Separatist fleet near the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center that had arrived to assist the Confederate warship Malevolence, which was under attack by Republic forces. This meant she was unable to reach them in time to assist in the destruction of the warship, but her help was rendered unnecessary thanks to Skywalker's tinkering with the Malevolence's hyperdrive system, causing it to crash into the nearby dead moon."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Assault on Ilum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Four months after the Battle of Geonosis, Unduli led her Padawan to the secret Jedi Temple on the icy world Ilum, where the two traveled to complete Offee's final lightsaber. Conducting the construction ceremony, Master and Padawan were attacked by cloaked Separatist chameleon droids, which had infiltrated the temple in an attempt to destroy the cavern's precious natural lightsaber crystals. Together, they were able to halt the droid assault, but much of the temple was brought down upon itself by mines the droids had set before attacking. Unduli and Offee plunged into the depths of the temple cavern as great slices of rock and small and precious crystals alike plummeted to the ceremonial floor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For moments, they were able to elude the stone maelstrom, but even their great powers working in concert were soon not enough to allow escape. The Jedi were trapped. Offee reached out bodily with the Force to halt the falling debris above her, and succeeded, only to glance at her Master, who sat in meditative harmony with the Force and falling stone. The apprentice joined the master in reflective poise, and, together, they calmly held up the crushing vault of stone which piled above them.

Luminara Unduli was selected to oversee the transport of the crystals aboard the starship Sedawan. The ship however, was attacked by the Nightsisters of Dathomir; the group had ties to Count Dooku and intended to steal the Sedawan's cargo of crystals. Master Unduli made a standoff against the intruders in the docking bays as the Nightsisters boarded, but she was overwhelmed by their numbers. One of the Nightsisters' leaders, Yansu Grjak took Unduli as a captive and used her as a device in their crystal powered weapon on Dathomir. Two Jedi eventually came and rescued Unduli but had to fight of the Nightsister leader Sai Sircu.

Aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tranquility, Unduli spearheaded the interrogations of the viceroy, whose denial of information cost Tano her patience. The Padawan physically threatened Gunray with her lightsaber, and though Unduli scolded the Padawan for using fear as a weapon, the viceroy agreed to \"negotiate.\" Before any information could be gleaned, the Tranquility was attacked by Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress and a battle droid squad, who had arrived to rescue Gunray."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Unduli and Clone Commander CC-1004, nicknamed \"Gree,\" managed to destroy the army of B2 super battle droids, the Jedi Master sensed that Tano was in danger and rushed to meet with her.

However, while \"surrendering,\" Ventress activated thermal detonators that she had planted in the Star Destroyer's engine room, crippling the cruiser, and escaped to the ravaged engine room.

She acknowledged Ventress's preferred style, that of Count Dooku, but Ventress's was unrefined, amateurish, and sloppy. The enraged Ventress then pinned her under several pipes she collapsed from the ceiling and as Ventress moved to deal the killing blow. The Jedi Master was saved by the timely arrival of Tano, who had decided to disobey her orders in the interest of helping Unduli and Force-pushed Ventress away. The Mirialan accepted the Padawan's help for the continuing duel, but in the end, Ventress escaped with Senate Commando Captain Faro Argyus, who had defected to the Separatists and freed Gunray from Republic custody. Unduli and Tano transmitted the signal of the Consular-class cruiser that the Separatists had used to escape the Tranquility to Jedi Master Kit Fisto, who tracked Gunray to the third moon of Vassek.

While she and Skywalker acted as diversions, the two Padawans Offee and Tano made their way through the vast underground catacombs to destroy the factory, not before Ahsoka contacted them explaining that they wouldn't be able to make it shortly before detonating the explosives, forcing Unduli and Skywalker to watch in horror as the factory blew up with their respective apprentices inside.

While she and a trooper searched the temple, a sandstorm prohibited reinforcements from reaching their positions. While communicating with Masters Kenobi and Mundi via hologram, Unduli's clone trooper was killed by the undead hordes of the mysterious Hive Queen Karina the Great. Having been knocked unconscious and captured, the Jedi Master was taken before Karina. Jedi Kenobi and Skywalker came to her rescue; they were not far off when Luminara regained consciousness and wrestled her way out of the zombies' reach. Realizing what they were up against, she contacted Kenobi to warn him not to come after her, but was cut off as the zombies overwhelmed her. The Jedi disregarded her warnings and continued their search until they came upon Karina's abode, where they found Luminara in an energy trap for her to be infested with brain worms. Kenobi was instantly curious about the brain worms and expressed interest in how it worked, despite Skywalker's statement that Luminara probably didn't want to see how it worked, which she promptly confirmed. Kenobi said that it was better they know more about it, but Luminara quickly disagreed as the worm approached her and was put on her face, prompting her to remark that she sincerely hoped it was part of the plan. At that point, the clones and Jedi sprung into action. With Kenobi and Commander Cody delaying the zombies and the Queen, Skywalker freed Unduli and the two captured Poggle.
