He operated as the gamemaster in Grakkus the Hutt's arena on Nar Shaddaa. He was tasked with training new candidates to fight in the arena, including Luke Skywalker. During Skywalker's arena fight with Kongo the Disemboweler, Agent 5241 contacted the Empire to inform them that Skywalker was on Nar Shaddaa.

When he was four, Kreel watched a man die. It made him cry like a baby for a dozen more times. Two years later, Kreel watched his own father being murdered in front of him, but he did not cry. His mother was also said to have died in the arenas. He then started to kill people and worked in the fighting pits. Kreel made the fighting pits his way of life in order to survive. Sometime later when Kreel first saw the Galactic Empire's stormtroopers, he viewed them as being beautiful. After the Empire toppled Chagar IX's warlords and shut down the fighting pits, Kreel and his people were given jobs, a sense of purpose, and peace. When he was old enough, Kreel joined the Stormtrooper Corps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He then went to the Imperial Academy, where he became friends with a ranger named Izak Anzio of Agamar.

He posed as one of Grakkus's greatest fighting slaves that he had bought. In his role, Kreel trained Wookiees, lizard men and space pirates to fight in the arena for Grakkus and his audience. He called himself the \"Gamemaster\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, he was given Luke Skywalker to train for Grakkus's games. Along with the MagnaGuards, Kreel taught Skywalker how to fight.

He then arrested Grakkus, telling him that his arena was closed. He was joined by several of the TIE pilots who surrounded Skywalker. However, as they were taking Grakkus and Skywalker, Grakkus initiated an E.M.P. that disabled Kreel's and the TIE pilots guns. Kreel then drew his lightsaber as Kongo was revived. Kreel attempted to subdue Skywalker but was attacked by Grakkus. He ordered the pilots and stormtroopers to capture Skywalker and his allies.

The attack was successful, with Kreel and his squad capturing Admiral Verette, and interrogating him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kreel then had Verette tied to his shuttle and sent it to the captured Star Destroyer Harbinger as distraction, while he and his SCAR troopers boarded the Harbinger to retake it. Kreel then fought and dueled Skywalker, confirming to Luke that he was the Gamemaster from Grakkus's arena. During the fighting, Kreel was contacted by Vader and was warned not to injure Skywalker- a contact that allowed Skywalker to sense Vader's presence, leaving him distracted. Kreel took advantage of Luke's attempt to use The Force, which he claimed to just get in the way of true fighting skill- but before he could fully overpower the young Jedi, Luke struck out with a Force push that rocked the entire Star Destroyer, trapping Kreel under wreckage and debris. While Luke and the others escaped, Kreel ordered his team to salvage the mission by destroying the Star Destroyer, while he used his lightsaber to cut off his own arm at the shoulder, allowing him to rejoin them as they escaped the ship. While Vader was furious that Kreel and his SCAR team had thoroughly failed in every one of their objectives, Kreel and the Task Force escaped the brunt of his wrath by presenting a valuable captive- the Protocol droid C-3PO."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kreel and SCAR Squadron took 3PO to the Devastator where they attempted to interrogate him in order to find the Rebel fleet or any new bases.
