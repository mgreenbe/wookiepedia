The spell allowed the caster to project their thoughts towards another individual. That individual would \"hear\" the thoughts and then \"feel\" the emotion accompanying it. The spell was used to communicate with the mind of another, but could not be used to control them. The recipient was aware that the thoughts and feelings were not their own, but did not know who the caster was unless they identified themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ascendants who wished to cast the spell were required to know the receptive empathy spell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
