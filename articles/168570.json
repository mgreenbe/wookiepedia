As the New Republic replaced the Galactic Empire and ended the Imperial Blockade of Zolan, the already existing tensions between the two species reached its limits. The New Republic tried to intercede to establish a peace between the two species. However, the assassination of a New Republic diplomat resulted eventually in a full-scale war. The Clawdite claimed three quarters of the planet, and dominated the Zolanders. The war ended circa 25 ABY and the Clawdites were making overtures to the New Republic when the Yuuzhan Vong War began."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
