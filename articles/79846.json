Calrissian Senior first learned of his wife's pregnancy while on the planet Kashyyyk late in the year 40 ABY. Already over seventy years old, he was shaken by the news, believing simultaneously that he was both too old and not yet ready to be a father. His friends Han and Leia Organa Solo reassured him, however, pointing out that the wealthy couple would spoil their child and would be the parents that everyone dreamed of having. Feeling better about the situation, Calrissian told his friends he would likely comm them for parenting advice, and he left Kashyyyk to be with his wife."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 43 ABY, Lando Calrissian, Junior was a curly-haired infant who greatly resembled his father.

The Calrissian family owned eight homes, including one on Kuat, and when the Solos visited them at their seaside residence on Lujo, Calrissian Junior was greeted by their granddaughter Allana. He shyly showed her his Perystal doll, a dragon from the holovid program Castle Creep, before retreating to the comfort of his father.

After their arrival, Calrissian Junior played with Allana under the watchful eye of his nanny droid, Nanna, as well as the Solos' droids C-3PO and R2-D2, in a chamber adjacent to the conference room where the adults sat and discussed their problem. Nanna later put him down for a nap, and when he woke up, he joined Allana in the cafeteria, where he was confused that the Solos had not yet returned. They had in fact been trapped in the mines behind walls of rock, but the senior Calrissians were later able to locate them while their son ate breakfast with Allana."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the help of some old friends, the Calrissians and Solos sucessfully stabilized the Great Kessel Fault.
