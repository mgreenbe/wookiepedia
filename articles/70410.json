The school had several preparatory programs including Endurance and Agility and various obstacle courses. Jelucan had a preparatory academy because the Empire limited recruitment from former Separatist worlds like Jelucan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The school was headed by a proctor and the academy staff personally handpicked the students. Due to the limited slots, competition was fierce and the academy's coaches were known to disqualify students who suffered physical injuries during training.
