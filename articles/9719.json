The prefix \"Ast\" was a remnant of the planet's history as an Galactic Republic astrocartographic research outpost, originally established to map the areas of Wild Space closed to the Moddell sector. The Republic constructed a ring of orbital telescopes around Ast Kikorie that connected to Kikorie City by a skyhook, but eventually abandoned them when the Clone Wars broke out in 22 BBY. Over time, the telescopes were abandoned but not forgotten. During the early years of the New Republic, astrocartographers found records of Ast Kikories' telescopes, and made the dangerous journey to the Moddell sector in order to use \"free\" telescope time. The natives of the planet called it \"Down Below,\" a reference to the ring of telescopes and other docking platforms that filled Ast Kikorie's skies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
