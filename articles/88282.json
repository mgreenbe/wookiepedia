A Sith Lord known as Belia Darzu derived the power from mechu-deru, a technique granting absolute control over mechanical systems through the Force. Using her knowledge of mechu-deru, along with Sith alchemy, Darzu created a technovirus capable of converting the flesh of living beings into metallic parts, eventually transforming them into technobeasts.
