In 3000 BBY, Iliana attempted to manipulate Caretaker Varner Hilts to give her and her faction political on Testament Day. This attempt failed after Hilts tricked her into believing that the holocron of Yaru Korsin, which contained Korsin's Testimony, would only activate on Testament Day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Testament Day, the Tribe discovered an older transmission beneath Korsin's Testament which revealed that the Lost Tribe were actually descended from slaves of the Red Sith which ruled the former Sith Empire. This development sparked the Great Crisis which resulted in much rioting and unrest across Keshtah Minor. Iliana herself took part in the fighting and wounded several rival Sith. However, the Sisters of Seelah quickly fell apart within two weeks to internal infighting and Iliana barely survived.

After much difficulty, the three explorers discovered the Tapani heritage of the Lost Tribe's ancestors and learnt that Kesh had another continent known as Alanciar. Through these discoveries, Hilts was able to unite the various Sith factions and set the Tribe on a new mission of reaching and annexing this new continent. Hilts was unanimously elected by the other Sith as their new Grand Lord. Iliana subsequently became his wife, viewing this marriage as a means of sharing Hilts' power over the Tribe. While an ancient law stipulated that the consort of the Grand Lord was to be executed at the latter's death, Hilts vowed to protect her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Hilts Restoration, Iliana reigned with her husband Lord Hilts during the Hilts Restoration and supported his efforts to explore and colonize Alanciar. She later gave birth to a daughter named Takara Hilts, who shared her mother's bright red hair and fiery temperament. Takara was also Force-sensitive like her parents and would later become the Prefect of Police of the Tahv Constabulary by 2974 BBY. That same year, Takara prevented an assassination attempt against Grand Lord Hilts and apprehended the assassin Parlan Spinner, a Sith outcast. While Iliana and her daughter Takara desired Spinner's execution, Lord Hilts decided to spare the youth and sent him on an expeditionary mission to Eshkrene, in the planet's south pole. Spinner would later be responsible for freeing the ancient Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa which led to Dreypa's rebellion that devastated parts of Keshtah Minor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iliana led the Tribe's forces against the rebels and inflicted heavy casualties on Dreypa's forces during the Battle of the Marisota Floodplain. Most of the Sith forces were later wiped out during the Battle of Sessal Spire by Dreypa's Leviathans, reptilian Sithspawn capable of draining the life energies and knowledge of sentient beings. Iliana was almost devoured by a leviathan but was rescued by Spinner, who subsequently joined forces with Takara and Kaliska of the Doomed to stop Dreypa. Iliana was greatly weakened by the Leviathan and as a resulted aged by several decades. Despite the loss of her fighting prowess, Iliana was still able to lead the defense of Tahv which marked the death and defeat of Dreypa.

Following the Night of the Upside-Down Meteor in 3960 BBY which saw the disappearance of Grand Lord Lillia Venn, the Lost Tribe had descended into chaos and internal infighting with many rival Sith factions fighting for control of the Tribe. This conflict lasted for nine hundred years and devastated the continent of Keshtah Minor. Many of its cities including the capital Tahv ceased to functioned properly due to a lack of proper maintenance. At some time prior to 3000 BBY, Iliana became a member of the Sisters of Seelah, an all-female faction of the Lost Tribe. The cult consisted entirely of women and believed that Seelah Korsin was the true founder of the Tribe and that her husband Yaru and Nida Korsin were traitors. Like their role model, the Sisterhood practiced selective breeding and saw themselves as perfect specimens of humanity."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Enter the Historian"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3000 BBY, Iliana Merko and her fellow Sisters of Seelah took over the Kesh capitol building, a palace in the capital city Tahv, which had traditionally been the residence of the ruling Grand Lord. She visited the office of Caretaker Varner Hilts, who was entrusted with preserving the Lost Tribe's written historical records and lores. Hilts was an elderly sixty-year old man who was the Tribe's de-facto historian and who worked and resided in part of the Circle Eternal. Testament Day was going to be held within twelve days time and Iliana wanted to coerce the historian Hilts into giving her faction a political favor. Testament Day was a holiday held every twenty-five years where the final testament of Yaru Korsin, the founder of the Lost Tribe, was read out before the Tribe. For centuries, Testament Day had been the only time when the Tribe's entire hierarchy met peacefully together. Even after the Sith splintered into warrior factions following the Night of the Upside-Down Meteor, this day was respected as a time of peace out of deference to the Tribe's ancestors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iliana's armed followers waited within the palace atrium while Iliana herself walked into Hilts' office, demanding to see him. She threatened Hilt's Keshiri assistant Jaye Vuhld with her lightsaber in order to draw Hilts' attention. Iliana expressed her displeasure that the palace atrium contained no statues of Seelah Korsin but only contained statues of her estranged husband Yaru Korsin and her daughter Nida Korsin. Millennia earlier in 4975 BBY, Seelah and her son Jariad Korsin had plotted to overthrow Yaru Korsin. This coup failed with Korsin killed and a crippled Seelah was banished to the Omen, the Sith warship that had brought the ancestors of the Lost Tribe to Kesh during the Great Hyperspace War. Since the failed coup, all statues of Seelah had been destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iliana wanted to talk with Varner Hilts about the contents of Korsin's Testament before the other Sith arrived for the conclave in twelve days time. Hilts responded that everyone already knew about the contents of the Testament since it had been transcribed many times. Iliana reiterated that she knew the basic facts but then revealed the true reason for why she had come. Iliana was aware that Korsin's Testament had been used by different Sith factions to support their claims and to denigrate Seelah. Since the Sisters of Seelah had little to gain from Korsin's Testament, she tried to convince Hilts to change the Testament to favor her faction. Iliana wanted Varner Hilts to tell the other Sith that he and his Keshiri workers had discovered Korsin's \"true\" Testament which declared that Seelah and those who followed her teachings today were the legitimate heirs to power on Kesh. As part of her plan, the Sisters had produced a fake scroll that purported to be Korsin's \"true\" Testament."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By producing Korsin's \"true\" Testament, Iliana intended to uplift the Sisters of Seelah's standing within Sith society. However, the historian Hilts was unwilling to cooperate with Iliana's scheme. While he admired the Sith woman's initiative, Hilts contended that Iliana's plan would not work because the Caretakers in reality did not actually read Korsin's Testament. He explained that the Testament was actually read by a holo-recording of Yaru Korsin himself which was kept inside a holocron, a pyramidical crystal lattice device used by both the Jedi and the Sith to store historical memories and lesson. In an effort to buy time until Testament Day, Hilts lied to Iliana that the holocron would only activate on Testament Day. This did not stop Iliana from fiddling with the holocron in a vain attempt to activate the projector."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Testament Day"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After four days, Iliana grew impatient with having to wait until Testament Day. Iliana's forces continued to occupy the Circle Eternal and imprisoned the workers in a room but left Varner Hilts and his secretary Jaye alone. Iliana and the Sisters' presence in Tahv was observed by the spies of several rival Sith factions including the Korsinite League, Golden Destiny, Force 57. The Sisters of Seelah guarded the Circle Eternal's entrance in an effort to deny entry to their opponents. Over this period, the number of visitors which included the Human Sith and their Keshiri followers grew which increased the risk of violence on the streets of Tahv. These Sith factions initially held off on violence but instead exploited the mass public gathering as a change to recruit people to their causes. This year's Testament Day also coincided with the Festival of Nida's Rise which commemorated the ascension of Nida Korsin to the office of Grand Lord every seventy-nine years. While there was a festive mood, there was also a risk that violence could escalate due to the high concentration of Sith factions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout this period, Iliana struggled to activate the holocron. Since it was a recording device, she speculated that it must have a power source which she guessed was a Lignan crystal. Hilts told her if she found out how the holocron worked, she would become the Caretaker of the Tribe herself. While Hilts was physically attracted to Iliana's beauty, he disliked her arrogant, venal, and untrustworthy personality. Hilts was a bachelor who had never married due to his lowly position and the selfish nature of many Sith adherents. Frustrated at Hilt's unwillingness to help her to activate the Holocron, Iliana ordered her followers to harm Hilts' Keshiri secretary Jaye if he refused to cooperate. Hilts reluctantly took the Holocron in his hand and agreed to activate it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that point, Iliana and Varner were both interrupted by the arrival of two rival Sith factions: the Korsinite League and Force 57. The Korsinite League was a Sith cult that had been founded by a former slave a century earlier which emulated Yaru Korsin and Nida Korsin. Each member adopted the name \"Korsin\" as their first name and their leader was Korsin Bentado. Meanwhile, Force 57 were another Sith cult that practiced ritual mutilation and scarring and were devoted to the original non-Human 57 aliens that were aboard the Omen. Since Seelah Korsin had destroyed all origins related to the Red Sith, no living Sith or Keshiri could remember how they looked like. Varner Hilts was able to bring peace to the three factions by offering to do a reading from the holocron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iliana quickly got into an argument with Neera, the leader of Force 57. Neera blamed Seelah for banishing and marginalizing the original 57 from the Precious Pantheon. Iliana retorted that Seelah had been right to purge the original 57 and threatened to do the same to Neera and her followers. However, Varner Hilts restrained the two parties and reminded them that the Circle Eternal was not the place for violence. Korsin Bentado suggested that the three Sith factions take their fight outside into the streets where several other factions had gathered. Hilts was unwilling to let bloodshed take place and offered to do the holocron reading. When Iliana realized that Hilts had lied, he retorted that lying was a Sith characteristic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bentado reiterated that the Korsinite League would not accept a reading of Korsin's Testament on any day besides the anniversary which was scheduled to occur within eight days time. At that point, Varner Hilts convinced his Keshiri assistant Jaye to present his calculations concerning the Sandpipes. Jaye explained that the first Sith colonists had brought their Galactic Standard Calendar to Kesh which differed from the planet's length of days and years. Millennia earlier, the Sith had calibrated their Sandpipes to the magical chrono aboard the Omen prior to abandoning the ship. However, the Sandpipes in Tahv flowed one second slower than those aboard the Omen. This time difference meant that the Standard Calendar was eight days ahead of the Keshiri calendar. Hilts and Jaye then deduced that Testament Day and the Festival of Nida's Rise actually occurred on that day. Thus, Hilts was able to declare the Pantheon's Peace and ordered the assembled Sith to bring in the other Sith factions into the atrium."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "An Inglorious Past"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twenty leaders from the various Sith factions watched the holocron recording of Yaru Korsin. Per Sith tradition, all Keshiri were excluded from the Pantheon's Peace since it contained sensitive secrets about the Tribe's origins. The Tribe's founder had been mortally wounded during Seelah's failed plot and had recorded his final testament to the Tribe. During the recording, Korsin expounded about the importance of the Tribe as a survival mechanism for the Human Sith on Kesh and how the Tribe's hierarchical structure should be managed to prevent future uprisings. Iliana was visibly angry when the late Grand Lord suggested the practice of killing the spouses of deceased future Grand Lords and talked about banishing Seelah. Iliana was also bored during Korsin's discussion about the political structure of the Tribe. Meanwhile, Caretaker Varner Hilts was worried that the holocron recording contained no resolution that would end the infighting between the rival Sith factions or protect his staff and his position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the end of Korsin's Testament, the assembled conclave descended into a verbal match. Korsin Bentado argued that the Tribe needed to adhere to Korsin's ancient tribal structure while the leader of the Golden Destiny, a faction obsessed with the Tribe's stellar origins, argued that the Tribe should reopen the Omen and return to the stars. Due to the loss of historical knowledge during the Time of the Rot, the Golden Destiny's leader mistakenly believed that Yaru Korsin was a \"great conqueror\" and that the Sith came from a powerful people who ruled the galaxy. While attempting to deactivate the holocron, Hilts discovered that the Testament recording had been recorded over an earlier transmission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The assembled Sith quickly learnt the true history of the Lost Tribe. It turned out that Yaru Korsin had used the holocron as a communications device during his servitude to the Sith Empire. Rather than being conquerors from a glorious past, the Human Sith had actually been slaves to the Sith Lord Naga Sadow, a red-skinned and tentacled-face humanoid. The \"vaunted\" Yaru Korsin was merely a \"delivery boy.\" The Omen was a dreadnought which had been tasked with delivering Lignan crystals to Sith forces on Kirrek during the Great Hyperspace War. In addition, Sadow dispatched Ravilan Wroth and his Massassi warriors to work with Korsin. It quickly transpired that Wroth and the \"Original 57\" had actually been members of an alien species known as the Red Sith, the original forebears of the Sith Order and the alien masters of the Tribe's ancestors. Finally, Sadow warned Korsin that he expected nothing but success and that failure would be punishable by death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These revelations about the Lost Tribe's origins as slaves sparked anxiety and panic among the attendees. Korsin Bentado initially reacted with disbelief and commented that Naga Sadow had been \"Korsin's celestial ally\" in folk tales. He was shocked to learn that the \"thing\" actually owned the Omen and its crew. In response, Iliana commented that the Tribe's ancestors had not been conquerors but had merely been \"diggers in the dirt\" and that the Tribe's founder had merely been a \"delivery boy\". Similarly, Neera commented that this was not Sith but madness. Iliana herself commented that this \"inglorious past\" had been what motivated Seelah Korsin to implement eugenics policies on the Tribe. She deduced that Seelah was \"sanctifying\" the Humans on Kesh. Korsin Bentado accused Hilts and Iliana of tampering with the holocron. Hilts responded that he would not have known how to tamper with the device."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Caretaker then concluded that the Sith Tribe was just a \"lost\" Tribe that had ended up on Kesh because Korsin was unwilling to go back and face Sadow. Ashamed at the stigma that her ancestors had been merely runaway slaves, Iliana ignited her lightsaber and used it to destroy the holocron and the pedestal it stood upon. When asked by Hilts to justify her actions, Iliana warned the Sith that their ancestors did not want them to know about their \"inglorious past.\" She reasoned that the Tribe's origins as slaves had motivated Seelah to forbid any records of what Ravilan's people really looked like. She concluded that Korsin had recorded over the message to preserve this secret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the historian Hilts was open to telling the true story of the Tribe's origins, Korsin feared that this would inspire a revolt among the Keshiri. Neera vowed to kill anyone who revealed this secret while Iliana stressed that such measures would not be necessary since she had already destroyed the holocron. Despite efforts by the leaders of the Sith factions to preserve the secrecy of the Testament Day, a drunken Sith leader revealed the truth behind the Lost Tribe's origins to the Humans celebrating the Festival of Nida's Rise. This sparked a series of violent riots across Keshtah Minor, known as the Great Crisis, which resulted in the razing of several cities. Within eight days, the unrest had spread all over the continent. Since the Tribe had been reduced to a few thousand individuals, the ensuing bloodbath threatened the viability of the Tribe itself."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Visiting the Omen"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the disastrous Testament Day, Iliana and the Sisters of Seelah were distressed by the revelations that their revered ancestor had been a slave. The Sisters had taken part in the fighting following Testament Day but quickly fell apart within two weeks. During the fighting, Iliana severed the left hand of Korsin Bentado. Bentado survived but vowed vengeance against the Sith woman. Iliana herself barely survived the unrest and was wounded and bloodied during the fighting. Alone and destitute, Iliana made her way to the Kesh Sith Temple to escape the other Sith factions, who wanted her blood for killing several of their members during the fighting.

While in the Omen, she encountered Varner Hilts and Jaye, who had also decided to visit the Omen and unseal the temple. During the Testament, Korsin had mentioned that he had secrets and that his true power was behind the throne on his ship the Omen, which was buried beneath the Sith Temple.

She was crying because she could not come to terms that her ancestor had died alone. She was distraught that her forebears had left Seelah to die alone and forgotten on the Sith Temple. Based on the barriers below, she surmised that Nida Korsin had punished her mother by exiling her to the ship. Iliana expressed her anger at the unjust treatment of Seelah. She also revealed to Hilts that she had experienced a Force vision during her childhood of Seelah telling her to avenge her. When Hilts asked Iliana whether this was how she learnt how to braid her hair, Iliana replied that she had seen Seelah washing the feet of the Sith quartermaster Ravilan. The revelation of Seelah's lowly origins destroyed the Sisters' unity of purpose and splintered the group. Enraged at this revelation, she smashed Seelah's skull against the wall which shattered into pieces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jaye revealed his presence, Iliana was startled but Hilts assured her that the Keshiri was on his side. A despondent Iliana chided Hilts for keeping \"pets\" at a time when the world was \"coming to an end\", exposing her speciesist streak. The Caretaker Hilts succeeded in convincing Iliana to follow them since they might need her help to find what they were looking for. Hilts also surmised that Iliana was at a dead end while he and Jaye actually had a plan. Iliana reluctantly complied and she led them to the Omen which was situated directly beneath the Sith Temple. They eventually discovered the starship and managed to enter it. Iliana tried to press the black panels but was unable to restart the ship since it had not be maintained for millennia. In frustration, Iliana slammed her fist on a panel, causing it to crack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Hilts and Jaye found that the ship's chrono still worked. The chrono was the model for the Tribe's Sandpipes which had been used for millennia to record time. This discovery validated Jaye's earlier theory that the Sandpipes at Tahv were eight days behind the Galactic Standard Calendar. However, Iliana was unable to find the command chair which was usually at the center of the command bridge. Hilts reasoned that the command chair was not inside the Omen since it have been moved by Yaru Korsin to the colonnade of the temple for use on the days when he received visitors. Iliana was perplexed that Korsin had ordered everyone to move from the mountain to Tahv. While their generation may not have been able to repair the Omen, she felt that Korsin was foolish to have stopped work on the ship entirely."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hilts responded that Korsin had wanted the Tribe to commit to living on Kesh based on the fact that they had built the Sith Temple around the Omen. Shortly later, the three explorers heard the voices of eight newcomers including Korsin Bentado and Edell Vrai, a young member of the Golden Destiny. These newcomers were disturbed that the Omen had been used to transport slaves eons ago and was the cause for their ancestors' \"imprisonment\" on Kesh. Bentando wanted the Tribe to meet its end with hatred against fate. Iliana reasoned that they would not be able to destroy the Omen due to its vast size and the lack of explosives.

Iliana commented that Bentado and Vrai did not need to destroy the vessel since it was already dead and buried. Despite their fierce divisions, a desire to eradicate their \"shameful\" past had brought the Sith together. Meanwhile, Jaye had discovered a latch which led to the Sith Temple's rotunda.

The three explorers quickly realized that they were inside a planetarium which depicted the stars above Kesh. However, they could find nothing behind the throne and the star map above contained no clues to Korsin's secrets.

Hilts then reasoned that Korsin's secret was hidden inside the chair. He borrowed Iliana's shikkar knife and used it to cut a hole through the upholstery behind the seat. Hilts discovered a glass vial was sewn to the upholstery which contained a single rolled-up sheet of transparent film. Hilts brought it to the fire and discovered that it contained the old cant of the Tapani, the language of the Humans under Sith rule. This film contained a message from Yaru Korsin's mother Takara Korsin to her son prior to his fateful delivery run to Phaegon III during the Great Hyperspace War.

Hilts believed that he could use Takara Korsin's document to reason with the other Sith and dissuade them from destroying the Omen. Iliana disagreed and argued that the other Sith were not willing to reason. Instead, she offered to rally the other Sith to her own cause.

He concluded that the star map was merely decorative and that Korsin's real focus was on building an empire on Kesh. Iliana recalled that Yaru Korsin had made his final testament after he had been mortally wounded and had made his way back to the chair to record the Testament.

Hilts and Iliana decided to test Jaye's theory especially since the other Sith were closing on them. The three explorers made their way to the sealed chamber at the seventh step.

Hilts agreed and speculated that Korsin had died in this room from his injuries. Hilts speculated that Korsin's chair had been left upstairs in the planetarium by Nida as a ruse to mislead people into thinking that Yaru had spent all his time contemplating the cosmos and their return.

Hilts argued that the Tribe was not doomed but Edell disagreed and argued that the end had already happened but that the Tribe was ignorant about it.

The mathematician Edell Vrai was assigned with the task of developing a means of transportation to Alanciar which could be replicated. The Lost Tribe faced several difficulties. Firstly, the uvaks were not able to fly for such long distances. Secondly, the Tribe was unable to develop a fleet of ocean-going vessels since the hejarbo plants were too fragile for ocean voyages and hardwoods like vosso were too dense to float.

In addition, she also attended to the health of her husband which occasionally irritated him. Iliana brought Kesh's best skin experts to attend to the dermatological needs of Varner Hilts. However, Grand Lord Hilts had them banished because they wanted to apply an organic poultice on his skin which vexed him. These unfortunate servants ended up \"grooming\" icebergs.

To keep an otherwise idle Bentado from creating new cults, she convinced Grand Lord Hilts to appoint the former as High Lord and place him in charge of the invasion force to attack Alanciar as soon as Vrai had proved its existence. In 2975 BBY, Edell led a reconnaissance force to explore Alanciar which made contact with the Alanciari. However, the expedition was attacked by the well-armed and disciplined Alanciari military.

While this news was something of \"Kesh-shaking\" importance, her husband was too preoccupied with writing his own revised testament which would discuss the Tribe's Tapani heritage and how they escaped Sith subjugation. During the meeting, Bentado cited the recent telepathic mesage as evidence that Edell and airships had discovered Alanciar.

When Iliana speculated that Edell and his airships may have crashed into the Southern Ocean, her husband replied that he was still alive since he would have sensed his death. In the end, Hilts reluctantly gave approval for Bentado to invade Alanciar. However, in private, Iliana and her husband dismissed Lord Bentado as a fool who was sending his forces to a watery death.

They also managed to hijack an Alanciari fishing trawler Mischance which they used to return to Keshtah through the dangerous Southern Passage which led into the Sea of Flames. In addition, the Sith also managed to obtain a copy of Adari Vaal's popular history book, the Keshtah Chronicles, which provided the Sith with invaluable intelligence on what the Alanciari knew about them. While Edell's lieutenant Peppin sailed back to Keshtah with Jogan, Edell stayed behind with Quarra who agreed to serve as his guide for an inland reconnaissance mission into Alanciar.

Jogan was also brought to meet the leaders of the \"Protectors\" who claimed to be an egalitarian ruling circle where no man or woman ranked above the other. However, Hilts did not inform Bentado of these new developments. Based on his reading of the Keshtah Chronicles, he realized that the Keshiri would treat Bentado as an \"evil invader\" and were able to resist him.

In Alanciar's highly militarized and advanced society, Bentado saw the opportunity of creating a \"Second Tribe\" with himself as its \"Grand Lord\".
