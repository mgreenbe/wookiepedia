During the Mandalorian Wars of 3976\u20133960 BBY, however, the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders attacked the planet Nouane, and the mini-empire turned to the Republic for assistance. Noaune was admitted into the Republic and reorganized into an Allied Region, the name given to a semi-autonomous region of space allied with the galactic government. Leaders of Allied Regions typically held the title of Moff or Grand Moff. As the centuries went by, the status of Allied Regions became largely ceremonial and the territories were gradually absorbed into the Republic as sectors; Nouane was one of the few to remain until the end of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time, many of the Allied Region's worlds, scattered among 212 inhabited star systems, became well-known throughout the Republic.

The Four Sages of Dwartii, from the Dwartii system, brought their coldly-merciless political philosophy to the Republic, where it was greatly contested and studied."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 19 BBY, centuries after Nouane joined it, the Republic was transformed into a Galactic Empire.

However, when the Imperial government fell after the Battle of Endor and was gradually replaced by the New Republic, Nouane declared its independence. During Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn's campaign against the New Republic in 9 ABY, Nouane was neutral. By 16 ABY, the New Republic's reconnaissance vessel IX-26 was on a patrol assignment in Nouane before it was diverted to the Obroan Institute on Obroa-skai to pick up an archaeological team to aid in the investigation surrounding the organic starship known as the Teljkon Vagabond and its frozen homeworld of Brath Qella."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The region of Nouane was briefly mentioned in 1996's Before the Storm, written by Michael P.
