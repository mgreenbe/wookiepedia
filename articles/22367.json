The stress of his job regularly left CZ-4 feeling strained, and at times when not needed by Jabba he would temporarily switch himself off. When C-3PO and R2-D2 were brought before Jabba's supervisor droid EV-9D9 inside the palace's droid workshop, CZ-4 was resting against a wall. As C-3PO was ushered out by a Gamorrean guard, he suddenly came face to face with the motionless, skeletal-looking CZ-4, and let out a startled wail. Later, when Luke Skywalker made his appearance before Jabba requesting that Han Solo be released, CZ-4 was back up in the palace throne room."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The same droid prop used for CZ-3 in A New Hope was used for CZ-4 in Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
