The array was located on a beach surrounded by a river that stretched past its western and northern sides. A thick forest covered the eastern side. The array was only accessible by land from a shallow path through the river on the north. The other side of the river had three sentry posts to alert the Federation of anyone approaching the listening array."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The array consisted of six transmitters for listening in on Wookiee communications. One was placed on elevated ground near the entrance and guarded by a droideka and two B1-Series battle droids. Four transmitters occupied the lower middle section of the array, with one adjacent to the river and the other three in a triangular arrangement closer to the forest, where the ground was more elevated. Two B1 battle droids and two advanced beetle droids guarded the transmitters. The last transmitter was placed on a strip of land that jutted out into the river, and was guarded by another droideka. Various trees grew throughout the array."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The listening array was built at some point between 39 BBY and 36 BBY, as part of the Trade Federation's illegal colonization attempt on Alaris Prime.
