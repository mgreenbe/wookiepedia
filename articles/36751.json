During his childhood, Wyrick was captured by Iskalloni slavers from whom he learned his infamous surgical techniques. Subsequently released by a Mandalorian raid, the young Zeltron was taken into Mando'ade culture and trained in martial arts by Mandalore the Indomitable himself. In 3996 BBY, after the Duel on Kuar and the victory of Ulic Qel-Droma over Mandalore, Wyrick became fascinated by the Force and its mechanisms. Having stolen the robe of the Arkanian Jedi Master Arca Jeth in Ulic's affairs during the Great Sith War, the scientist began experimenting with a hair found in the clothes of the disappeared master at the end of the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the war, Wyrick became engaged to a Zeltron woman and had a child with her, whom they named Chantique. He was also the master of a mysterious school on Osadia, in which Chantique and Edessa were pupils. When the school was destroyed by the Crucible, Wyrick was crushed. Wyrick later became a Mandalorian Neo-Crusader, under the alias of Doctor Demagol, and served as Mandalore the Ultimate's lieutenant with Cassus Fett during the Mandalorian Wars. After the capture of Flashpoint Station by the Mandalorians, all Jedi prisoners were sent there to be studied by Demagol, in hopes of finding the secret of their powers to negate and/or replicate them, not understanding the complexity of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Zayne Carrick, a fugitive Jedi Padawan, arrived at Flashpoint intending to free Jarael, as well as the Jedi there, Demagol switched armor with Mandalorian Rohlan Dyre, whom he drugged in a coma, and joined Carrick under this guise. Dyre, falling into a coma, was transferred to Coruscant. Demagol traveled with Carrick and his crew, showing an interest in Jarael, whom he believed was actually Edessa. Eventually Jarael left Carrick's company, and Demagol followed her, revealing his true identity. He manipulated Jarael and Chantique into a duel to reveal Jarael's true abilities.

Sometime in his childhood, Antos was taken in by Iskalloni slavers.

By learning their surgical techniques, Antos was able to survive and adapt to the Iskalloni lifestyle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At sometime just prior to the Great Sith War the Mandalorians invaded Iskadrell. As a result, many slaves of the Iskalloni were taken into Mandalorian culture, including young Antos. Through Mandalorian medics, Antos learned of other species throughout the galaxy, and Mandalore the Indomitable himself taught Martial Arts to the Zeltron. After the Duel on Kuar, Antos was stunned that the Sith Lord Ulic Qel-Droma was able to best Mandalore in single combat. He began to wonder what was inside the Jedi to give him this power. While Ulic was preoccupied, Antos sneaked into his cabin and began to look for evidence that could help him understand the Jedi's powers. Inside a chest he found a robe that Qel-Droma had carried around with him. Believing he could find answers in a genetic trace, Antos took the robe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The war prevented Antos from beginning his research, but with the death of his mentor and the Mandalorians suffering another humiliating defeat, Antos felt it was time to shed his armor and head for Republic space, once again taking Qel-Droma's robe with him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antos immediately found a place in an Arkanian University that was recently named for their fallen hero; Arca Jeth. Antos's talents caused him to excel at the school, up until the day the Adasca family had the school purged of all \"alien\" students. Even after he was forced to leave, Antos was determined to finish what he started. Finding friends in unlikely places, Antos developed good relations with the Arkanian Offshoot community. Continuing his work with these brilliant students, Antos eventually made the discovery he was looking for: a small hair on the robe revealed that the original owner was not Ulic Qel-Droma at all, but the Jedi Master and Arkanian hero Arca Jeth.

With his comrades and a few volunteers, Antos formed a school on the planet Osadia. However, in actuality it was a cover for Antos to run his experiments to create Mandalorian Knights using Jeth's DNA. Antos's main goal was to create a vanguard for an eventual Mandalorian revolution. He modified infants in vitro, but to no success. However, Antos eventually discovered that Jeth was not pure Arkanian; he had Sephi blood. This had been causing complications with the birth parents. Armed with this new knowledge, Antos continued his work, and eventually two offshoot researchers were able to give birth to Edessa. During this time, Antos met and became engaged to a Zeltron woman, and the couple had a daughter, whom they named Chantique."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Antos' greed knew no bounds, and he had bargained with the Crucible slaving organization to obtain more offshoot families. He even traded Chantique, considered a serious crime among the Mandalorians, simply because she was disruptive. The Crucible soon proved it was more greedy than he was. While Antos was away to report his success to Mandalore, the Crucible, led by Dace Golliard, attacked the school using Skyreaper drones, kidnapping his students, ransacking his lab and killing his guards. When Antos's colleagues learned of his dealings with the Crucible, they wanted nothing more to do with him, feeling that the lost children had been truly theirs. Devastated by the loss of his students, especially Edessa, whom Antos called his \"triumph,\" the Zeltron searched the galaxy for the children, but to no avail.

Adasca promised to cure Camper and so brought Demagol, Camper and The Last Resort on board his flagship, the Arkanian Legacy.

He asked him to contact Mandalore the Ultimate and inform him of a meeting with Adasca concerning the biological creatures known as exogorths. Demagol was hesitant to do this since it would reveal his location to those looking for him. However, Adasca promised him safe passage off the Arkanian Legacy should he do this. Adasca knew immediately that this wouldn't be enough. Demagol told him that he would only do it if Jarael would accompany him off. Arkoh knew he wouldn't be able to give Jarael up and Demagol knew why: Adasca needed Jarael to keep Camper under his control.

Zayne and Carth Onasi then realized that neither party would want the other to have control of the exogorths. Demagol further backs up that Mandalore sees the slugs as a surprise and would be satisfied if no one controls them. He gives Zayne his new armor as a disguise for his plan.
