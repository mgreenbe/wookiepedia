A hardcover first edition was published on January 5, 2016. The unusual publishing schedule was arranged directly by The Walt Disney Company with Del Rey, who agreed to forego holiday sales of print copies of the novel to prevent sensitive plot details from leaking. David Moench, a spokesperson for Del Rey, expressed that the publisher would have preferred to put out the hardcover edition on the same day as the film but understood the importance of preserving the secrecy. When J.J. Abrams, the film's director, was contacted by The Wall Street Journal regarding the story, he stated that he was not previously aware of the decision but looked forward to reading the novel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The novel contains several differences to the film and scenes that do not appear in the final film:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The novel opens with a scene of Leia Organa thinking about the events of the past and about having sent an exceptional Resistance pilot, Poe Dameron, to try and find her brother, Luke Skywalker. This is followed by the opening scene of the movie, in which the First Order forces on approach to Jakku. During the attack on Tuanul, FN-2003 is killed by blaster fire from one of the Tuanul villagers instead by blaster fire of Dameron as in the film. FN-2187's failure to shoot the villagers is thought by one of his fellow troopers to be due to a \"blaster jam,\" explaining why Captain Phasma orders him to turn in his weapon to be checked by technicians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Niima Outpost, rather than refusing outright Unkar Plutt's offer of 60 portions for BB-8, Rey instead bargains up. She ends up agreeing to sell him for 100 portions, but then retracts the deal and gives Plutt a piece of her mind. This burns her bridges with him, but earns her respect from many of the villagers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the novel, Leia sends her personal envoy, Korr Sella, to persuade the Galactic Senate to act against the First Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A scene depicts Dameron's encounter with a scavenger on Jakku and his escape from the planet following the crash of the stolen TIE fighter.

Rey tries to shoot him with the blaster Han gave her, but she has not taken the safety off, and she is quickly disarmed by Plutt. Rey is rescued by the intervention of Chewbacca, whom Plutt aggravates by poking at his wounded shoulder. Chewbacca responds by ripping off Plutt's arm. This scene was shot, but ultimately cut from the film. During Rey's Force vision, she hears a voice say, \"Stay here. I'll come back for you,\" and \"I'll come back, sweetheart, I promise.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Starkiller Base destroys the Hosnian system, it is described as utilizing \"dark energy\" acquired from the sun. The destroyed planets and moons become miniature supernovae rather than slag. During a conversation between Kylo Ren and Supreme Leader Snoke, they discuss Darth Vader and his downfall, which they agree was due to \"sentiment.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finn tells the Resistance that Starkiller base uses its sun to channel dark energy, which temporarily blocks it out, rather than saying the star itself is drained until destroyed. A scene depicts Finn and Rey stealing a snowspeeder while on Starkiller Base. This starts a snowspeeder chase sequence. The chase was one of the scenes that was filmed but cut from the movie. Later, Kylo Ren leads a small group of stormtroopers to the crashed Millennium Falcon while on Starkiller Base.
