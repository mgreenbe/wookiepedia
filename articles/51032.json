Fulluusub was part artist's colony, part independent inventor's retreat, part insane asylum, as many Sullustans who failed SoroSuub's psychological screening ended up there. It was a free-thinking city, unique on the planet, and as such, its residents weren't necessarily anti-SoroSuub, but interested in life outside its corporate confines. However, anti-corporate Sullustans, employees of rival companies, and various fanatics were more welcome in Fulluusub than elsewhere, so that the average Sullustan found the environment of the place somewhat sinister."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
