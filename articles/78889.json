They were approached by a diplomatic party from the Rebel Alliance during the height of the Galactic Civil War. Some members wished to join the rebels, whereas others feared retribution from the Galactic Empire. No decision was ever made, however, as one member of the council betrayed the rebels to the Empire, and Star Destroyer came to the planet, unloading Stormtroopers secretly by delivering them onto the planet in cargo ships. A young man by the name of CSL Danenberger informed to the diplomats, and they promptly left the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
