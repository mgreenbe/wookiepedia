The Jedi-Bendu, at that time the bodyguards of the Emperor, had revolted against the authority of the Emperor, resulting in their exile and manhunt, as well as their replacement by a rival faction known as the Knights of the Sith. It was considered a very turbulent time for the Empire, with the Emperor ascendant in the aftermath of the rebellion, Cos Dashit, labeling in a speech his then-upcoming campaign against the Aquilaean System as being the most decisive conflict and the most destiny-upsetting event for the Empire since the Jedi Rebellion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
