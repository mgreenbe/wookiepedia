During the Clone Wars, Belcoze worked in Doctor Gubacher's artificial intelligence team that designed enhanced overseer droids to supervise the battle station labor force. At a Republic Futures Program reunion held in an apartment in 500 Republica, he ranted that the Republic should bomb the Separatist capital Raxus Secundus. After demanding details on Galen Erso's imprisonment on Vallt, he confronted the crystallographer about his possible Separatist sympathies and started a brawl, in which he lost due to slower reflexes. After the rise of the Galactic Empire, Belcoze was part of the research team stationed in the Project Celestial Power facility on Malpaz, where he witnessed the destruction of the city and pled to Orson Krennic that he tried understanding Erso's research as best he could."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
