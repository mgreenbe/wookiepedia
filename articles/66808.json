Often they were responsible for solving crimes and bringing the perpetrators in so that they could face justice, sometimes having to cross vast stretches of the galaxy to do so. Hal Horn was an inspector for the Corellian Security Force up until his death at the hands of Bossk. Lorz Geptun was an inspector for the Judicial Service.
