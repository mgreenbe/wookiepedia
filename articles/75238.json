That year, the Kendall served as the flagship of the Hapan Fleet of the Glorious Defender Queen, which was dispatched to aid the Killiks of the Colony in the Unknown Regions. In doing so, the Kendall briefly went up against the forces of the Chiss Ascendancy in the Gyuel system before helping to relocate the Killiks in order to maintain peace between them and the Chiss. Five years later, the Kendall became the flagship of the Heritage Fleet, whose purpose was to aid Ducha AlGray and the other Hapan members of the Heritage Council in overthrowing the current Hapan monarch, Queen Mother Tenel Ka Djo. However, their plot ultimately failed, and the Kendall was pummeled by a quarter of the Hapan Royal Navy at the planet Hapes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kendall was a 500-meter-long Hapan Battle Dragon produced by Olanji/Charubah. Equipped with both a hyperdrive and sublight drives, the cruiser possessed launching bays and hangars\u2014including one designated for captured starships\u2014and a durasteel-walled hold that featured a single observation bubble. The Kendall also had departure alarms, which were used to announce an imminent jump to hyperspace, as well as intercoms and life support."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Killik troubles"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kendall was serving with the Hapes Consortium's Royal Navy and had been given to Dukat Aleson Gray of House AlGray of the Relephon Moons to command by the year 35 ABY, at the time of the Dark Nest Crisis. Involving the Killiks of the Colony; the Chiss Ascendancy; and the Galactic Alliance and its New Jedi Order, the crisis took place in the Unknown Regions and eventually led to the Swarm War. With the Colony encroaching on Chiss space in the Gyuel system and threatening to escalate the conflict, Hapan Queen Mother Tenel Ka Djo dispatched the Fleet of the Glorious Defender Queen with the Kendall as its flagship to aid the Killiks and dissuade the Chiss from immediately assaulting the Killiks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the fleet was on its way to the planet Qoribu in the Gyuel system, the Kendall encountered the Galactic Alliance freighter Millennium Falcon, which was operating under the alias Longshot, and was also on its way to the same system. The Kendall's Hapan crew members initially wished to impound the freighter but soon discovered its true identity and that it was carrying Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo, the parents of the Queen Mother's new consort, Jedi Jacen Solo, so Gray let them continue on their way. The Hapan forces under Gray did not immediately engage those of the Chiss when the former arrived in the Gyuel system, but the Solos soon revealed to the leaders of both fleet groups that Qoribu's moon of Kr was the site of the nest of the Gorog Kiliiks\u2014who wanted the Dark Nest Crisis to escalate into further violence\u2014and that Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and his wife were currently fighting them there. This prompted the Chiss and the Hapan fleets to attack one another after both tried to aid the Jedi and refused to back down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, after the Gorog were defeated and the misunderstandings between the Chiss and the Hapans sorted out, the Solos devised a plan to move the Killiks from Qoribu to another system not under Chiss control in order to reduce tensions between the two species. To achieve this, the Fleet of the Glorious Defender Queen departed the Gyuel system, transporting the Killiks in the holds of the Hapan vessels, with the Kendall carrying the Taat Killik nest itself."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Flagship of the Heritage Fleet"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 40 ABY, during the Second Galactic Civil War, when the Galactic Alliance was fighting the planet Corellia's Five Worlds government, the Kendall was still in Hapan service. That year, Ducha AlGray of House AlGray and the Heritage Council of Hapan nobles conspired with the Five Worlds to overthrow Queen Mother Djo in order to keep the Hapan homeworld of Hapes independent of the Galactic Alliance. As the new flagship of the council's Heritage Fleet, the Kendall staged with the rest of the fleet and three Corellian Dreadnaughts at a comet in Hapan space, where they arrayed themselves in a three-dimensional diamond formation to attack the planetary defenses of Hapes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just before the Kendall and the Heritage Fleet departed for their attack, the Millennium Falcon, once again under the alias Longshot, found the fleet\u2014Lalu Morwan, a Hapan operative for the Heritage Council, was aboard the Millennium Falcon in addition to the Solos, who supported Corellia in the struggle despite members of their family and relatives serving the Galactic Alliance. Morwan wanted to board the Battle Dragon, but AlGray, in command of the Kendall, did not allow her to do so due to time constraints, and the battle group departed for Hapes with the Millennium Falcon tagging along. However, the Solos betrayed the reversion coordinates of the Heritage Fleet to Djo, and when the Kendall and the fleet exited hyperspace at Hapes, they were immediately set upon by Hapan forces loyal to the Queen Mother. The Heritage Fleet was badly damaged in the surprise attack, and the Kendall soon had a quarter of the Hapan Royal Navy firing upon it. In the end, the Hapan loyalists defeated the Heritage Council and their Corellian allies with the help of the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of the Battle of Qoribu, the Kendall was commanded by Dukat Aleson Gray, and among the ship's crew, Lalu Morwan served as a field surgeon.
