A Vizier acted as a high-ranking political advisor or a respected member of the clergy. A Vizier was often left in charge of a region in the event that the chosen ruler was unable to perform their functions. They were most commonly found in star systems run by a theocracy, but this was not true of all governing bodies. Additionally, on Alderaan a vizier served as the equivalent to a Prime Minister."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "List of known Viziers"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
