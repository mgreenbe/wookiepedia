Shon-Ju had spent time in exile forging a new way to use The Force, channeling it through his hands. He taught this Ithorian and two other students.how to use the Force in a similar way at Shon-Ju's castle on the moon of Cavamina Minor. One day, the Jedi Knight Aayla Secura crash-landed on the moon and was pursued by the mercenary Sabat. Shon-Ju and his students intervened on her behalf, charging directly at Sabat's men. This Ithorian used his Force powers to subdue two of Sabat's men, one of which was a Gungan. An injured Secura then collapsed from her injuries and was taken back to Shon-Ju's castle to recover. She and Shon-Ju agreed to join forces and take down the mercenary Attuma Duum, Sabat's employer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shon-Ju later betrayed Secura and tried to kill Duum to humiliate the Jedi Order.
