Around 3640 BBY the Pendant was in possession of Voss commando Biddeck-Va, who was unaware of its function. When the Emperor's Wrath, sent by Madaga-Ru, asked Biddeck-Va for the Pendant, the Commando merely asked the Sith to kill a Gormak warmaster for him. After the deed was done, Biddeck-Va simply handed over the key of the prison cell to the most powerful individual in the galaxy over to Wrath."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
