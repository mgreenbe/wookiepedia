This base was built by builder droids and was reinforced daily by deliveries of TIE fighters, AT-ATs, AT-STs, troop carriers, and more stormtroopers. The base was located at a considerable distance from the Jakku Observatory near the Plaintive Hand plateau."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base was known to contain a prefab training facility where stormtroopers underwent ruthless and violent training. The Imperial base also had an underground level which housed a room full of screens which linked up to security cameras. Prior to the Battle of Jakku, Rax gave a broadcast speech urging his Imperial forces to destroy the New Republic.
