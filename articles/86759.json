Margo questioned why they came, and Beckett explained that Dryden Vos was expecting him for a meeting. She promised that he'd be with them after dealing with the Regional Governor, and both turned to see the crime lord use his custom kyuzo petars to kill him, ending the meeting. Margo suspected one of the party guests, Kara Safwan, of being up to something, and discreetly blocked the spy's attempts to get deeper into the Dryden Vos' inner circle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on board the First Light, Margo wore a black shimmersilk gown and a Ottegan charbake smelt necklace.
