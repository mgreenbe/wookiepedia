Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of the Naboo formulated the plan to end the invasion, enlisting the help of the Gungan Grand Army to stage a diversion while the Queen battled to retake the planet's capitol and capture the Trade Federation's Viceroy, Nute Gunray. As the Gungans engaged the Trade Federation Droid Army on the Great Grass Plains, Amidala's strike force infiltrated the capital city of Theed, and also freed the pilots of Bravo Flight to engage the Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palaa in orbit, which controlled the Trade Federation's droid army. The battle came to an end when the young boy Anakin Skywalker destroyed the Control Ship, disabling the Federation's forces, and Amidala captured Viceroy Gunray in Theed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, the intergalactic corporation known as the Trade Federation was forced into the invasion of the planet Naboo by its hidden master, Darth Sidious. Over the course of the engagement, the Federation failed to capture the planet's Queen, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, despite the assistance of the Sith Lord Darth Maul. She fled to Coruscant to plead her case to the Galactic Senate, and the Federation lost support for the blockade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deciding to take action herself, she returned to Naboo and, with the aid of the exiled Gungan Jar Jar Binks, the Queen went to the Gungan Sacred Place to convince Boss Rugor Nass, leader of the Gungans, to align with the Human population of Naboo. The Trade Federation had driven the Gungans to their sacred place after invading their homes and destroying the city Otoh Gunga. Amidala humbled herself before the Gungans (while also revealing herself to have been Padm\u00e9 Naberrie, who had initially been believed to just be a handmaiden, to the others shock), and Nass pledged his support to her, forging a historic pact and ending years of enmity between the Naboo and the Gungans. Once the remainder of the Royal Naboo Security Forces had been summoned to their hiding place, the Queen, head of security Captain Quarsh Panaka, and Nass devised a plan to retake Naboo. This plan replaced the ones the Gungans were making in retribution for the loss of their home. By the time Amidala returned to the planet, only the Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palaa was left in orbit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the planning session, Nass made Binks a Bombad General for the upcoming battle, largely because of the latter's role in uniting the Gungans and Naboo against their common foe (much to the latter's horror). The Gungan Grand Army was to lure out the main bulk of the Federation's Droid Army onto the Great Grass Plains for the head-to-head assault, allowing Amidala and her strike force, along with the two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, to attack capital city of Theed and liberate the main hangar. Naboo pilots would then attack the Droid Control Ship, deactivating the Federation Army, and allowing Amidala to capture Viceroy Nute Gunray, thus re-gaining control of the planet. Amidala specifically chose capturing Gunray as an important objective towards ending Trade Federation control over Naboo due to knowing that the Neimoidian culture, and by extension, the Trade Federation, held the Viceroy as having absolute power, due to the Neimoidians being unable to think for themselves due to operating under a hive mind, and as such could not continue fighting if the Viceroy were indisposed. In advance of their entry, Captain Quarsh Panaka ordered the resistance to secretly infiltrate the hangar and prepare their fighters for battle, as well as program the battle flight-path coordinates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A ready force of Naboo soldiers, supplemented by the two Jedi, Panaka, Amidala, the Handmaiden Sab\u00e9, astromech droid R2-D2, Anakin Skywalker, and Mett Habble; as well as students from the Royal House of Learning who were aboard the Crescent; Dan\u00e9, Galak, Arani Korden, Rorworr, Deel Surool, and Sia-Lan Wezz, used a captured Trade Federation Multi-Troop Transport, Transport 714, to approach Theed without being detected by Trade Federation forces. The group navigated the transport to the entrance of a secret passage at the base of Theed's cliff face. The ready force disembarked, while the students remained behind to guard the transport for use as a rendezvous point in case of retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nass, however, was actually without an organized army. Half an hour after the ready ready force had departed, he took what troops he had and destroyed a Federation monument that had been erected in the city of Spinnaker. In its place, he had a temporary Gungan monument built, which he would use to rally and summon all of the militiagungs that had been in hiding around the town; additionally, militagungs from every Naboo city joined the growing army, leaving only a few to guard the towns. With his army in place, all he needed was the weapons with which to equip his army. During the Naboo Swamp Battle, droid Commander OOM-9 had captured the Gungans' fambaas, which were their beasts of war. Nass attacked the city of Harte Secur, where the fambaas were being held, and rescued them from captivity at Camp Six. With all of the pieces in place, he moved the Grand Army out of the swamps and onto the Great Grass Plains. The Federation, meanwhile, had sent three divisions to engage the Gungans. Army A was the main force and moved to engage the Grand Army head-on while droid commander PDA-2 led the remaining droid army contingent in Theed. Army B's approach was halted thanks to the efforts of the pirate Nym in his Havoc, and likewise, Army C's efforts were halted by Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes of the Royal Security Forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle droid commander PDA-2 assumed control of the Trade Federations rearguard forces that remained to secure Theed. PDA-2 identified Transport 714, and, believing the vessel was damaged overrode the vehicle's controls. PDA-2 directed Transport 714 to the repair bay within Theed Hangar. The unit assigned to guard the transport notified Panaka of the change in their location, and within twenty-five minutes the transport was docked below the hangar. The unit ambushed the forces of ADO-8, a command battle droid guarding the repair bay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the infiltrating forces followed the secret passage through the Catacombs of Theed, before emerging outside of a boathouse near the Solleu River's largest waterfall, Virdugo Plunge, allowing the Queen and company to enter Theed and attempt to capture the Viceroy, Nute Gunray. Captain Panaka issued a synchronized signal over his comlink when the Queen's party began its assault."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of the Great Grass Plains"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gungan Grand Army proceeded to move out of its hiding place in the Swamps; they had licked the wounds of the Naboo Swamp Battle and were ready to take back what was theirs. The Federation's actions during the previous battle reflected little more than a massacre. Many civilians were killed during the evacuation of Otoh Gunga, leaving many militiagungs without a family, and without a home. General Ceel planned on taking position along Shaak Ridge, where the Gungan energy catapults could hold off the Droid Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grand Army had moved into their position by midday, taking up much of the level part of the Great Grass Plains 40 kilometers south of Theed, where Captain Roos Tarpals ordered the activation of their shield generators, set upon the backs of the fambaas. The army was encased in an enormous dome approximately one kilometer wide, impervious to any bombardment. They were still close enough to the swamps to allow a retreat if it came to that. The Grand Army had formed command units, each led by a General. OOM-9's forces, freshly away from Theed, had arrived before Ceel along Shaak Ridge, forcing the Gungans to forgo the tactically superior high ground. Remaining in the valley reduced the effectiveness of the Gungan's catapults. The Droid Army descended from the hills into the valley, in a mile-long formation of Armored Assault Tanks escorting Multi-Troop Transports, with Platoon Attack Craft held in reserve. The Droid division settled into position, facing the massive Grand Army. OOM-9 commenced a preliminary bombardment, firing on the Gungans' shields, with his AATs, to little effect."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a while, OOM-9, atop his enhanced personal tank, ordered the other AATs to hold fire; the order took 0.396 seconds to circulate to the regiment; the Gungans believed the battle to be won. The tanks fell back, and with an order from the Droid Control Ship transmitted via a top-secret frequency, the Federation's MTTs unloaded thousands of battle droids, much to the horror of the Gungans. The B1-Series battle droids slowly marched in units of 56 droids through the Gungan shield and commenced fire on the unprotected militiagungs. The Gungans, led by General Ceel and Bombad General Binks, fought with personal shields, catapults, boomas, and cestas; the Grand Army clobbered dozens of battle droids. The Gungan energy catapults launched large plasma boomas at the droid ranks, but they could not halt the persistent droid march. A squad of P-series destroyer droids rolled onto the bloodied battleground, further increasing Gungan casualties as the MTTs moved in to trap the Grand Army. At some point, a battle droid, having been severed from the waist, flew onto General Binks, eventually getting him off and he started stomping and kicking it, eventually accidentally getting his foot entangled with the severed wiring. This setback eventually came with an advantage where he took down some droids, including one destroyer droid, due to the wiring causing the droid to fire his blaster when he makes movement with the entangled foot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, the shield generator was destroyed by concentrated droid fire, deactivating the protective dome. OOM-9 immediately called upon all AATs, battle droids, Single Trooper Aerial Platforms, to advance. Tank shells now ripped unobstructed into the Gungan lines, tearing up the previously untouched Great Grass Plains. While the Gungan catapults had a large area of effect, they had a slow firing rate, and they were nearly useless when in motion, and Gungan ranks fell to the mechanized Trade Federation Army; the two armies engaged each other at close range among several ruins and mounted laser cannons. Approximately 50 minutes into the battle, Gungan command units broke up under the assault while individual Gungans carried out desperate counterattacks against the droids and tanks. General Ceel shortly ordered a retreat, and the Gungan Grand Army turned back toward the swamps. In the confusion, Binks, running on foot since his kaadu had been lost, jumped onto a cache of boomas carried by falumpaset. The weight of the Gungan opened the door and released the large boomas; one impacted with an AAT, destroying it while others disabled destroyer droids. An explosion then sent the harried Binks flying onto a tank. Tarpals drew up alongside on his kaadu and threw a booma at him to aid Binks, as Binks lacked a booma to take down the tank. However, Binks clumsily deflected it onto the tank's pilot, causing the vehicle to crash. In the end, both Gungan officers were captured by a battle droid squad which included 3B3-888, their army defeated, Binks surrendering easily to Tarpals dismay. General Ceel was also captured. Kaadu units rescued the Gungan wounded while other Gungans stood against the droids to cover the retreat, managing to destroy several more AATs in the process. With the battle turning in their favor, the battle droids set about gathering the captured Gungans into groups while Federation PK droids picked up scattered weapons. OOM-9 had planned on flanking the retreating the Grand Army to prevent escape, but this plan was thwarted by the destruction of the other two Droid Army divisions. By the end of the battle, 543 Gungans lay dead, although over half of the Grand Army escaped back into the swamps."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Assault on Theed"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle through the streets"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After infiltrating the city, the two Jedi were walking along the deserted streets of Theed when they were attacked by an overzealous battle droid on a Single Trooper Aerial Platform.

The two Jedi decided to ride it, and another one they found, through the streets of Theed, destroying numerous battle droids and destroyer droids before diverting onto an aqueduct and blasting through the battle droid defenders. Several gates blocked parts of the aqueduct, forcing the Jedi to destroy the gates. The two Jedi eventually dismounted at the cliffs overlooking the waterfall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They then proceeded to Force Jump down the cliffs until reaching a balcony, then jumped back up the other side.

The Jedi rescued five of the pilots before proceeding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes, freshly returned from the battle near the south ridge, led the diversionary Gian speeders and Flash speeders into Theed across the canal. As Sykes and his wingmate Kol Kotha drove through the Theed streets, they used their Gian speeders' laser cannons to blast the droids in their way. An AAT sat at one end of a street directly facing Sykes' approach, but the Naboo pilot destroyed it as he drove forward, before destroying another one off to the side. Two Ostracoda-class gunboats were patrolling Theed on the river. Sykes destroyed them when he encountered them, along with two more AATs on the sides of the river. As Sykes continued his way through Theed, he received a transmission from Palmer, another Naboo pilot. She was leading Group 2 and her three-member Flash speeder squad had become pinned down in a plaza. Sykes acknowledged her message and went to rescue the group. He blasted through several barriers in his way, along with more droids before emerging into the plaza with Kotha and destroyed the two AATs and the two destroyer droids attacking Palmer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sykes and Group 2 then continued on toward their objective, the Theed Courthouse, where they planned on meeting with Group 3 and several commandos. Along the way they destroyed two more tanks. When Sykes asked for an update, a member of Group 3 reported they were running behind, so Sykes ordered them to catch up. As Sykes and the other pilots destroyed the droids guarding the courthouse, Group 3 caught up to them. Sykes escorted the transport speeder to its objective, an armored gate blocking their way to the Theed Hangar. Sykes blasted the droid defenders while the commandos disembarked, placed charges on the door, and escaped the blast. Sykes then drove through the ruined gate and met up with Panaka. Panaka ordered him to advance slowly under the archway to a certain point, then ordered Sykes to fire on an AAT. He destroyed the tank with his opening shot, and the blast alerted the nearby Federation forces to the presence of the Naboo. His diversion complete, Sykes dismounted from his craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, Kenobi was contacted by Asha, a palace servant and resistance leader. Their pilots were prevented from taking off by a Federation turbolaser cannon south of the hangar, and Kenobi was asked to help destroy the cannon. As Kenobi moved through Theed, he met one of the resistance fighters, who informed the Jedi that the Droid Army was hunting down Resistance members. Kenobi set off through the streets and disabled a force field in his way. He rescued three Naboo hostages from the droids; as he continued his path to the cannon, a he a firefight erupted between the Resistance and battle droids.

The Jedi flanked a repeater cannon, destroyed the droid at the controls, then turned the cannon onto other droids. As he moved to engage other droids, he was ambushed by a squad of OOM security droids and a destroyer droid, which he destroyed by taking another repeater cannon. Kenobi then went up the staircase to where the cannon was placed, facing four more destroyer droids. When the threat was gone, he destroyed the two power conduits on its side, causing the cannon to explode. Kenobi then jumped off the balcony and landed in the pool underneath.

Sab\u00e9 requested the students' assistance in creating a diversion that would allow them to enter the Palace. The team engaged an Armored Assault Tank, a single STAP patrol, and a squad of eight battle droids, managing to distract the Trade Federation forces long enough to allow Sab\u00e9 and her retinue to infiltrate the Palace directly and join up with Amidala.
