Dassyne was initially stationed on Murkhana in 22 BBY when the Clone Wars began; however, he wanted to take part in the war, and requested that he be moved away from Murkhana, an isolated planet. Dassyne was sent to Bomis Koori IV, where he created a stronghold he believed to be impervious. However, in 20 BBY, two Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, succeeded in breaching his fortress, and shut down the ray shields, allowing Republic starships to bombard the bulwark from orbit.

Dassyne enjoyed warfare, and took pleasure in using the Alliance's NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcers to collect payment from customers or to intimidate business rivals. Dassyne was later granted generalship by Passel Argente, Magistrate of the Corporate Alliance, who had been impressed with Dassyne's body of work."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the Clone Wars broke out in 22 BBY, Dassyne was stationed on Murkhana, headquarters of the Corporate Alliance, which had joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, Murkhana was very isolated, and, wishing to be involved in the fighting, Dassyne requested a transfer elsewhere. He was moved to Bomis Koori IV, a colony world controlled by the Alliance that housed many battle droid factories. Dassyne used the war to add to his personal collection, taking valuable literature and artwork from conquered planets. However, Dassyne's demand to be in battle backfired when one of his horns\u2014status symbols in Koorivar culture\u2014was shattered. To cover this, Dassyne wore an enlarged miter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All the while, Dassyne built up his arsenal on Bomis Koori IV, creating a fort he believed to be impenetrable. Whereas in the past he had relied on clever strategy, Dassyne now depended solely on numbers and spent all his efforts on fortifying his stronghold with more weaponry. In 20 BBY, the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic did battle on Bomis Koori IV. Dassyne was confident in his defenses, stating that the Republic would need at least one hundred Jedi to conquer the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Republic was not so sure that Bomis Koori IV's defenses were impenetrable, and sent two Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, along with a company of clone troopers, to take control of the planet.

He requested a transfer from Murkhana\u2014which was located in the Outer Rim Territories, far from the war\u2014to a place where he could be more active in the fighting. However, he was overconfident, believing that he was invincible, and he lost his horn in a battle as a result of fighting in the vanguard. While Dassyne initially relied on strategy rather than brute force, he later changed his style once he was stationed on Bomis Koori IV, and began to depend solely on firepower rather than tactics. He also felt that his stronghold on Bomis Koori IV could not be conquered by less than one hundred Jedi. However, he was proven wrong when a mere two Jedi forced their way into the bulwark and deactivated the shields. Dassyne paid for his overconfidence with his life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Created for Star Wars: Clone Wars, Oro Dassyne was voiced by Terrence Carson and credited as Alien General.
