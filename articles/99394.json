The competitors of the Ochotl-based firm, however, had influence with the courts of the Galactic Republic, and an investigation was launched into a possible infestation of Ochotl by the creatures known as Corris-weevils. Although no evidence for the infestation was discovered, Ochotl was placed on a three-year probationary list, and Ochotl Ag lost its entire chak-root crop, with the market for its goods effectively having been destroyed. Furthermore, while the Corporate Alliance was attempting to have Ochotl's case arbitrated, pirates based at Nocto, in the Nocto system, destroyed the depots in orbit around Ochotl. The Republic Outland Regions Security Force, which was also indirectly linked to Ochotl Ag's competitors, only made half-hearted attempts to respond to the attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, of which the Corporate Alliance was a member, broke out.
