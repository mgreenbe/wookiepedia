During the time of the Galactic Civil War, she was responsible for stealing the plans for a secret Imperial project called Project Dead Eye. Evading capture, Lyda was eventually rescued by a Rebel operative, allowing plans for the Dead Eye prototype to fall firmly into the hands of the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Human female by the name of Lyda Skims was born around 23 BBY to Lynn and Doyle Skims, and she had a brother, Athon. She lived on the Core World of Corellia, where she worked at her mother's textile facility. Her work there gave Lyda a broad knowledge of clothing design as well as engineering and droid repair. Lyda cultivated other interests during this time, including arts and modern dance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both Lyda's father and brother served on the side of the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the course of the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire. Athon, who worked as a GR-75 medium transport pilot, was killed during a delivery to Alliance contacts on Alderaan at the time of its destruction by the first Death Star in 0 BBY. Lyda's father suffered a similar fate in the subsequent Battle of Yavin, where he was killed while piloting a Y-wing starfighter during the assault on the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the devastating losses of both her brother and her father, Lyda made the decision to join the Alliance in order to continue her family's tradition of service. Though she lacked significant combat skills, she served as a spy, code named \"Skimmer,\" on undercover missions for the Alliance, including the investigation of Imperial Project Dead Eye in about 1 ABY. On that mission, Lyda recovered secret plans related to the project, and promptly went into hiding for a period of several weeks. Datadiscs outlining the initial report of her findings were intercepted by the Alliance, but were misappropriated by several underworld organizations, including the Meatlumps and various swoopers. Agents in the field had some luck recovering the disks, but many remained missing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel leader Princess Leia Organa, eager for more information on the project, wished to find Lyda before the Empire discovered her whereabouts. Still in hiding, though committed to her mission, Lyda attempted delivery of a datadisc at a designated drop zone. She was hampered, however, by a previously unknown Imperial patrol in the drop area. Rather than abort the mission, she attempted surveillance of the Imperial facility in the area by climbing a fence to get better footage of their operations. However, Imperial agents caught her and charged her with trespassing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Imperial transport was dispatched to deliver her for processing. However, when the transport experienced a mechanical failure, she used that opportunity to make her escape into the wilderness. Despite the botched surveillance attempt, data acquired from the operation proved to be of the highest quality, and Lyda managed to remain in hiding until she encountered an operative sent by the Alliance to find her and retrieve her datadisc. After locating her, Lyda was subsequently extracted by a larger rescue team and returned to safety. The perilous mission evidently did not phase Lyda very much. Shortly after her rescue, Lyda already began requesting more assignments, much to the chagrin of her friend, who bemoaned her headstrong and risk-averse demeanor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
