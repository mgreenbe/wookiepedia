By the time the Alliance and the Nagai had joined forces, however, it no longer belonged to either the Nagai or the natives\u2014in the hands of the Tof, it became the personal base of operations for their Supreme Commander, Prince Sereno. When the New Republic (recently formed by the Alliance) learned of Sereno's presence on Saijo, they sent an insertion team of Bey, Kyle Katarn, Jan Ors, Dash Rendar, and Guri to investigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once their intelligence was recovered, a strike team, consisting of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, Dani, Fenn Shysa, Maggie, Trif, Knife, Den Siva, and several other commandos\u2014including at least one Imperial Stormtrooper\u2014was assembled. Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, Wedge Antilles and Nien Nunb were also part of the mission, placed in command of the fighter squadrons launched from the Star Destroyer Emancipator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The strike team picked their way through the wreckage of one of Saijo's wrecked cities, working their way towards the planet's main trade center\u2014now employed by the Tof as a headquarters. Inside waited not only Prince Sereno, but also Dark Lady Lumiya, who had defected to the Tof cause following the Battle of Zeltros. Knife and Den allowed themselves to be captured by a Tof patrol, and were brought before the Prince. Leia and Dani donned exquisite ball gowns, disguises which allowed them to infiltrate the throne room, and Luke and Han were able to sneak in regardless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knife and Den launched their attack, and were soon joined by Leia, Dani, Han and Luke. Sereno's Tof guards were easily dispatched, but Lumiya proved harder to deal with. She incapacitated Knife with a stun blast, before holding Leia at gunpoint."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Sereno ordered immediate air support to neutralize the attackers. As the Merriweather launched a flight of Tof starfighters, Lando's squadron pounced, eliminating the Tof fighters before they could make it planetside. Defenseless, the Merriweather surrendered to the Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Luke was able to capture Sereno, no one could reach Lumiya in time to stop her from shooting Leia. Just as she was about to pull the trigger, though, one of the Tof unexpectedly blasted Lumiya."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With his forces defeated and Lumiya left for dead, Sereno reluctantly ordered a full Tof surrender. The Tof traitor then removed his disguise and revealed himself as Bey, who had been the Alliance's most trusted agent amongst the Tof. And so it was that, with the full, unconditional surrender of the Tof, the Alliance were given their first shot at forging a lasting peace from the remains of war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After this battle and the conclusion of the war at Saijo, the New Republic was now free to focus on its main liberation campaign against the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
