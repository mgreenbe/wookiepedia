During battle on an unknown planet between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, she was assigned to a battlefront under the leadership of Councilor Ki-Adi-Mundi. Joined by recently knighted Rivi-Anu and Eon, the group fought valiantly to repel the Separatist Droid Army. When a Victory-class Star Destroyer plummeted toward the battlefield, they all believed they would die, until Rivi-Anu held back the warship with an astounding display of the Force. Rivi-Anu waited until all Jedi and clones had fled the field, including this Twi'lek Jedi, and then allowed the ship to crash down upon herself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
