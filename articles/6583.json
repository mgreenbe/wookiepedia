He possessed a great sense of justice, an extraordinary knack for mechanics, and surprising acumen for someone so young. All of this was mainly due to his great affinity with the Force. Only one encounter with Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn was enough for the Master to think that Anakin might be the Chosen One to bring balance to the Force. Young Skywalker would fulfill his dream of becoming a Jedi and this would mark a turning point in the course of galactic history that no one could have foreseen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
