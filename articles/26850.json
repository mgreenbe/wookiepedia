When Tarkin approached them, Ciena apologized for getting Thane into trouble.

During the exercise, Ciena and Thane's speeder bikes became conjoined. With much difficulty, the two cadets managed to win the race and land their bikes back safely at the landing pad. Since this was the first time that the exercise had produced two winners, the flight commander awarded split the prize and awarded them 25 points.

With his specialists unable to ascertain which layer of data was the falsified one, he decided to punish them both by failing their laser cannon assignment and downgrading their course rankings.

Jude found some evidence pointing to the involvement of the Office of Student Outcomes, a department of the Royal Academy tasked with challenging students. When Thane proposed confronting the Student Outcome people, Ciena argued against it since it would jeopardize their relationship with the Academy.

However, Kyrell managed to disable the ship's computer systems. With time running out, Ree decided to crash the Star Destroyer into Jakku's surface in an effort to deny the ship to the Rebellion. After bidding farewell to Nash, she also decided to remain on the ship, seeing the perfect opportunity to escape the grip of the Empire she loathed while keeping her honor. However, Kyrell recognized Ree's voice on the intercom and fought his way to the bridge. Thane was able to figure out the password Ree had used to seal the door, \"Look through my eyes,\" leading to a confrontation between the two lovers. Ree refused to abandon ship but Kyrell would not leave her, resulting in a fistfight between the two. Kyrell managed to stun her and carried her to an escape pod, rescuing her from the doomed ship."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Capture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon landing on Jakku, the two were picked up by New Republic soldiers, who promptly arrested the unconscious Ciena as a prisoner of war. Following her capture, Ree descended into a state of depression because she had been denied the opportunity to kill herself and leave the Empire. Despite fearing that she would be tortured by the Republic, she was relieved that they provided her with medical treatment and information on her legal rights. While recognizing the fairness of the New Republic, she still refused to recognize the new government's legitimacy. After a week of refusal, she finally allowed Thane to see her. Ciena believed that the New Republic would put her on trial as with every other Imperial war criminal, but Thane assured her that even if she didn't give any intelligence in exchange for leniency, the New Republic wouldn't have time to prosecute every Imperial, and that she might have a place in the New Republic. Either way, he promised to wait for her so they could be together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ree was believed dead by her remaining comrades in the Galactic Empire and became a symbol as an upstanding Imperial officer who refused to give in to defeatist attitudes plaguing the Imperial forces following the Empire's defeat at the Battle of Endor.

For instance, she believed in honor above all and that making an oath was forever and entirely binding. That was why she never left Imperial service despite disagreeing with their actions. Her honor also bounded her to Thane, with whom she fell in love. Ciena fought within herself to honor these oaths, but it became too much for her to handle in her last few months of service, and she attempted suicide because of this. Due to her upbringing, Ciena also still believed in the Force, something that Second Wavers such as Thane rejected."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In large part due to a combination of Imperial propaganda and her belief in not breaking vows, Ciena was largely convinced that the Rebels were aimless terrorists and blamed them for the death of her friend Jude Edivon. Despite her patriotism, Ciena still loved Thane despite knowing that he had joined the Rebel Alliance. She could not bring herself to kill him and hoped to avoid having to meet him in combat. While her faith in the Empire was shaken by atrocities like the destruction of Alderaan and the wrongful conviction of her mother, Verine Ree, Ciena believed that she had little choice but to continue serving the Empire. Due to her strong moral compass, Ree was unwilling to let innocents and weak die. On one occasion, she rescued civilians on Ivarujar despite receiving no orders to do so. Later, she ignored Imperial military protocol during the Battle of Endor by covering retreating fellow TIE fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among her peers and colleagues, Ree was known as a diligent officer who volunteered for extra shifts and helped train newer officers about Star Destroyer protocols. Due to her leadership skills and selfless service, Ciena rose though the ranks of the Imperial Navy. Eventually, she was made captain of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Inflictor during the pivotal Battle of Jakku. Despite no longer believing in the Empire, Ciena believed that she was still responsible for the lives of her crew and soldiers. In addition, she did not want to endanger her mother, who was still serving an Imperial prison sentence. When New Republic forces tried to hijack the Inflictor, she was prepared to lay down her life in order to destroy the ship in an effort to deny it to the enemy. By dying, Ree believed that she would finally be free from her vow.
