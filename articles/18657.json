The crew not responding the calls, Fett assumed them dead. Hoping for a valuable salvage, Boba boarded the freighter. Suspicious of the dangers awaiting, he took one of his prisoners, Tsumo, with him. There was another prisoner in the hold of the Slave I named Chung. The entire crew of the freighter was dead. They found Volpau, third cousin of Emperor Palpatine, in a death casket with a royal amulet in it, and the dead crew with boils all over them. Ubuugan fleshborers came out of their bodies and attacked Fett and Tsumo. Tsumo was infected and died from the fleshborers. Because of Fett's Mandalorian armor, the fleshborers didn't make it through. The fleshborers had eaten through the airlock and boarded Slave I. Boba torched the fleshborers but the flames were heating the power cells. He then escaped through the waste chute. The Mingula exploded and Slave I intercepted Fett. Thinking that the fleshborers are still on the ship and that Chung is dead, Boba rushed to the prisoner hold. There, Chung is eating the dead fleshborers as a snack - originating from Ubuuga, his species had developed resistance to the fleshborers. Fett has lost Tsumo, but gained a royal amulet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
