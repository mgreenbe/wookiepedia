Lock arrived at the Kalida Nebula in the star destroyer Demolisher. He took the clone trooper shinies CT-8863, CT-4012 and CT-5177 down to the Malevolence crash site with a Nu-class attack shuttle. During the mission, Lock, feeling it inconvenient for the three troopers to call each other by their number, assigned them with nicknames based on one of their skills. CT-4012 received the nickname \"Sharp\" for spotting the insignia of the Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps in the wreckage. CT-8863 received \"Breaker\" which was short for \"circuit breaker\" after he had discovered a circuit board with an exotic design. As Captain Lock turned to give CT-5177 his nickname, a B1-Series battle droid rose from the wreckage and starting shooting at the clones. CT-5177 was hit and collapsed while the other clones returned fire. The droid was easily destroyed, but CT-5177 was badly injured. Lock deemed the mission over and they hurried with their wounded comrade to the shuttle and up to the star destroyer for medical aid. Lock demanded that his brother would live, and would not reveal his new nickname unless he did survive."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Kynachi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were soon assigned to a new mission to the planet Kynachi where the exotic circuit board had been manufactured. Lock and his troopers along with a recovered CT-5177 assembled in the Jedi Temple's landing bay. He then revealed that the clone's nickname was Chatterbox, which was an irony on the clone's silent nature. For the mission he was put under the command of Jedi General Ring-Sol Ambase and received 11 clones plus two pilots. They were to travel to Kynachi in secret and was to use an unmarked freighter. Unbeknownst to Lock however was that the shuttle had been sabotaged. As soon as they had exited hyperspace the freighter was attacked by Separatist forces. Lock was in the cockpit of the freighter as the attack started and yelled that droid fighters were incoming. His voice vanished as an explosion rocked the ship. The troopers attempted to abandon ship as more explosions occurred, but the launch systems for the escape pods had been tampered with. As such they had to be launched manually from the freighter. As the first pod was launched, Breaker, Knuckles, Chatterbox and Nuru Kungurama jumped into the second one, but realized someone had to stay behind. Lock had then managed to limp his injured body to the pods. Breaker told the captain to get into the pod while he remained to launch it. After understanding the situation he pushed Breaker into the pod and launched it, with his final words that until he was dead, he was the one to give order. As the escape pod soared towards the planet, the freighter exploded, incinerating Lock and everything aboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lock showed both concern and a wanting for his fellow clones to become more like individuals as he personally wanted to come up with nicknames for the clones.
