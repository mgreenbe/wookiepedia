It served as the command ship of Jedi General Jaro Tapal and his 13th Battalion of clone troopers, who led a campaign to defend the Bracca system from the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Shortly after the end of the campaign, Order 66 was executed, forcing Tapal and his Padawan Cal Kestis to escape from their clone troopers. Tapal sabotaged the reactor of the Albedo Brave to conceal their escape, but was fatally wounded before he could board an escape pod. Kestis managed to escape the Albedo Brave before its destruction, landing on Bracca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Albedo Brave first appeared in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, developed by Respawn Entertainment.
