She left her homeworld of Dathomir when she was young. Consequently, she survived the slaughter of her sisters by General Grievous during the Clone Wars. By the time of the Iron Blockade, Shelish lived in a hut, on the swamps of Jhas Krill, the eleventh moon of Jhas, in the Anoat sector. She was accompanied by a Wookiee named Owacchi, a former pirate who had been betrayed by his associates. She was also the mother of Deathstick, leader of the secret society of assassins known as the Kouhun. At several points however, Shelish did go back to Dathomir, searching for clues about the fate of her sisters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shelish first appeared in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, by Kabam, in which she was voiced by Kari Washington. She was designed by Kate Burgess and modelled by Jay Doherty. Burgess liked working on Shelish, because she saw it as a rare opportunity to design an older female in a game and a character who \"falls outside the traditional mold of heroes/villains [sic].\" The witch's distinctive hairstyle was inspired by fiddlehead greens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
