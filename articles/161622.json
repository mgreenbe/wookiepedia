This mix became supercharged by two electromagnetic exciter disks on either end of the weapon's core. Once released into space, these disks would infuse the core with energized impulses to excite the blended explosives. The Void-7's explosion was characterized by a powerful implosion followed by a planar expanding energy wave of massive power, enough to decimate large asteroids, like in the rings surrounding Geonosis. Only the shields on a capital ship could protect against a Void-7 shock wave. The resulting explosion also temporarily canceled out sound before the shockwave released a loud humming sound. The explosive mix within a Void-7 could be altered to produce a shock wave that caused less collateral damage than the baradium-collapsium mix."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jango Fett installed a Void-7 launcher aboard his starship, Slave I, prior to the First Battle of Geonosis. The seismic charges were held in place by magnetic clamps, and released through an airlock situated between the vessel's engines. He deployed a number of seismic charges against Obi-Wan Kenobi's Delta-7 interceptor over Geonosis, knowing the Void-7's erratic trajectory would be difficult to evade even for a Jedi. However, Kenobi was able to avoid two seismic charges, and both he and Fett ultimately survived their dogfight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some Delta-7 starfighters were also fitted with seismic charge launchers during the last decades of the Galactic Republic.
