Suba was present nearby, standing at Piett's side aboard the bridge, when Vader proceeded to order his admiral to deploy the fleet and calculate every possible escape trajectory the Millennium Falcon may have taken, before issuing a clear warning to Piett that further failure would not be tolerated.
