It was located in the Transitory Mists region of the Hapes Cluster and was surrounded by gravity wells, planetary debris, and other navigational perils. It had also once contained an unstable triple-world gas giant cluster which eventually became a field of icy monoliths. Due to the high number of hazards, any approach into or departure out of the system required lengthy travel through realspace. It was in this system that the Jedi Coalition established a secret base during their fight against the Galactic Alliance led by the Sith Lord Darth Caedus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
