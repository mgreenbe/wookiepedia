Around 9 ABY, a Mythrol was a customer in the bar when he was threatened by two humans (an alpha and beta) and a Quarren. A bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian arrived to collect a bounty on the Mythrol, and, despite the attempted intervention of the bartender, a fight ensued between the Mandalorian and the three companions threatening the Mythrol. The Mandalorian won the fight, incapacitating the two humans and bisecting the Quarren by forcing the bar's front entrance to close over his body."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
