They had the same general statistics as a standard Cloud Car, but were equipped with only repair lasers instead of the Cloud Car's more powerful weaponry. Some of these were used by a group of Rebels when they were chasing Gamusha and his swoop gang the Gutterwipes in order to rescue Plum Tantrellius whom they had kidnapped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
