The mercenaries were pinned down by the Imperials but managed to set a defensive perimeter of Ubrikkian R-TechApp Man Trap. A miniaturized reversed repulsorlift field, the man traps were designed to immobilize quarry for capture, but the Riflemen used them to capture grenades, causing them to explode prematurely.
