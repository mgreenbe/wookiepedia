She and their father were political dissidents who spoke out against the Empire's atrocities at Ghorman and Alderaan and were sentenced to hard labor in the Spice Mines of Kessel in 1 ABY. A year later, she and Kyp's father were caught up in a prison result and executed by Moruth Doole's smugglers who overtook the mines.

The elder son, Zeth Durron, was born in 13 BBY and her younger son Kyp was born six years later in 7 BBY. Along with their father, the family lived in a peaceful raft settlement on Deyer surrounded by terraformed lakes, where both parents served as outspoken local politicians. Although ultimately accepting of the Empire, hearing of the atrocities committed by Emperor Palpatine/Legends forces and the growing rebellion against them drove her and Kyp's father to become political dissidents. They marked the anniversary of the Ghorman Massacre and loudly protested the destruction of Alderaan, believing that by speaking out they could moderate the Emperor's more extreme policies from within. They were among the colonists who unanimously voted to condemn the planet's destruction and request that Palpatine rescind his New Order and thought their votes could influence their Emperor's decisions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She underestimated the deadly reality of the Empire and in 1 ABY stormtroopers came to their home on Deyer and seized the family. In the altercation, the stormtroopers melted down unlocked the door of their family dwelling and laid waste to the home, knocking over the fiber-grown furniture and stunning both parents. The stormtrooper captain read their arrest order, which accused them of treason and restrained the parents and their son Zeth with stun-cuffs. Zeth was brought to the Imperial Military training center on Carida and his mother, father and brother were brought to the Correctional Facility on Kessel and sentenced to hard labor in the Spice Mines of Kessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 2 ABY, about a year into her sentence at the Spice Mines of Kessel, the Imperial powers there underwent an unpheaval.

In the midst of the commotion, both Kyp's mother and father were executed for being on the wrong side at the wrong moment, and their young son managed to survive by hiding and laying low until he was rescued by Han Solo years later."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The loss of his parents and the suffering he and his family endured on Kessel fueled a deep sense of rage and pain in Kyp Durron, against both the Empire that originally imprisoned them and the smugglers who perpetuated their suffering and executed his mother and father. He felt the Empire ruined his life when they punished his parents and him for their political resistance. Durron's rage over his past was exploited by the Sith Lord Exar Kun, who used it to draw him over to the dark side. This reached a boiling point when, overcome by the dark side, he used the Sun Crusher to destroy the Carida system and the Academy of Carida in an act of revenge against the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though repentant for his genocide of the Caridan solar system, Kyp Durron never forgot the execution of his mother and father at the hands of the smugglers who overthrew Imperial rule on Kessel. Partly due to the memories of their deaths, he formed the starfighter squadron \"Dozen-and-Two-Avengers\" with his Jedi apprentice Miko Reglia and dedicated himself to ridding the Outer Rim Territories of smugglers and pirates. When Han Solo first heard of the Dozen-and-Two's exploits, his knowledge of his old friend's parents' deaths due to smugglers immediately led Solo to worry about Durron's activities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although she was loyal to the Empire and believed its worst offenses could be fixed from within, Kyp Durron's mother was an outspoken individual.
