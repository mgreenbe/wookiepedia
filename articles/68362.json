During his scheme, Brandl became fascinated by Winger's adopted daughter, Alexandra, and ultimately relented on his plan after prompting the young woman to fall to the dark side of the Force, albeit temporarily.

By the time they got home, Brandl's mother was in tears, confirming for him that the figure had been none other than his father, Adalric. The man's return, however, prompted consternation from the residents of Kovit\u2014Brandl overheard one individual, Menges, preparing to use his starship to drive the outsiders away.

At first Adalric queried Brandl as to who he was\u2014the young boy angrily identified himself as the man's son, before becoming fixated on Adalric's lightsaber. Brandl was hesitant to touch it before being encouraged by his father, but the young boy quickly moved onto the intent of his visit\u2014to warn Adalric and Ross.

Adalric briefly educated his son in the Jedi arts, particularly meditation and the use of a lightsaber.

Jaalib Brandl still had his heart set on being an actor, and so he studied under Adalric, putting the lightsaber skills he had learned to good use in any stage fighting required. His father's temperament and predilection to the dark side of the Force had been prevalent when he first returned, but the process of being sole guardian of the young Brandl gradually eased his temperament over the five year period. In due course, Brandl began his acting career offworld on Iscera, but kept his home in Kovit with Adalric.

In the third act, Brandl's character became a domineering autocrat, determined to destroy all who opposed him. After the final performance before Iscera's winter, Brandl was approached outside the theater by one smitten audience member\u2014a young woman named Fable Astin.

Adalric's performance in the same role was among those that Brandl had idolized as a youth, and in attempting to play the part he struggled to reach the same level as his father. Adalric reassured Brandl, however, that the role was the most difficult ever conceived, and whoever could master it was assured of greatness as a thespian. In the forthcoming production, Adalric would take the role of the titular Uhl Eharl Khoehng, a trickster king who deceives the Edijan-Prince into swearing fealty after having effectively tricked the prince into sending all of his people to their doom. As he rehearsed in the Kovit theater with his father, the pair were interrupted by the arrival of Astin, who had tracked Brandl. In a panic, the young man approached the woman and demanded to know what she was doing in Kovit\u2014despite Adalric's curiosity and protestations that his son mind his manners, Brandl did everything he could to get Astin to leave immediately. Adalric took further interest however, sensing the Force in the girl and noticing that she had been injured in a recent fight.

Eight hours later, Astin returned to the theater, sopping from the rain and the lengthy, arduous exercise, having found Adalric's tasks to be impossible.

Brandl comforted the woman yet again, and sent her away from a bath, while Adalric confided in his son that he found the girl impossible to teach. Amused by the similarities in master and pupil's opinions on one another, Brandl took the opportunity to begin an impromptu rehearsal of Uhl Eharl Khoehng with his father, demonstrating the work he had put into the performance since that had last practiced. Afterwards, Adalric departed on a trip that would take several days. Brandl went to Astin's room and consulted with her.

Her father, a Jedi pupil of her mother, had been slain when she was very young, and so the duty of raising her and training her in the Jedi arts had fallen to her mother. As the town was bereft of transportation after the Imperial attack, Brandl and Astin were forced to hike to their destination, Khoehng Heights. There, after they completed their meal, the young man showed Astin the outdoor theater, flirting with her and regaling her with the tale of Uhl Eharl Khoehng, for which the location was named. Noticing a set of candles, Astin requested that Brandl impart some of his lightsaber skill to her, and run the young woman through an emulation of Adalric's exercises.

Informing her of his father's plans to take her to Byss, he urged her to leave the theater and follow him to Khoehng Heights. As Astin and Holman were reunited, he urged the pair to depart without him. Drawing a parallel between his own life and that of his current role, the tragic Edijan-Prince, Brandl explained that he would have to stay to prevent his father's pursuit. Astin bade him a tearful farewell as the Prodigal departed, leaving Brandl to confront Adalric, who had just arrived at Khoehng Heights himself. Lambasting his child's arrogance, Adalric began choking Brandl through the Force, before abruptly releasing him.

The play was another tale of kings, power struggles, betrayal and corruption, and Brandl, playing the part of \"Dontavian,\" held thrall over the audience with the power of the dark side of the Force. When the performance had concluded Brandl was alerted by Werth of the Wingers' presence, as they sought to congratulate him for his work on the stage.

Having been adopted by Governor Winger, she ultimately came to work with the local resistance and had a particular affection for Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, now of the New Republic. Intrigued by the young girl, Brandl decided to alter his plan, and only have Governor Winger fall prey to his plot. While getting into Alexandra's landspeeder, Brandl noticed a nearby tavern, Chado's Pub, enjoying a large amount of activity from both Imperials and civilians. One individual, Dair Haslip, was waving at Alexandra, piquing the Dark Jedi's curiosity. The young woman explained that he was a family friend, before the pair departed in the speeder.

To Alexandra's astonishment, Brandl was able to control and subdue one of the predators, which allowed itself to have the young woman approach. At that moment, Lieutenant Werth contacted the Dark Jedi, alerting him to the bombing at Chado's Pub. Brandl and Alexandra raced back to the city, where Werth reported that Winger had been nowhere near the blast, but the governor was nonetheless sufficiently shaken by the experience.

Conferring with Winger, the Dark Jedi did not hesitate to blame the attack on the Garosian resistance movement. Claiming that he was surprised by the boldness of the move, and given the proximity to Imperial Headquarters, Brandl ordered that Winger and Alexandra be moved to a safehouse outside the city in the intervening hours until their evacuation transport was prepared.
