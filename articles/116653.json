One Rodian, Drexl Roosh, had set up an impressive salvage operation on the junk-covered planet by using his minions to produce scrap and other goods that could be sold off-world. His scavengers would pick apart any junk found on the planet, looking for the valuable hunks of metal or intact mechanical parts. Drexl had little regard for the lives of his gang members and even less for the lives of those who attempted to interfere with his operations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Salvage Cartel established its primary base of salvage operations on Raxus Prime, they came under assault from Jedi Master Kazdan Paratus's droid legion of Scrap Guardians, junk behemoths, and Scrap Scavengers. After initially suffering from heavy casualties, the gang managed to reorganize themselves and deploy their Heavy Defenders and Rodian Rippers against the droid army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Galen Marek landed on the planet Heavy Defenders and Rodian Rippers were deployed on skiffs to stop him. Marek killed them along with the scavengers inside the wrecked hyperdrive core. Scavengers were also skirmishing with Paratus' droid army near a crashed blockade runner, until Marek intervened and defeated both factions. Marek then advanced to the scavenger's camp, whereupon he destroyed its shield generator and fought his way past them into the junk chasm, into the territory of his target Kazdan Paratus, whom he killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Paratus' death allowed the scavengers a short-lived respite, but the Imperials were not long in descending onto the planet to claim it for the Empire. The Imperials and the scavengers skirmished over the planet until Galen Marek arrived again and defeated both parties, dissolving the cartel and killing Roosh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Variants"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
