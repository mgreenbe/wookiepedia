The unit was owned by a deep-cover Alliance operative at one time. When the agent was assassinated by the minions of Laboi crime lord Qa'till, Qa'till took the droid and placed it in his labor pool on Hypotria. Toozy remained loyal to the Alliance, stealing information from starships that landed on the planet and relaying important data back to the Alliance. The droid tipped off Koedi Raef to the Empire's movements near Vilosoria. As a result Raef was awarded the Rohal Cross for successful liberation of the planet, but the starfighter pilot refused it and gave it to Toozy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
