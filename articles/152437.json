Once there, the assassin hunted Satine, first attempting to kill her by sabotaging her speeder. He eventually framed her for the murder of an informant, Davu Golec, who the assassin had shot with a sniper rifle. The assassin fought Satine's friend, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, during another attempt to kill her, and was defeated by him.
