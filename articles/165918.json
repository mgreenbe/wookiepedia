At some point prior to the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY,  the cyborg bounty hunter Beilert Valance broke the Bounty Hunter Code and stole five bounties from Xonr, leading to the latter tracking Valance down in the crowded BG-RT's Tavern and Spirits cantina, within Level 1313 on the planet Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finding Valance drunk and slouched over a table, Xonr condemned him for stealing bounties and breaking the Code. Xonr then sat down across from Valance and aimed a blaster pistol at him, declaring that it was time for him to die. As a final insult to Valance, Xonr took his beverage and downed it when Valance asked for one last drink. At that moment, Valance revealed that he had allowed Xonr to find him, having also lured several other hunters to the same cantina. While initially alarmed by this revelation, Xonr remained confident about surviving the encounter, but Valance quickly killed his confronter by blowing Xonr's head off with his palm blaster, which started a shootout that left all of Valance's other nemeses dead as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite considering other bounty hunters to be scum, Xonr respected the Bounty Hunter Code and denounced Beilert Valance for choosing to break the Code by stealing bounties.
