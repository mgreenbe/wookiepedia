A pompous and conceited monarch, he was also a collector and trader of exotic and dangerous creatures, which he kept in his own expansive zoo. He had a longstanding rivalry with another royal, Regent Solculvis of the Mol'leaj system, who maintained a similar facility. At the time of the conflict between the First Order and the Resistance, Prana hired the smuggler Han Solo to collect three rathtars, dangerous tentacled predators, for his personal zoo in an effort to outdo Solculvis. When Solo failed to deliver the rathtars, however, Prana was left unhappy and word spread as far as Takodana."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
