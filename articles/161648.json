The captain landed their XS stock light freighter in a hangar in the contested settlement of Drelliad village on the island of Avilatan. They were met by a human man named Skavak. He suggested that the smuggler leave, but before they could, another Rendia employee by the name of Corso Riggs entered the hangar and informed the two that the separatists had activated three anti-aircraft guns that could shoot down the smuggler's starship.

The smuggler, realizing Rogun would be gunning for them, agreed to help Viidu catch Skavak if they could have their ship back. He told the smuggler to meet a man named Reki in Talloran village, who was an expert on the separatists. Viidu said that Reki was behind enemy lines in a village, blockaded by Republic troops.

With Pollaran's assistance, the smuggler found out about Kixi, a Mirialan slicer forced to work for the Migrant Merchants' Guild. After fighting through the Guild's territory and freeing her, she informed the smuggler that Skavak had already left, and that she was forced to clean his record. She gladly restored his record, however, even adding false information such as being a carrier of the Bothan Nether Rot disease."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pollaran soon came through for the smuggler again, revealing that Skavak was spotted in Black Sun territory. After piecing together the different parts of the holorecord of his meeting there, it was discovered that a lawman was pursuing him, and he needed someone to kill him. The Black Sun bounty hunter Urbax went to the hanger at the spaceport to wait for him there, but was followed by the smuggler. In the ensuring firefight, Urbax was killed, and the Sullustan constable Miel Muwn was safe. Miel and the smuggler teamed up to find Skavak, following the leads to the Justicar sector.

She and the smuggler came to an agreement: Ace would help her with her contract and she'd help them find the radiation vault containing astrogation charts needed for their treasure hunt. During Ace's business, the Republic Customs Office agent Soganti was investigating Thorne, suspecting her of smuggling Tarisian relics. Thorne tasked the smuggler with sending supplies to a Doctor Vernan in the eastern part of the resettlement zone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thorne sent them deeper in the ruins, this time to recover some planetary core samples from a core-drilling engineer named Ovold. However, the samples were stolen by scavengers along with important equipment, and so he had to direct Ace in the direction of the pirate base instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Ace arrived in the pirate base, it was revealed that the thief was Tyrodall, Thorne's previous assistant who faked his death. He offered the smuggler some Tarisian relics, which were smuggled off planet by Thorne disguised as core samples. However, Tyrodall and Thorne had different views on who to sell them to. Thorne would rather sell them to Tarisian descendants at a lower price, while Tyrodall would've rather sell them on the Imperial black market at a higher price. Ace refused the Devaronian's offer, resulting in a shootout that killed Tyrodall and his droid bodyguards. Ace then returned the contraband back to Thorne and confronted her for her underhanded operation, in which she admitted that she was returning the relics to the descendants of former Tarisian residents for a much smaller fee. With her contract with the Republic fulfilled, Thorne upheld her end of the deal by having a technician who had access to the Republic sensor array, locating the vault in Zone Zero, a designated no man's land said to harbour monsters worse than rakghouls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Thorne's advice to ask Risha for a method to reach the vault, Ace then returned to their ship, where Risha informed them that Skavak had hired a team of mercenaries to search for the vault. After being provided with a Geonosian slicer module to open the vault, Ace disembarked, only to be confronted Soganti, who had his suspicions on how Thorne was smuggling contraband but lacked proof, and attempted to offer a generous bribe in exchange for testimony, but Ace refused to betray Thorne, forcing the defeated customs agent to leave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ace then traveled to Transport Station 5 and fought through hordes of rakghouls until they reached Zone Zero and found Skavak's mercenaries just outside the vault door. The mercenary leader, Roksur, startled by Ace's appearance, called Skavak on the holocomm, who subsequently ordered the mercenaries to kill Ace. Ace fought back and killed the mercenaries before cracking the vault and retrieving the charts. Ace then returned to the ship, where Risha explained that the charts once belonged to a Tarisian Exchange gangster named Davik Kang, who mapped a series of uncharted hyperlanes in the stretch of galaxy between the Core Worlds and the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Nar Shaddaa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next stop on the smuggler's itinerary was Nar Shaddaa, the Smuggler's Moon. The delivery made was the male Shanjaru that was held in the cargo hold in exchange for a prototype starship engine. Unfortunately, their client, Drooga the Hutt, was victim of a theft. A group of eco-terrorists had stolen his female Shanjaru, and he was no longer interested in the male the smuggler had."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fortunately, Drooga's servant Ga'ram was able to assist the smuggler, giving the coordinates of the eco-terrorist base, where they met with Tyrka, one of Momi Andrell's friends.

Before leaving, Drooga ordered for Bowdaar to approach. Poisoned, he was to fight a ferocious, starved gundark. Fortunately, Ace entered the fight and helped kill it. Drooga decided that the Wookiee was no longer worth the costs, and let him free.

Raed claimed her ship was damaged and drifting towards a sun, and the smuggler traveled to assist her. However, it was a ruse.

Protected by a ray shield, she ordered assassin droids to kill the capitan, although they easily overcame them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When her ray shield dispersed, Skavak cut the transmission, leaving her with the smuggler.

It was stolen by none other than Drayen's rival, Diago Hixan, who was seldom seen nowadays. Fortunately, one of Hixan's men, Tookreek, was willing to help get a meeting. Unfortunately, the means to meet Hixan, a small Krayt Dragon tooth, was lost when Geonosians attacked one of their warehouses and killed the lieutenant holding it, and the men tasked with finding it were slain in a fight which involved Jedi Knight Nariel Pridence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fighting their way through the Geonosians, the smuggler found the Krayt Dragon tooth on a desk in the upper office of the warehouse. At that moment, a Sith, Vaverone Zare, walked in, admitting to be the one who sent the Geonosians to the warehouse in the hope of attracting Hixan's attention.

By the time they got there however, Skavak had already traded a fake head for the hyperdrive. Ace quickly gave chase after \u201cborrowing\u201d one of House Alde's speeder bikes, but Skavak shut down the hanger blast doors as they arrived, forcing the smuggler to override the door.
