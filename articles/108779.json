However, they later rejoined the Collective, though Maul reminded them that the Pyke Syndicate was a small player in his operations and could be replaced.

Lom sent his four Pykes down to hunt for the Padawan. The four soon encountered Kaitis and Maul traveling below them, and they opened fire. Maul and Kaitis drew their lightsabers and deflected their shots. The four then found themselves flanked by four DRK-1 Dark Eye probe droids, which gunned down one of the Pykes.

In 19 BBY, the Syndicate allied themselves with Maul and his Shadow Collective; the Pykes were eager to join after Maul had coerced the Black Sun into joining the alliance. Along with Black Sun, they assisted Maul and Death Watch when they attempted to force the Hutt Clan into joining the Shadow Collective on Nal Hutta, where they attacked Gardulla the Hutt's Palace and forced all but one of the Hutts to flee to Jabba's Palace. The last Hutt, Oruba, was stoked into revealing the whereabouts of the other Hutts and killed by Savage Opress afterward. The Pyke Syndicate then helped Maul attack Jabba the Hutt's Palace and force Jabba and Gorga the Hutt into joining them. For the Shadow Collective's next move, the Pykes staged a false flag attack on Mandalore, allowing Death Watch to intervene as so-called defenders of the people. With the government of Mandalore unable to manage the crisis, Death Watch successfully took over Mandalore without any real resistance and locked up their opponents.

Lom told the Jedi they could have Silman in exchange for them turning a blind eye to them killing Sifo-Dyas. Shortly afterward Tyranus arrived on Oba Diah with the intention of keeping the Jedi from discovering the truth behind Sifo-Dyas' demise. Tyranus cut through several guards and killed Silman when arriving at his cell. Tyranus then engaged the Jedi and the Pykes in battle.

Krim was unable to rely on his Pyke Syndicate subordinates for help because several of his underlings contested his leadership of the organization. In response, Krim enlisted the services of two independent bounty hunters\u2014the former Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress and the undercover Jedi Master Quinlan Vos\u2014to rescue his family.

Agreeing to the deal, Rafa, her sister Trace, and Trace's friend Ahsoka Tano, secretly a former Jedi, loaded up Trace's Nebula-class freighter, the Silver Angel, with the spice and set off to Oba Diah. On route, however, there was a confrontation leading Trace to believe that the Pyke Syndicate were going to take her ship, so she dumped the spice. Ahsoka Tano, realizing they still owed the Pykes 30,000 credits worth of spice, came up with a plan to get away safely. Upon arriving on Oba Diah, a group of Pykes met them on a platform, including Marg Krim. The group then pretended they had the spice and gave the Pykes empty containers. Ahsoka Tano, unbeknownst to both her friends and the Pykes, used a Jedi mind trick to convince Krim to give them the credits. Fife, however, became suspicious of the group, realized the crates were empty, and ordered Pyke guards to get them. The group then made a hasty escape aboard their ship; however, they were cut off by patrol ships and caught in a tractor beam. The group was then taken prisoner by the Pykes and Rafa was tortured. Trace escaped the torture chamber and met up with Ahsoka and Rafa who had escaped the prison cell. After nearly escaping, the group was again captured by Marg Krim and the Pykes. In order for the Martezs to escape, Tano claimed the sisters still had a family and that she would tell Krim their location if the sisters did not return the spice. In reality, the sisters' parents had been killed during Senate hostage crisis. After the two left to their ship and Tano was taken away, Krim spoke with Fife, stating that, while he knew it was a deception, his life depended on the spice as much as theirs. When Fife questioned if Maul would find out, Krim stated his belief that Maul already knew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After she escaped her cell by using the Force, Tano sneaked through the facility until finding an armory, where she took a set of magnetic thermal detonators to damage the Pyke base. Elsewhere, given that they lacked the spice but intended to rescue Tano, Trace and Rafa returned to Oba Diah, intending to steal spice from the Pykes and then trade it back for Tano. Pretending they were to take delivery of a shipment, Rafa claimed the order was \"from up top\" and had the Toongs at the shipping dock get to work getting her the spice. Meanwhile in the facility, Tano secretly placed the detractors before overhearing Krim talking with Maul via hologram. During their discussion, Krim informed Maul that the Republic was cracking down on the Pykes, recounting that they had raided a shipment. After Tano hid from the rogue Sith's view when he seemed to notice her, Maul ordered Krim that there were to be no more delays or else another member of the Collective, Crimson Dawn, would take control of their operation. After Fife and Krim left, having been informed that Tano had escaped, she made contiuned to plant explosives and learned Maul was on Mandalore from the transmission log. However, Krim and his forces then entered the room and captured her, but not before seeing she could use the Force. This made the Pyke leader believe she was a member of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After fighting off a Trandoshan manager and several Toongs, Rafa and Trace escaped the dock with the spice and went to return it to Krim. Fortunes were not as high for Tano, however, as Krim intended to kill her to help restore his syndicate's reputation. The Martez sisters then entered the room, claiming they had returned the spice that they had really just stolen, so Tano would not have to die. Krim, however, believed all three had been working for the Republic, although he soon learned both had been unaware of Tano's Force-sensitivity until he revealed it. As the Pykes around the three prepared to fire, Tano's bombs went off, giving them an opportunity to escape. They made it to the Silver Angel and, while they were chased by three Pyke ships, Tano used the Angel's gun to take out two of the craft, and Trace used the Angel itself to knock away their final pursuer. After this, the former Jedi and the sisters were finally free from the Pykes, retuning back to Trace Martez's repair shop on Coruscant. Once there, Tano thought that, because the Pykes thought she was working for the Jedi, the syndicate would not hunt down the sisters in the near future."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano's time with the sisters on Coruscant was cut short almost immediately because they had been followed by members of the Mandalore resistance.

Quay agreed to negotiate and told Qi'ra, Beckett, and L3-37 to come with him, while two of Quay's guards took Han and Chewbacca to work as slaves in the mining operation. When Quay and Qi'ra arrived to the control room of the mining operations, Quay led Qi'ra and L3 into a closed room but told Beckett to wait outside. When the door of the room closed, Beckett killed two of Quay's guards and began to fire at the others. Eventually, Beckett killed all of Quay's guards.
