However, due to a bug, many of the NPCs in Naberrie's quests were not properly sequenced. For instance, in the quest to kill Fitzal, players actually encountered an individual known as Herosk Bal'far, who was supposed to appear in a previous quest. According to the game files, killing Fitzal would not result in a mission success, as the character (in this case Herosk Bal'far) was not designated as a \"destroy\" NPC. Nevertheless, it was possible for the player to complete the mission by escorting Fitzal back to Naberrie in Dee'ja Peak. This article assumes that the content of Naberrie's quest dialogue is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity, and that Fitzal, not Herosk Bal'far, actually appeared during her sixth and final quest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Furthermore, because Melloc Fitzal lacked a proper character model, the canonical species cannot be definitively determined in the Star Wars Legends continuity.
