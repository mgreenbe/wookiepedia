In order to install a geothermal reactor, geothermal conduits have to be installed through costly crust drilling procedures, with excess heat dissipators and the generator itself only being installed after drilling is complete. Because of the nature of this type of power source, its heat signature is very easy to detect and not very suited for concealed facilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Examples of this type of power source are hyperbatteries and geothermal taps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
