Amassing a multitude of like-minded disciples, Ruin founded a new empire of the Sith, clashing with the Galactic Republic and the Jedi in the New Sith Wars. The reign of Darth Ruin ended prematurely due to the instigation of his backstabbing followers, setting a treacherous precedent that would plague his successors for many centuries.

This venture met an abrupt end, however, after Rivan and his Battlelords were entrapped, and ultimately destroyed, by a Sith artifact called the Darkstaff.

For centuries up to this point, the Sith were commonly believed to have been vanquished, having been inactive since the reign of the reconstituted Sith Empire from the time of the Great Galactic War. The Sith would eventually return, however, due to the machinations of a Jedi Master known as Phanius.

Despite a number of foiled incursions at Corphelion, Gap Nine and King's Galquek, the New Sith had enlisted allies among the Devaronians and Hiitians by the year 1500 BBY. Decades later, the Sith amassed an army against Republic and Jedi forces on the planet Mizra. Many Lords of the Sith participated in this battle, each mounting a personalized speeder bike named after a predatory species that epitomized their innermost nature. The tide of this engagement was turned by the actions of a lone Sith sniper who\u2014after killing a Jedi coordinator and disrupting their battle meditation\u2014triggered a full-scale slaughter of the Jedi forces, resulting in a crushing Sith victory. At the battle's end, hundreds of Jedi were captured by the Sith and promptly converted to the ways of the dark side. In the aftermath of their triumph at Mizra, the Sith were left without a clear line of succession, leaving no immediate heir to the Dark Lord mantle.

This success proved short-lived, however, when the eventual betrayal of Rivan's Sith apprentice\u2014Darsin\u2014obstructed the fruition of the Dark Lord's Battlelord army. Additionally, the Jedi began specifically killing individual Battlelords, thereby releasing the bonded subordinates and allowing them to flee the battlefield.

By this point, Rivan had finally managed to acquire the Darkstaff, only to have its power turn against him amid the pivotal battle. To this end, the Darkstaff invoked a hyperspace wormhole, obliterating Rivan's entire contingent of Battlelords and teleporting the Dark Lord himself forward through time.

These experiments led to the creation of the nanogene spore, a virus capable of transforming living victims into hulking hybrids of metal and flesh called technobeasts. Through the power of the dark side, the technobeasts were bound to the will of Darzu herself, who promptly mobilized the creatures into an obedient army known as the Metanecrons.

In spite of Darzu's death and the resulting sabotage of her technobeast army, the New Sith were nonetheless deemed victorious by the end of the Sictis Wars. Additionally, Darzu's successors would continue utilizing the technobeasts for the remainder of the New Sith Wars, albeit in smaller numbers than before.

Unwilling to unite under a single leader, the New Sith failed to capitalize on the Republic's decline.

Nonetheless, the Republic avoided extinction and escaped the Dark Age perpetuated by the Sith, rebuilding its government after the Ruusan Reformation.
