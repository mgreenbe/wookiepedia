She was offworld when the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing destroyed the planet during Operation: Cinder, becoming a survivor of the genocide, which eradicated the population of Nacronis, including members of her family. Six years after the end of the Galactic Civil War, the survivor, wishing to speak with Imperial pilots who were involved in the incident, reached out to the New Republic's Reconciliation Project. Senator Wyl Lark arranged for the survivor to meet with Yrica Quell, a pilot of the 204th who had deserted the Empire after participating in the genocide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
