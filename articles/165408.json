In addition to providing the wearer with extra strength and protecting against kinetic and energy attacks, the Malgon armor came with fire suppressing chemical sprays attached to each arm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The armor was originally designed for use near power plants, chemical factories and other areas where explosives might be found. For reasons unknown, the Galactic Empire requested that all production of this battle armor be cancelled and all armor units be handed in to Imperial authorities. A handful of battle armors were never handed in, and eventually found their way into the black market. Ironically, the fire suppressing mechanisms were replaced by flamethrowers in all of these armors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
