The Force artifact was spherical in shape, hand-held sized, and black-colored with red markings. Around the year 34 ABY, the galactic explorer Lor San Tekka infiltrated the Great Vaults of Cato Neimoidia to take a look at the artifact as his proper request to do so was rebuffed. Shortly after he got his hands on the relic, he was arrested by Neimoidian guards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kazerath device first appeared in the 2017 comic Poe Dameron 20, written by Charles Soule with art by Angel Unzueta."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
