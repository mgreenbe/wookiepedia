They were blamed for both the destruction of several blaster rifles on Vandor-3 and a turbolaser assembly line on Coruscant. The actual reason behind forming the group was to force the Vandor-3 law enforcement to requisition more blasters, allowing fake ones fitted with espionage droids to be circulated into the local Borsk Fey'lya Army Base."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Attacks"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wraiths made a domestic disturbance call and waited for officers to enter the building, then a fake victim would claimed that he had been attacked by his roommate, a genetically modified Kowakian monkey-lizard.
