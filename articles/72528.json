At any one time, there were twelve junior counselors on the council, and their votes counted for half as much as those of the council's nine senior counselors. During the waning years of the Galactic Republic, the former criminal Westa Impeveri served as a junior counselor, until he later defeated the council leader Karid Blakken in an election in 33 BBY and became a senior counselor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
