The temple had been attacked by Anakin Skywalker, Kenobi's former Padawan who had recently succumbed to the Dark side of the Force and taken the name Darth Vader. Kenobi and Yoda were unaware of Skywalker's fall or the cause of Order 66, and planned to return to the temple to investigate, as well as shut down an emergency beacon that had been activated by Vader that recalled Jedi back to the Temple and into a trap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Temple, occupied by clone troopers, Kenobi and Yoda encountered and fought Decoy Squad Five, a clone squad whose members had disguised themselves as Jedi to lure any stragglers into a trap. They fought more clones at a surface entrance and continued to face different types of clone troopers on their way up to the security station. On their way they discovered the corpses of their Jedi brethren and noticed that several had been killed by lightsaber strikes, but had little time to mourn as they hid from the thousands of clone troopers at the Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After reaching the security station Kenobi fought a group of clone assassins posted there by Vader and deactivated the beacon, after which the younger Jedi examined the security holograms to discover who had invaded the Temple.

Sidious orchestrated the galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars between the Republic\u2014in which he served as Supreme Chancellor in his public identity as Palpatine\u2014and the Confederacy of Independent Systems to bring about the destruction of the Jedi. He secretly arranged an army of clone troopers to serve under the Jedi in the Grand Army of the Republic. As the war drew to a close in 19 BBY, Palpatine revealed his true affiliation to Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight prophesied to be the Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. Skywalker informed Jedi Council member Mace Windu of Palpatine's Sith loyalty, leading the latter to confront the Chancellor in his suite on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, in fear of precognitive visions he had seen of the death of his wife Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Skywalker intervened just as Windu planned to execute Palaptine, killing the Jedi Master and pledging to become the Sith Lord's apprentice. In his first act as the newly christened Darth Vader, on Palpatine's orders he attacked the Jedi Temple and planned to exterminate every Jedi there. Concurrently, Palpatine enacted Order 66, a contingency plan which commanded the clone troopers to turn against their Jedi officers with lethal force, that was enforced by secret inhibitor chips implanted in their brains. Across the galaxy the Jedi fell in battle to the blaster-fire of their once loyal comrades, but not all were eliminated. Skywalker's Master Obi-Wan Kenobi narrowly survived on the Outer Rim Territories planet Utapau, and on Kashyyyk Grand Master Yoda, sensing the deaths, was able to decapitate his would-be assassins."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ruin of the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader followed the orders of his new Master, leading thousands of troops of the 501st Legion into the Temple and killing the Jedi there, including Master Cin Drallig and many younglings. Once the clones were able to breach the beacon control room at the Temple summit, Vader was able to use his access code to activate the Return-to-Coruscant code recalling any Jedi to Coruscant immediately, and ordered several clone assassins, who fought with wrist-mounted vibroblades, to guard it with their lives. Clones were also stationed outside the Temple in Jedi apparel to lure any surivors in. On the orders of Sidious, Vader then traveled to the planet Mustafar to eliminate the members of the Separatist Council and end the Clone Wars. Kenobi and Yoda were able to escape the warzones they had been attacked on and were collected by Senator Bail Organa, a Jedi supporter who witnessed the massacre at the temple firsthand. Aboard Organa's starship, the Sundered Heart, Kenobi mourned the loss of his many friends, including Skywalker, whose death he incorrectly presumed, but Yoda urged him to focus on his responsibilities as a Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi realized the beacon was activated as a trap, and arranged to return to Coruscant to deactivate it to save any other survivors. Yoda also realized the need to understand how the Jedi had been betrayed. Kenobi was discussing how Yoda could fit on his lap in the single-cockpit of his stolen Belbullab-22 starfighter Soulless One when Organa was summoned back to Coruscant by Republic Vice Chair Mas Amedda for an emergency Senate session, where Palpatine would declare the reorganization of the Republic into the Galactic Empire. The senator offered to escort the Jedi on his way. The Jedi and Organa arrived at the Grand Convocation Chamber of the Senate, where Kenobi mind tricked a Senate guard who was enthusiastic to arrest the Jedi into thinking that their presence was not a problem.

Kenobi adopted the hunched stance and mannerisms of a tramp while holding Yoda in his arms. He offered his ancient companion as a Jedi infant to the clones, whose sergeant was skeptical and asked how it could be verified. Yoda responded by igniting his lightsaber, and Kenobi resumed his more dignified Coruscanti accent and offered Decoy Squad Five a chance to surrender. The clones refused and were dispatched by the Jedi in six seconds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At a surface entrance to the temple both Jedi took on a group of clones, deflecting blaster-fire with their lightsabers and using the Force. Yoda telekinetically threw one clone trooper into two of his brothers, and killed another by impaling him with a thrown lightsaber. The Grand Master jumped onto that clone before leaping into further action. Inside the Temple thousands of clone troopers were present to tally the clone and Jedi dead against official records. In one room of the Temple Kenobi and Yoda fought a large group of clones, also leaping up to a ledge to take down several clone snipers. Another group of clones heard the Jedi approaching and detonated a large pillar, unwittingly giving the Jedi access to the ledge they were on. The Jedi continued fighting more clones, including clone blaze troopers. Both became aware of the attention they were drawing, so Yoda suggested that the two split up.

Kenobi had to jump out of the way to avoid being crushed by the ensuing rubble, and Yoda joked that the younger Jedi was always finding himself in trouble. The two fought several clones together and both had to lift a large piece of rubble out of their path. In a hallway leading to the Jedi Archives Kenobi had to repel turret fire while Yoda ran ahead to deactivate the weapons. Inside the library the Jedi found the body of Jocasta Nu, the Jedi librarian who had been killed by Vader, and mourned their losses. While fighting more clones in the archives, including a clone trooper commander, the Temple's lockdown protocol was activated, shielding the exits. Kenobi cut open a wall panel to break the shield, also cutting through the door with his lightsaber. The two Jedi proceeded to a significantly damaged passageway where the walls were exposed to the outdoors. Several Low Altitude Assault Transports began firing on the Jedi, but were destroyed by Kenobi, who used an anti-aircraft cannon to block their missiles and destroy them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clone officers became concerned when some five-man surveillance squads began disappearing only for their corpses to appear stuffed inside closets. Some clones also beame concerned that the Temple was haunted through unexplained noises and movement in their peripheral vision. Kenobi and Yoda found it easy to hide from the clones, having years of experience navigating the Temple's enormous passageways and rooms compared to the clones' single day. Inside the Room of a Thousand Fountains one clone in a cleanup squad noticed movement behind a stand of Hylaian marsh bamboo and led his comrades in pursuit.

The two Jedi also encountered more bodies wounded by saber strikes. They reached the beacon room late at night, having spent the whole day slowly sneaking through the Temple, and there they were ambushed by the clone assassins posted there by Vader, but Kenobi was able to defeat them. He recalibrated the emergency beacon through the force, switching the outgoing message from a request to come home to a warning to hide, rather than simply deactivating the beacon. Yoda observed that the clones would not discover the alteration for some time, and insisted that the Jedi leave quickly to avoid detection, knowing the pain finding answers would cause, but Kenobi insisted on viewing security footage to discover the perpetrator of the attack on the Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi activated a security hologram of the fight that had taken place between Skywalker and Drallig, witnessing him killing the Jedi Master along with many other younglings.

However, filled with concern, Amidala traveled to the Mustafar system to confront her husband, with Kenobi stowing away on her ship. Prior to landing, Kenobi contacted Yoda by a comlink, with the Jedi wishing for positive outcomes on their respective missions. On Mustafar, Amidala asked Skywalker about his actions and the new Sith denied them as a ploy by Kenobi to drive them apart. Amidala was relieved but grew more concerned when Vader expressed a desire for power and dominion over the galaxy, realizing that her husband had changed. When Kenobi emerged from Amidala's ship, Vader believed his wife had betrayed him and planned to kill him, using the Force to choke her in anger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi and Vader fought, while Yoda simultaneously battled Sidious in the Grand Convocation Chamber.

Kenobi took Amidala to Polis Massa, where she gave birth to the twins Luke and Leia and expressed belief that there was still good in Vader before she died. Kenobi took Luke into hiding to Anakin's relatives on the planet Tatooine, accepting that the Jedi Order was no more.

One Jedi identified his allegiance to the crowd and demanded that his hidden brethren join him in fighting back, but the present Jedi, including Hudorra, Na, Dass Jennir, Shadday Potkin, and Koffi Arana, refused, so the Jedi calling for action was killed on the Temple's steps and the rally was ended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Tsui Choi was in his starfighter when Order 66 was given and began flying towards Coruscant in response to the Return-to-Coruscant beacon.

On the planet Murkhana in the Outer Rim, a group of Order 66 survivors; Roan Shryne, Bol Chatak, and Olee Starstone, received the initial duplicitous transmission from the Temple through a beacon transceiver and made plans to steal a ship to return to Coruscant. Just as the Jedi trio found an appropriate ship to steal, the new trasmission came through, warning them to go into hiding. However, they still prepared to capture the ship to escape the occupied world, but were surrounded by clone troopers and captured.

Originally Kenobi and Yoda encountered clones wearing Jedi robes at the entrance to the temple, with the two immediately seeing through the ruse and cutting them down, but in postproduction the scene was deleted, and the standard clone trooper armor was edited over the robes for a short action sequence. The deleted scene was included in bonus discs of the DVD and Blu-ray releases of Revenge of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Matthew Stover's novelization of the film portrays the events in the Temple with some differences. Kenobi and Yoda discover the bodies of Drallig and several younglings in the Room of a Thousand Fountains rather than on a bridge, and it is Drallig's body that Yoda observes a lightsaber wound in, instead of a Padawans. Both the novel and the comic portray Kenobi falling down in grief after observing Anakin's dark deeds, which does not occur in the film."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The home console video game adaptation of Revenge of the Sith portrays the infiltration with significantly more combat than the other versions, with the player controlling Kenobi in the level \"Aftermath in the Temple\", and fighting a wave of clones as Yoda in the bonus mission \"Size Matters Not.\" The video game portrays Kenobi and Yoda as fighting their way through to the summit of the temple, where the security station is located, but the 2005 reference book Star Wars: Complete Locations places the security station at the base of the High Council Tower. The Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance versions of the game portray Kenobi arriving independently to the Temple, only meeting Yoda and planing to deactivate the beacon at its entrance.
