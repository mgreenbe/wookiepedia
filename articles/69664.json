During his career, he became acquainted with such notorious figures as the Corellian smuggler Han Solo, the Socorran gambler Lando Calrissian, and the bounty hunter Dengar. Tumperakki and Calrissian went through several adventures together. On one occasion, Tumperakki ratted Calrissian out to Renza the Hutt\u2014although the Lepi claimed that he had only meant it as a jest. On another, the Lepi told the legendary pirate queen Maz Kanata that it was Calrissian who had stolen the hypercoils from her starship Corsair. In fact, the real culprit was the pirate Amaiza Foxtrain, Tumperakki's partner at the time, and the stolen hypercoils had somehow found their way in the Rabbit's Foot's power core."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Smuggling Prizzi's eggs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the Battle of Yavin, Tumperakki and Foxtrain were hired by Prizzi, Queen of Livorno, to safely deliver the last eggs of her kind to Princess Leia Organa of the Rebel Alliance.

While all reacted in shock, Tumperakki knew that he had been sent on a wild goose chase and that those eggs were fake as well. The Rebels then admitted that knowing the Empire were closing in on the eggs, they used Tumperakki's mission as a decoy while Solo smuggled the genuine articles in his own ship, the Millennium Falcon. Nevertheless, Tumperakki was glad to learn that not only the Alliance would pay him what he was owed, but that Solo himself would have to repair his ship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Too Many Lepi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after his fall out with Amaiza Foxtrain, Tumperakki traveled to the planet Rekelos, where he attempted to con the Gloovan gangster Scram at a game of sabacc.

Since the Rebels were intent on acquiring the stolen chips, Skywalker convinced Tumperakki to take part in a ruse. The Lepi smuggler confronted his cousin and, with the help of Chewbacca, forced him to divulge Foxtrain's hiding place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using face paint to make it like he had his cousin scar, Tumperakki pretended to be Reegor as he entered Foxtrain hideout, and while she wasn't fooled by Tumperakki disguise (Hearing about his ship making planet fall), he revealed that he was wearing a tracker, Bringing both the Empire forces and Dengar to attack the place. In the confusion he grabbed the chips. When Foxtrain points out that won't help him as the empire will just target him, he revealed his final distraction, the rest of his cousin running around the place with the imperial not knowing which Lepi to shoot.

Tumperakki and Calrissian took Asera to the Millennium Falcon, but came under attack by several stormtroopers. Despite that, Tumperakki was convinced by Calrissian to steal one of the Empire's new Scuttlers. He used it to fight Korda and his troops until the scuttler fell apart.

Tumperakki and his \"fellow\" guards then returned to the hangar, where Calrissian and Asera were ready to board the Rabbit's Foot, having retrieved the totem.
