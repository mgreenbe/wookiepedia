At some point after being imprisoned by the Pykes, the two prisoners witnessed the pilot Trace Martez run past their cell after she escaped interrogation. When Martez was caught by a Pyke outside the prisoners' cell, the Weequay told her to set them free, and she managed to open the door while the Pyke attempted to hold her back. Free from the cell, the Ithorian incapacitated the Pyke, and the two prisoners attacked oncoming Pyke reinforcements. The Ithorian and the Weequay eventually escaped the fortress, and walked past Martez in the streets of the nearby city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
