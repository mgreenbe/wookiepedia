When Darth Malak seized control of the empire, this master swore allegiance to the new Dark Lord of the Sith. He was in charge of the Temple of the Ancients on Lehon, and was responsible for the dark side education of the Sith Acolytes there. When a redeemed Revan entered the temple along with fellow Jedi Jolee Bindo and Juhani to disable Lehon's disruptor field in order to destroy the Star Forge, the trio encountered this master, who was eager to face Revan, having greatly intensified his training with the hope that he would have the opportunity to fight and kill Revan in lightsaber combat. However, he was ultimately defeated and slain by the former Dark Lord."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
