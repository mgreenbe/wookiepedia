Because the quest dialogue identified Wililikin as male, this article assumes one of the four Human male depictions is canon.

However, it should be noted that this was primarily due to game mechanics, as a result of Wililikin being placed under the randomized terrorist spawn template appearance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
