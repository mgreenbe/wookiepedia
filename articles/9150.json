He took control of the city and the colonists were enslaved and transported to Zygerria. Ten planetary rotations later, Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived in the city to try to remove the Separatists from power. Kenobi tried to negotiate with D'Nar in the governor's tower, but D'Nar threatened Kenobi with bombs placed around the city. After he detonated one in order to prove his point, injuring several clones, Kenobi distracted D'Nar while Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, and R2-D2 disabled the rest of the bombs during the Battle of Kiros. When D'Nar learned that his plan had failed, he fled and was ultimately captured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After all the colonists were rescued, Governor Roshti announced his people's intention to join the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
