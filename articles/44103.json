Leia escapes without the Imperials discovering the true reason for her visit, but she realizes that the time may be past for talk and \"mercy missions.\" Turning her attention to another of the galaxy's trouble spots, Leia finds herself up to her neck in Imperial trouble and comes to terms with the need to take up arms against an evil enemy.
