Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker were sent on a mission to the planet to verify the holocron and return it to the Jedi Order. After meeting with the archaeologist Clatriffe, Kenobi took the holocron, but the pirate gang known as the Krypder Riders arrived to take the artifact for themselves. The leader of the Krypder Riders, Hudso Shaku, confronted Kenobi and noticed his lightsaber, wishing to acquire it instead. With help from Skywalker, Kenobi dealt with the pirates as peacefully as he could, taking the holocron back to the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
