While in a cantina, Io spotted the Resistance operative Finn, who Voss was aware had a large bounty placed on him by the First Order. Io contacted Voss, who told him to follow Finn back to his ship and place a tracker on it. Voss contacted a lieutenant of the First Order, requesting to claim the bounty on Finn's head.

Wooro killed the Resistance operative Tonkins, who Io impersonated in order to get closer to Finn.

Voss went to investigate the disturbance, and found Io fighting with Finn. When Wooro went to shoot Finn, Voss warned the Aqualish to stun rather than kill. Wooro missed, stunning Io, and Voss reprimanded him for allowing Finn to get away. Mak, who was waiting in the crew's starship, was tricked into investigating lights on the far side of the outpost by Dameron, despite Voss ordering him to keep watch over the Resistance ship.

However, BB-8 bumped a crate of thermal detonators, sending one rolling towards Voss. Voss dived aside to avoid the explosion, giving Dameron the chance to escape in his ship. Upon learning that the explosion had triggered the remaining cache of weapons, Voss contacted the rest of her crew, ordering them to evacuate from the base. She reprimanded Mak for moving from their post, but the Utai was killed when Finn crashed an impounded airspeeder into the Kendoh Gang's ship. Finn and Dameron managed to escape the moon, leaving the bounty hunters and the wreckage of their ship behind. Voss was unperturbed, however; Mak's death left the rest of the crew enough rations to survive long enough so that they could repair their ship.

She was later hired by an anonymous contact to steal the hilt of the sword, which was in the possession of the Ithorian collector Dok-Ondar, who resided in Black Spire Outpost on Batuu. Voss hoped that the job would bring her enough credits to return to her homeworld and restore the status of her family.

Voss, however, saw through the fortune-teller's act, aware that she was a front to screen potential customers for Ohnaka Transport Solutions, ran by the pirate Hondo Ohnaka. Voss spoke with Ohnaka, claiming she needed him to transport the Sword of Khashyun through the First Order blockade, citing his renown as a pirate. She was unaware that Ohnaka was working for Dok-Ondar, who was listening in on their conversation. Voss was forced to wait as Ohnaka recounted one of his adventures before she was asked what she was transporting.

Through a hologram projected from a floating droid, Dok-Ondar spoke to Voss, disclosing that he had been the crew's anonymous benefactor in order to retrieve the other half of the sword. Inside the box that had supposedly contained the hilt, Voss found a number of credits, while Dok-Ondar informed her that he had revealed her ship's location to the First Order.
