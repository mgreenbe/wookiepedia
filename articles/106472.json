As such, Point Defiance jutted westward into the Western Sea toward the continent of Keshtah. The Alanciari, Keshiri inhabitants of Alanciar, maintained a signal tower at Point Defiance from which the Signal Corps could watch for signs of invasion from the Lost Tribe of Sith, who inhabited the western continent. They did just that in 2975 BBY, when the Signal Corpsman Jogan Halder spotted the approaching airships of the Sith Lord Edell Vrai. The fortress of Garrow's Neck lay inland from the Six Claws an housed a garrison of soldiers who could respond in the event of such an attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
