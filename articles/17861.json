In 4 ABY, Ortolan musician Max Rebo kept several blatberry pies hidden behind his organ, which he played in the Tatooine palace of the Hutt crime lord Jabba. When Princess Leia Organa arrived disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh and was subsequently revealed to be the famous Human Rebel, Rebo noticed that she was skinny and looked malnourished.
