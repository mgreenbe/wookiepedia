The spacer instructed him to wait until they had left the station before completing his duty. Nos'lyn admonished the spacer for doing this and not considering the consequences of their actions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TK-363 appeared in the 2003 MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.

The events mentioned above only occurred if the player took a dark sided approach to one of the first quests they received as the \"Jedi\" profession.
