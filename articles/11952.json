He was a big fan of the podracing sport even after it was outlawed across the galaxy. After leaving Tatooine, the pitmaster droid 8D-J8 never left his side. He moved to the planet Batuu, where he opened a restaurant called Ronto Roasters in the settlement Black Spire Outpost in order to bring the ronto to new customers. 8D-J8 accompanied him to Batuu, serving as the pitmaster of the restaurant, where he was programmed to turn the spit and make sure that the meats were grilled well. Bakkar employed several others to help run the establishment along side the droid. He used a large podracing engine as the grill for Ronto Roasters, which he had salvaged and subsequently hung from the ceiling. Due to his becoming a butcher, Bakkar was aptly nicknamed \"the Butcher.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bakkar and his pitmaster sold several meats and vegetables at Ronto Roasters, but the establishment's best-selling dish at was the Ronto Wrap, which was made with his signature sauce, Clutch Sauce. Ronto Roasters also sold drinks, with Bakkar's signature beverage being the Tatooine Sunset. On multiple occasions, Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs had tried to persuade Bakkar to share his family's secret spice rub for ronto wraps, but Bakkar always refused. Tuggs respected it being a secret, but he still tried to figure out the recipe for himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the Battle of Takodana of 34 ABY, Tuggs published a cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook. In the book, he discussed Bakkar and his secret recipe while also proclaiming that Bakkar's stand in Black Spire Outpost had the \"most delicious\" meat one could find in the Outer Rim Territories. The historian Eloc Throno also discussed Bakkar's restaurant and signature dishes in his book Traveler's Guide to Batuu, where he recommended the food there.

Bakkar insisted that another reprogramming was necessary, or else he would need to fasten a restraining bolt onto the droid. Mubo beseeched him not to put a bolt on the pitmaster, but Bakkar pointed out that 8D-J8 had begun thinking himself to be a droid chef, and that due to his simply being a pitmaster, he needed to stop talking.
