Little food was produced on Lianna itself and much of the food eaten there was no longer fresh by the time it reached the planet's cities. The publication known as Galactic Gourmet's Galaxy Guide warned against food native to Lianna, claiming that it was strongly and unsubtly flavored with lill and various preservatives. The guide claimed that this made the cuisine taste rather unpleasant, as the flavor of the preservatives and lill prevailed over other ingredients. In contrast, the travel guide How to Do the Allied Tion on 25 Credits a Day gave a positive review of Liann cuisine, describing the taste of food flavored with lill as hot, spicy, and unpredictable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One dish available on Lianna that included lill was fish sticks, which could be purchased on the streets of the starport in the city of Lola Curich alongside food and drinks such as Bubble Bowls of VegeParsine, fresh choya bread, and Dalkash ale.
