They had 2 small eyes on the side of their broad armored head. The wings of the rormaroo were filled with gas-filled chambers that provided lift. They primarily grazed on airborne pollen and insects and drank from cliffside waterfalls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A rormaroo started out as a tan creature that resembled a leathery snake, but over time soil and vegetation would accumulate on their wide backs. This gave them the appearance of being a flying island when viewed from above. The build-up of plants and soil would help protect them during ritual mating battles. However, as the rarmaroo aged, the years of soil accumulation would weigh it down and cause it to sink to the canyons of Pallaxides and starve to death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rormaroo was often used as a beast of burden, with campers landing on one and spending weeks there as the animal would drift along the skies of Pallaxides.
