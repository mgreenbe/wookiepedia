It had two entrances, one in the front and one in the back. The cantina consisted of a large room with a long, U-shaped bar counter in the middle of the room where a bartender sold beverages. Six large booths along the walls provided tables and chairs where people could sit down, drink and listen to the music. A door behind the bar led to a small back room that wasn't in use as of 1 ABY. Another room in the back of the cantina gave special patrons a little privacy from the other patrons' prying eyes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the beverages available at the bar were Adumari beer, Lopez Softdrink, Ardees Beverage tea, milk and imported Utozz."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Employees and patrons"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A bartender and the Ithorian chef Oecax worked in this cantina."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the beings who visited this cantina regularly in 1 ABY were the Bith Sigrix Slix and the Drall Green Laser.
