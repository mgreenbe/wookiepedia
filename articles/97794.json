Alongside another criminal, nicknamed \"Scar\", he tried to steal three cases of weapons from the Exchange's agent and former Republic commando Zeerid Korr. Korr anticipated the ambush even after the group tried to trick him into thinking that they were sent by Arigo, and Korr attacked them first, killing No Scar with a well-placed strike to the throat. Korr managed to kill the entire criminal group before they could steal his weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
