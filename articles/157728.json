Its major focal point was a large temple. At some point, its population was massacred, prior to the system's sun vanishing. In 34 ABY,[source?] Resistance members Commander Poe Dameron and Kazuda Xiono investigated the star system and discovered the ruins of the village, deducing that a massacre had occurred. Xiono retrieved a child's doll from the ruins of the temple before the two encountered a First Order probe droid that had been left at the village."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
