The style featured short, quick movements, most beginning from the set position and moving within the small area framed by the target's shoulders and hips. A skilled practicioner could quietly silence an opponent, disarm them, and disable them within a very short period of time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
