After conquering Naboo, the Federation built three camps on separate islands near the base of a waterfall on the Solleu River to hold captured civilians. A shield gate was also constructed on the opposite side of the islands from the waterfall. Camp Two was situated on an island that was between the other two. During the Raid on the Solleu River, the prisoners were liberated by Rescue 2 of Rescue Flight. Camp 2 apparently had the most prisoners of the three camps since Rescue 2 was the only Rescue Boat to report being overloaded. Rescue 2 was able to deliver the prisoners to the Mercatan, which transported the Naboo to a place free from the Trade Federation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
