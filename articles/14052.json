They eventually found Utric Sandov who revealed to them the discovery the Vor'Na'Tu.

Organa also brought her translater, C-3PO, along. During the voyage, rumors spread that Darth Vader was on his way. Shortly after their arrival on the asteroid, Wookiee chieftain Attichitcuk came to the aid of Organa and Shen-Jon. The timely arrival of Attichitcuk and his contingent of Wookiee warriors and war machines proved critical in the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They split their forces, with one group creating a diversion while Shen-Jon and the pummels approached from behind the base.

The Dark Lord demanded that they hand over the relic to him in order to bring back to his master, Emperor Palpatine. Shen-Jon, fearing the results of the Vor'Na'Tu falling into the Emperor's hands, refused to surrender and shattered the item into four pieces, rendering it useless to Vader. Engaging Vader in a duel, Shen-Jon's skills were no match for the Sith Lord's and eventually Echuu Shen-Jon was killed.

Converting the explosive droids is an optional objective. This article assumes 100% completion of objectives and follows the guide's recommended strategy. The mission and thus the battle was also included in the game's 2002 expansion pack, Clone Campaigns.
