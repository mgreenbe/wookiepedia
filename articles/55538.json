Rimward of the Loop Worlds were the rarely-traversed Wetyin's Way and the Pinooran Spur, which included the planets Vaal, Glade and Wetyin's Colony, and Krylon, Betshish, Marrovia and Kushibah.

In 3955 BBY, Supreme Chancellor Tol Cressa assigned a G0-T0 infrastructure planning system to restore the area to its former glory. However the droids began a bloody coup, setting themselves up as dictators and seizing all 16 habitable worlds. After millions were slaughtered, Cressa sent a military task force to deal with the rogue droids. In the aftermath of the Old Sith Wars, the Jedi Order expunged all records of the Yavin system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Hydian Way was charted by Freia Kallea in 3693 BBY, scouts and settlers moving north up the super-hyperroute and the praediums branching off it rediscovered the region. One such hyperlane, the Gordian Reach, stretched from the Feriae Junction on the Hydian Way to Belderone beyond the Perlemian Trade Route Rimward of the Cron Drift. Briefly a significant hyperroute in the Outer Rim, shifting stars eventually erased the route, though the arc of thousands of star systems along the old route was still sometimes called that by spacers by the the Rise of the Empire era. By 22 BBY, the Gordian Reach had been reduced to a minor route that gave its name to an unremarkable sector of motley factory worlds, mining installations, and lightly-populated colonies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Anakin Skywalker, pursuing Asajj Ventress from the Battle of Muunilinst, fought a duel with her on Yavin 4.
