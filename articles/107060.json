This would date the events of the scenario to 29 BBY, but this contradicts the canon established by the Living Force scenario Philology, in which the Cularin system disappears from the galaxy for ten years, between c. 31 BBY and c. 21 BBY, thus making it impossible for the anniversary celebration have taken place during that timeframe.
