Ashmead's Lock and SOL-GDA were constructed by the Predori, a rogue empire that opposed the Galactic Republic centuries prior to the Galactic Civil War. Hidden in a gravity well, the ship crashed on the nearby planet Kashyyyk after the well collapsed on itself. SOL-GDA remained intact, however, and still continued to operate even after the Galactic Empire took control of Ashmead's Lock and had it modified and rebuilt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
