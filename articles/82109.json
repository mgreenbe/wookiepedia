Even Galactic Cup matches held on Coruscant were poorly attended, and HoloNet News sportswriters did not seem to fully understand the rules. By contrast, the people of the planet Fwillsving were highly enthusiastic limmie fans. After Fwillsving's team defeated Kubindi in a 22 BBY Galactic Cup match, the ensuing celebrations left the city of Svitalos in ruins. Limmie was the favorite sport of Mandalorians and clone commandos. In Mando'a, the game is called Meshgeroya\u2014the beautiful game.
