They were armed with one booma launcher, and featured a propeller and two bubble-like cockpits set apart from each other, where the pilot and gunner sat. They were first used around 3000 BBY during the War of the Gungan tribes and cost 90 units of carbon and 20 units of nova crystals. These frigates were constructed at shipyards by the Bongomeken Collective. Bongo scouts were upgraded versions of Bongo Light Scouts and were further upgradeable to the Bongo Advanced Scout."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bongo Scouts appear in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack.
