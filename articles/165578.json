The Xanadu Blood was given to Cad Bane by Darth Sidious as payment for his theft of a holocron and the kyber memory crystal. Bane used it during his kidnapping of Wee Dunn from Rodia and Zinn Toa from Glee Anselm, and lost the ship when he was captured. Bane eventually regained custody of the ship and used it to hunt down Ziro the Hutt. At some point, Bane replaced the Xanadu Blood with a new ship, the Justifier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
