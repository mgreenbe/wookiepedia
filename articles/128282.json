She was captured by Sith agents before being able to pull off the hit and was sent to Korriban to be tortured for information. Throughout her interrogation, Solentz maintained that she was hired by an anonymous party, and that she was unaware that the target was an Imperial agent. Despite her insistance, her jailer, Knash, refused to believe her, and was given assistance in the interrogation process by a Sith Warrior acolyte. The Sith Acolyte refused to believe the assassin and chose to execute her in her cell instead of giving her an opportunity to fight for her freedom. After this, Overseer Tremel berated the Warrior's decision, stating that she could have been an asset."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
