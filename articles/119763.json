Upon reaching the Skeleton Straits of the course, San became engaged in a three-way podracer battle between him, Ahsoka Tano, and Kidd Kareen. Ventress appeared on the hull of San's podracer to receive the data file, but was foiled by Ahsoka who began to fight her with her lightsaber and Anakin Skywalker who Force crushed the datafile. San was left in peril when Ahsoka sliced his podracer in half in mid-flight. However he did not die when his remaining section crashed, as Kidd Kareen later said that he \"retired\", telling in fact he wasn't dead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
