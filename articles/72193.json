At fifty meters tall each, its four rock formations were seen by the locals as resembling hooded women with faces hidden in sorrowful contemplation. The Socorrans believed that when someone died, their soul would travel from anywhere on the planet and be judged by the four women before which would allow them to go to the afterlife. Because of this, the Socorrans considered the area to be a shrine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
