Manufactured by Duwani Mechanical Products sometime before 3843 BBY, the astromech droid did not undergo a memory wipe during his entire lifetime, allowing him to develop a strong personality and preserve the memories of the dozen or so partners he worked with throughout the years. Originally a repair and pilot droid, Teeseven began working with the Jedi Order in the years before the Great Galactic War as the partner of Jedi Master Ven Zallow, and he went undercover for the Jedi and the Republic Strategic Information Service on multiple occasions during the conflict. Surviving the Sacking of Coruscant and the fall of the Jedi Temple at the end of the war, Teeseven served as a reconnaissance droid for the Order on their homeworld of Tython for much of the Cold War before teaming up with a young Jedi who was the former apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alongside his friend and the Jedi's apprentice Kira Carsen, Teeseven played a pivotal role in halting the plot of the Sith Lord Darth Angral to assault the Republic using stolen superweapons, and after the Knight received the title of Hero of Tython the droid continued to travel the galaxy with his partners. Teeseven's service with the Hero of Tython eventually culminated in a plan to capture the Sith Emperor himself, and the droid accompanied the Hero of Tython during an assault on the Sith capital of Dromund Kaas. The two managed to gain entry to the Emperor's throne room and defeated the Emperor in a fierce confrontation. Afterwards, Teeseven and the rest of the Hero of Tython's companions were awarded the Cross of Glory for their pivotal role in ending the threat of the Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A T7-series astromech droid produced by Duwani Mechanical Products, T7-O1 was constructed sometime before 3843 BBY as a standard factory-spec astromech. Over the next century and a half, Teeseven passed from owner to owner\u2014whom the droid referred to as \"partners\"\u2014without ever undergoing a memory wipe. This led Teeseven to develop a personality and preserved the droid's memories of all of his former partners. Approximately one hundred years after his creation, Teeseven was assigned as a Senate legislation analyst under Senator Oodora of Manaan. Oodora promoted the astromech after his first year, and Teeseven soon became the Senator's campaign manager and speech writer throughout Oodora's four consecutive terms. When the Senator retired after twenty years of working with Teeseven, the droid began working with a Rodian named Shafu\u2014who, unbeknownst to Teeseven, was a slaver."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teeseven served Shafu faithfully as a navigator, piloting the Rodian's ship and never entering the cargo hold. However, Shafu was eventually captured by a Jedi named Ven Zallow, who convinced Shafu to turn over a new leaf instead of turning him over to the authorities. At Zallow's request, Shafu became a confidential informant for the Order, and in gratitude the Rodian gave Teeseven to the Jedi. By 3681 BBY, Zallow had sent Teeseven undercover to work with the smuggler Nico Okarr, and the droid served as the human's mechanic and aide on his XS stock light freighter Redshifter. While attempting to smuggle Sith artifacts off the planet, Okarr and Teeseven were captured by Republic forces over the Sith homeworld of Korriban, and the Republic arrested Okarr and impounded the smuggler's ship with Teeseven aboard the Republic space station in the Horuset system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Okarr's transfer to a holding cell was interrupted by the arrival of the Sith Empire. A massive fleet arrived in-system and launched an offensive against the station, intending to retake their homeworld. As the smuggler's ship was the only one fast enough to escape the Sith fighters, Jedi Knight Satele Shan and her master decided to use it to escape in order to warn the Republic. Teeseven had been on-board the ship performing maintenance as the hangar came under assault by Sith forces, and the smuggler instructed him to prepare the ship's weapons in preparation for their escape. The smuggler and his passengers, including Teeseven, were ultimately able to escape their pursuers and bring word to the Republic of the oncoming Sith threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving Okarr's service sometime after Korriban and returning to Master Zallow, Teeseven worked with the Jedi Order throughout much of the Great Galactic War. By that time, he had worked with a total of eleven partners, including Zallow, Oodora, a doctor, mechanic, Shafu, a Senatorial aide, and Okarr. Around 3663 BBY, Zallow lent Teeseven to the Republic Strategic Information Service for a single mission. The intelligence agency sent the droid undercover to protect a Muun ambassador from the secretive bounty hunter guild known as the GenoHaradan. During the assignment, Teeseven was successfully able to detect the assassin in the crowd and discharged a stun bolt, but the assassin escaped into the crowd. The ambassador retired in fear, leaving Teeseven depressed and believing that he never truly completed his mission."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Service to the Order"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The fall of Coruscant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3653 BBY, Teeseven was present on the Republic's capital planet of Coruscant with Ven Zallow when the Jedi Temple was attacked by a Sith strike force under the leadership of the Sith Lord Darth Malgus. Zallow ordered his astromech companion to stay hidden and record the battle in case of a Jedi defeat, though the droid emerged briefly to warn the Jedi Master of Darth Malgus' approach during the fighting. Teeseven returned to his hiding place and watched as Zallow was slain in battle with Malgus, and he escaped into the tunnels beneath the Temple as the battle turned against the Jedi. Teeseven attempted to return to Zallow's body after the fighting ended and managed to recover his lightsaber, but the Sith planted explosives and the droid was forced to retreat deeper into the lower levels of Coruscant as the Temple was brought down. A damaged Teeseven remained there for quite some time before he encountered Zallow's former apprentice Aryn Leneer and the smuggler Zeerid Korr, who were attempting to find out who had killed Zallow. After explaining what had transpired at the Temple, Teeseven accompanied the pair to the Temple's backup surveillance station, and he was able to restore power to the systems in order to show Leneer recordings of the Temple's fall. He paused and resumed the recording as per Leneer's instructions, allowing her to discover the identity of Zallow's killer, and he copied the recording for Leneer to peruse later when the trio departed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "T7 and the two Humans hid in an abandoned apartment building after leaving the Temple ruins, and he stayed with Leneer while Korr scouted the nearby Liston Spaceport.

There, the two found Darth Malgus and Leneer embroiled in a fierce duel, but Korr interrupted the fight in fear of her falling to the dark side and helped Leneer escape. Leneer then decided to pursue Malgus' Twi'lek lover, Eleena Daru, in her quest for revenge, and as part of her plan the trio fell from their speeder onto the top of the spaceport. Leneer slowed T7's descent with the Force, and the droid hacked into the spaceport's systems and triggered the facility's fire suppression and safety systems with a false signal that tricked the network's sensors into detecting a fuel gas leak. As a result, evacuation alarms were triggered in Landing Bay 16-B\u2014the hangar used by the shuttles belonging to Daru and her team\u2014and the hangar's launch doors openned, allowing Leneer to enter and attack Daru. At Korr's orders, T7 hacked into the Dragonfly-class dropship Razor in the landing bay, but the droid decided to remain behind with Leneer after she decided not to kill Daru. Teeseven hid in the shadows of the hangar while the Knight confronted Malgus, and the two departed Coruscant aboard Daru's shuttle after Leneer threatened the Twi'lek to ensured her own safety."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Tython uprising"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Leneer left the Order and traveled to the planet Dantooine to live with Korr, Teeseven returned to the Order's service, and when the Jedi Order left Coruscant in 3650 BBY, Teeseven accompanied them to the Order's long-lost homeworld of Tython. Teeseven served as a reconnaissance droid for the Order over the next few years, scouting Tython's wilderness and identifying hazards. In 3643 BBY, Teeseven was sent out along with nineteen other droids as long-range probes, but he was captured by a group of Flesh Raiders, a violent species native to Tython, near the Flesh Raider-controlled Tythos Ridge region. Locked inside a weapons cache in the Upper Hollows cave system, Teeseven faked deactivation and recorded a meeting between the Dark Jedi Callef and a hooded figure whom Callef called Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din raided the weapons cache for the Pilgrims of Kalikori village, the Padawan freed T7 and removed the restraining bolt that the Flesh Raiders had attached to the droid.

Morr revealed himself as Orgus Din's former apprentice and was assumed to have been killed during the Sacking of Coruscant, and his rage at his perceived weakness of the Jedi left him seeking vengeance on the Order. Before he could slay Orgus Din, the Padawan and T7 intervened, defeating Morr and saving the Jedi Master. The Padawan was then elevated to the rank of Knight for the Jedi's role in ending the Flesh Raider threat, and T7 looked on as the newly promoted Knight constructed their first lightsaber. When the Knight was then dispatched to the capital of Coruscant to aid Jedi Master Bela Kiwiiks and her Padawan in dealing with a new threat, T7-O1 decided to remain with the Knight as the droid felt they were a formidable team."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Partners and heroes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Coruscant, T7-O1, the Knight and Orgus Din were brought up to speed on the situation by Master Kiwiiks.

Working with Kira Carsen and Agent Galen of the Republic Strategic Information Service, T7-O1 and the Knight tracked the stolen plans first to a Rodian slicer then to the Black Sun criminial syndicate. The mission then became more complicated as the two learned that Tarnis had been kidnapped by Black Sun. After one failed attempt to rescue Tarnis, T7-O1 and the Knight were informed by General Suthra that the stolen plans had also contained information about every Republic superweapon in development, not just the Planet Prison. Masters Din and Kiwiiks, as well as Agent Galen then departed Coruscant to secure the sites of the compromised superweapons while the Knight and T7-O1 launched an assault on the headquarters of Black Sun in order to rescue Tarnis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the aid of the Coruscant Security Force, T7-O1 and the Knight fought their way to the Black Sun command center, where they found the Black Sun leader in a holocall with Tarnis, who revealed himself to be a Sith Lord.

The three then pursued the Sith Lord first to the Justicars' Sector, where they found the murdered engineering team behind the Planet Prison, then to the ruins of the Jedi Temple, where they found Tarnis in a call with four Sith Lords, including his father, Darth Angral.

With Kira Carsen in tow as the Knight's new Padawan, the group then departed Coruscant for Ord Mantell. Upon arriving on Ord Mantell, T7-O1 and the Knight made their way to Angral's hidden base and fought their way into the command center of the facility. With the base's defenders dealt with, T7-O1 accessed the facility's databanks and found files indicating that Angral was planning to combine aspects of several Republic superweapon programs into a single project, which was codenamed the \"Desolator.\" The files additionally contained intelligence indicating that Angral had sent agents to various worlds to where Republic superweapons were under development."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With this information in hand, T7-O1 continued to accompany the Knight as they traveled to the worlds of Taris, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine and Alderaan in order to chase down Angral's agents and secure the superweapons.

Unfortunately the Knight and his companions learned from General Var Suthra that Angral had already succeeded in combining the superweapons technology into the Desolator, which he had mounted on his flagship.
