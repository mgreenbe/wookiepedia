His unit instigated several anti-Bothan operations, including acts of sabotage and causing havoc in the protests.

However, during the unit's final task to sabotage the planetary shield generators, Navett died after a baby mawkren, which had a bomb, blew up Navett.

As leader of this organization, he participated in several anti-Bothan operations, including acts of sabotage and the instigation of deadly riots, calculated to increase tensions within the New Republic. Navett was the agent who used a Xerrol Nightstinger during a riot on Bothawui in order to make it appear Han Solo and a Bothan leader named Rayl'skar had fired on the rioters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His final mission was to sabotage Bothawui's planetary shield generators in the planetary capital, Drev'starn. During this mission, he and another agent, Klif, opened a pet store\u2014Exoticalia Pet Emporium\u2014as a cover. Using this cover, he was easily able to obtain metalmites which he was able to introduce to the shield generator buildings. When he and Klif offered to act as exterminators, they spread both insecticide and liquid nutrients. Afterward, with the help of two other agents (Pensin and Horvic) who were working at a nearby Ho'Din restaurant, he allowed hungry baby mawkrens with explosives strapped to their backs to follow a power conduit into the generator buildings. This was a suicide mission: after the first wave of mawkren took out the main walls of the generator buildings, he had to accompany the second wave to destroy the generator itself. Navett was killed in the explosion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Navett's mission was a success, even though harassment from Moranda Savich forced both unexpected delays and unplanned acceleration of operations. Even a fire which Savich set in his shop did nothing more than force him to begin his operations early. Navett would not collect any posthumous accolades for his efforts, however, as the Imperial Remnant went on to lose the ensuing Second Battle of Bothawui anyway."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
