Mathematics droids were built to perform billions of calculations at incredible speeds, and were typically used to process data or at universities in the study of hypermathematics. For example, Mathematics droids were used in geometric progressions to help with predictions and intergalactic travel. Less powerful mathematics droids were sold as accounting droids, which were used by businesses and households. The simple customer service software installed on these droids gave them a reputation as dour data pushers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
