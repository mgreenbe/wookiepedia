The risp had been infected with the rakghoul plague on Ord Mantell by the insane Doctor Sannus Lorrick, the Tionese scientist who had released the virus on Kaon to gain revenge on the Tion Hegemony.

However, by the seventh day the illness had spread across Civilian Decks 1 through 5, and the patients were barely controllable. Captain Magnus, who had recognized the signs of the plague, was infected himself two days later, and became paranoid when the doctors suggested that he rest. He accused the crew of mutiny and locked himself on the bridge, sending the Stardream off-course. By the twelfth day, the ship was lost in hyperspace and the infected passengers had begun to gather near the ship's core. The remaining crew, many of whom were infected already, attempted to stop Magnus and retake control of the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crew failed, however, as the Stardream crashed-landed on the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine.
