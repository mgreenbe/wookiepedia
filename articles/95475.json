These were of such significance that many nobles of the Senex-Juvex sector region who had Nartian servants gave them permission to partake in the ceremonies. All Nartians were expected to make a pilgrimage to their ancestral homeworld Nars at least once in their lifetime.

For millennia, they served as household servants for the nobles of the region, becoming ubiquitous across both the Senex and Juvex sectors. Often Nartian families served the same noble family for generations. Some Nartians also made it into the wider galaxy, beyond the borders of the Senex-Juvex sectors, finding work independent of the noble families of their region."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Nartians in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Nartian Nackhar lived on the planet Tatooine, located in the Arkanis sector. In 0 BBY, he worked two jobs: as a fast food vendor in the Mos Eisley marketplace and as an assistant bartender to Wuher in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. He was present on the day when local residents Luke Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the cantina and met the smuggler Han Solo, setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to Skywalker destroying the Death Star. On that day, Skywalker and Kenobi were accompanied by two droids, who were forbidden to enter the cantina. Noticing the droid detector going off as the droids entered, Nackhar alerted Wuher to their presence and the bartender then ordered them to leave. Shortly after that, another patron, Ponda Baba, drew his blaster to attack Skywalker after little provocation. Before he could complete his assault, Kenobi ignited his lightsaber and severed Baba's blaster arm. Following the altercation, Nackhar was assigned to clean up the blood and severed limb."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That was not the only bloodshed that day: Solo also killed the Rodian bounty hunter Greedo. At Wuher's behest, the Nartian claimed the corpse for Chalmun's Cantina, fighting off scavenging Jawas who also desired the body. Wuher later used the corpse as an ingredient in liqueur for Jabba the Hutt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nartians were created by David Bischoff with the character Nackhar in the short story \"Be Still My Heart: The Bartender's Tale,\" published in the Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina anthology in 1995.
