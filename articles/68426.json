It was written by Jim Woodring, illustrated by Art Wetherell, and published by Dark Horse Comics on April 4, 1995. The issue was followed by Jabba the Hutt: The Hunger of Princess Nampi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Publisher's summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jabba the Hutt lives to negotiate, and the art of the deal is his only discipline. But the goods he trades are the lives of others, and in that line of business you can't lose your head. In this self-contained story, Jabba finds himself bartering with Gaar Suppoon, rumored to be an absolute devil at the negotiating table. There's a valuable lesson to be learned here: In a deal with the devil, you can always refuse. In a deal with Jabba, it's not advised."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving on the Gaar's planet, Jabba the Hutt and his adviser Bib Fortuna enter his mansion and witness a fight between two small creatures as a jubjub, a celebration before negotiations. Suppoon introduced Jabba to Kosh Kurp, an explosives expert working for the Galactic Empire, who said that he investigated the place for two days and did not find the bomb that Jabba threatened to put into Suppoon's mansion. The Gaar presents a tromonid, a poisonous creature, which Jabba wants to acquire in exchange for a biological construct known as the Pontak Hypergland. Jabba also presents the Hypergland's creator, Dr. Pineas Pontak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suppoon agrees and gives the tromonid to Jabba, but he notices that it is probably sterile, which the Gaar tells him is correct. But the Hutt then reveals that Dr. Pontak's brain had been removed from his body. Suppoon threatens to kill Jabba, but the Hutt opens the tromonid's cage as he reached for it, so the creature jumped onto his arm and bit him. A bit from one is fatal due to it being poisonous. Jabba offered him a syringe with the antidote in exchange for the tromonid, the doctor, the Hypergland, and some spice. He also took out a grenade and threatened to kill them all if the Gaar shot him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suppoon agreed to the exchange and took the antidote to the poison, but then asked if Kurp could examine Jabba's grenade, to which the Hutt agreed. Kurp then detonated the grenade after surrounding it with his armored body. Suppoon then told Jabba to surrender, at which point Jabba called him by his old alias \"Sonopo Bomoor.\" Kurp had been looking for the man name Sonopo Bomoor, who had his family slaughtered when Kurp was young, during the massacre of Bonaka Nueno. When Kurp realized that Suppoon was actually Bomoor, he turned on the man. Suppoon tried to shoot him with a blaster. The shot ricocheted off of his armor and hit Suppoon in the head, killing him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jabba then told Kurp that he planned this out all along, and said that Kurp can have authority over all of Suppoon's assets. Fortuna praised Jabba's genius, who then responded by warning Fortuna against betraying him, as he seemed ready to \"jump ship\" when it appeared that Suppoon would kill the Hutt. They then left the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
