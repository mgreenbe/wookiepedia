The ship sent out a scrambled distress signal which was picked up by the Galactic Republic space station Starlight Beacon, and a team of Jedi was dispatched to investigate. The Jedi discovered the now-derelict ship and investigated, coming into conflict with a lone pirate left behind on the ship, who was killed by Jedi Master Sskeer after injuring Terec. Finding that the grain onboard had likely come from the planet Sedri Minor, Marshal Avar Kriss sent Sskeer and Ceret to investigate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
