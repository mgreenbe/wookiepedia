It had a narrow cockpit near the rear of the vehicle between a pair of long wings with a sleek ion engine in the middle of each. The starship's narrow framework presented a small target for most pursuers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In fitting with the ship's use as a smuggler's vessel, her weapons were all retractable to keep its profile as low as possible. Three hidden laser cannons in each wing (for a total of six) and an ion cannon on the ship's underbelly provided some limited offensive power though Villie relied more on the Inferno's speed, maneuverability and powerful deflector shields to evade capture. The vessel's hyperdrive unit, which was considered state-of-the-art prior to the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, never achieved its former glory following an incident with a trio of pit droids much to the chagrin of Villie who was forced to make frequent repairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inferno was also equipped with a powerful full-color holoprojector which allowed Vilmarh to receive and send messages across the galaxy.
