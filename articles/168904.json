Zythmnr belonged to a Massassi tribe that was descended from the followers of deceased Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow, who came to Yavin 4 in 5000 BBY. After attaining a position of authority in his tribe, Zythmnr withdrew, spending twelve years in solitude. The Massassi priest emerged in 3997 BBY, when fallen Jedi Knight Exar Kun was knocked unconscious in a fight with Massassi guards in a Yavin 4 forest. Believing that Kun was someone whom they had been waiting for, Zythmnr brought a bound Kun to the structure known as the Temple of Fire, and summoned an ancient Sith wyrm to test the former Jedi's power. Taking possession of Zythmnr's powerful Sith amulets, Kun defeated the Sithspawn, winning the allegiance of Zythmnr and the other Massassi. Kun eventually learned the secrets of Sadow's Sith alchemy, discovering how to change a sentient being into a vessel of the dark side.

Zythmnr belonged to a tribe of Massassi that descended from the followers of former Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow, who fled to Yavin 4 after his defeat at the second battle of Korriban in 5000 BBY. Sadow used Sith magic to twist Zythmnr's ancestors into violent, uncivilized beasts who utilized the dark side of the Force to wield their weapons. By Zythmnr's time, the Massassi tribe had one duty, to watch over the Sith temples built by their ancestors. Zythmnr eventually became a temple priest and came into the possession of a pair of Sith amulets. In 4009 BBY, he withdrew from the outside world and spent the next twelve years in solitude. In 3997 BBY, Yavin 4 was visited by the fallen Jedi Knight Exar Kun, who came to the moon at the behest of the spirit of dead Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd to further his knowledge of the dark side of the Force. However, Kun was quickly defeated by Massassi guards, and after twelve years of self-imposed isolation, Zythmnr emerged from his place of solitude to examine Kun. The temple priest proclaimed that Kun was the one they had been waiting for, and ordered that the Jedi be brought to the Temple of Fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zythmnr ordered that Kun be placed in restraints, and once they reached the Temple of Fire, he accused the Jedi of coming to steal his Sith amulet. Although Kun denied it, the Massassi priest branded him a liar and demanded that he be thrown into a pit in the structure. Zythmnr and the other Massassi elders fell to their knees, muttering ancient spells under the broken statues that lined the temple. Their chants released a torrential power and a throbbing beat, along with the smell of burning flesh that filled the temple. Suddenly, a Sith wyrm created long ago by Naga Sadow's Sith alchemy appeared and attacked Kun. Calling upon the power of the dark side, Kun used the Force to take Zythmnr's Sith amulet and used its dark properties to destroy the monster. Kun's display of power won the allegiance of the Massassi, including Zythmnr. Now the leader of the Yavin 4 Massassi, Kun ordered Zythmnr's clan to build temples that would focus great dark side energies. The fallen Jedi began to study Sith alchemy and discovered a procedure that could transform a living creature into a manifestation of the dark side. Zythmnr agreed to be the first to receive the ancient empowerment, and although the Massassi priest was hesitant about the procedure, Kun reassured him by telling him that the process was painless and that Zythmnr would become the greatest of all the Massassi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the transformation began, Kun fused Zythmnr's skin with metallic bioarmor and enhanced the priest's bone structure and muscle mass. Zythmnr's claws became razor-sharp, and his hide became a hardened plating. Despite Kun's promises to the contrary, the procedure was excruciatingly painful for the Massassi priest. However, Zythmnr survived and urged that the experiments continue. Kun then infused Zythmnr with the dark side, using some of his own physical makeup as a template. The priest took well to the treatment and showed potential with the Force, prompting Kun to perform the same procedure on several dozen more Massassi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zythmnr initially held a great deal of contempt for Exar Kun, going so far as to threaten to kill him and to release a Sith wyrm to attack him. The Massassi priest was very protective of his powerful Sith amulet, causing him to be mistrustful of Kun, as he believed the fallen Jedi was going to steal them. He was also protective of his temple, accusing Kun of seeking to rob it. Zythmnr was unflinchingly loyal, pledging his allegiance to Kun after the Jedi Knight proved himself worthy, even agreeing to be experimented upon after Kun discovered the secrets of Sith alchemy. Despite his loyalty to Kun, Zythmnr was still hesitant and reluctant to undergo the procedure that would make him a dark side vessel. Zythmnr was bilingual, speaking both the Massassi language and Galactic Basic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zythmnr, although not a Force-sensitive, was able to wield the power of the Sith amulet upon his assumption of the temple priest position. However, when Exar Kun discovered the effects of Sith alchemy and transformed Zythmnr into a vessel of the dark side, Zythmnr became able to touch the Force. After some training, the Massassi priest showed potential with the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zythmnr made his first appearance in Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith, a story arc of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Kevin J.
