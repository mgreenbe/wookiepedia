Greenbeaks made a quacking noise and at times swam in bodies of water. In the year 3653 BBY, smuggler Zeerid Korr went to Karson's Park on Vulta to deliver a hoverchair to his crippled daughter, Arra Yooms. While he was in the park, there were some greenbeaks swimming in the pond, and Yooms was feeding them with food that she had bought from a utility droid that was cleaning the park. Once she received her chair, she proceeded to chase the creatures around the park."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greenbeaks' first and thus far only appearance in Star Wars was in the novel The Old Republic: Deceived, written by Paul S.
