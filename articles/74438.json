In 4 ABY, he was among six SpecForce members selected for a mission to the planet Akiva which aimed to investigate the Imperial presence there and rescue pilot Wedge Antilles. The squad, led by Sergeant major Jom Barell, reached Akiva in a transport which they jumped from in a suborbital drop. Kason was first out of the vehicle, which was then hit by Imperial turbolaser fire from Akiva's surface and destroyed. Kason himself was then hit by the laser and vaporised. During his final mission the Corporal wore carbon-lace armor, an orbital drop mask and parawings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kason first appeared in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
