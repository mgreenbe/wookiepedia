She was shown alongside the Daughter in various depictions of them, such as the painting of the Mortis gods in the Lothal Jedi Temple. Some believed that Morai was a servant of the Daughter, or even a manifestation of the Daughter herself in another form. In 20 BBY, the Father, Daughter, and Son all died when the Jedi Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano visited Mortis, as the Father had wanted to test whether Skywalker was the Chosen One of prophecy. During the events that followed, Tano was killed by the Son, who later stabbed his sister with the Dagger of Mortis when she jumped in front of it to protect her father. Dying, the Daughter sacrificed her remaining life force to revive Tano. The Father later killed himself and the Son before the three Jedi were returned to the normal universe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of the life force transferral, Morai became a friend of Tano, coming to watch over her. A few years after the rise of the Galactic Empire, Skywalker, now the Sith Lord Darth Vader, visited the moon where the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal had crashed during Order 66, as it had been carrying Tano and Rex at the time, although they had escaped. Vader found the abandoned lightsaber of his former apprentice in the wreckage, and looked up to see Morai circling above him in the sky before he left the scene."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano later came to owe Morai her life. During the establishment of Chopper Base on Atollon, Morai was present and watched the conflict between the crew of the Ghost and the krykna.

After reuniting with Tano, she was present when Tano and Bridger fought against Emperor Palpatine. Morai accompanied Tano when she returned through the portal to the ruined Malachor Sith Temple. As Tano returned to the temple interior, Morai overlooked an injured Darth Vader as he limped away from the scene."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morai was later present for the meeting of the Mandalorian Din Djarin and Tano in 9 ABY on the planet Corvus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morai was a female convor with green and white feathers and green eyes.
