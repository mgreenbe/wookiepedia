Early Authority IRD models were not aerodynamic and performed so badly in atmospheric combat that many pilots refused to engage targets in atmosphere; this led to the development of the Authority IRD-A starfighter, which was deployed during atmospheric battles. The IRD-A had a carefully molded fuselage that channeled air through a vector stabilizer, enhancing both maneuverability and speed; it also mounted concussion missiles, making it a tougher opponent than its predecessor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Han Solo's days in the Corporate Sector, Solo and a group of outlaw techs fought against the new Authority IRD-A fighters, defeating them in early model Z-95 Headhunters; this victory was anomalous, however, and other, more successful battles encouraged the Authority to begin a full production run of the IRD-A."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
