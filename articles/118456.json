He was owned by the Bith male Bahima, who was the bartender of the cantina at the time. He was the third serving droid Bahima had owned, as the previous ones had all been destroyed by local thugs. While taking out the cantina's refuse, S-0D3-GE3 discovered the body of Captain Sullio\u2014an officer of the Onderonian military\u2014shortly after she was murdered.

Meanwhile, S-0D3's ruined body was left at the crime scene and picked over by scavengers, who sold some of the parts to 1B-8D-GE3. 1B-8D, a droid owned by local merchant Tolas, traded used droids and droid parts, and readily purchased S-0D3's components as he lacked the ability to comprehend or care whether he bought stolen goods. As a result of S-0D3's destruction, Bahima gave up on droid waiters and replaced S-0D3 with a much less competent human waitress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Meetra Surik, an exile of the Jedi Order visiting Onderon in search for Jedi Master Kavar, began investigating the murder.

The GE3-series programming was geared towards social interaction, and they were highly knowledgeable of the customs and history of multiple species in the galaxy, making S-0D3 well suited in his role as waiter for the Iziz cantina. S-0D3's sensor color was blue-white, while his chassis was silver and blue, and his memory core was located in his head. The droid's voice indicated that masculine programming was installed in the unit. Despite his programming for social interaction, the cantina patron Panar did not consider S-0D3 a very fun individual. S-0D3 took great care with his work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "S-0D3-GE3 appears in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, a roleplaying video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by LucasArts for the Xbox in 2004 and the PC in 2005.
