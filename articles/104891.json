Those plates were sealed to a black temperature control bodysuit via magnatomic gription panels. The bodysuit was also pressurized, offering temporary protection against the vacuum of space, and the body glove protected the clone from the extreme cold and heat. The armor's design was reminiscent of the Mandalorian armor, including the helmet with a distinctive T-shaped visor. Despite its advantages, the Phase I armor proved uncomfortable for the troopers to fit in, which was due to the Kaminoans' unfamiliarity with human ergonomics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the Phase I helmet, a clone trooper had a life support system, a tracking device for monitoring troop movements, and a display screen, which was built into the helmet's viewplate. The helmet also contained a comlink, and a comlink antenna was located in the helmet's crest. A clone could also have attachments to their helmets, such as macrobinoculars, a rangefinder, or a visor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The armorsmiths of Kamino designed Phase I armor after the Mandalorian armor worn by the clone soldiers' template, the bounty hunter Jango Fett. Fett himself gave input on the armor, and it was introduced at the same time as the first batch of clone troopers, which were deployed at the First Battle of Geonosis. Sometime prior to the Battle of Mon Cala, it was gradually replaced by Phase II clone trooper armor, which was more comfortable and capable of supporting more specialized equipment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the DVD audio commentary for Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Dave Filoni noted that, while there were transmitters and receivers in the clone troopers' helmets, having the characters hit the buttons of and hold up wrist-mounted comlinks signaled to the viewer that the characters were speaking with each other."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
