Recognizing that Cymoon 1 and the Imperial Weapons Factory Alpha on the surface was vital, the Empire maintained a strong fleet presence in the Cymoon system, with the battle group remaining there at all times. Landing craft were extensively scanned, with incoming craft having to be scheduled well in advance of arriving, though there was a degree of flexibility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle group's Star Destroyers were supplemented by a score of fighter wings and orbital vessels. On the ground, the factory was protected by a full regiment of stormtroopers and subdivided into battalions. Due to the various number of ad hoc groups, efficacy was reduced due to communications breakdowns between the units."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
