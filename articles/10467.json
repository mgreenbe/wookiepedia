The auction sold several starships including a Theta-class H-2 executive star shuttle, E-wing escort fighters, a Koro-2 all-environment Exodrive airspeeder, and an Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor. The auction was attended by several individuals including Ignacio Wortan, Wick Cooper, Graballa the Hutt, and the Freemakers. The Freemakers were on a mission to procure the Theta star shuttle's embersteel wings, which they needed to build the Arrowhead, a starship capable of turning the tide of the Galactic Civil War. For that mission, Kordi impersonated the Clawdite princess Alo Kortessi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Galactic Empire held an auction on Mygeeto to sell off starships that had been seized from Rebel Alliance sympathizers. Several items were on sale at the auction including a Theta-class H-2 executive star shuttle, E-wing escort fighter, a Koro-2 all-environment Exodrive airspeeder, and an Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor. Needing a pair of embersteel blades to build the Arrowhead, Kordi Freemaker managed to convince the Alliance leadership to loan them 75,000 credits to purchase a Theta-class H-2 executive star shuttle with embersteel wings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The auction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The auction on Mygeeto was attended by several wealthy individuals including Ignacio Wortan, Wick Cooper, and Graballa the Hutt. Graballa wanted to visit the auction in order to recruit investors for his planned beachside resort and buffet. Another guest was the Clawdite princess Alo Kortessi. Taking advantage of the Clawdite shape-shifting ability, Kordi disguised herself as the princess while her brothers Rowan and Zander Freemaker pretended to be her servants. Kordi managed to use her royal status to force the stormtrooper sentries to let her and her entourage inside. When the real Kortessi arrived, the stormtroopers mistook her for an impostor and arrested her instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Per tradition, the nobles lounge in the luxury terrace while their servants carried out the actual bidding. The auction was run by a Cerean manager. In Kordi's absence, Zander was placed in charge of the mission. Zander gave in to his impulses and bidded for the Jedi light interceptor, believing that the ship was worth 30 credits. To his chagrin, Zander learned that the ship was actually worth 30,000 credits, leaving them short of the money needed to purchase the Theta-class shuttle. Meanwhile, Kordi was forced to ward off Graballa's advances. Graballa mistook her for \"Kortessi\" and sought to recruit her as an investor for his beachside resort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unable to return the light interceptor, the Freemakers' situation was complicated further when one of Graballa's bounty hunters Raam accidentally bidded for the Theta-class shuttle. Kordi was furious with Zander while Graballa was furious with Raam and Baash for their incompetence. Kordi later traveled to Graballa's starship Rancor's Fist in an attempt to swap the Jedi light interceptor for the shuttle. Believing that Princess Kortessi's parents were rich, Graballa instead kidnapped her. This led Zander and Rowan to undertake a rescue mission. Kordi managed to free herself by posing as Graballa's business adviser and managed to escape with the help of her brothers. The Freemakers also managed to obtain the shuttle but the Jedi interceptor was lost during a clash with Graballa's leading bounty hunter Dengar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Auction on Mygeeto first appeared as a sub-plot of the LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures Season Two episode \"The Embersteel Blade\", which premiered on August 1, 2017."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
