The Skakoan homeworld's most sacred site, it factored heavily into their complex religion and was the resting place of the Book of the Boolmide, which was kept and read by the Elders. Few were invited to the mounds; chosen individuals who travelled there and read from the book could open the Gates of Grontessiant, a supposedly mythical realm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After losing an eye to Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars, Wat Tambor of the Crimlin clan was summoned to the Power Mounds by the Elders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
