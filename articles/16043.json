While the main walkway to the landing shaft was kept clear for traffic and the transportation of finished products, the former assembly lines were used to support housing. Prefabricated habitation cubes were among the first things Jans Coorsa ordered to be constructed upon the foundry's reactivation. The identical, modest cubes generally contained four rooms, and they rested in long rows along the former assembly lines, and while only a few hundred people lived on the planet, most worked in either of the two factories or the Ferra Sector Shipyard, or are too young or old to do so."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Belts were introduced in the 2016 Fantasy Flight Games adventure book Friends Like These as part of the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
