It was located near Anobis and was originally settled by the Galactic Republic circa 12,000 BBY as an Ordnance/Regional Depot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was primarily known as a former industrial world, where large portions of the planet's surface was covered in immense junkyard fields, which served as the perfect lawless haven for many smugglers, mercenaries and bounty hunters of all stripes. Although a dangerous place, its strategic location on the Celanon Spur between the Expansion Region and the Outer Rim Territories gradually made the planet as the leading commercial hub not only of the Bright Jewel sector, but of the Dohu sector and Qiilura sector as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ord Mantell was known as the \"Heart of the Bright Jewel\", since it orbited the star Bright Jewel at the center of the Bright Jewel system. Two large moons and thirteen other satellites orbited the planet, to which was added the Jubilee Wheel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over 70% of Ord Mantell's surface was covered with pink clouds. The cloud cover was tinged with pink when viewed from the planet's surface. This collection of natural wonders made Ord Mantell something of a tourist attraction, despite its seedier side. It was also the homeworld of the Mantellian Savrips and Mantellian flutterplumes, whose sentience was largely unnoticed or ignored."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ord Mantell's population was clustered in the low mesas and flat plains of the arid equatorial region. Coastal cities, including the capital Worlport, were known for their casinos and touristic attractions. Many spacers regarded this part of Ord Mantell as a safe port, and it attracted almost one billion tourists annually. Other metropolitan areas lacked address markings and were considered not intended for outsiders. The thinking behind this was that if you don't know where you're going, then you don't belong here. Thrill-seekers often visited the planet to participate in savrip-tracking expeditions. The Mantellian savrip could pose as a formidable opponent for even the most seasoned of hunters in Ord Mantell wildlife."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ord Mantell was considered to be in the middle of nowhere but, at the same time, it was located close to some major hyperspace trade routes, making it a thriving port. Futhermore, the planet was known for having clement banking laws and anyone could get a bank account easily. Combination of these factors made the planet very popular among criminal organizations. The planet was famous for its thick, outer cometary cloud, which glowed with a pinkish cast when viewed from space, ensuring its place as the site of the Blockade Runners Derby for nearly 100 years."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Surface"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet had a temperate climate with a variety of different terrain types. The most remarkable were the plateaus peppering the surface, including the Ten Mile Plateau."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The relative closeness of Ord Mantell's two large moons, which could easily be seen during the night and daytime, was responsible for the elevated tidal forces that affected the planet's dynamic landscape: groundquakes were common, which resulted in the planet being volcanically active and almost every landmass being dotted with mountain chains. Sandy beaches were rare, and the coastlines were mostly dominated by cliffs, rocks, and mudflats. Thus, mountains and islands were the distinct features of Ord Mantell's terrain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outside the urban sprawl, the narrow equatorial band of starports, and the volcanic islands, Ord Mantell remained largely rural and low tech. The interior was present with smelters, scrap heaps, and a persistent brown haze from burning fossil fuels. Its extreme reliance on fossil fuels kept the planet quite barren; huge robotic coal yards remained to fuel the planet's cities, and immense junkyard fields, like the Scraplands, littered a large portion of the planetscape."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Environment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since fossil fuels were the predominant energy source throughout most of the Old Republic era, massive amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide were in the Ord Mantellian atmosphere. As a result, Ord Mantell lacked polar icecaps, and the average global temperature was far above the pre-industrial level."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet's polar regions were mostly dominated by a tundra landscape which consisted of many fjords, glaciers and mountains. In turn the tropical and temperate regions of Ord Mantell included the vast majority of its forests, seas, mountain chains and junkyard fields. The large robotic coal yards and factories emitted tons of different gases into the planet's atmosphere, polluting the air of Ord Mantell, especially in the immense junkyard fields of the planet's industrial zones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Discovery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ord Mantell was originally inhabited by the primitive but sentient Savrips. Circa 12,000 BBY, Ord Mantell was settled by Corellian colonists as an advance military and scouting base for the Galactic Republic. Established as an Ordnance/Regional Depot during the Pius Dea Crusades, with many military installations being built around the continent of Worlport, which in the following centuries provided the ground for the planet's capital city and other urban areas. Due to the aggressive nature of the Savrips and the expansionist beliefs of the outsiders, violent conflict arose between the groups almost immediately. The Savrips, outmatched in technology, were ultimately forced to flee into the wilderness of their homeworld. Beginning a propaganda campaign depicting the Savrips as dangerous beasts, the Republic placed bounties on the hides of Savrips which led to their near-extinction due to overhunting. With the Savrip population nearly depleted, the colonists were able to settle into their new home, mostly becoming farmers. Over time, the planet's fauna were driven back, and the world became something of a free port for all manner of freighters and cargo ships. The Republic eventually lost control of the colonists overtime, who embraced their obstinate Corellian attitudes and resisted foreign control."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Old Republic era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ord Mantell was colonized as a an ordinance/regional depot during the Pius Dea Era. Despite the Mantellians' collective refusal to behave as civilized as the Galactic Senate wanted, the planet served as an ordinance/regional depot for centuries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Mandalorian Wars, Ord Mantell was the site of a battle won by the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While never attacked outright during the Great Galactic War, Ord Mantell would become embroiled in scandal during the Cold War between the Republic and the Sith Empire. Several cabinet members were revealed to have accepted bribes by the Empire, causing the Galactic Senate to investigate and detain members of the cabinet on charges of treason. In 3653 BBY, a corrupt admiral sold off the local fleet, causing the Republic military to all but abandoned the planet. The planet became a haven for mercenaries, exiles, murderers and smugglers coming from the Hydian Way who sought out the Republic's military spaceports. Angered with the Republic's response to the cabinet scandal and the fleet's departure, many secessionist movements began to describe a free and independent Ord Mantell that could police its own government. As the cries for succession rose above all other politics, an armed civil war for independence racked the planet. The conflict was primarily focused near the Republic-aligned Fort Garnik in the Avilatan region where the Galactic Republic-backed elected government sought to defeat the Mantellian Separatist Movement through force. Based out of Fort Garnik, Republic and Mantellian troops sought to gain control of the volcano stronghold of the Separatists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this period, corruption ran rampant throughout the Mantellian government and military. Lax ethics among both Republic and Mantellian officers damaged relations with civilians. In the local villages in Avilatan, public perception of the Republic and the Ord Mantell government was very low. Crime syndicates and smugglers utilized such corruption to operate on Ord Mantell freely. Republic and Mantellian officers did little to combat illegal trade, and some encouraged smuggling as a way to expedite shipping. One such crime syndicate, led by Rogun the Butcher, utilized Ord Mantell as a viable shipping depot. Although attempting to restore order, crime syndicates and Galactic Republic military forces destabilized the region as the local government attempted to reclaim the area. Several Republic Special Forces units were dispatched to deal with the crisis. Organized at Fort Garnik, Havoc Squad, led by Harron Tavus, was one such unit. Havoc Squad defected to the Sith Empire on Ord Mantell, stealing a prototype ZR-57 Orbital Strike Bomb."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Separatists were fueled by fanaticism and self-righteous rage, the Republic military eventually overwhelmed the Separatist groups and encouraged them to lay down their arms.

Smugglers and black marketeers startes to establish their activity on the planet in that era. Despite the colonization of the New Territories by the Republic and efforts to create other trading worlds in the region, Ord Mantell remained the most powerful planet in the New Territories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the planet was the site of a battle won by the Jedi during the New Sith Wars, Ord Mantell remained at peace since the time of the Great Galactic War. Despite being considered a shadowport, the world was a profitable member of the Republic. While rarely sending its senators to Coruscant, Ord Mantell maintained its position in the galactic economy through untaxed criminal enterprise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 37 BBY, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi were assigned to investigate a missing cargo ship. The investigation led them to Ord Mantell, where they encountered a ruthless land baron named Taxer Sundown, who controlled much of Ord Mantell's moisture-farming property. The intervention of the Jedi forced Sundown to try and flee Ord Mantell, though the resulting chase ended in a crash that broke Sundown's neck. This led to the discovery of a mind-control device being employed by Sundown, which, in addition to lightsaber-wielding enforcers, had convinced Mantellian farmers that he was a Jedi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the start of the Clone Wars, Jedi Knight Pablo-Jill brought peace to the lawless world. Anakin Skywalker's fleet was ambushed by Separatist forces while making a supply run to the planet. Despite this, the overall lack of Republic presence on the world allowed for Black Sun to control the world and its criminal enterprises. The Shadow Collective seized this as an opportunity when the Clone Wars erupted across the galaxy, enveloping Black Sun and other criminals to amassing a large criminal empire. When the Confederacy of Independent Systems attempted to establish a stronghold on Ord Mantell, Darth Maul led the armies of the Shadow Collective against the droid army, and defeated both Count Dooku and General Grievous, before abandoning the world to the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterward, Ord Mantell became the headquarters of the Republic 8th Sector Army and was used as a weapons storage facility, clone trooper barracks and fleet support by the Grand Army of the Republic and Republic Navy. Despite its prominent and profitable position in the Republic, the Senate still sought to bolster the manufacturing capacity on the planet to raise its tax revenue. Despite increased contributions to the Republic, the windfall was never as great as the Senate planned.

Together with the corrupt government, the syndicates controlled the planet's industry and the tariff prices of incoming and outgoing goods. Since Ord Mantell was located at the junction of the Celanon Spur and Entralla Route, the tariff prices continued to be the main income of the planet's economy, because apart from some manufactured weaponry and foodstuffs, Ord Mantell's industry could offer little of value to export.

As the number of Savrips declined, contact with the colonists became less frequent, and hunters' interest in the world waned. Although the economy of Ord Mantell recovered from these losses, the Savrip population remained low. The absence of strong law enforcement, at least in the Old Republic era, prevented farmers from having an efficient agrarian industry and was the main reason Ord Mantell remained dependent on foreign food supplies, mostly from the agriworld of Anobis.
