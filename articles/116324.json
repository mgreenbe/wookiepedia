While he had no political leanings toward either the Galactic Empire or the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Garnet hated the Empire for making it hard for him to earn a living through their restrictive laws and edicts, and had several run-ins with their military forces and law enforcement agencies.

However, after years of struggle, he was unable to make ends meet under the oppressive regime of the Galactic Empire. While he dreamed of making one large deal and retiring, the truth was that his main expenditure was bribes to Customs Inspectors. Eventually, his operating expenses forced him to take out a loan of 25,000 credits from the crime lord Grappa the Hutt.

Garnet ended up spacing the droid, and vowed to have words with Fuller if he ever ran into him again. Around 1 BBY, Garnet sold several GY-I information analysis droids to the University of Rudrig in the Tion Hegemony. The University paid for the droids using credits from tuition fees and donations, and were also willing to pay a slight markup.

Nagraoao was wounded in the crash, and Garnet attempted to cauterize the Wookiee's wound with his blaster since the bacta tank and all the medical supplies were destroyed in the crash. Nagraoao complained about Garnet's attempt. While piloting the Dorion Discus, Garnet encountered several strange pyramidal ships, and was attacked by them. The resulting damage was so severe that it took him several days to repair, although the fusion generators were left with an odd pinging sound. On the ship's next voyage, Garnet took his Wookiee companion Nagraoao along. The ship encountered a meteor storm, causing more damage to the Dorion Discus. The fusion generator failed, and the two were grateful that the system's magnetic bottle did not follow suit.

He put out a call for fellow smugglers and an expert in droid slicing to assist him in hitting an Espo ordnance depot.

Garnet discovered the stowaway and took a liking to the alien, especially his singing. The smuggler nicknamed Yowza \"Furball,\" and the Yuzzum helped Garnet out by performing menial chores around the ship such as cooking and cleaning, all the while learning Basic. During a layover on the moon Nar Shaddaa, in Hutt Space, Yowza wandered away from the ship and was attracted to the music emanating from a local tapcafe called Uncle Chesko's, which was being performed by Evar Orbus and His Galactic Jizz-Wailers.

An altercation occurred on the vessel, pitting Garnet against the Imperial crew and causing the bathysphere to lose control and plunge deeper into the gas giant. Garnet managed to subdue all but one Imperial, and the two wrestled for control of the vessel. The Imperial elbowed Garnet away from the wheel, gaining the upper hand, and arrested their descent while attempting to stabilize the bathysphere. Garnet wrenched control of the bathysphere back from the Imperial when he noticed a gray, flying life form above them, and avoided a collision by centimeters. Suddenly, the bathysphere's repulsorlift engines failed, exposing Garnet and the Imperial to the full gravity of the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Imperial was stunned and believed that they were doomed, he directed Garnet to the craft's repulsors at the smuggler's insistence.

As the Socorran approached the bathysphere's control cabin, he heard the Imperial change the setting on his blaster. Realizing the temporary truce that had manifested itself during the stabilization of the bathysphere was over, Garnet drew his own weapon and leapt through the doorway firing.

The Regina Cayli, an M-class Imperial Attack Transport, was dispatched to investigate the crash. Deploying stormtroopers, they discovered Carrow, and proceeded to wound and capture him, taking him back to the Regina Cayli. Garnet subsequently infiltrated the vessel through an open and unguarded landing ramp, freeing his co-pilot from the ship's infirmary. Escaping from the ship, Garnet and Carrow had to figure out a way off the planet as the Dorion Discus had been disabled in the crash, and they were certain that more stormtroopers would be waiting for them at the crash site.

Farseeker advised caution, and Dree made it clear that if the Imperials caught him aboard the Dorion Discus, then he would see to it that Garnet would suffer. Jill recommended hiding Dree by dangling him out of an airlock tethered to the ship. Dree dismissed the idea and headed to the gunnery bay while Garnet attempted to bluff the Assessor, claiming that they were carrying a priority cargo bound for the Imperial base on Markon IV. The Assessor's crew did not believe Garnet and started firing at the Dorion Discus; Garnet evaded the incoming fire long enough for Farseeker to plot a course and jump to lightspeed, although the customs frigate managed to score a grazing hit. While on a planet with strict weapons restrictions, Garnet was asked by an Imperial bureaucrat if he had a permit for the sidearm he was carrying. The Socorran was unaware of any need for a permit, which was required to stop traders joyriding and targeting the native population.
