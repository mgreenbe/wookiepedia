A vain man, Hekis soon began adding a new, grandiose title to his name whenever he felt unappreciated by his superiors, increasing the apparent importance of his own signature. His droid, 3D-4X, delivered his master's afternoon Stim tea on schedule, along with a datapad containing production data, on the day IG-88A arrived. While the Human sipped his tea, 3D-4X delivered a blaster shot which quickly killed the Administrator, on orders from IG-88 to leave no organic life on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
