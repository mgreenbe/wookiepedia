Like the other Invid gangs, they were based on Courkrus in 11 ABY, though it can be speculated that prior to this arrangement they may have staged out of Nal Hutta. A pair of LazerLords were the first pirates attacked by Corran Horn in his \"Ghost Jedi\" guise as they attempted to force themselves onto a native woman; following this attack and other dramatic displays by the Jedi, their ranks were severely depleted by desertion. After the demise of Shala the Hutt and the reassurances of Tavira that the problem would be dealt with, the remaining LazerLords began negotiating a merger with the Red Nova crew, who also had become too small to operate effectively."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
