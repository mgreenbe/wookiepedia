R-3 held a position in the bureaucracy of the Republic, and in 3637 BBY, he was about to acquire a communique from a prominent Imperial figure to a Republic captain and reported his impending acquisition to the Shroud. However, before he could acquire the message, R-3 was framed for accepting bribes from constituents and was thus arrested by the Senate Guard, and the asset's death prompted the Shroud to send Asset R-10 to investigate. The Shroud initially assumed a possible defection by the Imperial, but later evidence pointed to the Order of Revan's agents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
