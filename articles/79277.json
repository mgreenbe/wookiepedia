The mine was designed to be detonated by a secret comm code, which could also be used to disable it for removal. In an embarrassing incident on the Imperial world of Calonica, a spot inspection of the more than 50,000 LX-2 mines buried around the capital found over 90 percent of them had been rendered harmless. Alliance to Restore the Republic spies had discovered the secret code and used it to disable the mines, removed their explosive charges, and put the mines back in the ground. This incident resulted in the production of the LX-4 proton mine, which could not be disarmed except through detonation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
