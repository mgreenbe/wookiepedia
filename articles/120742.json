The ritual would result in the Vunakunians' foreheads and cheeks being covered with protuberant scars and ritual drawings. A Vunakunian's caste could be determined based on the configuration of the scarring across their head. This ceremony caused a level of suffering past the Vunakunian's pain resistance thresholds, resulting in brave people, capable of resisting extreme situations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vunakunian Republic Colonel Kohn Doil went through the scarification ceremony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
