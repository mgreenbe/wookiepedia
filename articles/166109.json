As the image lacks the ten quad laser cannons of the larger cruiser (having an armament consistent with the Vengeance), and possesses the blocky cockpit design distinct to the YV-series, it is safe to say that the image was misplaced in the sourcebook - especially as the image is not definitively tied to an info or stat block, and is simply free standing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
