After being hounded by the Exchange for their cut of the profits, Lupo found a way to fix the races and keep every last credit: by going \"legit.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He commissioned an Aqualish droid dealer named Kodin to create a droid that could pilot a swoop bike better than any sentient ever could. With a droid's body, his new pilot could withstand much greater trauma than flesh-and-blood organics, and all of the weighty safety features could be removed from the swoop bike. Even the Hutts were unable to discover a loophole in this arrangement, thanks to the Exchange's rather strict rules concerning \"legality\" and business enterprises."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because it was no longer the Exchange's racer anyway, Lupo pulled out from his dealings with them altogether.
