Like its owner, who belonged to a splinter sect of the Jedi Order, that lightsaber was unorthodox, as its blade emitter was pierced with holes through which smaller, spike-like secondary blades were projected, forming a star-shaped collar at the basis of the primary blade. It was utilized by Chelli Lona Aphra to defend herself against and destroy the original droid body of Eternal Rur, and later by Eternal Rur itself in a new body in conjunction with another, more traditional blue lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
