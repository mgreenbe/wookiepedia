A group of Alliance to Restore the Republic operatives tries to meet with Fandar to enlist his services in harassing Imperial shipping. Fandar held no interest in politics, and the Alliance wasn't offering the kind of money he wanted, but he struck a deal; if they helped to raid an Imperial treasure ship he would discuss future dealings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alliance High Command approved the endeavour, but during the raid, Fandar was betrayed by his own second-in-command when the treasure ship turned out to be full of soldiers rather than treasure. Fandar and the Rebels escaped the Imperial trap, and Fandar initially thought the Rebels had sold him out. When he discovered his own lieutenant had betrayed him, Fandar thanked the Rebels for their assistance, renounced his piratical ways, and joined the Alliance Fleet as a Captain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
