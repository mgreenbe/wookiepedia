In this way, botanists spent much of their time on Ithor and other tropical planets; meteorologists spent their time studying the gas planets and cloud storms on Bespin; historians would visit the ruins of Ossus; and political students had jobs as government functionaries on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the university's provost was Dalus Othona and its dean was Halcor Raystel; the latter was eventually removed after a three-month scandal when it became known that he was a ryll user and had offered class credits to two female students in exchange for sexual favors.
