Capable of being tailored to numerous species, Repli-Limb prostheses range from not only hands, arms, and legs, but also includes eyes, ears, hearts, and lungs. Additionally the prostheses themselves could be upgraded many times, enabling the prosthetic to function far more effectively than the organ that was lost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prosthetic limbs were frequently capable of being covered with synthflesh to disguise their artificial nature."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
