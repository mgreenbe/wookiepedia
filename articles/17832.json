Power packs for rifles (such as the E-11) typically carried enough tibanna and electricity for one hundred shots. Alternatively, plasma packs of the same size could power a blaster for up to five hundred shots, although with a slight decrease in the accuracy and cooling power of the weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
