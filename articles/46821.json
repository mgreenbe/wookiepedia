Around 5 ABY, the fighter wing fought a New Republic battle group at the Cerberon system. Falshoi took part in the attack, which saw the devastation of the battle group's naval forces above the planet Troithe. With the 204th's Imperial II-class Star Destroyer having been lost, the TIE/ln space superiority starfighters and TIE/sa bombers of the 204th were ordered by Colonel Soran Keize to attack New Republic positions on the surface of Troithe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Falshoi soon landed her TIE at Troithe's Raddakkia Plaza, which the fighter wing used as a staging ground to repair and refuel their fighters. Her injuries from the prior fighting required her to wear a sling for her arm. After Second Lieutenant Commander Teso Broosh and his squadron, Squadron Five, made a supply run and set up a makeshift galley, Falshoi approached Keize and offered to get food for him. The colonel accepted the lieutenant's offer and thanked her for it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Falshoi appeared in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
