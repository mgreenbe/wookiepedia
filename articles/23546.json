The virus had relatively stable structure, and those afflicted by it generally developed an immunity, allowing the virus to strike only once in a lifetime. Moreover, it could be prevented through the use of vaccines. Around the time of the Bacta War, a similar virus haunted the inhabitants of Halanit, except that the virus mutated at such a rate that it was impossible to prevent using vaccines and would strike the same individual more than once."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
