The cantina, according to the droid that tended its bar, served food and drinks from a wide variety of worlds, possessed a pazaak room, hosted a swoop track, and, as its centerpiece, a stage that was frequented by Bith musicians and Twi'lek dancers. During this time the patrons enjoyed the music, that several thousand years later would be played by a band in one of the cantinas of Tatooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her stay on Citadel Station, the Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik, visited the cantina at least twice.
