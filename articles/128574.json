The weapon could be fired in two modes, the first of which released a cone shaped sonic blast that at point blank range spanned half a meters, but spread to three meters wide at its maximum width over the rifle's thirty meter range. The second mode released a debilitating sonic wail which stunned targets, although the frequency of the wail had to be recalibrated to affect different species due to their different physiologies. The weapons design included a grip located underneath the body of the weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SonoMax 100 sound rifle was a weapon designed for riot control by its makers, the arms manufacture SonoMax. The rifles were used by the Security Police in the Corporate Sector of the galaxy, as the Corporate Sector Authority technically owned everything located within the sector, and so preferred the use of weapons that caused no property damage. Members of the Security Police were not affected by the wail setting of the gun at all, as their helmets had integral sound-proofing. Despite the SonoMax 100 not being available for public sale, the Tolanese bounty hunter Var'Rotha Fin'Rotha used one when he attacked the Broken Tusk cantina on the planet Reuss VI during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SonoMax 100 was first shown in the Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook, a supplement written by Michael Allen Horne and released in 1993 for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game by West End Games.
