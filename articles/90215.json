These privateers flew specially modified Hawks that could outperform most regulation Imperial fighters, including the TIE/LN starfighter. Millennium's next delevopment was the Millennium fighter, a larger and slower craft capable of carrying greater paloads."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Intending to stamp out contraband traffic, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin arranged an official visit to the Millennium Astro-Engineering plant to buy a small, fast, and hard-hitting ship that could outrun the Millennium Hawk. A week later, Tarkin and an Imperial delegation arrived at the plant, where its direct and chief salesman Zoltan Starkid presented them with the Millennium fighter, which the Grand Moff immediately dismissed. Alternatively, Starkid presented them with Millennium's latest prototype, the Millennium Falcon, which exactly suited Tarkin's requirements, complete with unique hyperdrive capability. The Grand Moff purchased it, intending for Imperial engineers to modify it before sending it back to Millennium for production."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
