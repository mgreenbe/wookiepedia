She noted her initial impressions in a scouting log entry from orbit and soon landed on the planet's surface. The Gigoran then hiked to the nearest entrance of a large subterranean cavern nearby that her terrain mapper had identified."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Among the fallen"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Purpruff discovered that the cavern was spacious enough to house freighters inside and tested the structural integrity by detonating a sticky mine on a stalactite, which did not even shudder during the explosion. The corporal's life-form scanner then led her to a tauntaun herd in the cavern, of which she captured a surveillance image at five times zoom before feeding the creatures a ration stick by hand. Purpruff then compiled her findings into a report that recommended Hoth as a suitable location for a base. The report reached Colonel Anna Seertay, who sent it on to the head of Special Forces, General Pitt Onoran. It was also added to The Rebel Files, a collection of physical documents maintained by the archivist Hendri Underholt that tracked the history of the Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance ultimately chose to follow Purpruff's recommendation and constructed Echo Base on Hoth as its new headquarters. In 3 ABY, the Empire discovered and attacked Echo Base, forcing the Alliance to swiftly evacuate. Most of the Alliance forces escaped, but Purpruff was among those killed during the battle. In 34 ABY, Ematt saw Purpruff's report in The Rebel Files after they fell into the hands of the Resistance. Ematt annotated it with a note saying that he had known the Gigoran and that he had seen her name listed among the fallen at Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Gigoran, Purpruff's tolerance for cold temperatures was far higher than that of humans. As such, she considered the freezing temperatures of Hoth to be merely brisk. The corporal enjoyed the tingle of the planet's clean air in her nostrils upon first landing.
