He served with Clone Commander CC-1004, another clone commander in the 41st, who at some point during the War introduced him to the writings of Wilhuff Tarkin, a captain in the Republic Navy. Unlike most clones, he did not consider his Jedi General to be an omnipotent warrior, and Etain liked and respected him for that."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gett was the commanding officer of the Acclamator-class assault ship Fearless one year after the Battle of Geonosis.

Several Jedi on Kashyyyk were successfully killed, along with many others across the galaxy, but Gett learned that Yoda had escaped, killing Gree in the process and turning the Wookiees against the Republic. After several days of fighting their former Wookiee allies, Gett and the 41st established peace on Kashyyyk, and were then reformed into the 41st Stormtrooper Legion in service to the new Galactic Empire. In 15 BBY, Gett held the rank of Stormtrooper commander and gave a orientation seminar to a group of Imperial cadets, in which he spoke about his experience at Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gett is the Mando'a word for \"nut.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
