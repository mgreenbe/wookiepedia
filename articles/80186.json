Soon though, she took an interest in Atin. It is not known for certain if she continued working in Qibbu's Hut but it seems likely that, after Kal Skirata rented her an apartment, she would have left her old job. During this time she was still very wary of unexpected visitors, prompting Kal to advise Jedi Knight Bardan Jusik to call ahead before arriving."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan gave birth to Venku Skirata, she acted as the baby's caretaker along with Besany Wennen and Jusik.
