They lived only beneath sands of the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban, and were attracted to Force-sensitives. They would stalk and swarm their prey in the darkness. The bug's attunement to the Force allowed them to determine if a creature was suitable prey, as Darth Bane found when exploring the Valley, in which they found he was too powerful and did not attack. The barbs were used in training sabers at the Sith Academy because of the toxin's effects, which mimicked the effects of losing a limb to a lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Pelko\" means \"fear\" in Finnish."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
