It was often found on space stations or military bases to coordinate multiple weapon systems at once, whether to accurately track individual targets or coordinate fire on a single target. The system also improved the targeting ability of any gunners using a weapon system controlled by the 3K40, with an upgrade package which doubled its efficiency."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
