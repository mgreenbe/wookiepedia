His past was full of devoted service to the Chief Councilor. He had a perfect memory, likened to a protocol droid's ability to retain information. He was present when Tolokai, her Gotal bodyguard, attacked her under the influence of the brainwashing of Warlord Zsinj's Project Funeral. Malan fell with a vibroblade to his chest, but succeeded in forcing Tolokai down the stairs in a fatal fall that broke the assailant's neck."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
