Commissioned by Prince Xizor, the droid proved to be a failure when the assassin, Kaird, was able to detect the unit's imperfections; upon tactile contact with the Nediji, the droid proceeded to dissolve into a pile of goo. As if to add insult to injury, not long after this disastrous test it was discovered that the HRD's creators had been slaughtered wholesale by a group of Feral Droids, who had also taken the effort to smash the lab's equipment to uselessness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
