The Imperials pretended to cooperate, but only long enough for a detachment of troopers to surround and attack B'karitz and the Rebel operatives he was with. The besieged group was able to break through the encircling forces and make their way to the Rebels' ship, from which B'karitz was able to summon aid from other Schenor nobles. The Imperials attempted to flee, but the Rebels were able to disable and board the ambassador's cruiser, returning the ambassador to the planet for local judicial action."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
