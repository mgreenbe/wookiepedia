He was captured by the Galactic Republic along with 49 other of the most dangerous criminals on M'Bardi and would be shipped to Coruscant. While being guarded by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his padawan Ahsoka Tano, the cruiser was attacked by Separatists under the command of General Grievous. The cruiser's main reactor was damaged, causing the prison cells to open. While the Jedi were trying to keep the prisoners contained and under controll, the crew tried to repair the reactor until they ultimately failed. Knowing that the ship was going to be destroyed very soon, Nomag was among the prisoners to cooperate with the Jedi and helped repair the ship, allowing it to move safely through Republic space. Skywalker thanked the prisoners for helping and guaranteed their aid will affect their parole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
