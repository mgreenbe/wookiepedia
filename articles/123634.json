A clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, Shadow Seven was born on the planet Kamino. In 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic learned about the Malevolence, a Subjugator-class heavy cruiser, after the battleship had destroyed a task force in the Abregado system. Jedi General Anakin Skywalker devised a plan to stop the Malevolence, which possessed twin ion cannons capable of neutralizing the power of enemy starships. After the Confederate cruiser, commanded by General Grievous, destroyed a Republic medical convoy in the Ryndellia system, Skywalker assumed that the Malevolence was on its way to the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, where over 60,000 wounded clone troopers were being treated. Skywalker, together with his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, and Jedi Master Plo Koon, would lead Shadow Squadron, including Shadow Seven, to a shortcut through the Kaliida Nebula in order to arrive at the medcenter before the Malevolence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piloting recently-acquired BTL Y-wing starfighters, Shadow Seven and his fellow pilots departed from the Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute. Before jumping to hyperspace, Skywalker contacted all pilots, who checked in with the General. Shadow Squadron eventually emerged from hyperspace, and the Jedi Knight led the unit in to the Kaliida Nebula. Skywalker, however, was unaware of the space neebrays inhabiting the nebula, but the squadron was able to evade the massive creatures without taking any casualties. Shadow Seven and the rest of Shadow Squadron piloted their bombers out from the nebula, arriving at the Kaliida Shoals Medical center. However, the Malevolence emerged from hyperspace and approached the medical station, and Skywalker led the squadron toward the battleship. Several Vulture droid starfighters were launched from the Malevolence to engage the approaching Republic starfighters, and Grievous ordered the crew of the ship to fire one of the ion cannons despite the Confederate starfighter presence. As the ion ray approached Shadow Squadron, the squadron took evasive action to evade the ray. However, Shadow Seven was unable to pilot his Y-wing starfighter away in time. His fighter was left disabled in space, while the remains of the squadron continued its attack on the Malevolence, eventually crippling its starboard ion cannon. The cruiser retreated from the battle, sparing the Kaliida Shoals medical center from destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Malevolence fired one of its ion cannons toward Shadow Squadron during the Battle of the Kaliida Nebula, Shadow Seven was unable to evade the ion ray in time, leaving his starfighter disabled in space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shadow Seven first appeared in \"Shadow of Malevolence,\" an episode in the first season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, which aired on October 10, 2008.
