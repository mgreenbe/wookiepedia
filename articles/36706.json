One of the twenty-five squads that comprised Arca Company of the Commando Group Zero Five Commando in the Grand Army's Special Operations Brigade, Delta Squad took their orders from the Director of Special Forces, Jedi General Arligan Zey, along with Zey's former Padawan, Bardan Jusik for much of the war, and then from Jusik's replacement, Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan.

The squad would be tasked with locating the Kaminoan defector Ko Sai, though their search would turn up nothing but the scientist's severed head. Delta Squad would again prove invaluable to the Republic in the lead up to the Battle of Kashyyyk, where they were able to rescue the Wookiee chieftain Tarfful from his Trandoshan slaver captors, defend Wookiee villages from Separatist battle droids, and even destroy a Recusant-class light destroyer. However, it was on Kashyyyk that Delta Squad would be forced to abandon one of their own, the commando known as Sev, when he came under fire and the squad received orders from Jedi Grand Master Yoda himself to immediately pull out. Delta Squad would go on to serve the newly-formed Galactic Empire as part of the 501st Legion's Imperial Commando Special Unit, where they were given a replacement for Sev, and tasked with hunting down Jedi who had escaped Order 66, along with clone deserters, Jedi sympathizers, and other Imperial dissidents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Youth and training"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The four members of Delta Squad were born in the cloning facilities of Tipoca City on the planet of Kamino.

Hand-picked by Jango Fett himself, Vau believed that in order for his commandos to survive in combat, he must train them as harshly as possible\u2014to do anything less would compromise their training. Seen as brutal by many, including his fellow Cuy'val Dar training sergeants, Vau's practices made Delta Squad an aggressive, but supremely efficient unit and they were truly grateful toward the man for making them into survivors. Vau took great pride in his squads' consistently high performance, both in live-fire exercises on Kamino and later during their deployment in the Clone Wars. During their training, the four commandos adopted names to go along with their formal numerical designations. RC-1138, the squad's sergeant, became known as \"Boss\", while RC-1140 took on the name \"Fixer\". RC-1262 earned himself the nickname of \"Scorch\", following an incident with explosive ordnance that left both 62 and Sergeant Vau without eyebrows for a period of time, and RC-1207 became known as \"Sev\", short for his designation's final digit, seven."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Geonosis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Delta Squad's intensive training on Kamino would come to an end in the year 22 BBY.

His Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala would attempt to rescue Kenobi, but would fail and instead join him in captivity. While Jedi Master Mace Windu moved with a Jedi strike team to rescue the three captives, Grand Master Yoda traveled to Kamino to see the recently discovered Grand Army for himself. The Grand Army, and Delta Squad with it, would be sent to Geonosis in a deployment so hastily ordered and carried out that it would leave Delta with no time to say goodbye to their training sergeant, Vau.

Once on the ground, Delta Squad's sergeant, Boss, was called upon to destroy an armored bunker on his way to rendezvous with the other members of his squad, a task he completed utilizing a thermal detonator. Upon the reunion of the four commandos, Delta Squad attacked Sun Fac in his command center, although the Geonosian leader would manage to escape. Delta would track Fac through the Geonosian catacombs, eventually catching up with him in Fac's private hangar as the Geonosian attempted to escape in his starfighter. Fac's escape was prevented by the timely actions of Delta Squad's sniper, Sev, who used the sniping attachment of his DC-17m blaster rifle to shoot down the starfighter, killing Fac. While in the hangar, Delta Squad would also witness the departure of General Grievous' personal starfighter, Soulless One, although they were unable to recognize it for what it was at the time. While hunting for Sun Fac, Delta Squad had engaged a number of spider droids while their fellow Republic commando unit, Theta Squad, blew through a door in the catacombs. Once the door was down, Delta was given leave to enter and fire on the Geonosians inside, while Theta moved off to destroy a droid factory. Once Sun Fac was dead, Delta Squad was informed via their advisor that Theta Squad had failed in their objective; three of the four commandos had been killed, leaving RC-1136 the only survivor.

Deployed in a nearby canyon from a LAAT/i gunship piloted by clone pilot Delta 42, Delta Squad was quickly ambushed by Geonosian forces. Though outnumbered, they soon came upon a downed gunship and two clone troopers; though the troopers would fall to the Geonosians, Delta Squad was able to commandeer one of the gunship's turbolaser bubble-turrets in order to fend off the enemy. As they continued toward the Core Ship, the squad was called upon to take out an anti-aircraft cannon. Delta fought through a number of B1-Series battle droids and super battle droids, before finally destroying the large anti-aircraft emplacement. When the squad finally reached the Core Ship, they were met with resistance from an advanced spider droid, and a ray shield blocking the ship's entrance. The four commandos were able to destroy the spider droid with considerable effort\u2014with Boss making note of his desire never to have to engage one again\u2014and they then called in air-support from Delta 42's gunship to blow through the ray shielded entrance. Once inside, Delta Squad split up, each of its members tasked with sabotaging and destroying various crucial systems. Scorch and Fixer came under heavy fire from a small number of droidekas, but Boss and Sev were able to rescue them without incident. Their primary objective was the capture of vital launch codes housed on the ship's bridge. On the bridge, Delta came under heavy fire from numerous battle droids and stationary autoturrets, but still managed to acquire the codes before retreating down a branching corridor. By this point in time, the squad's efforts to sabotage the Core Ship had come to full fruition, with several primary systems overloading. With no time to make an escape back the way they had come, Delta Squad was extracted via LAAT/i gunship through a hole forcefully blown in the hull the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Delta Squad's actions in retrieving the Core Ship's launch codes would allow the Republic to hault the evacuation of several other fleeing ships.

Three hundred and sixty-seven days into the war, now in the year 21 BBY, Delta Squad was called upon to investigate the derelict Acclamator-class assault ship, Prosecutor. Having recently reappeared in the Chaykin cluster following a two-week-long disappearance while tasked with defending trade routes in the Corellian sector, the Prosecutor was found drifting without power and unresponsive to communication attempts. Delta Squad had spent a substantial amount of time aboard the capital ship during the early portion of the war, even coming to think of it as their \"first home\". They were specifically chosen for the mission due to the impact their actions on Geonosis had on an individual higher up the Republic chain of command. Arriving on scene in the Corbantis system aboard a CR25 troop carrier, Delta Squad was tasked with retrieving flight records from the Prosecutor's four data cores and securing the derelict assault ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The four members of Delta Squad disembarked from the CR25 via a jump through the vacuum of space, splitting up and entering the Prosecutor at four different locations\u2014Boss entered the assault ship through one of its torpedo launch tubes.

While searching through the ship, Delta Squad came across few survivors, and several members were set upon by scavenger droids, including Scorch, who was ambushed and incapacitated by the droids. Shortly after, the squad found that the Prosecutor has been attacked by Trandoshan slavers and mercenaries when Sev was captured at the starboard data core, and Boss forced to flee into the ship's maintenance shafts. Boss and Fixer were able to complete their original objectives, battling through heavily armed and armored Trandoshan mercenaries and the ship's very own autoturret defenses that had been sliced by the Trandoshans, before rendezvousing and proceeding to rescue Sev. Once Sev was free of the violent interrogation from his Trandoshan captors, the incomplete squad moved to retrieve Scorch from where he was being held in the Prosecutor's detention area. After a brief skirmish in the detention area, Delta Squad was able to locate and revive an incapacitated Scorch, and together make their way to the bridge where they destroyed a Confederacy jamming device and re-established communication with their advisor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After scanning the assault ship, CC-01/425 was able to determine that a Trandoshan dropship had touched down in one of the Prosecutor's hangar bays. Delta Squad proceeded to head toward the hangar, but a booby-trapped turbolift left Delta stuck back in the ship's detention area and under attack by Trandoshan mercenaries. Repairing the cell block's damaged systems, Delta Squad was able to trigger the detention area into lockdown, flooding the area with noxious gas that neutralized the Trandoshans while sparing the commandos who were safe inside their sealed Katarn-class armor. The squad escaped the locked-down detention area into a garbage pit, and moved on to the hangar where they successfully used the Trandoshans' own rocket turret to destroy the dropship. Unfortunately for the commandos of Delta Squad, a Lucrehulk-class battleship had entered the system and was rapidly approaching the Prosecutor. While their advisor called for assistance, Delta Squad was charged with repelling the droid boarding parties and sealing the assault ship's hangars. By the time Delta Squad reached the final hangar, it was heavily overrun with droids and therefore the commandos commandeered the roof-mounted mass-driver cannon of an AT-TE walker to deal with the overwhelming droid threat. Although the Confederacy had initially been interested in obtaining the Republic warship from the Trandoshans in exchange for battle droids, following these losses, the battleship instead opened fire on the Prosecutor, intent on destroying it before reinforcements could arrive. In an attempt to hold off the battleship, Delta Squad struggled to get the Prosecutor's turbolaser battery array back online amidst a continuing assault from droid forces already onboard. Reinforcements would come in the form of Republic Navy Captain Talbot and the RAS Arrestor, the only Republic force to respond to CC-01/425's calls for assistance. Between the combined strength of the Arrestor and Prosecutor\u2014even as the latter's hull integrity was compromised\u2014the Conferacy droid control ship was destroyed, shutting down the battle droids aboard the Prosecutor, and saving both the ship and the lives of Delta Squad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For their actions aboard the Prosecutor, Delta Squad would be commended by High Jedi General Mace Windu, and the data gathered by the commandos would help the Wookiees to curb the efforts of Trandoshan slavers in the Kashyyyk system."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rescue of Omega Squad"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Delta Squad departed the Prosecutor aboard a stolen, unarmed Neimoidian vessel, and shortly thereafter received a Red Zero signal\u2014the GAR code requesting immediate extraction from another commando unit, Omega Squad, in the Tynna sector. Omega was trapped aboard a damaged freighter at the Corellian\u2013Perlemian hyperspace intersection, with no power, limited oxygen, and a trio of prisoners suspected of terrorist activity, which they had captured during an earlier Traffic Interdiction Operation. With no other Republic forces close enough to provide the much-needed assistance, Delta Squad took it upon themselves to respond, and arrived first on the scene. As Scorch began rescue operations, a Separatist ship of Neimoidian manufacture arrived a short distance away. Before the enemy ship could open fire on the stranded commandos, the timely arrival of the RAS Fearless from hyperspace, also responding to Omega Squad's Red Zero, brought about the destruction of the Separatist craft via a pair of hastily-fired missiles. Delta Squad was then able to successfully complete the extraction of Omega Squad and the prisoners, with Scorch cutting through the freighter's forward viewport and attaching a docking tube from their vessel to the freighter to allow for cross-decking. During their brief time together aboard Delta's stolen ship, Sev provoked Omega Squad member Atin into a confrontation that nearly came to blows, a confrontation over their shared history as commandos both trained by Walon Vau. The fight was broken up by Omega Squad's sergeant, Niner, before any punches could be thrown. Both commando squads docked aboard Fearless, though while Omega was reunited with their old friend Jedi General Etain Tur-Mukan, Delta Squad moved off together into an isolated corner of the hangar deck where they could talk amongst themselves during the journey back to Arca Company Barracks on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Anti-terror operations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon setting down on Coruscant, Delta Squad disembarked from Fearless along with Omega, and were met by former Cuy'val Dar training sergeant, and now military advisor to Special Operations Brigade, Kal Skirata.

Once they were finished\u2014although Skirata teased that they had only completed forty of the fifty he'd assigned\u2014Delta helped Omega offload the three prisoners into a waiting speeder piloted by Skirata's Wookiee associate, Enacca, bound for interrogation at the hands of Delta's former training sergeant, Walon Vau. A transport arrived soon after to take Delta and Omega back to Arca Barracks. At 1500 hours, Delta met with Skirata and Omega Squad in one of Special Operations Brigade Headquarters' briefing rooms, where Skirata attempted to ease the tension between the two squads, insisting that Atin and Sev leave behind their grudge and shake hands.

Over the following days, members of Delta Squad would take part in a rotating surveillance watch with the members of Omega, and despite conflicts between members of the two squads where their distinct personalities clashed, the two squads worked together effectively and even came to develop a respect for one another. Together, they managed to root out a traitor in the Grand Army's logistics center, who was attempting to meet with a Falleen contact. Using Qibbu's criminal contacts, the strike team was able to lure their terrorist targets under the pretense of having a supply of five-hundred-grade thermal plastoid explosive that they were willing to sell. While Skirata acted as the strike team's public face, meeting with members of the terror cell\u2014including its leader, Perrive\u2014Sev and Scorch teamed with Omega Squad's Darman and Fi to mark the terrorists with specially designed tracers with Skirata's personally owned Verpine sniper rifles. When the terrorists\u2014now identified as hailing from Jabiim via their accents\u2014took the explosive sample to be tested, Sev and Scorch returned to Qibbu's with the rest of the strike team.

Fortunately, the new location for the trade was a CoruFresh produce distribution depot in Quadrant F-76 of Galactic City, a location Delta Squad had personally reconnoitered previously.

Delta completed their assignments as ordered, but instead of exfiltrating as they were supposed to, the commandos instead decided to assist their former training sergeant Vau in his personal mission, one that consisted of robbing Mygeeto's own Dressian Kiolsh Merchant Bank. While Fixer held position near the squad's snowspeeder on the planet's surface, the remaining three members of Delta followed Vau into the underground halls of the bank, where Scorch proceeded to electronically disable the locks on the main vault's door. Once inside, however, Vau refused to allow the squad to assist him any further in the heist, determined not to compromise his trainees' integrity by directly involving them in the actual act of stealing. It was during Vau's raid on the vault's numerous safety deposit boxes that Delta Squad learned of their former training sergeant's past as a disinherited aristocrat from Irmenu, and that the purpose of the theft was to regain the inheritance his mother and father had denied him.

During the skirmish, Vau fell through a hole in the ice and into one of the countless crystal-worm tunnels that ran beneath the frozen surface of Mygeeto; although Delta Squad was determined to retrieve him, Vau forcefully commanded them to leave him and get themselves to safety. Despite severe reservations, Delta Squad did as ordered and exfiltrated from Mygeeto, although each would have some difficulty coming to terms with their perceived abandonment of their former sergeant, none more so than Sev. However, Boss contacted Kal Skirata and Null Captain Ordo once they were off planet to inform them of Vau's situation at the behest of General Jusik; Skirata and Ordo immediately traveled to Mygeeto and managed to extract a hypothermic but still alive Vau from beneath the Mygeetan ice."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hunting Ko Sai"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon their return to Coruscant from Mygeeto, Delta Squad was debriefed by General Zey in his office within Special Operations Brigade Headquarters.

Considering her capture as near a priority as locating the Confederacy's Supreme Commander, General Grievous\u2014if only to deny her expertise to the Separatists, but primarily so as to have an experienced cloner unassociated with Tipoca under Republic control\u2014Palpatine insisted that Zey put his most qualified squad on the assignment, from which Zey selected Delta Squad for the task. Ko Sai had gone missing during the Battle of Kamino, and was suspected to have defected to the Confederacy by Kamino's Prime Minister, Lama Su. Despite the length of time between her disappearance and Delta Squad's tasking of her retrieval, Kaminoan intelligence was able to track Ko Sai's movements to the planet Vaynai. Zey would insist that Delta Squad not inform Kal Skirata of their assignment, knowing of the Mandalorian's extreme hate for Kaminoans.

The next day, they would again be present as Vau delivered a report to Zey in which he insinuated that although the culprit delving into the Republic Treasury system had turned out not to be Skirata, Vau had forcefully persuaded Skirata not to cause any more further trouble.

Tarfful had spent years combating Trandoshan slaving parties, and without him the Wookiees turned to the Republic for assistance.

Battling their way inside, the squad was ambushed in a narrow corridor by Trandoshan mercenaries on the overhead catwalks, forcing them to make an escape through a maintenance shaft toward a landing zone. After securing the landing zone, the commandos caught a glimpse of a Belbullab-22 starfighter, matching its profile to General Grievous' ship, Soulless One. Continuing through the slaver's base, Delta freed a number of imprisoned Wookiees on their way to locate Tarfful before Delta's advisor tasked the squad with another objective: confirming Grievous' presence on Kashyyyk. Climbing a tower close to the General's landing pad, Delta managed a visual confirmation on the General himself, before nearly being attacked by one of Grievous' IG-100 MagnaGuards. Rushing down the tower, Delta Squad found Tarfful being escorted to Grievous' fighter by two MagnaGuards; although Tarfful was able to successfully destroy the droids on his own, Grievous fled the planet in his starfighter, leaving behind another pair of MagnaGuards. Though Grievous had initially wanted the Wookiee chieftain alive for questioning, once denied of that opportunity, the commander of the Separatist Droid Army instead ordered Tarfful dead so as to deny the Republic the valuable intelligence Tarfful possessed. Delta Squad engaged the deadly droids in an effort to protect Tarfful, although the Wookiee warrior refused to back down from his attackers.
