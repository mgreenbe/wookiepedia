These clones, Captain CT-7567 \"Rex,\" Advanced Recon Commando CT-5597 \"Jesse,\" and the clones of Clone Force 99, had gone behind enemy lines to see if the Separatists possessed Rex's strategy algorithm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clone Force 99 took out a group of droids when the group's Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry had been shot down at Sector One. This was seen as irregular by the Separatist leadership, so droids were sent to investigate. The clones later took out the Anaxes Separatist Security Outpost to get closer to the Cyber Center. The platoon investigated this location, and Trench deduced the clones were heading for the center. The platoon's Multi-Troop Transports arrived there and deployed B2-series super battle droids. The units attacked the clones, but failed to stop them from finding that the Separatists were using the algorithm and escaping."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
