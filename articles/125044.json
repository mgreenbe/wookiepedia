The pirate Queen Maz Kanata left a cache of treasure from her reign in a buried vault in the shrove and left coordinates and a map pointing to its location in the book that would become known as the Smuggler's Guide. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the smuggler Tryphon Leo stole the book from Kanata and decided to try and claim the treasure in the shrove. While searching for the treasure, Leo did not mention the cache to the natives for fear of the Crimson Dawn syndicate learning about it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The smuggler was ultimately killed during the search when a large rock fell and crushed him in front of a Typhojem Thrall approximately seventy meters along the Grand Causeway.
