The mercenaries were secretly hired by the Trade Federation. The Federation lured the Queen of Naboo out to a remote region of space on the pretense of conducting negotiations. When the royal delegation reached the location, they were attacked by mercenaries. Unable to safely jump to hyperspace, the royal starship hid in an asteroid field as Bravo Flight pilots Essara Till and Rhys Dallows fended off waves of mercenary starfighters. Eventually, Queen Amidala escaped to hyperspace, but not the Bravo pilots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The attempt"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time before the Invasion of Naboo, Queen Amidala agreed with the Trade Federation to meet for negotiations in a remote region of space. As the Royal starship approached the Federation ship, three mercenary ships approached quickly. The Trade Federation battleship immediately left for hyperspace, but the Naboo delegation was not as fast. Bravo pilots Essara Till and Rhys Dallows were sent to defend the Royal starship until it was ready for hyperspace. Till ordered Dallows to concentrate on the Daggers. After the first three starfighters, the mercenaries attacked in waves of Daggers, followed by waves of MorningStars. During the fighting, the Queen's starship took cover in a nearby asteroid belt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just as the Royal starship was ready to make the jump to hyperspace, a wing of Dianogas came through the asteroids blocking the ship's escape route. Dallows attacked the new starfighters, enabling the Royal starship to finally escape. After the Queen's escape, a MorningStar came up behind and fired upon Dallows. Till came around to shoot the MorningStar. At that point, the leader of the mercenaries chose to appear. He shot down Till and disabled Dallows in quick succession using his craft's missiles before leaving."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rhys Dallows was later found by the Toydarian Reti as he was scavenging for parts.
