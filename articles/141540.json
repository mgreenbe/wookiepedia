Officially off-duty, they joined Grand Marshal Cheketta and the Jedi Knight Ralon Nys in attacking the Imperial-held planet of Balmorra. Two members of the squad were killed alongside Ralon Nys by an Imperial spacer who had infiltrated the Balmorran Arms Factory. After the defeat of Grand Marshal Cheketta, the rest of the squad presumably were either killed or surrendered to imperial forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
