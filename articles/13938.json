The engagement began when the Corrupter attacked the space station Dunari's Rest, hoping to flush out any Rebel operatives who had taken refuge on board the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "About"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the year 3 ABY, the Rebel Alliance had discovered the existence of the Galactic Empire's newly constructed Death Star II, a massive battle station capable of destroying entire ships and planets. They immediately proceeded to assemble their forces and supplies so that they could destroy the station before it became operational. However, they needed supplies to do the job, and with their own supply caches destroyed by the Empire, they sought assistance from Dunari, who headed a large trading firm. Dunari agreed to help the Rebels, as did his partners, the Hurrim. Unfortunately, the Hurrim proved to be less than trustworthy and after firing upon civilian and Alliance ships, joined the Empire. Dunari rejected the Hurrim from his trading firm, but the Hurrim retaliated by summoning Imperial forces to attack Dunari's Rest, forcing the Rebels and Dunari to abandon the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels from the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Liberty arrived with a full force of B-wing starfighters and T-65 X-wing starfighters to protect the civilian vessels fleeing the casino. When they arrived, most of the casino patrons had already evacuated, but the remaining ones were attacked by several squadrons of Star Wings. The Rebels repelled them alongside Dunari's security forces, who were flying Cloakshape Fighters, and the casino employees prepared to abandon the station. Unfortunately, Imperial Admiral Garreth Holtz arrived on the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Corrupter alongside the Strike-class medium cruiser Lament, and both vessels immediately launched their TIE/LN starfighters and TIE/sa bombers. The B-wings made short work of the Lament, but the Corrupter was coming at the station at full speed. The joint Rebel-Casino Security forces fought valiantly and held off wave after wave of enemy fighters until Dunari's employees had evacuated the station. Dunari left the station on the Luxury Yacht Raw Deal alongside Emon Azzameen, who had been rescued by Dunari and his younger brother Ace in a recent engagement. Ace was among the pilots fighting the battle, and they held off the remaining fighters until Dunari had cleared the battlefield. Later, the Imperial Nebulon-B2 frigate Cerebus dropped out of hyperspace to aid in the battle, accompanied by TIE Avengers. However, by this point, the station was totally evacuated, and the Rebels soon retreated back to the Liberty and the Separatist Cruiser. Dunari's forces also evacuated the area, but the casino was now under Imperial control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The evacuation prevented the Rebels' trade agreement with Dunari from falling apart, and it helped ensure that the Rebels would indeed be ready to attack the Death Star II when the Battle of Endor occurred. It is unknown what became of the casino, as it was captured intact but no known attempt to recapture it was made. Dunari swore revenge against the Hurrim, who were responsible for setting up the Imperial ambush. The Rebels and Dunari's forces would eventually destroy the Hurrim's main base and shut down the group's operations before moving on with their plans to attack the Death Star II. The Rebels would also exact revenge on the Empire, as Admiral Garreth Holtz and the Corrupter were also destroyed with the Hurrim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
