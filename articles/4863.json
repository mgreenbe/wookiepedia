After Darth Vader captured Jedi Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu following a duel in the Jedi Temple, Imperial shock troopers of the Galactic Empire searched Nu and discovered the memory crystal.

After Vader killed all shock troopers after Nu revealed his former identity, the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, he then also killed Nu, and informed his master that she had attempted to escape, which resulted in her death. When Palpatine asked Vader if he had recovered any information from Nu, Vader responded that he had learned nothing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alaytia Taverre was first mentioned, albeit via their name written in Aurebesh, in the 2018 canon comic, Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 10, written by Charles Soule and pencilled by Giuseppe Camuncoli."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
