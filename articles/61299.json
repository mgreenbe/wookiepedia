Really more of a sub-adventure meant to be played as part of a larger adventure, High Alert! explores what happens when something goes wrong with a covert mission. The heroes have to use their wits and cunning to escape an enemy-controlled starport without attracting attention. It forces the heroes to put away their blasters and lightsabers and rely on stealth and guile -- giving some of the less combat-oriented characters a chance to shine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
