Largely unexplored throughout galactic history, it remained a mystery to space travelers and served as a source of tales and wonders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To those who lived in the Unknown Regions, it was known as the Chaos. They knew the rest of the galaxy as \"Lesser Space.\" The Chaos was a very dangerous place to navigate due to supernovae, black holes, gravity wells, and stranger phenomena. These hazards made navigation computers unreliable within the Chaos, and were the source of the name \"Chaos.\" Due to such hazards, the peoples of the Unknown Regions employed Force-sensitive navigators, individuals endowed with the Force power of precognition, to navigate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Unknown Regions, known as the Chaos to those in it, was a vast patch of mysterious space located to the west of the Outer Core. Individuals and governments located in the Unknown Regions were faced with constantly-changing pathways and distorted hyperspace routes, meaning they often dealt with stunted trade and slowed travel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Republic Era, the peoples of the Unknown Regions used Force-sensitive navigators with the power of precognition to navigate the Chaos, instead of navigation computers. The various governments of the Chaos regularly hired the services of the Navigators' Guild, which dispatched Force-sensitive navigators to navigate for paying clients. Navigators of the Guild were bound by a vow of confidentiality and could not discuss anything they saw working for clients with anyone other than that client. The Chiss Ascendancy used Force-sensitive Chiss children (most often girls) as navigators. These Chiss navigators were known as the ozyly-esehembo, Cheunh for \"sky-walker,\" and they were among the Ascendancy's most treasured assets and groups of people. The existence of ozyly-esehembo was among the Chiss Ascendancy's most closely-guarded secrets, so the Chiss often hired Navigators' Guild members to navigate, relying on the ozyly-esehembo for backup. During the Imperial Era, the warlike Grysk species of the Grysk Hegemony kidnapped Force-sensitive Chiss children in order to navigate safely through hyperspace, leading to conflict with the Chiss Ascendancy. At the same time, the Grysk came into conflict with the Galactic Empire, whose territory they sought to expand into."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Unknown Regions was regarded as an unexplored region that was separated from the galaxy by a labyrinth of solar storms, rogue magnetospheres, black holes, gravity wells, and things far stranger. Strange creatures were known to inhabit the void. This maze was considered impassable and many exploration ships and probe droids were lost trying to breach it. By the time of the Battle of Jakku, Imperial computers at the Jakku Observatory had identified a safe route through the maze, but one that required multiple short hyperspace jumps, a journey which took several months."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ilum system, the Dassal system, the Deep, Rakata Prime, and the Chiss homeworld of Csilla were located in the Unknown Regions. The watery world of Ahch-To, the site of the First Jedi Temple, was located in the Unknown Regions. The Queluhan Nebula was also located within the Region."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the Z7 series construction droid Zeta, there were few service centers, mechanics and factories for replacement parts in the Unknown Regions and no self respecting droid ever ventured there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ancient history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the legends of the Chiss Ascendancy, the Unknown Regions had not always been the collection of constantly-shifting pathways and twisted hyperspace routes that it was by the Republic Era. The legends claimed that, at the beginning of space travel, traveling between the stars of the region was as easy as regular travel, but, thousands of years prior to 19 BBY, a series of chained supernovas threw huge masses at near-lightspeed between the stars, demolishing asteroids, devastating entire planets, or even setting off more supernova explosions. The movement of these masses, combined with heavy electromagnetic flux in a number of regions, brought about the ever-changing hyperlanes that still plagued travel efforts a thousand years later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dating as far back as the Old Republic, the Jedi Order was known to utilize the planet Ilum as a source of kyber crystals, which were important in the construction of a Jedi's lightsaber. At a young age, Jedi younglings were sent to Ilum to retrieve these crystals, traveling into the Unknown Regions aboard a ship known as the Crucible. The Chiss Ascendancy took part in the Sith Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Chiss Ascendancy rose to become a major power in the Unknown Regions. This empire recognized that the instability of the Unknown Regions could be an advantage because, if the Unknown Regions limited travel, the chances at an enemy faction launching an invasion were also limited. However, Chiss intelligence and recon missions were also slowed by the region's instability, blinding them to potential hidden foes who sought to bring destruction and conquest to their domain. Furthermore, the Chiss had a strongly ingrained policy against initiating hostilities, and were only allowed to use their military for defense purposes."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Era of the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chiss surveyed events in the rest of the galaxy and became aware of a massive war being fought there. The conflict was the Clone Wars, which was fought between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. By 19 BBY, concurrent to the Clone Wars, an empire in the Unknown Regions known as the Nikardun Destiny had begun to expand, allying and subjugating other peoples. The Destiny was led by a Nikardun general known as Yiv the Benevolent, though he himself had unseen masters. Yiv's efforts were also watched by another group that included an individual named Jixtus. As he later noted, many of this group predicted Yiv's efforts against the Chiss Ascendancy would fail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yiv sought to bring his empire against the Chiss. To cover up an an attack against Paccosh refugees in the Dioya system, which was at the edge of Chiss territory, the Nikardun launched an attack on the Chiss capital of Csilla. After he and Supreme General Ba'kif realized it had been a distraction, Thrawn began to investigate this new threat. He eventually realized that the Lioaoin Regime, Rapacc, and Urch were all sought by the Destiny. Judging by Chiss reports, he also reasoned that the Paataatus government, the force that the Chiss had assumed to be the sole culprit behind the Csilla attack, was under their control too. Controlling these factions would allow the Destiny to begin to encircle the Chiss, who would be prevented from fighting back by their non-aggression policy unless they could prove they were in imminent danger. By now, Thrawn had nearly enough proof to permit fighting back against the Nikardun Destiny. Nevertheless, the Ascendancy's policy against launching attacks without enough proof impacted his efforts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Lioaoin skirmish, Thrawn and sky-walker Che'ri traveled into the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories to search for allies, leading to them detecting a deflector shield generator on the Separatist-controlled world of Mokivj and having an encounter with Jedi General Anakin Skywalker over the planet Batuu. The Chiss had not seen shield technology as advanced as the deflector shield generator, which they termed a \"Republic energy shield.\" Skywalker and Thrawn agreed to ally to search for Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, whom they found on Mokivj. The planet was home to a Cortosis mine that was controlled by the Separatists. Unknown to Thrawn and Skywalker at the time, the Grysks had told Count Dooku about Cortosis's ability to block blasters and lightsabers. As such, Dooku began developing prototype B2-series super battle droids fortified with Cortosis in their chassis\u2014as well as Cortosis-fortified clone trooper armor for potential use in executing Order 66. Thrawn helped Skywalker and Amidala defeat the local Separatist forces and parted ways with them, taking the shield generator with him. Then Anakin accidentally destroyed the factory was in a planetary catastrophe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Thrawn and Che'ri returned to the Ascendancy, Yiv's operations fell apart when he was defeated at Primea. The Vak Combine joined forces with the Chiss fleet during the battle, and the Nikardun Destiny fell apart after Thrawn captured Yiv. A short time later, however, Jixtus and his faction informed one of Yiv's former servants, the Pathfinder Qilori, that they would launch a more \"subtle\" campaign against the Chiss for control of the Unknown Regions. Around that time, the Ascendancy began a campaign against the remnants of Yiv's Nikardun forces."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire in \"Lesser Space,\" the Grysk agent Jixtus concocted a plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy. Aided by Haplif of the Agbui, who had previously engineered a cataclysmic civil war on a planet nicknamed Sunrise, the Grysk Hegemony operative drew several Chiss Great Families to the brink of open warfare with each other. Jixtus hoped that the Great Families' allied Ruling Families would escalate the conflict into a Chiss civil war, which would weaken the Ascendancy to the point it would be easy prey for the Grysk. In about 18 BBY, Jixtus's plan nearly succeeded, but was foiled at the last moment by Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet Senior Captains Thrawn and Lakinda. While the Chiss Ascendancy did not descend into civil war as a result of Jixtus's machinations, the Grysk Hegemony remained a threat. The Grysks' continued threat eventually led the Ascendancy to send Thrawn to Lesser Space to scout out the potential of an alliance between the Ascendancy and the nascent Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early years of the Galactic Empire, some dissidents, such as Berch Teller, believed that the Empire would extend all the way to the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The existence of \"evil threats\" in the Unknown Regions led the Chiss Ascendancy to send the Chiss Thrawn to forge an alliance with the Galactic Empire. Thrawn made first contact with the Empire by posing as an exile, exiled for violating the Chiss's non-aggression policy. Thrawn had merely expected to perform reconnaissance and appraisal of the Empire's capabilities and report back to Csilla. However, due to his origins in the Unknown Regions, Emperor Palpatine took interest in the Chiss and made him a cadet and later officer in the Imperial Navy. Unbeknownst to Thrawn, Palpatine sought Thrawn's familiarity with the Unknown Regions for his Contingency plan. Thrawn eventually gained the trust of Emperor Palpatine and Imperial Security Bureau Colonel Wullf Yularen. Following the Batonn insurgency, Thrawn became an Imperial Grand Admiral and sent his friend Commander Eli Vanto to join the Chiss Ascendancy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, the Emperor sent several explorers into the Unknown Regions. Many of these explorers were killed while trying to breach the maze that lay to the west of Jakku. Others went mad from isolation. Palpatine's efforts to map the Unknown Regions were aided by the Chiss Admiral Thrawn, a native of the Unknown Regions. For decades, Palpatine had been seeding the Unknown Regions with storehouses, shipyards, and laboratories. At some point, a communications station was established on the planet of GH-531.  Thrawn served as Palpatine's chief adviser concerning matters within the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ilum was occupied by the Empire, and the Empire began strip-mining the entire planet for kyber crystals, used as a vital component for the DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station. The mining eventually destroyed Ilum's surface, leaving a large trench stretching around the entire planet. Ilum was heavily guarded, with a battle group and a garrison protecting it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Atollon, Palpatine sensed a disturbance in the Force coming from the edge of a region centered on Batuu and sent Thrawn and Darth Vader to investigate. As Thrawn came to understand, Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker, the very same Force-sensitive who he had fought beside during the Clone Wars. The two discovered that this disturbance had been caused by the war-like Grysks' kidnapping of Force-sensitive Chiss children, whom they were forcing to use as navigators. With the help of Lord Vader and Thrawn, the Chiss Ascendancy managed to rescue the children. Thrawn still felt that the Grysks continued to pose a threat to both the Chiss Ascendancy and the Empire, though Vader dismissed them as a distant threat that could be ignored for the time being. Like he had with Vanto, Thrawn later sent Assistant Director Brierly Ronan to join the Ascendancy, but Ronan also planned to act as a double agent if he should learn Thrawn was working against the Empire in any capacity. When Chiss Admiral Ar'alani departed with Ronan, she feared the chaos growing in the Ascendancy would lead to a war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial era, Palpatine had installed a secret Observatory on the planet Jakku which contained powerful ancient computers that generated a computerized three-dimensional map of the Unknown Regions, a critical part of Palpatine's Contingency plan. The Observatory's computers dispatched numerous probe droids to test the routes that the computers had generated. Shortly before the Emperor's death at the Battle of Endor, the computers finished their calculations and found a safe path into the Unknown Regions. As a result, the Emperor's flagship Eclipse was dispatched into the new frontier. Following the Battle of Endor, Palpatine's former Advisor Yupe Tashu advocated that the Empire venture into the Unknown Regions to seek out the source of the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Republic Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Jakku and the signing of the Galactic Concordance by Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, the Galactic Empire surrendered to the New Republic. The Concordance severely limited militarization and the buildup of forces among former Imperial worlds and sectors, as well requiring the Empire to stay within strict boundaries within the Core and Inner Rim. The Concordance caused certain elements of the Empire to withdraw into the Unknown Regions as the Empire fell. Among the retreating Imperials were Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, Brendol Hux, and his son Armitage Hux, who rendezvoused with the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Eclipse as well as an Imperial remnant led by Grand Moff Randd that took refuge in the Queluhan Nebula.

Several shipyards, weapons factories, and base installations were established and maintained by the First Order in the Unknown Regions. Starkiller Base, which was located on the forested ice planet of Ilum, became one of the First Order's most significant strongholds.
