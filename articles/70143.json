Crafted by some of the best armorsmiths in the galaxy, these suits of battle armor were extremely resistant to cutting edges and blaster fire alike. They were also quite cumbersome, and each one was custom forged for its wearer. Though hundreds of such suits were made, only a handful had survived to the present day in anything resembling usable condition, and all specimens were still fitted to their wearers of old."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
