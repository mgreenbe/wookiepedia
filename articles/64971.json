Attuning an item took a massive drain on the crafters reserves, however, with the crafter only being able to imbue energy once every twenty four hours. More potent than other traditions' respective abilities to craft items, Jal Shey imbued items were capable of being used by even non-Force sensitives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
