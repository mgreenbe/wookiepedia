They were set on the cause of preserving the environment of their homeworld. They also ran a thriving tourism industry on their world, including hotels, bars, and casinos, and were renowned for their manufacture of electronics as well. Despite, or perhaps because of, their prosperity, they were fearful of losing what they had to the oppression of the Galactic Empire.
