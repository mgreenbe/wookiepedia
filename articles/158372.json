During the war, he was stationed on the neutral planet Voss within Camp Talanis in the Gormak Lands. There, he encountered several of the native Voss who were sympathetic to the Republic cause and volunteered to investigate a downed Republic walker near the camp. When they did not return, Usser became worried and sent a Republic aligned individual to check what had happened.
