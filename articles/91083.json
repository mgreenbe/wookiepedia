Members of the Hutt Clan led by Myarga had made an alliance with the Jedi in order to fight the Drengir, vicious carnivorous plants which had emerged across the Outer Rim Territories. The Hutts had subsequently requested an envoy be sent to their homeworld, but not all of the Hutts approved of the alliance. Jedi Master Obratuk, an experienced diplomat, was sent to Bilbousa with the Padawans Farzala Tarabal and Qort aboard the starship Vessel, which had been hired for the job along with its crew. However, Obratuk fell into a Parwan seasonal hibernation before he even arrived, leading Tarabal to lead the negotiations. However, after Tarabal and Leox Gyasi left to negotiate with Skarabda the Hutt, a group of thugs sent by the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure hijacked the Vessel and attacked Skarabda's palace, leading the Hutt diplomat and her head of security Ishnar to believe a double-cross had occurred. Tarabal managed to gain Ishnar's gratitude by saving the Nikto from a Drengir while he and Gyasi had attempted to escape, but the two were still recaptured. Onboard the Vessel, the navigator Geode retook control of the ship from the hijackers, as the thugs did not understand the Vintian's nature and thought he was a \"creepy rock\" thing. However, Qort and Affie Hollow were forced to hide as the thugs hunted for them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
