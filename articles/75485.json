However, he returned after Dreypa threatened the life of Takara, whom he had developed a crush for. Spinner returned to Tahv where he destroyed Dreypa's leviathans and rescued Takara. In the end, Dreypa was killed when the Jedi Starship crashed into Sessal Spire. However, Spinner and Takara managed to bail out into the Southern Ocean. Following the defeat of Dreypa, Tahv was rebuilt and Spinner was admitted into the Tribe as a Grand Lord's Hand, making him a personal enforcer of the Grand Lord. As a result, the Lost Tribe of Sith was able to consolidate its influence over the rest of Kesh."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Legacy period"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 41.5 ABY, Kesh's galactic isolation came to an end when a Sith Meditation Sphere known as Ship arrived on Kesh. Ship made contact with the Sith Tyro Vestara Khai and offered to instruct her in the ways of the dark side of the Force. Later, Vestara revealed Ship's existence to the Circle of Lords, telling them that they also shared their thoughts. The Lords then decided that they would use Ship to learn more about the Sith, and to travel offworld. Vestara was then made a Sith apprentice to Lady Rhea and was designated to be trained by Ship. Ship also revealed to the Lost Tribe that the Sith did not rule the galaxy and were actually very few in number. This revelation completely shattered the Lost Tribe's long-held belief that the Sith had ruled the galaxy for thousands of years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tribe spent the next two years capturing ships and creating a Sith armada. As the Sith built up their armada, a spaceport was constructed in open land just outside of Tahv. Within two years, the fleet contained several dozen ships, including the rebuilt Omen. After sensing the presence of exiled Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker through the force, a strike team was put together to hunt down and kill Skywalker. It was also at this time that Ship left Kesh. In response, the Circle of Lords decided to track down and recapture Ship and put aside their plans to hunt Skywalker. This brought the Lost Tribe into contact with both the Force entity known as Abeloth and the Jedi Master Skywalker and his son Ben Skywalker. Eventually, the Lost Tribe formed an alliance with the Skywalkers to stop Abeloth, who was responsible for causing a Force psychosis that was plaguing Jedi in the Galactic Alliance, one of the successor states to the former Galactic Republic which came to an end following the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 44 ABY, this temporary alliance came to an end when Abeloth approached the Sith Saber Gavar Khai with an offer to form an alliance with the Lost Tribe in return for killing Skywalker and his allies. While the Circle of Lords were divided over this issue, Grand Lord Darish Vol decided to side with Abeloth since he thought that she would benefit the Tribe's interests. Vol then contacted Gavar Khai, who was returning with his fleet, Abeloth, and Ship to Kesh, and told him to delay Abeloth's arrival on the planet. The Grand Lord had planned to prepare a celebration in Tahv for Abeloth, since she was regarded as a valuable asset in defeating the Lost Tribe's enemies. While Abeloth distrusted Vol's motives, she accepted his offer and told Khai to instruct everyone in his fleet to return to Kesh with their friends and family members."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Abeloth arrived in the Sith capital of Tahv, she was officially welcomed by a parade organized by the Sith authorities. The Grand Lord also closely observed Abeloth to understand her motives. Following the festivities, Abeloth visited Vol in his dreams. However, the Grand Lord was able to lure Abeloth into a mental trap which he used to attack the entity. However, Abeloth sent a Force shock-wave equivalent to that of a tsunami that destroyed much of Tahv, killing millions of its citizens including Sith and Keshiri. Khai's wife Lahka Khai perished during this attack. Following the Destruction of Tahv, Ship departed with Abeloth and several Sith who were still loyal to the Force entity. These included Gavar Khai, who was still grieving over the loss of his wife, and his forces who had been influenced by Abeloth. Grand Lord Vol was able to escape as well in his personal shuttle. Abeloth then \"absorbed\" the populist Senator Rokari Kem, and assumed her identity. Led by the new Chief of State \"Kem\", the Lost Tribe then infiltrated the Galactic Alliance Senate and took over the galactic capital of Coruscant.
