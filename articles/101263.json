Most ores were mined and sold on the same world because of the costs associated with lifting bulk cargoes out of a gravity well. Unless no feasible substitutes were available in a region, useful but common ores such as copper, iron, and titanium were seldom exported from a planet and only in very rare cases out of a system. Only ores valuable enough to turn a profit after taking into account the transportation costs were shipped to other galactic markets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable Ores"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ore is one of the resources in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack, Clone Campaigns.
