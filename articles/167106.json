Tann began her assignment by selecting an individual Yresilini as a general and attempted to teach him a series of commands. The general responded by laughing at Tann, prompting his fellow Yresilini to laugh as well. Tann had the general executed in front of his troops, and selected a successor, who led the Yresilini to follow her orders completely. Tann received high marks from her professor and continued on a military career, with the story of her taming the Yresilini being retold amongst soldiers under her command."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yresilini were first mentioned in Sev'rance Tann's databank entry for the 2002 LucasArts video game Clone Campaigns, an expansion of the 2001 game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
