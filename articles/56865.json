The massive increase in thermal energy caused the melting of Kamino's ice caps, which led to the submersion of the planet's surface into a vast ocean. The native Kaminoans, who had not yet developed sophisticated space travel technology, decided not to petition for aid from the distant Galactic Republic for fear of colonization. Instead, they turned to engineering to adapt not only themselves, but also their flora and fauna to the new aquatic environment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
