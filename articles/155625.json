It wore a cloth hat that was supposed to make it look more Human and had an integrated card scanner in its hand. The droid drove rogue Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer to the Eeseen spaceport while she was on her way to avenge the death of her Master, Ven Zallow. It tried to initiate its social programming and make small talk, but Leneer told it that she wanted to ride in silence. Once they got to their destination, the droid held out its hand so she could pay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The air taxi driver droid first appeared in Paul S.
