She was part of Duchess Satine's court on the starship Coronet. During her time there, she witnessed the assassination attempt on the Duchess's life by several assassin droids. Robb was briefly suspected of having smuggled the droids aboard, since the crate holding them was marked with the Senate stamp, and was subjected to a test of Kenobi's involving the lone surviving droid, which she leaned away from uncomfortably; Kenobi noted the droid's \"unusual hostility\" towards her as having absolved her of suspicion. The traitor was revealed to be Senator Tal Merrik, who released the droid to attack Onaconda Farr. When Kenobi destroyed the droid, Robb rushed to Farr's aid. She along with the rest of the senators made it safely to Coruscant thanks to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker's successful handling of the crisis on the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Amidala put together a party for Senator Aang, Robb was one of those in attendance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kin Robb was present at a meeting organized by Senator Philo to discuss the blockage of the Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill that the Chancellor wished to bring forward. The meeting, however, was caught in the middle of the bounty hunter Cad Bane's raid on the Senate, and she was held as hostage by Bane to bargain with the Chancellor for the release of the Hutt Ziro Desilijic Tiure; during the crisis, Senator Philo attempted to storm out, only to be callously shot in the back by Cad Bane, much to Robb's horror. The Chancellor was forced to meet Bane's demands if he was to get the senators out alive. However, Bane went back on his word and detonated laser-activated bombs he had placed around the East Wing lobby of the Republic Executive Building to prevent the senators from escaping. Robb's life, along with that of her fellow senators, was saved by the quick actions of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who cut through the floor around them seconds before the explosives detonated; though coughing from the dust and a little dazed from the fall, Robb was otherwise unharmed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She was present with two of her aides during a speech given by Senator Amidala to reduce the military budget, which all showed support for. She would later be present at the funeral of Onaconda Farr."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Robb later presided over the trial of Ahsoka Tano as a member of the jury following the bombing of the Jedi Temple, Tano was on trial for being the bombe rof the jedi temple due to the fact that she was found with the nano droid explosives that were used to bomb the temple; Tano was also put on trial because the bombs were fed to an engineer by his wife Letta Turmond and Tano was seen to have killed Turmond in her cell. At the climax of the trial, it is unknown whether Robb voted in favour of Tano's execution or against as before the decision of the jury could be revealed Anakin Skywalker burst into the court room with Jedi padawan Barriss Offee who confessed to the members of the jury that she was killer and the bomber of the temple. To this Robb was shocked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Robb was later present in the Galactic Senate when it was announced that interest rates on the Republic would be raised by the Banking Clan because the Separatists were refusing to pay their loans. Robb was one of the more vocal reactions alongside fellow Senators Mot-Not Rab and Meena Tills, shouting to the Chancellor that he had been warned that it would happen. When it was announced to the Senate that the CIS had attacked Scipio, Robb immediately called for a counter-invasion in order to seize the banks, supported by Senators Tills, Rab, Stonk and Riyo Chuchi. The crisis was resolved by the Republic victory at Scipio, home of the Banking Clan, though it resulted in the death of Rush Clovis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A female Human hailing from the planet Taris, Kin Robb seldom spoke but her interests lay in protecting her people and other innocents from the ever-escalating conflict. This was demonstrated several times, including her presence at a meeting to stop the Enhanced Privacy Invasion bill and membership in the Council of Neutral Systems. She gained a reputation for honor, as noted by Obi-Wan Kenobi, who also noted that the droid's hostility toward her was \"unusual.\" which could mean that she was a nice and likeable person. She dined regularly with Senator Onaconda Farr, suggesting a close friendship with him, and was one of the saddest in attendance at his funeral, gazing mournfully after his funeral transport long after the other attendees had left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Robb was voiced by Anna Graves, who also voiced Meena Tills and Satine Kryze."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
