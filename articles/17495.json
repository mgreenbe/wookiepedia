Belonging to an ancient settlement and acting as the original outpost, it was at one time the site of a temporary Resistance encampment, which the Resistance picked largely because it had been ideal for their needs. The encampment included a DF.12 Com Turret at an entrance that led directly into the ruins and into caves which included ancient artifacts and worship sites. The Resistance built their control center inside, in some cases cutting through rock to widen the caves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several Resistance recruits were once scrambled there alongside BB-8 to their fighters.
