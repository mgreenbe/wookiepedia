The group had very few resources to work with and few soldiers. Shortly before the coming of Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker, who were searching for the shards of the Vor'Na'Tu, Lathe and a large group of her supporters were arrested by Moff Yittreas, nearly crushing the rebellion. However the rebels destroyed the prison, freeing Lathe and her supporters. The Hanoon Resistance, along with the Rebel Alliance, captured the vital terraform processor, destroyed the imperial palace on the planet and killed Moff Yittreas, freeing the planet of Imperial tyranny."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
