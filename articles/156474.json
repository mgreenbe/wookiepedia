They were probably very rare, or were discovered just not long before the destruction of Alderaan, as zoologists never had an opportunity to identify the name of the creature or to study its habits properly. It was believed, though, that it fed on nectar and insects \u2014 including some large ones, like woolly moths. These creatures became extinct, along with many other species of the Alderaanian fauna, after the destruction of Alderaan in 0 BBY by the first Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
