In the game he serves as a Basic Gear vendor for the Bounty Hunter class, but with the release of Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan, a second version of Danvik was added as a Classic Token vendor in the same room. Both versions were later removed as vendors and NPCs in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, he remains in the game, as his character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
