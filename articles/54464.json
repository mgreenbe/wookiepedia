Following the Battle of Endor and the death of the Sith Lord Darth Vader in 4 ABY, Giggek convinced his friend Tuttel to journey within Vader's fortress together and destroy it with explosives. Inside, the duo encountered the Dark Lord's ferocious servant Vane\u00e9, who trapped Giggek within the castle.
