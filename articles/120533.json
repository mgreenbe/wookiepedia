The weapon would see action on many fronts such as Toydaria, Lotho Minor, Florrum, Nal Hutta and Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The weapon closely resembled Darth Maul's lightsaber, but also contained design features similar to Darth Tyranus's lightsaber (notably the emitter guards on both ends). Compared to typical lightsabers, this weapon had an unusual sound frequency where the ignition hiss sounded similar to an animal-like growl, while the idle hum had a much deeper resonance pitch. Also, the weapon's blade length extended much further than most other lightsabers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Serenno and Toydaria"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lightsaber was first used in sparring duels with Darth Tyranus's weapon. It was later used during the showdown on Toydaria, during a three-way duel on a Separatist dreadnaught with Tyranus and Asajj Ventress, and Opress's subsequent escape from the dreadnought, wielded against Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and numerous battle droids. On Dathomir, he later brandished the weapon against a lone Jedi Knight, displaying aggressive skills in combat."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Lotho Minor and Raydonia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Opress carried it to Lotho Minor, in search of his brother. He ignited it and slaughtered a bunch of junkers. When he fell below, he ignited half of the weapon to provide light to navigate the abyss to find his brother. In the struggle with a near-mad Darth Maul, he lost the weapon but shortly retrieved it with a Force pull after Maul ran away. The lightsaber saw combat, in conjunction with his brother's weapon, above Raydonia against Obi-Wan Kenobi and Asajj Ventress."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Outer Rim"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Savage would use his lightsabers against Trandoshans at Yellowblade's Landing, and it would be used to confront the Jedi Bruu Jun-Fan and Grohto at Pleem's Nexus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Opress would later wield the blade as he confronted the Jedi Masters Salmara and Judd, and Padawan Dray on Moorjhone. In addition to this, Savage wielded the lightsaber while dueling Jedi Knight Finn Ertay and her Nikto companion at an unidentified Outer Rim spaceport. Savage fended Ertay long enough for Maul to get behind her and stab her in the back."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cybloc and Florrum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Savage used the weapon on the Cybloc Transfer Station against the security droids, and used it to pry the credit coffer open. He would then use it against his brother when he suggested that they share equal power, throwing off the Rule of Two. He was bested quickly, however. Opress deployed the weapon against Jedi Master Adi Gallia on Florrum, while his brother went off to face Kenobi. The lightsaber was used to execute her, after Opress used his horns to impale her."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Missions to Mustafar and Nal Hutta"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Opress would travel to Mustafar with Maul, Pre Vizsla, Bo-Katan and the Death Watch to arrange an alliance with a Black Sun faction led by Xomit Grunseit.

He used it to kill the guards at the bank and then used it in a brief duel with Vizsla. Vizsla betrayed the two Sith and locked them up, but the two escaped. Maul would later kill Vizsla, therefore taking control of the Death Watch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, he would later wield it in a duel against the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, with the aid of his brother. It is here that Savage would meet his demise when Sidious impaled him with two lightsabers.
