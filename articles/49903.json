The first example took place during the two-on-one fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker against Count Dooku on the observation deck of General Grievous' ship. The scene takes place when Count Dooku uses Force Lift and Force Choke on Kenobi, and kicks his leg backwards at Anakin. Dooku's backwards kick appears to send Skywalker flying with unrealistically force across the platform and into a nearby wall. Another Force kick blooper occurred in that movie during the Mustafar fight scene. When Vader drop-kicked Obi-Wan Kenobi on the tabletop, his feet clearly did not impact Kenobi. Yet another similar blooper happened a short time later, where Kenobi returns the kick to Vader. In that instance, Vader is not only pushed back before being kicked by Kenobi, but the kick hit the Sith Lord's lower waist and yet seemed to focus the force of the impact on Vader's torso, thereby sending his body into a backwards vertical spin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coincidentally, another Force kick occurs in Willow, when Madmartigan kicks one of Bavmorda's soldiers in Tir Asleen castle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force kick sequence sparked off a minor fad within the Star Wars-oriented part of the YTMND community, in which the term might have originated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force kick was mentioned in Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, albeit as a joke, and made an appearance in Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The \"Force kick\" sequence"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
