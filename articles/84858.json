Circa 21 BBY, MT-D6 accompanied Du'Re on a mission to the city Tolea Biqua on the planet Genarius, in the Cularin system, where Du'Re was investigating the theft of a number of high value art objects. However, Du'Re was attacked while inside a Tolea Biqua warehouse and MT-D6 fled, hoping to find some reinforcements to assist his master.
