During the Second Galactic Civil War, Lecersen backed a mutual alliance between the Remnant and the Galactic Alliance under Chief of State Darth Caedus in combating the Confederation, a rebellion revolting against Caedus's government. After agreeing to supply warships and soldiers to aid in an Alliance war effort, the Remnant was granted control of the Bilbringi and Borleias star systems\u2014something the Moffs saw as the beginning of a renewed Galactic Empire.

In the aftermath of the fray, Lecersen, now the de facto leader of the Moff Council, accompanied Chief of State Caedus into battle during an attack on a Jedi Coalition base on Shedu Maad in the Hapes Cluster. Against Caedus's orders, the Moff authorized the creation and deployment of a nanovirus designed to target the bloodline of Hapan Queen Mother Tenel Ka Djo. The move ultimately proved fruitless, and, with Caedus's death, the battle ended in defeat for the combined Alliance and Remnant fleet. Cornered by Jedi forces, Lecersen and the remaining Moffs were given the choice between imprisonment or helping to rebuild the Alliance as punishment for their part in the war. The Moff Council opted for the latter, and, to ensure their cooperation, Jagged Fel, son of Imperial starfighter pilot Soontir Fel, was installed as Imperial Head of State\u2014a move to which Lecersen agreed, given the elder Fel's reputation as an Imperial pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 43 ABY, Lecersen was still serving as a Moff under Fel, who was gradually transforming the Remnant into a new Empire. The Moff, however, saw Fel's growing relationship with Jedi Knight Jaina Solo as a weakness for both the Head of State and the Empire as a whole. Lecersen hoped to exploit Fel's romance and other factors in the tumultuous post-war galaxy to his own advantage, with the aim of restoring the Moffs to glory as leaders of the Empire. Lecersen's dealing expanded considerably during the year, as he entered into a conspiracy headed by Alliance Senator Haydnat Treen that plotted to seize control of both the Imperial and the Alliance governments in an effort to bring about a renewed Galactic Empire. While simultaneously plotting against Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala, Lecersen sought to supplant Fel as Imperial Head of State. By 44 ABY, the conspiracy had only attained marginal success, and Lecersen was forced to ally with recently deposed Chief of State Daala in her bid for Empress to save his own life.

However, Pellaeon had no desire to ally with Caedus's government. Nonetheless, word of the offer leaked out to members of the Moff Council. Before the weekly meeting of the council commenced in Ravelin on the Remnant capital of Bastion, Lecersen and Pellaeon briefly discussed Caedus's offer, with Pellaeon stating that Grand Moff Quille's faction was most likely aware of the proposal.

When Pellaeon remained silent, Lecersen urged the Grand Moff to continue, going so far as to interrupt the man's speech with a well-placed joke. The discussion continued, and it was Lecersen who asked if the council wanted to expand Imperial territory. When Moff Rosset inquired if they would vote on the matter, Lecersen responded for Pellaeon, stating that the motion was not on the table\u2014and that the council should watch the situation unfold before Pellaeon would make a decision.

When Veila left, Pellaeon had his aide Vitor Reige assemble the Moff Council for a discussion of this new proposal. The Moffs realized that the Alliance would not be able to hold Fondor on their own, and their presence on the world\u2014combined with the additions of Bilbringi and Borleias\u2014would aid in the transition from the Imperial Remnant to a new Empire.

The Moffs set up their headquarters in Nickel One's command center, where they engaged in negotiations with the Verpine hive mother. Accompanied by an Alliance fleet, Caedus arrived at the Roche asteroids and landed on Nickel One shortly thereafter, intending to reprimand Lecersen and the other Moffs for their unauthorized attack. The hive mother was initially relieved by Cadeus's presence and hoped to be rid of the Imperials, but the Sith Lord made it clear that the Alliance fleet was there to hold the star system. Lecersen, who had already drawn comparisons between Caedus and his grandfather Darth Vader, emphasized that the Verpine were not neutral, having sold weapons to both sides of the ongoing civil war. Caedus agreed with the senior Moff but nonetheless found it necessary to scold the Moffs for not consulting him prior to launching their attack. Moffs Voryam Bhao and Krom Rethway were quick to voice their disagreement and disapproval with Caedus, and Lecersen even felt the need to remind the Chief of State that the Imperial Remnant was an ally\u2014not a territory\u2014of the Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Coalition\u2014yet another organization opposed to Caedus's Alliance\u2014soon launched a raid on the Roche asteroids, with the fleets of Admirals Natasi Daala and Cha Niathal engaging the Remnant and Alliance warships while a strike force of Mandalorians, accompanied by Caedus's sister Jaina Solo, landed on Nickel One and proceeded to move towards the Moffs' command center. Lecersen was trapped inside the command center as the Mandalorians poured in, wiping out the Imperial Elite Guard and killing several of the Moffs present. When Solo began to fire on her brother, Caedus urged Lecersen and the remaining Moffs to wait in the command center's anteroom while he dealt with the threat.

In an effort to wipe out one group of his opposition, the Sith Lord dispatched a fleet of Alliance and Imperial warships\u2014including the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Anakin Solo and the Super Star Destroyer Megador\u2014to destroy the base. Lecersen and the Moff Council accompanied Caedus aboard the Anakin Solo. As the battle raged, the Moffs entered into a discussion with Tahiri Veila regarding Caedus's sanity. Veila revealed this to her Master, but Lecersen was the only Moff who was not shocked by her betrayal of their confidence. Believing the battle to be going poorly, Lecersen suggested to Caedus that they launch an attack on the Dragon Queen, the flagship of Hapes Consortium Queen Mother Tenel Ka Djo\u2014the mother of Caedus's daughter, Allana, a fact unknown to the Moffs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Caedus was unable to read Lecersen's mind clearly, but he knew that the Queen Mother was the Moff's intended target. Lecersen explained that the Remnant's scientists had developed a nanovirus that could be tailored to a specific bloodline, once a sample of the target's DNA had been acquired. One batch, designed to kill anyone belonging to Clan Fett, had already been air-dispersed on Mandalore. Lecersen was particularly proud of the accomplishment, seeing it as revenge for the Mandalorian attack on Nickel One. Using a blood sample from the captive Hapan Prince Isolder, Tenel Ka's father, the Remnant would have been able to manufacture a specific strain directed against the Hapan Royal Family within an hour or two. Caedus, fearing for his daughter's life, tried to convince the Moffs and Veila not to develop the virus. Lecersen was skeptical of a victory without the nanovirus, but he nonetheless agreed to follow the Sith Lord's orders. The two then briefly traded jabs before Caedus prepared to confront his sister, who had boarded the Anakin Solo in preparation for a second conflict. Lecersen decided that the Moffs would transfer the flag to the Megador, but Caedus told them that there would be no need\u2014both warships would be moving into battle. Caedus noted that it was time for them to risk their lives to win the war. Later in the Anakin Solo's Biodisposal Pit, after Caedus confronted Isolder and killed him, the Sith Lord discovered that Lecersen had betrayed him: The Moff had had tissue samples collected from Isolder, developed the nanovirus, and sent a missile boat to deliver it to the Dragon Queen. Before Caedus could do anything about it, Jaina forced her brother into a duel and ultimately killed him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The nanovirus ultimately proved to be useless, as both Tenel Ka and Allana survived, though the Queen Mother chose to hide the fact that Allana had survived. The battle fell in favor of the Jedi Coalition; Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker led a strike force of Jedi Masters and Jedi Knights as they stormed the Anakin Solo. The Jedi forces found the Moffs seated around a tactical display in the Auxiliary Command Center following a brief firefight, during which one Moff was killed. The surviving Moffs all displayed varied degrees of shock on their faces at the outcome of the battle. Skywalker informed them that Caedus was dead, and he offered the Council an ultimatum: They would either become Hapan prisoners-of-war and face trial for their nanovirus attack, or they could aid in rebuilding the shattered Galactic Alliance. Lecersen, as leader of the Council, found the former to be an unattractive option and the latter to be unusually generous. Skywalker announced that the Moffs would have to accept Jagged Fel, son of Imperial starfighter pilot Baron Soontir Fel, as the Remnant's new leader. Lecersen was accepting of the proposal, as were several other Moffs. Han Solo, Caedus's father, then suggested that the Remnant set up a mission to aid worlds affected by recent galactic wars. Though he initially doubted if the Remnant had the resources for such an endeavor, Lecersen was persuaded by another Moff to provide support for the project. When the Hapan Queen Mother arrived, Lecersen bowed and personally apologized for the Council's actions. Ka replied by threatening the Moff with death should there ever be another nanovirus attack.

Lecersen decided to slip into a bath of warm, pleasantly-scented water before he told his comrade that he was keeping an eye on Fel; Vansyn suggested that they keep an eye on Solo, as she appeared to be leading Fel into more of a governmental relationship rather than just a personal one. Lecersen believed that the Moffs could use that to their advantage, as a distracted Fel thought he had succeeded in bringing the Moffs into line. The two Moffs agreed to wait for the moment when Fel's judgment was cloudiest to take advantage of the relationship for their own benefit. With the conversation over, Lecersen thought about how other factors, such as the current state of the galaxy, could aid the Moffs in their quest to be rid of Fel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Order, for example, had been weakened when Grand Master Skywalker had been exiled for preventing Jacen Solo from turning to the dark side, and Lecersen planned to use the Order as one of many pawns in the Moffs' plans. The Jedi did not prove a threat to the Moffs again, as they were too busy dealing with the oppressive policies that Chief of State Daala was implementing. Lecersen likened all the pieces as threads which could be weaved into a tapestry that would display the Moffs restored to power and glory\u2014without Jagged Fel as their leader. Lecersen later contacted Vansyn again to ask if the latter was watching HoloNet News and Entertainment's broadcast of reporter Javis Tyrr's exclusive interview with Acting Jedi Grand Master Kenth Hamner, the Mon Calamari healer Cilghal, the Chadra-Fan Jedi Tekli, and the two remaining Jedi Solos\u2014Leia Organa and Jaina.

Tyrr planted the cleaning droid in the New Jedi Temple, where it was able to captured footage of Jedi Yaqeel Saav'etu and Bazel Warv succumbing to the effects of Force psychosis. The reporter was also able to plant a spy droid within Jagged Fel's limousine, where it recorded Fel telling Jaina Solo of Chief of State Daala's plan to hire Mandalorians to deal with the Jedi.

As the two drank Ryborean gax, Lecersen couldn't help but cringe as Tyrr downed glasses of the expensive liquid. When they began watching the video, the Moff was initially unimpressed by what he saw\u2014after all, he had already seen the events at the Jedi Temple unfold live three hours earlier. But Tyrr urged him to keep watching as he fast-forwarded to the spy droid's recording of Fel and Solo's conversation within the limousine. Lecersen, much like Solo had been, was shocked to learn of Daala's plan to hire Mandalorians, but he was also amazed that Fel would so easily reveal an Alliance secret to a Jedi. The recording stopped as Tyrr approached the limo to download the data from the spy droid, which worried Lecersen that there was a potential that the droid would be traced back to the Empire.

Given that the model cost millions of credits, she concluded that Tyrr must have had help in obtaining the device. After comparing the device with a similar eavesdropping model uncovered from Moff Lecersen's chamber aboard the Anakin Solo after the Battle of Shedu Maad, she realized that Lecersen had supplied Tyrr with the parasite droid. Realizing that the Moff most likely wasn't content with Fel's leadership of the Empire, Solo contacted Fel and informed him of her findings.

The initial kidnap attempt failed when Fel was able to sound the alarm and defeat the attacking stormtroopers. Fel told Jaina Solo that the Moffs were probably behind the attack, but he doubted that Lecersen had been involved, noting that the attempt had been crude by the Moff's standards and would have probably been a last-ditch effort for him. Lecersen conducted his own investigation into the incident and found nothing that implemented any of the Moffs in the attack; rather, he had traced transactions through a Borleias bank all the way to Senator Treen. The Moff revealed this information to the Kuati senator in a temporary office within the Galactic Empire Embassy on Coruscant, and promptly asked her why she had wanted to kidnap Fel. Her response caught him off-guard\u2014she declared that she wanted him to become Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Kuat Embassy, Treen revealed that she wanted a return to the benevolent form of Palpatine's Empire and that Lecersen was the man who could accomplish the task.

Through a series of political maneuverings, Treen planned to manipulate a crisis that would dispose Daala, leaving the Kuati Senator to become the new Chief of State. To ensure everything went flawlessly, Treen had already secured the support of Senator Fost Bramsin of Coruscant, who would give her a tactical advantage in the Senate and the Armed Forces. In return, Treen merely wanted to become Grand Moff of the Corusca sector and have four dinners with Lecersen\u2014hopefully enough for her to convince the Moff to make her his Empress.

Lecersen arrived dressed as Emperor Palpatine, going so far as to perform a decent impersonation of Palpatine's voice. While the four of them played a high-stakes game of Chambers, they discussed what to do with the Bothan Admiral Nek Bwua'tu, whose loyalty to Daala would interfere with their plans. Jaxton, who won the game despite the Moff's best efforts, simply proposed to kill him if he would not bend to their will. Bwua'tu was later ambushed by two lightsaber-wielding assassins masquerading as psychotic Jedi; the attack, orchestrated by the conspiracy, left the Bothan admiral in a coma. Although Lecersen had been disappointed that Bwua'tu hadn't been killed, the resulting coverage of the Bothan's condition proved beneficial, as it served to distract Daala from her duties as Chief of State."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After learning that Fel and the Solo family would be dining at the Pangalactus restaurant, Lecersen sought to use the opportunity for an assassination attempt on Fel. The Moff had Kester Tolann, a Chiss-hating disgruntled grandson of an Imperial Navy commander relegated to waste management by the Chiss Grand Admiral Thrawn, enlisted to attempt to kill Fel. Lecersen realized that Tolann's chances at success were very slim, so he hoped to use the failure as a means of pushing Fel into resigning as Head of State and hurting Daala's public image. The plot was codenamed \"Operation Duusha,\" named so for a type of cheese that was blue on the inside but possessed a different exterior color. Fel had been nicknamed \"Duusha\" because many saw him as being \"blue\"\u2014a Chiss, for he was raised in their culture\u2014on the inside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lecersen revealed the details of the plot to Treen, explaining that the attempt on Fel's life would appear more like a diversion for a separate attack on the Solos. The two watched on a monitor as Fel's party arrived at the restaurant and were diverted to the room next to the chamber in which Tolann was present. Lecersen explained to Treen that when a cue\u2014a recreation of the destruction of Alderaan on one of the restaurant's walls\u2014was given, Tolann would knock down the wall dividing the two rooms with a micro-thermal-detonator, grab the Imperial leader, and then kill himself and Fel by triggering another detonator attached to his body. When the time came, Tolann breached the wall only to be killed in a salvo of blaster fire; the presence of two YVH droids was not enough to salvage the attempt. The Moff, however, having watched the scene unfold through Tolann's goggles and the optic feeds of the YVH droids, counted the mission as a success. Lecersen knew that key evidence left at the scene of the crime, such as the goggles's feed, would aid in the building up of a case against Fel, while manufactured documents and communications would lead the Jedi Order to assume that Daala was the mastermind behind the attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the incident, Fel and Jaina Solo concluded that Daala may have entered into an arrangement with Lecersen or another Moff.

After some pressing on Fel's part, Lecersen responded that he would give some thought to the matter and come up with a list of candidates. The two then briefly discussed the assassination attempt, with Fel noting that Tolann's conspiracy was doomed to destruction.

When the time came for the launch of the StealthX fighters, the Errant Venture's owner, Booster Terrik, had the Star Destroyer fire upon several of Coruscant's orbital mirrors, prompting the Galactic Alliance Sixth Fleet to intercept the threat and allowing the Jedi's fighters to safely leave Coruscant.

Lecersen was disgusted by Parova's choice of costume, a cheap Bothan admiral outfit intended as a mockery of Bwua'tu, but the Moff approved of her involvement in their cabal. At Obridagar's, the conspirators engineered a poison scare to implement their coup, with Lecersen and General Jaxton allowing themselves to be temporarily poisoned to add to the veracity of the situation. Jedi Knight Seha Dorvald, who had masqueraded as the pilot of the Dust Dancer, was implicated as the individual responsible; the extent of her \"plot\" was not revealed until agents of Fleet Intelligence uncovered a canister filled with the same poison used against Lecersen and Jaxton spliced into the Senate Building's water supply.

As Lecersen sat down with Vansyn at the latter's estate, Vansyn subtly baited his fellow Moff into revealing details of the conspiracy. Feeling a pang of regret for keeping Vansyn out of the loop for so long, and hoping to use his territory as a base, Lecersen made a calculated decision to reveal his plans to become Emperor. However, as the conversation continued, Lecersen realized that he had been drawn into a trap, one orchestrated by Daala. Daala revealed that she had full knowledge of Lecersen's activities and offered him a choice\u2014join her in her plot against Fel, or die."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Forced to ally with Daala, Lecersen severed all ties with Treen's conspiracy, which immediately began to unravel as various factors turned against it. As Nek Bwua'tu emerged from his coma and began investigating the members of the conspiracy with help from others, General Thaal received word that Lecersen had allied with Daala. This revelation, combined with the fact that their recent alliance with Senator Suldar had failed to bear fruit, prompted Thaal and Treen to dissolve their cabal. In short time, Bramsin, Parova, and Jaxton were dead, and Treen had retired to Kuat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Moff, meanwhile, gathered approximately three-quarters of his personal fleet and rendezvoused with Daala in the Exodo system in preparation for her coup. Hoping to use the opportunity to personally kill Fel, Lecersen had several baradium missiles loaded aboard his flagship, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Empire Maker. Above Exodo II, Daala revealed that Fel had been assassinated by Moff Tol Getelles, much to Lecersen's surprise; however, unbeknownst to Daala and her group of rebellious Moffs, the \"assassination\" was merely a ruse, and Getelles had secretly allied with Fel. Shortly after Moffs Vansyn, Trevin, and Getelles arrived at the rendezvous with their warships, Daala's forces were attacked by a flotilla loyal to Fel, including a vanguard from the Empire of the Hand, a Remnant armada, and the turncoat Getelles's fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the battle progressed, Fel's flagship, the Gilad Pellaeon, emerged from its hiding place in the hollowed-out tunnels of Exodo II's moon, Boreleo. Lecersen destroyed the Pellaeon using several of the Empire Maker's baradium missiles, but Fel escaped to the Bloodfin to continue the battle. It was at this point that Lecersen launched a salvo of baradium missiles at Boreleo itself, destroying the satellite and sending debris directly into the enemy fleet. Daala had initially thought the move to be a crazy one, but it proved successful, causing enough chaos to give her forces a temporary advantage. However, with reports of casualties flooding in, Daala devised a new plan, one which had an Interdictor from Lecersen's fleet\u2014the Kagcatcher\u2014use its gravity well projectors to gather the remnants of Boreleo into a protective shell around her warships. While the makeshift barrier protected them from any further attack, Daala and her allies were also effectively trapped, with nowhere to go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a month of hiding within the remnants of Boreleo, Lecersen had grown tired of the standoff. The arrival of Imperial Lieutenant Lydea Pagorski\u2014in reality an avatar of the female entity known as Abeloth, who planned to use the Empire as part of her machinations to take over the galaxy\u2014had provided the Moff with the motivation to break out of his and Daala's self-imprisonment in order to renew the fight with Fel. Daala rejected Lecersen's idea, as she knew that such a move would prove chaotic and end her plans of ruling an intact Empire. Though the Moff threatened to take his chances in battle, preferring to fight rather than surrender, Daala suggested a third option. With the input of Abeloth's Pagorski avatar, the admiral proposed a general election for Head of State, convinced that such a contest could easily oust Fel from power and place Daala in charge of the Empire. Though Lecersen scoffed at the idea, Abeloth/Pagorski displayed her powers by forcing the Moff to prostrate himself at Daala's feet, proof that the entity could deliver the election to Daala. The proposal essentially ended the battle, as both Fel and Daala instead worked to deny each other victory in the political arena. In the end, however, neither Daala nor Fel won the election, and the position went to Admiral Vitor Reige when Fel dropped out of the race to ensure Daala could not win."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An old-school Moff admired by Gilad Pellaeon, Lecersen always kept himself combat-ready should the need for battle arise. He was considered part of the \"new breed\" of Moffs, who, according to Pellaeon, were more enlightened than their predecessors. Lecersen was a firm believer in duty, putting it before personal gain. As the result of his many addresses and news broadcasts, the Moff and his appearance and manners were well-known to his constituents in Imperial space. Following the Mandalorian slaughter of Moffs on Nickel One, Lecersen assumed command of the Moff Council as its ranking member. Lecersen possessed an analytical mind; he considered himself capable of finding numerous opportunities which could be exploited for personal gain, like searching for credcoins on the ground. Lecersen was also skilled at reading body language, using it to excel in politics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much like the rest of the Moffs, Lecersen desired to see the Imperial Remnant transformed into a second Galactic Empire. To see this dream come true, Lecersen was willing to ally the Remnant with the Galactic Alliance under Darth Caedus. However, the Moff was not willing to see the Remnant submit to the will of the Alliance; thus, he had Remnant forces perform independent attacks such as the assault on the Roche asteroids. Though Caedus disapproved of the Moffs' decision to attack without first consulting him, Lecersen showed no fear in telling the Sith Lord that he had no place in the decision-making of the Remnant. Gradually, however, Lecersen became somewhat subservient to the Alliance Chief of State; by the time of the Battle of Shedu Maad, the Moff was addressing him as \"Lord Caedus\" and advising him during the engagement. In the aftermath of the war, he disapproved of Alliance Chief of State Daala's decree to add more females into the ranks of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the civil war, Lecersen gradually became more ambitious. As a result of his desire to remove Fel as leader of the Empire, Lecersen had begun to seek out numerous opportunities which he could use to restore the Moffs to glory as leaders of the Empire. He believed that ambition and intelligence without morality were the keys to being a great leader. As such, he occasionally employed torture\u2014despite his dislike for it\u2014to extract information from unwilling beings, keeping an IT-O Interrogator handy for such needs. When the subject caved in and revealed what the Moff was looking for, Lecersen had the being's life ended quickly and without pain. He had no qualms about using people like the journalist Javis Tyrr to further his own goals when he was unable to do so by himself. The Moff planned to use Tyrr's information to remove the Jedi Order and the Solo family as threats to the Moff Council, which would put Lecersen and his Moffs in the perfect position to drive their metaphorical vibroblades into Jagged Fel's back when the time came to remove the Head of State."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lecersen's ambitions were used to great effect by Kuati Senator Treen, who convinced the Moff to join her conspiracy when she offered him the position of Emperor in a renewed Empire. Although the idea for the plot had been Treen's, Lecersen became its titular leader. While involved in the plot, the Moff frequently manipulated events to further the group's plans, including developing the Freedom Flight into a galactic movement merely to distract Chief of State Daala. Lecersen believed that honorable individuals who stood between him and a goal deserved to be respected; as such, when Admiral Parova mocked the comatose Nek Bwua'tu, who had been an obstacle to the conspiracy's aims, the Moff wondered if he had judged Parova correctly. When confronted by Daala, the Moff was forced to abandon the conspiracy to save his life; without him, Treen's plot rapidly disintegrated. As a backer of Daala's bid for Empress, Lecersen continued to despise the woman, but he found that an alliance with her against Fel was, in some ways, more beneficial than an alliance against both her and Fel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lecersen owned a lavish estate on Coruscant, an expensive private residence situated on multiple acres and decorated with luxurious furnishings from across the galaxy. In addition to drinking only the best caf available, Lecersen enjoyed several fine alcoholic beverages. He savored the taste of Hapan gold wine\u2014something he saw as a bittersweet irony, given his dealings with the Hapes Consortium during the Battle of Shedu Maad. He also valued the flavor of expensive Ryborean gax; because of its cost, Lecersen was annoyed when Javis Tyrr drank glasses of the liquor during their one meeting. An occasional gambler, the Moff participated in several high-stake card games, including a Tendrando Arms-sponsored celebrity sabacc challenge with an entrance fee of 1,000,000.

Troy Denning later used the Moff, albeit in a more prominent role, in 2008's Legacy of the Force: Invincible, the ninth and final book in the same series.
