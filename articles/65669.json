Their efforts were typically unnoticed by the general population until the Declaration of Rebellion was issued by Mon Mothma. The Bureau repurposed their mandate in the wake of the Declaration to portray the Rebellion as made up of madmen, pirates, and outlaws. The events of the Battle of Yavin were portrayed by the Imperial Propaganda Bureau as being the fault of Imperial incompetence rather than the strength of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and played up the strength of the Imperial military over the paltry forces of the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
