The plant destroyed other plants grown near it and leeched all nutrients from the soil it was grown in, leaving behind gray dirt that would remain useless until it was fertilized or eventually recovered over many seasons. When the Empire took over the moon Raada a year after its formation, it forced the moon's farmers to grow the plant. It killed the food crops they would have harvested, and ruined Raada's fields."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
