Invading Mandalorian Neo-Crusader legions from the fringes of known space put the Republic on the defensive, conquering many systems on the edges of Republic control, starting in the far-flung reaches of the Outer Rim. The Mandalorians progressed toward the center of the galaxy, prompting Republic Navy Captain Saul Karath to establish a defensive cordon known as the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line. Heavy fighting occurred along that barrier, although the Mandalorians were not able to break through. One of the worlds along the line was Suurja, an agrarian planet with a population of 16 million colonists. About four months after the Mandalorians' capture of the Republic Flashpoint Stellar Research Station, the invaders set their sights on Suurja. The first engagement at Suurja between the Republic and Mandalorians was inconclusive, but both sides were still ready to fight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Republic naval forces, commanded by Saul Karath, soon battled the Mandalorians again for Suurja.

Over the next few weeks, the Republic and the Mandalorians engaged in two more battles at Suurja. This and the other battles of Suurja were reported upon in an edition of the Taris Holofeed news report from the nearby world Taris. In the release, Republic defense official Catronus Steffans was quoted as optimistically saying that the stalemate at Suurja represented a success of Karath's defensive cordon, and that it heralded an upcoming Republic pushback."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The second battle on Suurja garnered its first and only mention in The Taris Holofeed: Prime Edition, a short postscript to the 2006 comic Knights of the Old Republic 0.
