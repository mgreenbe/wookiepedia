Infidels were treated with disdain at best, although violence was far more common. The Yuuzhan Vong had a deep-rooted hate and fear of any and all types of artificially-created technology, such as droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Any sort of technology that was not natural was destroyed if at all possible by the Yuuzhan Vong. In particular, it seemed that any sort of machine that produced fire was viewed with extreme prejudice. This hatred was so ingrained into the culture of the Yuuzhan Vong that Vua Rapuung attacked Anakin Solo, whom he had gone to some trouble to ally with, after Solo used a grenade to start a fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
