One evening during the Cold War between the First Order and the Resistance, Thamm was managing a high-minimum Hazard Toss table in the casino where the Suerton gambler Dodibin entered into a streak of successful bets. The gambler's success soon drew a large crowd, which the Heptooinian Kaljach Sonmi tried to hide in to avoid the casino's head of security Pemmin Brunce. Brunce caught up to Sonmi and pinned him against Thamm's table, causing the Heptooinian to drop a cantocoin which then landed amongst the coins making up Dodibin's bet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thamm then called bets closed on the table, and after another patron rolled the polyhedrons involved in the game, the croupier declared the results as three threes, meaning Dodibin won again. Thamm then used his croupier stick to brush the Suerton's winnings into his pile, counting Sonmi's coin as part of the bet. Dodibin started to speak with Sonmi and Brunce, and since he didn't remove his bet, Thamm counted him as having let his bet ride. The polyhedrons were rolled again, and once again Thamm declared triple threes, meaning Dodibin and Sonmi had won again. Dodibin then declared he was out, and after Thamm delivered his winnings the Suerton left the table along with Sonmi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thamm was a tiny quadruped who was small enough to stand on the tables of Canto Casino and use his croupier stick like a push broom.
