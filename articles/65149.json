To hide its operations, the division was publicly referred to as the Imperial Biological Welfare Department. To the public, its goal was to protect the Empire's citizens against biological weapons and ensure their welfare. The Imperial Biological Welfare Division was an organization created to cover up the work of the Biological Weapons Division, claiming to be working to protect species survival from diseases."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known Projects"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is known that the Imperial Biological Weapons Division were experimenting with the Blackwing virus (Imperial bioweapons Project I71A).
