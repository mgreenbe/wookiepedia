As a rookie trooper or \"shinie,\" he was stationed at the Rishi moon listening station, an outpost to warn the Republic of an Confederate attack on the planet Kamino. In 22 BBY, during a meteor shower, Confederate commando droids infiltrated the station and killed CT-327. Sergeant CT-19-7409 sent troopers Nub and CT-00-2010 to look for 327, however, both were taken by surprise and killed by the droids. CT-19-7409 ordered the other four clone troopers to signal the fleet before the battle droids killed him, although the droids jammed the signal. Cutup, along with fellow troopers CT-21-0408, CT-782 and CT-27-5555 escaped through a ventilation shaft. After coming out the shaft, which led them outside the station, Cutup was attacked and eaten by a Rishi eel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Training on Kamino"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, CT-4040, nicknamed \"Cutup,\" was one of the many clones of Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. He along with the rest of Domino squad underwent training on the planet Kamino where he and squad were doing very poorly. Cutup did not seem to take the tests very seriously, joking around and making disparaging comments about his squad's efficiency. Despite his light-hearted manner, he did show concern for his brothers, shown in the Citadel Challenge test in which CT-00-2010, nicknamed Droidbait, was shot and injured, as he was the only one in the squad to stop and check up on his wounded comrade. He soon abandoned Droidbait under the duress of his other squadmates, which led to the failure of the test."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Bric asked for Cutup in the hangar bay, believing the clone to be the reason why his squad was failing, Cutup once more showed his lack of solemnity, going as far to mock and insult his trainer, causing Bric to physically assault Cutup and scorn him for his jesting nature. After this incident, he was able to work with his squad in the final test, warning his comrade CT-27-5555 of flanking droid fire and pushing forward with the others with effective teamwork. Domino Squad passed and they all graduated and shipped out to fight the CIS."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Rishi Station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The escalating war demanded more clone troopers and many younger clones - including Cutup - were pushed into service in the Grand Army of the Republic. Cutup was stationed on a remote Listening post on the moon of Rishi, which was supposed to warn the Republic Navy in case of a Separatist attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Cutup, along with fellow troopers CT-21-0408, CT-27-5555, CT-782, Nub and Droidbait were inside the station, clone trooper CT-327 was outside guarding the base. Inside the base, while Cutup was arm wrestling with CT-782 and lost, the clones entered a brief conservation with CT-21-0408 and CT-27-5555 about the boring work at the station. Sergeant CT-19-7409 appeared and informed them that some officers will come on an inspection. Soon, their long range sensors detected an incoming meteor shower."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clones raised the defensive shields, which blocked any meteors that land too close, although several struck in the crater plains outside. After a while CT-19-7409 didn't receive any contact from CT-327 and sent Nub and Droidbait to search for him. Both troopers were taken by surprise as Confederate BX-series droid commandos, after they sliced the door open and killed both clones with blaster shots. The other clone troopers recognized the attack and CT-19-7409 began fighting the droids. The clone sergeant ordered the other four troopers to signal the fleet that they are being attacked, but the droids jammed the signal. CT-19-7409 was quickly slain by the fire of the battle droids and Cutup, CT-782, CT-21-0408 and CT-27-5555 escaped through a ventilation shaft before the door was cut open. After leaving the shaft outside the station, the clones conferred about what to do. Then, a Rishi eel appeared behind Cutup, dragged him away and killed him. The three surviving clone troopers were able to retake the station with help of Commander CC-2224 and Clone Captain CT-7567 who had arrived to inspect the outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone cadet, Cutup showed qualities of being the clown of Domino Squad, telling jokes, teasing his fellow cadets, making light-hearted comments about other cadet squads, and mocking his trainer, Bric. Nevertheless, Cutup cared greatly for his fellow cadets, stopping to check on a wounded Droidbait when the clone was shot from behind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being shipped out to the Rishi Moon, Cutup, like most of the other clones there, was an inexperienced rookie trooper and he was bored with working at the station. He challenged Hevy a lot, but they got along well, participating in idle entertainment like arm wrestling. He would also join Hevy in teasing Echo, because the trooper was focused on protocols and manuals. Cutup sported a goatee while he served on the Rishi Moon, perhaps embracing his own individuality like many of the other clones during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Cutup\" first appeared in \"Rookies,\" the fifth episode of the first season of the the Clone Wars TV series, aired at October 24 2008. He also appeared in the first episode of the third season, titled \"Clone Cadets,\" which chronologically took place before \"Rookies.\" In the episodes, he was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who voices all clone troopers through the series. To make the clones of Domino Squad more unique from one another, Cutup was given a Scottish accent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
