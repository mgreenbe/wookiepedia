The engineers were taken severely by surprise. The droids that ambushed them where disguised as sweeper droids and swiftly killed engineers outside, taking the ones inside the generator center by surprise. One engineer hid behind a computer console and found a blaster. He then got up and shot one of the droids, who resisted the shot and killed the engineer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
