By this stage, Ania and Ramid had reconciled their differences after they were forced to work together to evade a mysterious bounty hunter, who was hunting for Ania. This bounty hunter was Teemen Alton's true murderer and wanted to frame Ania for a crime she had never committed. He contacted Jao and Sauk to bring them the good news. By then, Jao had been contacted by his mentor Master Yalta Val, who had found evidence exonerating Ania of the murder of Teemen Alton. While AG-37 continued to the settlement on foot, Jao and Sauk flew AG-37's freighter to rendezvous at the settlement. When Ania and Ramid arrived at the settlement, they were ambushed by the bounty hunter, who managed to kill Ramid.

Ania reluctantly complied with AG-37's wishes, and she was recaptured by the bounty hunter, who attempted to frame her for Alton's murder by severing her left hand and implant her prosthetic hand on Ania.

Following her acquittal, Ania was reunited with her companions Sauk, AG-37 and their Imperial communications droid. AG-37 was gratified that things had gone in Ania's favor.

Despite this predicament, the Empress saw a solution to Jao's legal situation.
