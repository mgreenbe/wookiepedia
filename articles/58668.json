They were capable of scanning a broad band of subspace frequencies, and could pick up on nearly any hypercommunications originating within ten light-years of the receiver. Additionally, since the HSI could detect the smallest of fluctuations in hyperspace, skilled operators could use the device to track vessels through hyperspace, obtaining several minutes' warning before a ship was to exit or gaining a good portion of the general course and direction of a vessel in hyperspace. The cost of an HSI-280 hyperwave signal interceptor was 10,500 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The HSI-280 hyperwave signal interceptor was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon in Gadgets and Gear, a 2019 supplement to Fantasy Flight Games' series of Star Wars Roleplaying products.
