On top were lights housed in truncated, conical projections, one of which was blue and the other red. On the front were two photoreceptors that projected from conical housings, as did a camera.

A probe heard the shot and responded to the scene. Seeing only Duchess Kryze, the probe assumed she had killed Golec. The Duchess fled the scene, and the probe, after informing nearby security forces of the situation, followed after her with CSF police droids and Coruscant Guard shock troopers joining the chase.
