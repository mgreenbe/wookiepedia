He operated primarily in the Outer Rim, having been spotted on Elshandruu Pica, in the Minos Cluster, and the Parmic sector. Gundark dealt in military weapons, military explosives, and stolen goods, and was suspected of having been involved with Black Sun at one time. His heavy build suggested a background on a high-gravity world, and his face was concealed at all times by a sunvisor or goggles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
