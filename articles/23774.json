Later HNN reported that the ship had been recovered by the Carnifex, but Rebel spies reported that the Carnifex was still looking for the ship. In reality the story was all a plan by Admiral Veritts, commander of the Carnifex, to lure Rebels close to an Imperial cargo ship, the Lifeline, then unleash its secret weapon, a battery of gravity well projectors. While the Rebels struggled to escape, the Carnifex and its escort ships swept in to disable the Rebel ships, capture them, and interrogate the prisoners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
