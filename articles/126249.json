The Sith apprentice Ry Nymbis stole the ritual from the chambers of his Sith Master Darth Caldoth in hopes to kill him. Caldoth, however, anticipated this, and altered the words to the ritual so that it would target the speaker, rather than the speaker's intended victim. When Nymbis recited the ritual, he fell to it instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
