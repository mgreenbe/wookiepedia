He was tall, broad, and pale. He looked human with a little Kiffar spliced in, although this was never specified as such. Kefka was responsible for the manufacture of droids produced by Cestus Cybernetics, including the JK-13 security droid. In 22 BBY, the Families of Cestus Cybernetics conspired to overthrow the Regent G'Mai Duris from the government of Ord Cestus, hoping to replace her with a more pliable puppet. The Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Vippit barrister Doolb Snoil encouraged the Regent to be wary of trusting the Families, but were unable to find a peaceful resolution."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the failure of diplomacy, the supercruiser Nexu bombed the bunker where Kefka and many members of the Five Families were hiding in the midst of attacks from the revolutionary group Desert Wind. Many of the heads of the Five Families perished in the destruction, and the remaining members of the Families made an agreement with the Regent and the Galactic Republic, with Regent Duris retaking control of Ord Cestus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
