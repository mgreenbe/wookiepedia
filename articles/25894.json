A Mantellian Savrip defeats a Monnok. Chewbacca growls in rage. C-3PO counters that R2-D2 made a fair move and that screaming about it can't help him. Han Solo tells the droids to let Chewbacca have it because it is not wise to upset a Wookiee. The camera zooms in on Chewbacca's menacing face and eyes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In several flashback and future scenes, Chewbacca growls into Han's face and later at a mouse droid aboard the Death Star. He also threatens a Rodian, then a stormtrooper, and manhandles Lando Calrissian on Cloud City. There is also a scene of Chewbacca and Han Solo fighting stormtroopers in a corridor. Returning to the present, C-3PO sees Han's point and counsels R2-D2 to let the Wookiee win."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
