Their job was to make sure that troops remained loyal to the regime. They were tasked with discovering any trespasses against the Empire, from mild breaches of conduct to outright betrayal. In order to do that, loyalty officers were trained to read body language and detect lies. They would also use more direct approaches, such as searching a suspect's quarters, digging through his or her files, and asking his or her superiors about any instances of disobedience that might have occurred in the past. Due to their functions, loyalty officers inspired terror in the members of whatever base, battle station or office they were dispatched to. A loyalty officer could also be assigned a squadron of TIE fighter pilots, and a such had the right to wear a distinctive flight uniform with red accents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "About four years after the Battle of Yavin, Sinjir Rath Velus was one such officer, and he was stationed at the Imperial shield base on Endor.
