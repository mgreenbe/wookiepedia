In the aftermath of a Republic special forces mission to capture a Confederacy scientist on Qiilura, the Qiilura system became host to a Republic military presence that was eventually forced to evict and resettle the planet's Human colonists elsewhere, in accordance with a deal that had been struck with the indigenous gurlanins. Though many colonists complied peacefully, hostilities eventually broke out on the agriworld's surface between resisting farmers and the Republic clone troopers meant to oversee the evacuation. The Confederacy later attempted to annex the Qiilura system, though a Republic fleet bearing the forces of Clone Commander Wolffe's 104th Battalion was dispatched to intervene."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Republic's transformation into the Galactic Empire, the Qiilura system fell under Imperial control.
