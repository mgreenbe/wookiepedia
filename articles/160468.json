There are some who believe that the Verpine simply just copied the Bothan droid disruptor. However, the Verpine say that one can't argue with results and in some ways the Verpine version of the weapon can be seen as an improvement of the original. This ion weapon could bypass certain defenses that other types of blasters and similar arms could not. One disadvantage of this high power was that they could not use most types of power pack upgrades."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
