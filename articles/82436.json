This discrepancy remained unaddressed until The Essential Atlas, where a second planet, Little Kessel, was identified in close proximity to Kessel. Jason Fry later confirmed in the Jedi Council Forums that Little Kessel was created to retcon the two different interpretations of Kessel, and that Little Kessel was the lush version found in The Second Kessel Run."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
