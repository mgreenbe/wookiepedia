The droids relayed information updates between themselves on a regular basis, allowing them to coordinate chores and errands while still communicating with their fellow droids. For example, H-3POA was given to Vago for use in negotiating. H-3POB served onboard the Imru Ootmian, Popara's personal starship. H-3PO droids were different from other 3PO-series protocol droids because their access systems were able to understand a verbal signal from a specific individual. They had advanced sensors and communications systems, and were even designed with self-destruct mechanisms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
