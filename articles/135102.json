The largest temple outside of Coruscant, it was intended to serve as a hub for the Jedi Order's activities in the Outer Rim Territories and beyond. It had been designed by renowned Jedi architect Palo Hidalla. Staffed by some of the Order's most experienced members, it provided everything Jedi of all ranks might require to serve the people of the galaxy and the Force. The Jedi starship Ataraxia was also stationed at the Beacon. The Jedi were initially meant to be led by Jedi Master Jora Malli, but after her death at the Battle of Kur, Jedi Master Avar Kriss was selected for the position. Conduit 398-GX14, where technicians Joss and Pikka Adren discovered and fixed a fault with the station's power systems, was located near the temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
