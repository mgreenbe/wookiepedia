The Millennium Falcon, traveling through Yuuzhan Vong territory on a diplomatic mission to the Imperial Remnant, was decanted from hyperspace by a Yuuzhan Vong dovin basal. Captain Han Solo piloted his freighter while his wife Leia Organa Solo and the Imperial commander Vana Dorja took to its quad laser cannons. Solo developed a new tactic by using the dovin basal's gravitic pull to slingshot himself around it; the move was later dubbed the Solo Slingshot and used by the New Republic in future battles. The Falcon's crew destroyed most of the Yuuzhan Vong coralskippers that were stationed at the dovin basal, but the enemy was finished off by the arrival of New Republic E-wings and Chiss clawcraft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
