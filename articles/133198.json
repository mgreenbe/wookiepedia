Mahjo Reeloo then entered and told Ohnaka to stop talking. But Ohanka refused and offered to continue explaining the Falcon if Tik paid him. After finishing his explanation, Ohnaka offered to race the Falcon against Tik's ship.

Ohnaka was prepared to escape the Falcon but Reelo would not let him do it because it was not their ship.

The ship questioned what Reelo was doing but Reelo instead snapped back and told them that they were messing around with them. She then lied and told the other ship that they had explosives and if the Millenium Falcon exploded then they will too. Ohnaka was surprised that Reelo lied but was proud of her. The Falcon got closer to the freighter and the Weequay pirate got worried they might crash. Right before they were going to crash, the tractor beam was let go and Ohnaka celebrated. Ohnaka still wanted to get his credits from the race but they left instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on Batuu, Chewbacca was angry with Ohnaka because of what he did with the ship.
