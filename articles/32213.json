After the Necropolitans killed her son, Sycorax cursed the world and warned of the consequences of disturbing the dead. Many natives believed that thanks to this curse, dead people who were not respected would rise as zombies, which were occasionally seen to walk on Necropolis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This legend led Cornelius Evazan to visit the world, discover that the fluids of native boneworms could reanimate the recently killed, and develop a formula with similar effects. His assistant Pylum was found dead with no obvious cause at a key moment, allowing him and his zombies to be stopped. Mammon Hoole wondered if it was the curse's doing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
