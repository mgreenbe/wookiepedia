The Spanners would repair runaway droids, as well as finding them places to hide. Some Spanners trusted their masters and told them about their affiliation to the organization and would sometimes try and get their owners to help them find positions for the runaway droids. If no such positions were available, then the Spanners would send runaway droids to trustworthy droid dealerships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
