No one tangled with him, and if anyone did, they would end up dead. He stole other prisoners' food on several occasions. When he tried to steal Ferus Olin's who also was there as a prisoner, he failed and later tried to kill him. However, he was stopped because Clive Flax, a friend of Ferus's, knocked Prisoner 677780 unconscious by throwing a datacard at him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
