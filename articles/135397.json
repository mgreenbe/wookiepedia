During the High Republic Era, it set out from Port Haileap, intending to carry its passengers, including young Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh, her charge Avon Starros, Padawan Imri Cantaros and Dalnan Ambassador Weft and his son Honesty, to the new space station Starlight Beacon. En route, however, bombs went off aboard the Steady Wing, leading Rwoh, Starros, Imri, Honesty, and Starros' protocol droid J-6 to escape in a shuttle after they were separated from the rest of their party. The Steady Wing was destroyed soon afterwards, killing everyone still onboard, and the survivors became stranded on the jungle moon Wevo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Steady Wing was a large luxury cruiser owned by the Galactic Republic. It had a silver exterior which Vernestra Rwoh compared to a beached mael fish. The starship's interior had sixteen decks, one of which was entirely devoted to games. There were also three decorative gardens, including a Pantoran-style hanging garden on the third deck. The Steady Wing had six dining areas, including a grand dining room which could seat more than a thousand people. There were also extensive cabins to house large numbers of guests. The ship further contained multiple game rooms and shops, including at least one jewellery store. Its hallways had golden floors and silver walls with screens that shifted between various flower patterns. Due to the Steady Wing's size, maps were posted throughout its interior to guide those onboard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Steady Wing was outfitted with a hyperdrive system, escape pods and at least one hangar bay, in which was stored a maintenance shuttle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 232 BBY, the Galactic Republic was preparing for the official opening of the space station Starlight Beacon. A diplomatic delegation from the planet Dalna, which was considering joining the Republic, planned to attend. Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh dispatched the Steady Wing to Haileap in the Dalnan sector to meet the delegation, which would travel onboard the luxury ship to Starlight. Jedi Master Douglas Sunvale, the marshal of Port Haileap, would also be coming along, along with his Padawan Imri Cantaros, young Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh, and Avon Starros, the daughter of Senator Ghirra Starros who had been sent to Haileap to study. Sunvale decided to bring along Avon and her droid J-6 in the hopes that the girl would befriend Honesty Weft, the son of Ambassador Weft, the head of the Dalnan delegation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Nihil, a group of pirates which had been causing trouble in the wake of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, had heard of the Republic's interest in the sector and wanted to prevent their interference. To that end, knowing that the Steady Wing would be picking up someone of importance to the Republic on Haileap, Storm Kara Xoo dispatched the Strikes Klinith Da and Gwishi to sabotage the Steady Wing, with the goal of leaving no survivors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
