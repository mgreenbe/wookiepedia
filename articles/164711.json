The Wookiee warlord Gharcanna led many of his species to settle in the forests on the surface of Ska Gora, ignoring the fact that doing so was illegal, and the Je'daii Council dispatched Je'daii Ranger Lanoree Brock to Ska Gora to settle the matter. Brock tried diplomatic methods to convince Gharcanna to leave, but when they failed, the Ranger was forced to turn her laser cannons on the Wookiees in order to prevent civil war breaking out between the Wookiees and those who lived on the floating city-ships above Ska Gora's surface. In her Peacemaker-class cruiser, she bombarded the surface where the Wookiees lived, killing all of the illegal settlers. Brock was haunted by her actions on Ska Gora, and regretted how Gharcanna had refused to back down and forced her hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiee land wars were first mentioned in the short story The Adventures of Lanoree Brock, Je'daii Ranger, and it was expanded upon in the short story Eruption and the novel Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
