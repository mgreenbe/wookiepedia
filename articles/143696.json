The teaching course was developed by Benevolent Guides V-Tan and O-Vieve in roughly 59 BBY. It emphasized that happiness came from contributing to the General Good rather than seeking other personal gratifications. Additionally, students were taught misleading \"facts\" about planets, systems, and people outside of the Kegan system, to encourage isolation of the planet from the outside galaxy. The curriculum covered students from young children aged four up to sixteen years old; however, exceptions were made for people like V-Davi, who started his education at the age of two when his parents died due to the Toli-X outbreak. At the age of twelve, students went before a committee that decided the career path for their continued education and future occupation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
