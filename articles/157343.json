He had plating colored entirely black, with a singular red sensor. When Veldar attempted to collect a debt from the gambler and smuggler Lando Calrissian, the sentry droid accompanied her to Neral's moon, locating Calrissian's starship, the Millennium Falcon, in a docking bay. Calrissian's droid accomplice, L3-37, lied about his location when questioned by Veldar, and warned Calrissian of the hunters. The sentry droid remained in the docking bay and confronted L3-37 with a blaster, threatening her to reveal Calrissian's location. However, the droid was shot and destroyed by Queen Forsythia Jin of Hynestia, who hadfollowed Calrissian to the moon in search of her daughter Rinetta Gan, who had stowed away on the Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
