Vulgarr implored the Ewoks to send as many warriors as they could spare to fight the beast and reclaim the child, but Arbo urged caution and suggested they consult the shaman Logray first. Nevertheless, Chief Chirpa, leader of the Bright Tree Ewoks, ordered the tribe's warriors to pursue the creature. This strategy left the women and elders to guard the village and its woklings. Vulgarr and his band took advantage of the lowered village defenses to kidnap the remaining children."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arbo makes a brief appearance in The Adventures of Teebo: A Tale of Magic and Suspense, written by Joe Johnston and published in 1984 by Random House.
