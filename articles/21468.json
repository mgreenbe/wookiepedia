Consisting of a large central room capable of seating several hundred guest at once, the cafetorium's kitchens were able to produce food to feed all of them.

During the war, a Trandoshan named Xirossk fled the station by cutting through the cafetorium after stealing a PU-36 modulator chip from the starship of the Heroes of Cularin. The heroes set out in pursuit, and they asked a number of the patrons if they had seen where Xirossk had gone. Among the Bothans, Sullustans, Humans, Wookiees, Duros, Rodians and Twi'leks patronizing the establishment, the heroes were able to glean some information as to where the criminal had gone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
