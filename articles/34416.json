The staff began to manipulate the Oblee; it summoned a shadow creature, a type of energy-based being that fed on emotions, to the atmosphere of Oblis, and influenced the Oblee into viewing the creature as a threat. The Oblee were determined to use the Darkstaff to power a weapon that would force the shadow creature away from their world, but when they activated the machine, the Darkstaff used the power that it absorbed to destroy Oblis. The remnants of the planet eventually settled to form the Cularin system asteroid belt, and the Darkstaff came to be located within the asteroid I-9. Years afterward, the Sith Lord Darth Rivan was drawn to the Cularin system by the Darkstaff's power, and he sought to gain control of the artifact. During a pivotal battle against the forces of the Jedi Order, Rivan gained possession of the staff and it generated a hyperspace wormhole that transported him hundreds of years into the future, to one of the battles of the Ruusan campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In about 31 BBY, the Force-sensitive criminal Len Markus traveled to I-9 and seized the Darkstaff for himself. However, as Markus departed from the asteroid belt with the artifact, a kilometers-long bolt of Force lightning was fired from Darth Rivan's fortress on the planet Almas, which struck the Darkstaff and created a time vortex that transported the Cularin system ten years into the future. The lightning bolt damaged the staff, so Markus made a deal with the slaver Phylus Mon whereby Mon would repair the artifact. Mon took the staff back to the Cularin system, where the artifact regained some of its strength by feeding on several Force essences that Mon had trapped inside a crystal pyramid. However, the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents that operated in the Cularin system, boarded Mon's starship and shattered the pyramid before the Darkstaff could fully repair itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Darkstaff returned to Len Markus, who aided the artifact in pursuing its new goal: the destruction of the Cularin system.

After learning the location of the Eye, Markus took the Darkstaff to the ch'hala Heart Tree, where the Jedi artifact was hidden.

The rod was brown in colorone meter in length and four centimeters in diameter, and it was crooked at one end, with a blue shining light at the other. Though the staff was created to feed off the Force, the relic was not itself a Force-imbued object. All light that passed near the artifact was consumed by the Darkstaff, which was able to produce black, smoky tendrils that allowed it to suck the Force essences out of living individuals and to drain energy from Force artifacts. However, the staff was unable to consume the Force essences of individuals who freely sacrificed their lives as a result of compassion and love. The staff used the energy that it absorbed to strengthen itself; if it absorbed a large enough quantity of Force energy, it gained the power to destroy an entire planet. For protection, the staff could create an area around itself that was devoid of the Force. It could teleport itself to a different location, although it was unable to transport itself in such a manner when it was located within one kilometer of the Eye of the Sun, an artifact that was imbued with the power of the light side of the Force. The staff was immune to the effects of all Force powers and to all forms of energy damage, including lightsaber attacks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The staff was able to possess the minds of individuals, which allowed it to use people as vessels through which it could communicate, speaking with a dark, rough-sounding voice. It could control non-sentient creatures, although animals could be released from the Darkstaff's influence by an application of the power Force Light. Furthermore, the staff had the ability to transform creatures into Sithspawn, dark side\u2013influenced mutants, and could be used to animate corpses, to create dark side\u2013using zombies. Cadavers that were exposed to the Darkstaff for extended periods of time were sometimes mutated by the staff's power in a manner that caused them to be strengthened, rather than weakened, when attacked with energy-based weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of an effect designed by the Darkstaff to interfere with the concentration of those around it, beings in the presence of the artifact felt an uncomfortable sensation, as if the air around them were thick, oily, and unpleasant. However, individuals could prevent the staff from affecting them in such a manner by entering a Force-induced trance. The staff had the power to drive those around it into insanity, and could prevent people whom it wounded from using the Force to heal themselves. The staff could imbue those who wielded it with some of the powers of the Sith battlelords, warrior leaders who were connected via the Force to the troops that they commanded. These properties allowed those whom the staff imbued in such a manner to bond themselves via the Force to other individuals, with any wounds inflicted onto the staff bearer being transferred to the bonded individuals, which rendered the staff bearer invulnerable to all attacks while the bonded individuals were still alive. In addition, the artifact's powers prevented anyone who wielded it from being disarmed during combat, and it could also enshroud its bearer in a cloak of shadows that concealed their appearance. In some circumstances, use of the Darkstaff by a Force-sensitive individual resulted in the staff bearer being rendered unable to connect to the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Interaction between the Darkstaff and large amounts of dark side energy sometimes could generate a time vortex capable of causing an entire star system to disappear and travel into the future. As a side effect of such a vortex, shifts in the galaxy's time stream occurred, causing some of the individuals affected by the vortex to develop timeshadows, versions of themselves that existed in an alternate timeline. The Darkstaff could be used to generate a Force storm that was capable of creating a hyperspace wormhole and transporting an individual across time and space to a different location. The staff had the power to alter the area around itself, and if it had access to sufficient amounts of energy, it could remake the part of the galaxy nearest itself into a larger version of the staff. When on a planetary body, the staff could alter the surrounding environment, by infusing the dark side into the area around itself. Byproducts of the Darkstaff's effects sometimes caused the light and dark sides of the Force to struggle against each other in the area adjacent to the staff, which generated a disturbance in the Force and prevented large pieces of technology from working when within the affected area."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Personality"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Darkstaff thrived on the suffering of others, and its primary aim was to cause destruction wherever it went.

The staff was deceitful, and it used others to achieve its own ends, preferring to be viewed by those around it as an object of desire that they wanted to use. To achieve that, the artifact played on people's emotions by appealing to their senses of greed and ambition. The Darkstaff always ensured that it was discovered only by those by whom it wished to be found, and when someone wielded it, the staff aimed to warp the mind of its user and used its powers to make it extremely difficult for the artifact to be taken from its owner.

When communicating with sentient beings, the Darkstaff did not like to be interrupted and became angered if someone spoke over it. The Darkstaff did not think of itself as being insane, because it thought that insanity was merely a word invented by weak individuals to explain why the strong held power over them.

The artifact was eventually recovered by the Sith Empire, who deemed the staff dangerous but too powerful to destroy, so it was placed into storage within the Arcanum, a space station commissioned by the Sith Emperor as a vast storehouse for holding similarly dangerous and powerful artifacts. The staff was cataloged within the repository under ID number 426-609-19752 and contained within a reliquary in the Arcanum's Specimen Storage Complex, and a warning message on a plaque next to the reliquary directed that the artifact was not to be interacted with, either physically or mentally. Around 3638 BBY, the Darkstaff was liberated from the Arcanum when the Sith Lord Tagriss raided the facility on the behalf of the Dread Masters, a group of powerful Sith who had split from the Sith Empire. Penetrating the Arcanum's Specimen Storage Complex, Tagriss found the Darkstaff and removed it from its reliquary, but was pursued by operatives loyal to either the Empire or the Galactic Republic. With the artifact in his hand, Tagriss ascended to the complex's upper levels and used the Darkstaff to free the Dashade Shadow Killer Akriss Veng in order to stall the agents while he fled the station with the relic. Tagriss took the Darkstaff to the Dread Guard Sanctum on Belsavis. The operatives loyal to either the Empire or the Republic traced Tagriss to Belsavis, and when they entered the Sanctum, they encountered Dread Guardsman Varrow, who used the Darkstaff to fight them. While the Darkstaff granted him immunity from many attacks and other powers\u2014the ability to animate stone statues and to resurrect long-dead Sith from the sarcophagi in the chamber\u2014he was unable to control the power of the Darkstaff; midway through the battle it turned on him and drained him of life.

There, it passed into the hands of the Oblee, the planet's native sentient species. The staff was studied by the scientist-philosophers, the ruling Oblee caste, who recognized that the artifact possessed great power. The Darkstaff planned to destroy Oblis, so it began to manipulate the Oblee, using its energy-draining abilities to draw a shadow creature\u2014a type of energy-based being that fed on emotions\u2014to Oblis. The shadow creature settled into the orbit of Oblis and began to meld itself into the atmosphere of the world, growing in size. As a result of the staff's influence, the Oblee began to view the shadow creature as a threat, and the scientist-philosophers planned to use the Darkstaff to power a weapon that would allow them to send the shadow creature away from their world. The Priests of Nether, an Oblee religious sect, suspected that the Darkstaff was manipulating the Oblee, but despite their concerns, work on the construction of the weapon went ahead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To power their machine, the scientist-philosophers created three focusing crystals and placed them at strategic locations around Oblis; the Oblee all channeled their hopes and fears into the crystals. The species situated their weapon inside a great hall on top of a mountain; there, a scientist-philosopher inserted the Darkstaff and one of the focusing crystals into a covered tray at the side of the machine, then activated the device. The Darkstaff immediately absorbed energy from the three crystals and created a blue-colored energy beam that burst through the ceiling of the hall and struck the shadow creature, hurling the being away from the system. However, the Darkstaff triggered a chain reaction that caused Oblis to explode seconds later. The Darkstaff and the focusing crystals were left unharmed by the cataclysm, while the Oblee were transformed into incorporeal beings that became known as \"shadow lurkers,\" trapped in a shadowy realm that was created when the staff destroyed their world.

The shadow lurkers made it their mission to hide the Darkstaff away, to protect the galaxy from the artifact, so they put in place six shadowy entrances to the chamber containing the staff, only one of which led to the staff itself. As a further defense, the disembodied Oblee installed incorporeal guardians inside the staff's chamber, which were tasked with challenging anyone who attempted to take the staff. At some point, a creature entered the staff's chamber and had its life sucked out by the Darkstaff, and over time the long exposure of the creature's remains to the Darkstaff mutated them, so that they became stronger when hit by energy weapons. The dark side of the Force sought to destroy the Darkstaff and began gathering on I-9, so the staff created a void in the Force around itself as a defense.

However, Rivan soon learned that the staff had the power to destroy him, and he became determined to nullify the artifact and eliminate the threat that it posed. However, he refused to directly search for the staff, because he believed that it planned to use him to help it leave the sector and that its release would cause great damage to the galaxy. The Sith Lord experienced dreams in which he utilized the Darkstaff for his own ends and to suck the Force out of his enemies, but he chose not to act upon these visions, believing that they were caused by the Darkstaff itself.

However, the artifact created a Force storm, which generated a hyperspace wormhole and eliminated Rivan's army of Sith battlelords. Caught in the eye of the storm, Rivan was transported hundreds of years into the future to one of the battles of the Ruusan campaign, a series of engagements that were fought on the planet Ruusan at the end of the New Sith Wars. The effects of the Darkstaff left Rivan bereft of the Force; in his weakened state, he was slain during the battle. The Darkstaff itself remained in the Cularin system, and at the same time the Ruusan campaign was being fought, a group of Jedi Masters created a Force-imbued artifact known as the Eye of the Sun on the planet Cularin. The Eye had the power to shield Force users from detection. Such properties concealed the Darkstaff, preventing the Sith artifact from being sensed from outside the Cularin system. It acted as a light side counterpoint to the Darkstaff, preventing the staff from sucking the life from all living things in the Cularin system.

There, he seized the artifact, which allowed itself to be taken by him. However, Nirama suspected that Markus was plotting to betray him, so the crime lord hired the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who operated in the Cularin system, to find Markus. The agents tracked Markus to I-9, and they arrived on the asteroid shortly after the Force-sensitive had taken the Darkstaff.

The staff later went on to appear in the 2013 game Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel, an expansion pack to the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic which became the first source to provide a visual depiction of the artifact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sources are inconsistent with regard to the capitalization of the term \"Darkstaff\"; some such as Philology, Recursion and The Eye, spell it \"darkstaff,\" while others, such as No Place Like Home, Echoes of the Jedi and Living Force: Last Stand spell it \"Darkstaff.\" As both The Complete Star Wars Encylopedia and The Clone Wars Campaign Guide, the two most recently published sources in which the staff is mentioned, both spell its name as \"Darkstaff,\" this article assumes that that is the correct capitalization of the term."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There are a number of inconsistencies regarding the Darkstaff in The Eye, one of which relates to a passage of the adventure that recounts some events from Philology in which a skeletal creature was reanimated on the asteroid I-9. Philology states that there was only one such creature and that, while the creature had been infused by the power of the Darkstaff, the creature's remains were reanimated by spirits put in place by the shadow lurkers, not by the staff. However, The Eye mistakenly states that in Philology the player characters encountered multiple skeletal creatures and that the creatures were re-animated by the Darkstaff itself. Due to the fact that The Eye retells the events from an out-of-universe perspective, recapping what happened to the player characters during Philology, this article therefore assumes that the events as described in The Eye are in error."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Eye includes another discrepancy, in relation to the Eye of the Sun. The adventure states that the Eye of the Sun was created concurrently with the Battle of Ruusan and completed two years after the battle, and that when Darth Rivan first arrived in the Cularin system, he was able to sense the Darkstaff through the Eye's shielding effect. However, it had previously been established in the Wizards.com article The Sith Fortress that Rivan had died during the Battle of Ruusan, a fact that was confirmed in the roleplaying adventure Echoes of the Jedi. Therefore, Rivan must have arrived in the Cularin system before the Battle of Ruusan and before the creation of the Eye, so this article assumes that the Eye of the Sun was not shielding the Darkstaff at the time of Rivan's arrival. A third inconsistency in The Eye relates to the diameter of the Darkstaff; while the article The Darkstaff established that the staff was 4\u00a0cm in diameter, The Eye claims that the staff has a diameter of 6\u00a0cm. The entry for the Darkstaff The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia supports the former measurement, so this article assumes that the staff was 4\u00a0cm in diameter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The appearance of the staff in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel introduced an additional discrepancy regarding the staff's color. Whereas the artifact is consistently described within the Living Force campaign as being black in color the game depicts the staff as being brown-colored. This article describes the staff as it is portrayed in Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Possible outcomes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The players of the Living Force campaign roleplay as the Heroes of Cularin, and during the adventures in which the Darkstaff appears, their choices can influence the actions of the staff. In Philology, the species of the skeletal creature that has been infused by the power of the Darkstaff varies depending upon the roleplaying experience tier of the player characters; for characters in the lower tier, the creature is a massiff, for player characters in the medium experience tier, the creature is a nexu, and for players in the upper tier, the creature is a gundark. Due to these different possibilities, the \"History\" section of this article does not specify the exact variety of creature that the staff empowered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the adventure Recursion, the player characters have a number of choices regarding what they do with the focusing crystals that link the disembodied Oblee to the Darkstaff. The players can opt to call upon the dark side and use the Force to allow the staff to absorb the spirits of the Oblee; alternatively, they can either allow the Oblee to transform into the Force or be resurrected into their physical form, severing the Oblee's connection to the Darkstaff. However, the Wizards.com article The Oblee confirms that the spirits of the Oblee were given physical form by players, thus making that the canonical outcome."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During A Mon Alone, when the Darkstaff speaks to the Heroes of Cularin through the possessed slave Alianda, the staff offers to give any character that leaves the Animiasma their heart's desire. If a player attempts to comply with the staff's request, the Darkstaff does not fulfill its promise and instead incapacitates the individual. The adventure advises that the gamemaster, the person directing the roleplaying adventure, portray the staff with a voice similar to that of James Earl Jones, the actor who voiced the character Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In The Eye, when the player characters confront Len Markus at the Heart Tree, it is possible for Markus to attempt to use the staff to turn the giant Kilassin into Sithspawn, although if he tries this, he does not succeed. It is possible for the staff to drain the life out of some of the player characters. Either one or several of the player characters then destroy the Darkstaff by channeling the light side of the Force into the artifact, and if Len Markus is still alive when the artifact is vanquished, the staff's destruction causes him to be permanently cut off from the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
