When a brutal conflict arises, two Jedi are dispatched by council member Mace Windu and presented with a new challenge: the treacherous Yinchorri. When only the Jedi's mutilated bodies return from the mission, Mace realizes how greatly he has underestimated this new foe: the volatile Yinchorri are immune to Jedi mind control. As this grave mistake weighs heavily on Mace, the challenge now lies before the Council: How can they battle a violent enemy that has no fear of Jedi Knights, as it gathers weapons that threaten the stability of the Republic?"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Issues"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
