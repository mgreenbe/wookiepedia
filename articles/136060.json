The vehicle was devoid of any wings or any engines, and was dependent on its sails and the wind. Some stormsailer pilots flew their stormsailers dangerously low, dipping into the stormsea, where the weather conditions were the most hazardous, in an effort to boost their speed. Such maneuvers were only successful about half the time, and failing could have lethal consequences."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 34 ABY, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron and journalist Suralinda Javos stole a stormsailer to escape from three pirates during a skirmish on Pheryon.
