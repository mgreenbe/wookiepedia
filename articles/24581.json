That word has two meanings: either a widow who holds a title or property derived from her deceased husband, or an elderly woman of high social station. Since The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide states that Celly Organa had a founded a family, the first meaning applies. According to Barbara Hambly, who authored Children of the Jedi, Celly Organa was single at the time of Leia's upbringing, \"either through widowhood, possibly divorce, or her own choice.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
