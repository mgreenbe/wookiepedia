At some point around 3642 BBY he was captured by the White Maw pirates and was put to work in Firefrost Lavaworks, run by a cruel boss Gradak Ungan, who chained slaves to their equipment and as punishment cut off their thermal shield, leading them to die. When a bounty hunter visited the Lawaworks on a mission to kill Ungan, Paul begged him to get the key from their shackles so that the prisoners could make a run for it. He offered his thermal shield to make it happen, ready to sacrifice himself for the other prisoners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Paul appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Bounty Hunter class mission on Hoth as \"Republic Prisoner.\" His name is only mentioned by a fellow Imperial prisoner in one of the possible dialogue branches."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
