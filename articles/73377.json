She served as the guardian of the Soul Trees, and the village legend-keeper. She lived several miles away from the village where the Warrick family lived, leading a life of solitude and oneness with nature. Kaink carried a magical staff with a crystal on top. Kaink used her staff to emit a beam of mystical force when necessary, or at other times, to hypnotize animals. She accompanied the Ewok warriors on their mission to save Mace and Cindel Towani's parents. As village legend keeper, Kaink was deferred to by the formal title \"Mistress Kaink.\" She was one of the few Ewoks who still remembered the heroism of the Ewok hero Erpham Warrick and the instrumental role of his great Ewok battle wagon. She told the legend to his grandson, Wicket Wystri Warrick, who later rebuilt the famous machine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It's unknown whether Kaink assisted Wicket and the other Ewoks in helping the Rebellion to defeat the Galactic Empire in the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Star Tours travel agency began offering tours of the forest moon.
