Accompanied by three other heavy cruisers, Attacker One was sent by the Lioaoin Regime to attack the Chiss warship Vigilant on behalf of the Nikardun Destiny when the Vigilant visited the planet Primea to collect Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo. Attackers One and Two provided flanking fire upon the Vigilant's starboard hull.
