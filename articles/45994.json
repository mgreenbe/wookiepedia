This track had a reputation for terminating the careers of upstart podracing pilots. To make the race entertaining, the wardens of the prison made sure the course's antigravity tubes were chock full of ore to smash into."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beginning again at the arena, the podracers made their way through a rather large avenue, which soon narrowed as two massive walls brought the diameter down to a single racer. As the course went down into the first antigravity tube, an alternate path could be found above it. Back out on normal gravity, the track went into a straightway until racers met the next tube, 90 degrees below them. The entrance to the shaft was on the ground, so pilots had to slow down. They exited onto a straightway, where pods thrust through a staging area surrounded by an energy field. A sewer type of area was next, with four separate tunnels to choose from. As these tunnels converged, the racers entered a zero-gravity tube; near the entrance to this tube, the beak of an Exogorth poked through the wall. Finally, the pilots landed heading straight for the arena to finish the lap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the same type of terrain as Vengeance, podracers with high ratings in top speed and cooling would do well on this track."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Tournament and race number"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This course was the first race in the Galactic Podracing Circuit tournament."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Track favorite"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Other tracks of Oovo 4"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
