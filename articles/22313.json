CT-915 was decanted just after fellow clone CT-914; the two trained together and eventually developed a brother-like bond. When the Clone Wars broke out, CT-914 and CT-915 fought side-by-side as clone troopers for the Galactic Republic. In 20 BBY, they were posted on the planet Drongar, where the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems fought for control of the valuable bota plant fields; bota possessed great medicinal qualities. Once again, the two friends were inseparable, as they were assigned to the same cohort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one of the engagements on the planet, CT-915 was gravely injured and was brought to the Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7 to receive help; CT-914 helped transport his comrade there. The surgeons of the RMSU fought for Nine-one-five's life for an entire day, while CT-914 waited for the results outside the surgery. However, the doctors were unable to save the clone's life, and CT-915 died. When CT-914 learned of his best friend's death from Doctor Jos Vondar, the trooper was stricken with grief, although he tried not to show it. CT-914 mourned for his fallen comrade, until he also met his end on Drongar in a Confederate ambush."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all clone troopers, CT-915 stood 1.83 meters tall.

Although all clone troopers were, in a sense, brothers, as they were copies of Jango Fett, Nine-one-five and Nine-one-four were especially close. CT-914 thought of Nine-one-five as a good and skilled soldier and was deeply saddened by the loss of his best friend."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "CT-915 was created by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry for the 2004 MedStar Duology, consisting of MedStar I: Battle Surgeons and MedStar II: Jedi Healer.
