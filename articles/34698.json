Maul is successful in completing the trial, and directly after Darth Sidious informs him of a task. With plans for the invasion of Naboo in place, Sidious worries of his dependence on the Neimoidians and the Trade Federation. Despite this, Sidious wants no interference from any outside forces, and orders his apprentice to strike at the heart of the criminal organization Black Sun. To aid Maul in his task, Sidious gives him an armed Star Courier that has been redubbed a \"Sith Infiltrator\" for his apprentice's use. The starship includes a cloaking generator for invisibility as well as a speeder bike and a trio of Dark Eye probe droids. As Maul leaves Coruscant, Qui-Gon Jinn senses his dark presence through a disturbance in the Force but is unsure of what he has sensed.
