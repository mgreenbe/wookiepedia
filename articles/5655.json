Specific character stats have also been unofficially made available. This information has appeared on several websites and message boards since the discovery. The early sales occurred in Spain after an alleged error indicated that the street date for sale was seven weeks before the official release. Some of the pieces appeared briefly on E-Bay before they were taken off the auction site. Wizards of the Coast has made extensive efforts to keep the content \"under wraps\" as George Lucas was explicit that he wanted the miniatures to be unveiled on the official day of release. Additionally, the legal ramifications for this could be severe since Wizards of the Coast is a publicly-traded company and the information is considered a trade secret until the official release and the official release date falls under contract law. At this time no official announcements about prosecution have been made by Wizards. Because of all of the commotion regarding this issue, WizO_Sith, a moderator for the Wizards of the Coast forums, made the following announcement on April 17th, 2007 (directly from Wizards' HQ): \"Wizards of the Coast is aware of an error in shipping of Alliance and Empire in our European market. We have taken swift and immediate action to correct the error and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
