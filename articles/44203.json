Anyone who attempted to cross through the shaft to the core would be hit by the grid, which fired powerful bolts of lightning at intruders. Callista Ming used the Force to make the grid misfire when she sabotaged the ship, though it reduced her to char and ashes. Years later, Cray Mingla and Nichos Marr would employ a similar technique, guided by the spirit of Callista, to reach the control core and finally destroy the Eye of Palpatine. Strangely, the enclision grid was also used as an execution weapon by a group of brainwashed Gamorreans while they were on the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
