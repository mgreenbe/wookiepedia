These ovoid frames projected a defensive screen of shield energy capable of deflecting blaster bolts back at the shooter and were similar to riot shields used on other systems. Sized to the wearer, the shield was generally about one-and-a-half meters long and was carried either on the wrist or held in the off-hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
