The toxin slowly rotted Aruk's brain and caused him to be addicted to it. The withdrawal caused by the sudden removal of the poison was enough to kill Aruk, leading to Durga taking over the Besadii clan. This particular poison used by the Malkite poisoners was sophisticated enough to elude thorough medical tests and postmortem evaluations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Individual Poisoners were known to carry deadly poisons on their persons at all times, to kill themselves rather than be captured and interrogated, possibly revealing secrets of their society under torture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Products"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
