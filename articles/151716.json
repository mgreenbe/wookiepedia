UniTech was also well-known for producing a variety of tools that allowed a person to directly interface with a computer's mainframe. The devices allowed for a quick untraceable entry into the system when a quick fix was important. Imperial technicians used the devices to override security systems that were malfunctioning and threatened to shut down large portions of the mainframe. At some point during the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance was able to obtain several of these devices, using them for espionage and the infiltration of secure Imperial facilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
