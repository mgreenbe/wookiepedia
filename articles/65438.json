At this time, it was just independent enough to be able to show the public some of the government's flaws. It was more blind\u2014perhaps deliberately so\u2014to the shortcomings of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's government. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, the company was renamed Republic HoloNet News to signal its opposition to the Separatist movement."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Creation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Palpatine declared himself Emperor in 19 BBY of the new Galactic Empire, the company was reorganized, given an Imperial warrant, and more or less passed back to its previous management, albeit with a few COMPNOR \"observers\" added. Apart from this, and the change of its name to Imperial Holovision, very few changes were needed to make it suit Palpatine's needs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "IHV's executives were not on the Imperial government's payroll. They were largely holdovers from the fall of the Republic, who were trained to be loyalists as a matter of course. Their allegiance to the Emperor was freely given; it did not have to be purchased. But they were still journalists, and sought a certain amount of autonomy in their reporting. What they wanted was apparently no great sacrifice for the New Order; of its own accord, Imperial Holovision staunchly maintained a pro-Imperial, pro-business, pro-individualist stance, without supporting government protection and supervision of rights. Its reporting style was detailed, sophisticated, and for the most part accurate. Rather than distort the Empire's more questionable policies, it simply ignored them altogether, ensuring that the population at large never even heard about the New Order's atrocities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Palpatine largely dismantled the HoloNet to clear the credits for his planned military buildup (19 BBY), the simple logistics of distributing IHV's latest news releases across the galaxy became a mind-boggling exercise. The company ended up having to spend more credits on collating and distributing its material than on gathering its stories. But the results were worth it; by the height of the New Order, Imperial Holovision was seen on virtually every planet in the Empire. After the Battle of Endor, Imperial Holovision was canceled, and HoloNet News, which would serve the New Republic and the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, took its place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A notable and popular newscaster for Imperial Holovision was Ashii Nermani."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, Imperial HoloVision had over 28,000 bureaus scattered throughout the Empire, Hutt Space, Corporate Sector, and the Tion Hegemony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
