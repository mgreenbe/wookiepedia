Hulking, humanoid fourth-degree droids strong enough to lift a Vulptereen off the ground by their neck, they had bronze plating and were equipped with a pair of black photoreceptors. Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars in the year 22 BBY, Arakyd sent sixty AAD-4 assault droids into Viper Tower, headquarters of Viper Sensor Intelligence Systems, during its hostile corporate takeover of VSIS, which quickly eliminated its ground floor security units. A garrison remained in order to assist with the transition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AAD-4 assault droid was originally created for HoloNet News Vol. 531 50, a 2002 HoloNet News article written by Pablo Hidalgo and Paul Ens with illustrations by Joe Corroney.
