The crystal was added to the game as part of the raid system in Hotfix 21.4. In some places in the game, the crystal was referred to as \"Ulric's Redemption\"; this article assumes that \"Ulic's Redemption\" was the correct spelling. The crystal shared the name of Ulic Qel-Droma, a Jedi turned Sith Lord who eventually returned to the light side during the days of the Old Republic.
