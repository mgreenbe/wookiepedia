A sensor jammer created static, random signals, or false responses in order to conceal one's exact position from enemy sensors. Sensor jammers were also capable of blocking communication signals. At the same time, the amount of energy broadcast by a sensor jammer would alert the enemy to its general location. Special electronic countermeasure packages could be used to help expand and scatter the jamming signal to make locating the source of the signal more difficult."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
