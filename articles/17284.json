A party was generally held on said day. People often gave special gifts to the person celebrating their birthday. One example of this was during the Rebellion era, the Ewok Princess Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka received her ruling staff on her birthday from her father, Chief Chirpa. On that day Chirpa had chosen Kneesaa as the future Chief of their Ewok tribe, and the staff symbolized this. Another example was, in 24 ABY, Jacen and Jaina Solo traveled to the Graveyard of Alderaan to get a piece of asteroid for their mother's forty-third birthday."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Examples of birthdays are Luke and Leia's birthday, which occurred on the 24th day of the 5th month of the Great ReSynchronization (one day after Empire Day), Anakin's birthday, which occurred on the fourth month of the Great ReSynchronization, and Palpatine's birthday, which occurred on the 11th day of the 8th month of the Great ReSynchronization."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
