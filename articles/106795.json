When he was still a young adult, Pondo accompanied Chief Chirpa, Warok, and other warriors to track down a monster that, according to a Dulok named Vulgarr, had kidnapped the wokling Malani. When all they found was a self-styled Dulok king named Ulgo, Pondo and the others realized that they had been tricked.
