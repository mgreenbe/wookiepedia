It is also rumored that the Trade Federation arranged a merger between Baktoid and Haor Chall arms merchants, although Baktoid denied this claim. Nevertheless, with the Trade Federation's support, Baktoid began work on several new craft, including the fearsome Armored Assault Tank and the nearly unstoppable Multi-Troop Transport. During development of these vehicles, the company made a conscious effort to adhere to a unified design style, resulting in a line of vehicles reminiscent of large and dangerous animals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Invasion of Naboo, the Trade Federation tried to distance itself from the Baktoid Armor Workshop, which was accused of providing the front line assault vehicles used in the capture of Theed and other settlements. The Trade Federation dramatically dissolved Baktoid, only to quietly transfer many of the company's manufacturing facilities and designs to other Trade Federation subsidiaries, including the illicit Baktoid Combat Automata and Baktoid Fleet Ordnance. Baktoid products and vehicles would form most of the Separatist military during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Clone Wars, Baktoid sponsored an effort to transport a Geonosian hive to Hypori, where they built a droid factory, producing troops for the incoming war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most of the Baktoid Armor Workshop's products' main power systems were located in the rear of the craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
