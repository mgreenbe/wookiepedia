A blocky transport which had its spacious storage bay outfitted for live cargo, the Tecora sported a large cargo hold in which creatures the size of a blixus could be transported, and could be competently operated by a single pilot\u2014namely, its owner, Darts D'Nar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Tecora was owned by Zygerrian slaver Darts D'Nar. A servant of Queen Miraj Scintel, D'Nar used the Tecora to transport slaves to be sold at the Royal Slave Auction so that the Zygerrian Slave Empire saw its resurgence. Through its alliance with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, D'Nar was sent to the neutral planet of Kiros to round up all 50,000 of its Togruta citizens. On the Tecora, he landed alongside a contigent of the Separatist Droid Army and abducted the inhabitants of the artisan colony and had them transported to Zygerria, while he and his ship remained to await for Republic forces to arrive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After ten rotations, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi of Grand Army of the Republic tried to negotiate a surrender from D'Nar, but with no success.

When they were exposed and captured, only R2-D2 remained free to contact Skywalker and help free Tano.
