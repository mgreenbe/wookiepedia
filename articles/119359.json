In 0 ABY, Luke Skywalker and Nakari Kelen accompanied Sakhet, the owner of the restaurant and the speeder, on a delivery run on Denon. The speeder smelled of cooking oil and had the words \"Sakhet's Noodles\" emblazoned upon its side. Sakhet used the speeder to deliver her catering orders, which might be delivered at any time of the day. She would drop the packaged food off at the client's doorstep."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
