Along the way, various obstacles were used to educate the player in the basics of game play. After reaching the shuttle bay, the player was allowed to choose a starting planet, then city. The planetary choices were Naboo, Tatooine, or Corellia. A majority of the already established cities on the planet of choice could be chosen as a starting point, such as Moenia, Theed, Coronet, Doaba Guerfel, Mos Eisley, or Anchorhead.

Han, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 arrived and escorted the player to the hangar bay, where they were attacked by three stormtroopers. After killing the troopers, Han, the player and crew boarded the Millennium Falcon and escaped the exploding station, with TIE fighters giving chase. The next sequence was meant to familiarize the player with the space-combat game play. The player commanded one of the Falcon's turrets and destroyed several TIE fighters, after which the Millennium Falcon hyperjumped to Tansarii Point Station. After arriving on the station, the player was free to complete several story-driven quests on their quest for credits and experience (the player had to reach level 5 before they could leave the station). Once the player was sufficiently experienced, the player had to aid Han Solo in repairing the Falcon. Upon doing so, Han Solo dropped the player off in front of the spaceport in Mos Eisley on Tatooine. Before leaving, Han Solo set them up with a speeder, and a contact in Mos Eisley. This led the player to working for Jabba the Hutt, first through Bib Fortuna, then directly from Jabba's Palace. Further quests in this overarching chain (known collectively as the Legacy quests) took the player to other planets, including Naboo, Corellia, and Talus. All throughout this quest chain, the player met many familiar faces from Star Wars lore, including Watto, Ephant Mon, Jabba the Hutt, Boss Nass, and Quarsh Panaka, just to name a few."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Opening crawls"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From its release in June of 2003 until November of 2005, Star Wars Galaxies used an opening crawl much like the movies as an introduction during character creation.

However, in some cases, they do not fit into the era. Keeping in mind that the time frame of this game was meant to be shortly after the Battle of Yavin (0 ABY\u20131 ABY), some elements of the game arguably should not be there:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In few of the above cases, the developers provided a reasonable in-universe explanation of these elements' existence. However, it is unknown if other sources will accept them as canon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game focused more on allowing its players to experience as many facets of Star Wars lore as possible, sometimes at the expense of consistency inside its own universe (for example, the mayor of Mos Eisley highlighted the incident in the cantina when Obi-Wan revealed himself as Jedi as something special, even though Jedi were a common part of the game population)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike the historic chronology of Star Wars, where almost all Jedi are extinct by the time frame of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, Star Wars Galaxies allows for hundreds or thousands of Jedi playing in the game, which is set in the period of time between the first film and Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the original Jedi system, a player could only become a Jedi after mastering professions chosen randomly at character creation. When fewer Jedi entered the game than was anticipated, players were helped by finding several holocrons, which would tell a player which game professions to play and master. This resulted in several \"career\" players spending hours on end writing program macros and mastering almost every profession in the game. However, after complaints from a large portion of the player base (especially those that weren't constant and devoted players and thus less willing to master multiple professions), Star Wars Galaxies was given a new Jedi system called the Jedi Trials. Under the Jedi Trials, only after obtaining various goals as a regular character was a character considered \"glowing with the Force\" and deemed worthy to train to become a Jedi. Several new tasks then became available to the player, which were revealed through various non-player characters. Such tasks included obtaining skills, destroying creatures, and visiting several Jedi-related locations. Even with the Jedi revamp in place, many in the Star Wars Galaxies community expressed feelings that the game would become an \"Army of Generals\" where the number of Jedi playing in the game will be extremely high, thus making the game less interesting for those playing non-Jedi characters. The method of obtaining Jedi skills was changed considerably under the \"Combat Upgrade\" system released in April 2005."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the NGE, anyone could become a Jedi by selecting the \"profession\" when creating their character. Arguments came up proposing that Jedi, once the NGE was released, would still be unbalanced, only this time with the odds against them. Many Jedi came into the NGE and saw that their former power was dramatically reduced. At one point, the village of Aurilia (the in-game location that served as a hub for pre-NGE Force-sensitive questing) became inactive. Players that were still inside when this happened found only a few NPCs left. Some players still wished to see the village reopened as a sort of training center for the Jedi made to ensure the old prizes don't disappear from the game. But it was later announced that Aurilia would never be returned to its former state, and was re-opened in a different form; in Chapter 7, it became the location where a player could receive quests, which, upon completion, will allow the player to access the \"heroic instances,\" which were battles against multiple \"bosses,\" with puzzle and strategy elements mixed in. These heroics were designed to be completed with a group of players, usually eight."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tie-ins"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "See also"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
