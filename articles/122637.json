It was comprised of the Senex sector and the Juvex sector. During the last years of the Galactic Republic, the Senex-Juvex was plagued by Q'anah's Marauders, a pirate group led by Q'anah, a pirate queen, seen as a folk hero in the Senex. The gang raided ships and settlements across the region until an encounter with the Judicial Forces led to a bounty being placed on Q'anah's head by the Republic, which forced the pirates to relocate their operation to the more-remote Greater Seswenna. At some point following the infiltration of Hivebase-1, the Imperial prison Accresker Jail was en route to Senex-Juvex where the Bandit purges were held."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
