It received its atmosphere thanks to the nearby gas giant Vicerv. This provided it with a barren, but survivable atmosphere. It was also home to Consolidations Unlimiteds base, which was a veritable fortress constructed beneath the surface. Increasing profits allowed the slavers to build comfortable living quarters, and all manner of amusements for the men. There was also a docking platform for any attack ships, a well-stocked arsenal, and an entire floor of slave pens to hold their merchandise. No one but the slavers and the slaves themselves are ever brought to the planet, buys are conducted at a neutral site so as to keep the location of their base secret."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
