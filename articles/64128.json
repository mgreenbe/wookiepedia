A Rodian prisoner aboard the Leviathan traded it to a companion of Revan in exchange for his freedom from the Sith warship's detention block. If asked how it was smuggled into his own holding cell, the Rodian's response was to say that the Sith were not very thorough in their search. It was then used to free Revan, Bastila Shan, Carth Onasi, and the rest of the crew of the Ebon Hawk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"ICE\" is a term coined by William Gibson in the 1984 cyberpunk novel Neuromancer.
