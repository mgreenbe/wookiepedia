Glowing a faint amber, it swirled and sucked debris in the area into its gravity well, causing objects to be crushed inside.

While Solo was able to escape the TIE squadron, he unintentionally woke a massive, vacuum-breathing beast called a summa-verminoth. Solo flew extremely close to a gravity well in the cluster. The summa-verminoth followed, but was caught by the gravity well. The massive beast's skin was torn from its skeleton and was devoured by the gravity well, while the Millennium Falcon escaped due to Tobias Beckett putting a microscopic amount of coaxium into the hyperdrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Maw first appeared in the 2018 movie Solo: A Star Wars Story.
