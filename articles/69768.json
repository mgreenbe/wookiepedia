They were jovial creatures, shedding their pink or red spots whenever they laughed. The Jeby then had to use their twelve tentacles to gather these spots and reattach them to their bodies. Jeby had three long necks, which terminated in three round heads, each with a single hair at its apex.

Located at the lateral sides of the body were six tentacles, for a total of twelve. Individuals stood on four legs. A Jeby's spots had a tendency to detach when an individual laughed, but they could be sucked back up by the Jeby's tentacles. These manipulators could also be used to handle other objects. Although the tentacles were primarily white, each featured a pink or red band at the midpoint and the tip. The Jeby's legs, while also white, were banded pink and red."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three Jeby necks originated from a single point on the body and were segmented into two different colors at their midpoints\u2014for example, one neck could be red and yellow, while another was green and light green.

The contest was initiated in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 3, which inspired Rice's first-grade teacher at a Cleveland Heights primary school to use it as an art project for the students. Star Wars Galaxy received several entries from the class, but Rice's was the only one published in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 7 (1996). The Jeby came under the \"honorable mentions\" section of the \"under 16\" subdivision. Rice's description of the Jeby leaves the beings' sentience ambiguous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars continuity editor Leland Chee has stated that published \"Design an Alien\" material is considered canon.
