He planned to kill the creature, but when Jedi Master Mace Windu objected, he threatened to reject signing a contract with the Republic that would give the Republic access to the planet's fuel reserves. He and his fellow council members were studying a manuscript, and found the Zillo Beast's vulnerability to fuel. However, when they attempted to use it to kill the beast, however, it merely angered it, to the point that left the pit to wreak havoc on Malastare. Eventually, he was happy to let the Jedi subdue the creature, after which he and his fellow council members signed the treaty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nakha Urus cared dearly for his people and Malastare's ecosystem. This caused him to be reluctant at first to allow the bomb to be used as he feared it would harm both of them.
