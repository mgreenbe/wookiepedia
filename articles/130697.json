The LucasArts staff was inspired by Grand Theft Auto, but that idea was quickly dropped due to its complexity. Another idea touted was to use a system similar to Gears of War. The game's background evolved throughout the year under the direction of company president Paul Meegan, and the title was settled on based on Coruscant's underground levels. The design would make use of the Unreal Engine. As the game was in development, Star Wars creator George Lucas suggested that it tie into the Star Wars: Underworld live-action tv series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The LucasArts staff decided to reveal the game at E3 2012 during the pre-production period.

According to sources for gamespot.com, the game had experienced major production difficulties that put it in \"danger\" of being released even before the Disney acquisition.
