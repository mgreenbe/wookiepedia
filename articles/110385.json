It could be fired through any standard grenade launcher. When it struck a target, it unraveled the conductive fibers, producing a sticky net with a diameter of up to 3 meters. If the shot was precise, then the target\u2014commonly a living being\u2014would be ensnared at this point. The operator of the launcher might then use a control panel under the weapon to unleash an electric charge that would go through a trailing guide wire from the panel to the net, stunning the captured target. The amount of electrical charge could be varied depending on the target, allowing for lethal or nonlethal applications."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A single electronet grenade weighed five kilograms and had a maximum range of a grenade launcher, which was 375 meters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The electronet was developed by the company Golan Arms.
