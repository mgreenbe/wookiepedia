As the unidentified droid operated the conveyor belt that carried the missiles, R2-D2 intentionally loaded one of the missiles backward. Once the missile was set to be launched, it would backfire, damaging the pirate's stolen Star Destroyer. To prevent his sabotage from being discovered, R2-D2 maneuvered a large overhead electromagnet over to the weapons droid, picked the droid up, and dropped it on the conveyor belt along with the missiles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An identical droid of the same model and color also appeared in the 1986 Star Wars: Droids TV special The Great Heep."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
