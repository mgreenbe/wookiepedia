He accomplished this by stringing monofilament wire around the courtyard where several priests and their mates were taking a stroll, then triggering an ancient recording of a thota, a predatory creature from the t'landa Til's homeworld of Varl. The priests panicked and stampeded right into the trap where they were dismembered by the almost invisible monofilament wires. Among the priests killed was the head Sacredot Tarrz. Sniquux was one of many mercenaries and assassins that would prepare the way for the Rebel invasion known as the Battle of Ylesia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
