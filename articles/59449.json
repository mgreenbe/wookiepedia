During Hantic's reign in Otoh Langua, Naboo's various Gungan cities were at war with each other, and as a result Otoh Langua lost a vast amount of its resources, forcing Hantic to continue fighting until he could find a solution. In the war Otoh Langua also formed a rivalry with the city of Otoh Jahai, whose Boss accused Hantic of stealing his city's Sacred Staff, an important religious artifact. However, Hantic denied the claim and had not actually stolen the staff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Gallo, the former Boss of the ruined city of Otoh Sancture, came to Otoh Langua as part of his crusade to unite the Gungan tribes against Boss Rogoe, who was controlling the war and had destroyed Gallo's city. Gallo asked Hantic if he had stolen the staff from Otoh Jahai, where he had previously visited and had agreed to find it, but Hantic stated that he did not have the staff. Hantic then told Gallo that if he somehow restored Otoh Langua's wealth, he would join Gallo's cause. On advice from his ally Marsune, Gallo and his militiagungs attacked a spaceport that belonged to Rogoe and stole its supplies to give to Hantic. In turn, Hantic thanked Gallo for helping him and donated four Kaadu Cavalry members, domesticated bipedal kaadu mounted with cannons on their backs, to Gallo's Grand Army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war against the other Gungan tribes, Hantic, a green-skinned member of his species, was forced to keep his men fighting in order to sustain his city but was very willing to seek a peaceful solution when Gallo asked him to cease combat.

The image used for Hantic in the game is also the same image used for several other Gungan Bosses who appear.
