Through physical contact with the talisman, the Sith sorcerer's ability to manipulate the Force was amplified while they focused all of their will on the execution of a desired effect. Concentration talismans were rarely used in battle due to the extreme exhaustion that afflicted the wielder following successful use of the device. Talismans of concentration were crafted in many different shapes, from amulets to pyramids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
