They were sac shaped gas bag organisms that moved about with the aid of two stubby wings. They had eighteen tentacle tongues that surrounded their mouths which were coated in an organic adhesive allowing them to latch onto large animals such as the beldon. They would then essentially be an external parasite scavenger that would move around with the larger animal and use their other tentacles to snatch airborne algae in their path. While this was their individual pattern, in larger numbers the airsquids were known to actually devour larger prey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
