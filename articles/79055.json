This odd obsession came into providential use when he spotted X-10D draft droids used by Bartokk assassins in a plot masterminded by Groodo the Hutt to destroy the Corulag Academy, thus aiding the plot's foil by the Jedi team of Noro Zak, Vel Ardox, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, Adi Gallia, Yoda and Mace Windu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bama, a Talz test-pilot for Trinkatta Starships of Esseles, became unwittingly entangled in separate schemes hatched by the Trade Federation and the Bartokks.

The Hutt did this by hiring the Outer Rim's infamous insectoid assassins to steal 50 of Trinkatta's Vulture-class droid starfighters\u2014at least some of which had already been modified and equipped with Groodo's illegal hyperdrive prototype. By creating an alliance with the Bartokk Queen and her minions, Groodo hoped not only to ruin the Federation's business plans, but also to wreak vengeance upon the Jedi, who had not admitted his Force-sensitive son Boonda to the Academy on Corulag."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After meeting up with Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn, Leeper helped rescue Bama on Esseles.

The Talz pilot and his navigator droid later accompanied the Jedi to Corulag and once again proved invaluable by alerting the Jedi, whose numbers now also included Jedi High Councilors Mace Windu and Yoda, of the Bartokk presence at Corulag Academy in Curamelle.
