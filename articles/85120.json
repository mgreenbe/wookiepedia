Despite the ship's design, only a select few of the cruisers witnessed any action during the war due to high maintenance and operation costs. The lead ship of the class, the Maelstrom, saw action under Jedi General Darrus Jeht during the war. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire, the remaining Maelstroms in Imperial Navy service were eventually mothballed and discarded. However, at least one, the Simoom, came under ownership of the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War against the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Design"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Belonging to the dagger-shaped proto\u2013Star Destroyer family of starships such as the Venator-class Star Destroyer and the Acclamator-class assault ship, the Maelstrom-class battle cruiser was manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards at a cost of 158,000,000 credits per unit and was larger than a Venator. The Maelstroms were designed to inspire awe in allies as much as they were designed to instill fear in enemies.
