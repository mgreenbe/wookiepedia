In order to prepare for the Ewok Festival of the Wisties on the Forest Moon of Endor, the wizard Logray gave a list of tasks to the young Ewoks Wicket Wystri Warrick and Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka. The last item on the list was to pick a bushel of ripe rainbow berries in order to make a large Wistie Fest pie for the festival. The pie was made with a beige, circular crust, and the berries were turned into a pink filling. During the festival, Wicket's mother, Shodu Warrick, held the pie."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wistie Fest pie appeared in the 1986 young readers book Fuzzy as an Ewok, which was written by Virginia Holt and illustrated by Deborah Colvin Borgo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
