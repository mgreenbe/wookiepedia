The plants were capable of growing roots that members of the sentient Tal Nami species, who also lived on Tal Nami, required in their diet to survive along with the fruit of the egoa tree, which grew in a separate region of the planet from the capabara plant. Their need resulted in the Tal Nami of the two different regions trading the different plants and led them to develop a code of honor for trading which always ensured that both sides got a fair deal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Capabara plants were first mentioned in Galaxy of Fear: City of the Dead, a book released in 1997 as part of the Star Wars: Galaxy of Fear series written by John Whitman and aimed at young readers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
