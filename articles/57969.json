During the Galactic Civil War, sometime in between 2 and 0 BBY, the Empire invaded Salline with the intention of taking the government center using the AT-ATs Hammer 6 and eight, as well as four AT-STs. The AT-ATs advanced down the avenue, and Hammer 6 came under attack twice from rebel forces hidden inside the upper stories of buildings using missile batteries. The second attack caused Hammer 6's hip joint to seize up, so the commander of Hammer 8, Colonel Maximilian Veers, ordered it to remain behind and serve as a 180 degree elevated turret. The Empire ultimately won the battle, with Hammer 8 routing the Rebel forces in the government center. Veers later mentioned Guildhead's Way in his report on the battle, which became known as the Pacification of Salline, and was included in the Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
