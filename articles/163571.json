In 1032 BBY, Wenna'lah and Rusher's Brigade fought for the Sith Lord Daiman, against the forces of Daiman's brother Odion. During the battle, Wenna'lah acted as an artillery spotter and after Odion deployed a Death Spiral attack vehicle, Jarrow Rusher, the leader of Rusher's Brigade, ordered Wenna'lah to assess the damage that the brigade's artillery had inflicted on the Spiral. Wenna'ah reported that the strike had caused zero damage, because the Death Spiral had raised its energy shields."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
