Sometime during the Galactic Civil War, Goorth infiltrated Cloud City. With his gaseous nature, the Neo-Bespinian was able to stow aboard a freighter and escape the planet. However, Goorth's invisible nature disappeared when the Neo-Bespinian exposed itself to foreign atmospheres. At one point when this happened, the grayish form that Goorth had taken brought a group of bandits after him. Although they tried to ionize him and disperse his molecules, Goorth had absolute control over the gases surrounding its body. As a result, Goorth was able to change the nature of the air around the bandits, suffocating them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Goorth was invisible while in the atmosphere of Bespin, but when entering other atmospheres, the foreign gases began to poison the Neo-Bespinian's body. Although naturally invisible, this poisoning gave Goorth a grayish, opaque appearance. This poisoning would have eventually killed Goorth if the Neo-Bespinian stayed in one atmosphere for too long. In order to avoid this, Goorth needed to enter small spaces, such as ships or freighters to expel the poisonous gasses, which kept Goorth from staying in one place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Goorth appeared in dossier BXLH: Les mutants dans Star Wars (Translated File BXLH: The mutants in Star Wars), a roleplaying article in the French magazine Graal 23.
