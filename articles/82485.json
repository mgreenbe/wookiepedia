Beyond its dualities, the Force had two complementary aspects; the living and the cosmic Force were symbionts, the latter possessing a will that was communicated to all life through the symbiotic midi-chlorians, which connected the living with the cosmic Force.

The presence of a lifeform could be sensed in the form of a song in a greater symphony to one, while being a leaf on a large tree or the light of a fire to another. The life force of one could be strengthened when in a Force-bond with another. Such bonds in the Force could be in turn strengthened by an abundance of non-sentient lifeforms or past shared experiences, as was the case between Elzar Mann and Avar Kriss, the latter of whom was able to focus and enhance the connections between those attuned to the Force. A being's life force could be given to another being to restore their vitality at the temporary cost of one's strength. However, the cost also extended to one's life, as demonstrated by Garro and Rey, who chose to commit themselves to their destined path in the Force, devoting to the light by acting as a Jedi; wholly letting go of themselves to eliminate users of the addictive force of the dark side, thereby restoring balance and harmony between the living and the cosmic Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin Skywalker, a fatherless vergence in the Force, fulfilled his destiny by bringing balance to the Living and the Cosmic Force, thereby fulfilling the Jedi prophecy of the Chosen One of the Force\u2014a prophecy that Qui-Gon Jinn, the to-be mentor of Skywalker and a student of the Living Force who achieved immortality by learning from the Force Priestesses to let go\u2014believed was the will of the Force.
