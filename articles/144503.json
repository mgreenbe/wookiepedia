Discovered over 200 years prior to 22 ABY and claimed by the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force, the cluster was to be used as a refuge in the event that the Chiss Ascendancy was overrun by any foreign invader. Exploration of the Redoubt by the Chiss only began in earnest around 27 BBY. The Redoubt contained high radiation levels, and the close proximity of stars to each other made navigation difficult. There were only a few safe routes into The Redoubt, and they were all guarded by Chiss fortifications, which prevented foreign intrusions. A planetoid in The Redoubt was the resting place of the ill-fated Outbound Flight Project, which crashed there in 27 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
