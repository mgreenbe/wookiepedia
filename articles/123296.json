In 22 BBY, immediately after the First Battle of Geonosis, these names were used as aliases by Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker and Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, respectively. Knowing matrimony to be against the Jedi Order's belief that such an attachment, through passion, brought one close to the dark side of the Force, the young lovers used the archaic monikers to anonymously marry, not even allowing their pastor, Pontifex Maxiron Agolerga, to know of their true identities. \"Set\" and \"Ver\u00e9\" were blissfully wed, and Agolerga was instructed to tell no one of the ceremony, ensuring the only record of the short procession would be a scroll in his Brotherhood's archives.
