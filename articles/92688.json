Often mistaken for a fungus, Monotropa Triflora possessed root systems that intertwined with nearby trees and fungus and thus allowed the plant to feed off other plants' nutrients as well as occasionally absorb properties of other plants. One variety contained a powerful opiate-like property potent enough to numb skin on contact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
