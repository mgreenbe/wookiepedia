Formerly owned by Captain Cassian Andor, Erso discreetly stole the weapon from the rebel's bag while on Yavin 4, later called out on her theft by K-2SO. Andor demanded Erso return the blaster, but the latter argued that as she was trusting him, he would have to trust her. Andor allowed his companion to keep her sidearm, much to K-2SO's surprise (and objection)."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedha"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Erso continued to carry her weapon throughout her time on Jedha, using it during a conflict between local Partisans rebels and Imperial stormtroopers at Tythoni Square.
