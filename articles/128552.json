Like blasters, most sonic weapons offered stun settings in addition to their more lethal, full-power settings. The former released a high-pitched wail that caused disorientation and/or loss of consciousness in anyone affected by the blast. The latter released a more concentrated sphere or \"bolt\" of sonic energy. When set to full power, this bolt was comparable in its damaging properties to a blaster bolt; it could shatter solid objects and break bones. Unlike blasters, however, sonic weapons could function underwater, though they required users to wear protective headgear in order to protect themselves from the effects of the sonic energy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sonic weapons were widely used against Jedi, as a Jedi attempting to block such an attack with his lightsaber would find that the bolt would simply pass around the blade, to strike with less\u2014but still quite lethal\u2014stopping power. This made them a popular choice for bounty hunters and organizations such as the Knighthunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sonic weapons existed in a variety of forms, the two most common being the sonic pistol and the sonic rifle.
