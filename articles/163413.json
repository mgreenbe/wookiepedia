The young Rodian was discovered to be Force-sensitive during his early infancy, but was not to be taken into the Jedi Order until a slightly older age. Dunn's identity was entered into a database of Force-sensitive infants stored within the Kyber memory crystal, which was used to locate future members of the Jedi Order when the time came for them to be trained. This crystal was eventually stolen by the Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane at the behest of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Planning to use the Force-sensitive infants to create an army of dark side warriors, Sidious directed Bane to abduct two children from the crystal's list and deliver them to Mustafar, where they would become the Dark Lord's test subjects. Dunn was Bane's second target, and the bounty hunter traveled to Kay-Tap square in the guise of a Jedi Knight in order to fool his mother into willingly handing over the infant. Bane succeeded and took Wee Dunn to Mustafar, where the young Rodian was prepared for brain-washing surgery. Before the operation could take place, however, Dunn was rescued by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano. After the ordeal, Dunn was taken into the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Targeted"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wee Dunn was a male Rodian living on Rodia around the beginning of the Clone Wars. Wee lived with his mother, Mahtee Dunn, in Kay-Tap square, one of Rodia's tropical domed cities. In the days immediately after his birth, Mahtee discovered that her young son was Force-sensitive. He was able to levitate toys at this incredibly young age, information that eventually came to the attention of the Jedi Order. As a result, the Dunns were visited by Jedi Master Bolla Ropal, who informed Mahtee that although Wee would be taken into the Order, his induction would not occur for some time, as the junior Dunn was still in his early infancy. Despite this, Wee Dunn's name was added to the Kyber memory crystal, a device that held the identities of all known Force-sensitive children in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious put in motion a plan to create an army of dark side warriors that would act as his personal assassins and spies. In order to obtain his initial group of warriors, Sidious hired the notorious Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane to steal the Kyber crystal from the Jedi Order and provide Sidious with the information on it. Bane complied, killing Master Ropal and stripping him of the Kyber crystal. Sidious then directed Bane to kidnap several of the children listed on the crystal to serve as test subjects for a surgical slave conditioning operation that would make the children into little more than extensions of his will. Knowing the children listed on the crystal's memory would be in danger, the Jedi High Council decided to look into the Force in hopes that they would be able to sense the children Bane would target. During the Council's meditations, Grand Master Yoda discovered that Wee Dunn would be one of the children that would be taken and so dispatched Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to Rodia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Rodia, Wee and Mahtee Dunn were visited by Cad Bane, who was masquerading as a Jedi Knight that had come to take Wee into the Order. Mahtee was reluctant to surrender her child to Bane, citing her earlier visit from Master Ropal and his claim that Wee would remain with her for quite some time before being taken to the Jedi Temple. When Mahtee refused to surrender Wee, Bane used a hypnogazer to force her to give him the child. As Bane left the Dunn house with Wee, Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived and confronted Mahtee. Following the sound of Wee's cries, Kenobi found Bane fleeing to his ship, the Xanadu Blood, with the younger Dunn in tow. Although Kenobi gave chase, the bounty hunter escaped Rodia with Wee."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Test subject"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wee Dunn was taken by Bane to the volcanic Outer Rim world of Mustafar, where Darth Sidious held a base that was built into a mountainside high above a lava flow. Dunn was kept within the facility's nursery along with Zinn Toa, a Nautolan infant that had also been kidnapped by Bane. The two were watched over by a pair of nanny droids in the service of Darth Sidious, who visited the children via hologram. While Sidious \"comforted\" a crying Dunn, the Dark Lord was informed by one of his nanny droids, RO-Z67, that infants such as Dunn and Toa were unlikely to survive the slave conditioning operation. Sidious, who cared little for the safety of the children, decided to go forward with the surgery, claiming that he would lose nothing if Dunn or Toa were killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano had captured Bane during his attempt to kidnap yet another child on Naboo. While inspecting the Xanadu Blood in an attempt to find clues regarding Dunn's whereabouts, Tano and Skywalker discovered evidence that suggested Bane's accomplice in the kidnappings may have been located on Mustafar. This information led the two Jedi to investigate the volcanic planet. As they approached Mustafar, Sidious and RO-Z67 were preparing Dunn for his surgery; however, upon learning that their location had been compromised, the holographic Sith Lord ordered that the children be taken to his secondary facility and that the one they now occupied be destroyed. As Sidious ended his transmission, RO-Z67 grabbed Dunn and turned off the base's gravity supports. Neither of the nanny droids could escape with the children before Skywalker and Tano arrived, however, and so they hid in the darkened nursery in the hope that the Jedi would not find them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Jedi arrived, the droids attacked them, brandishing the children as shields. As Skywalker tried to grab Dunn, the station began to tear itself apart as it fell into the lava flow below. RO-Z67 was hit by falling debris and slid toward an opening in the floor; however, Skywalker was able to use the Force to pull Dunn to him. Both he and Tano, who had managed to rescue Toa, fled the station and escaped Mustafar in their ship, the Twilight. Wee was not returned to Mahtee, as the Jedi decided that the children had lived through a traumatic ordeal and were uncertain of the effect that it had had on them. It was instead decided that Dunn was to be raised in the Temple on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an untrained Force-sensitive, Wee Dunn was able to manipulate the Force to a limited extent. In his home in Kay-Tap Square, Dunn was able to levitate a ball; however, this did not come without difficulties, as he dropped it repeatedly. Despite his young age, Darth Sidious sensed that Dunn had great potential in the Force and would some day make a powerful pawn. Although his plans for Wee Dunn failed, Sidious eventually saw his vision become reality, even without the participation of the Rodian child."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wee Dunn was introduced in the third episode of the second season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, titled \"Children of the Force.\" Dunn's name was not mentioned in the episode, but he was given a name in the episode guide.
