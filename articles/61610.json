By 2 BBY, Hissal had become involved in an effort to open a branch of the university on Brigia, although the initiative was met with considerable opposition from the Brigian New Regime, which considered Hissal a fugitive from the state. As such, Hissal was forced to find alternative means to ship materials and teaching aids to the new college, fearing that the authorities would confiscate them upon delivery. Hissal learned of a capable smuggler in the region named Han Solo who was working as pit crew for a small-time stunt pilot on the backwater world of Saheelindeel. Hissal traveled to Saheelindeel and came to a deal with the Corellian, hiring Solo and his first mate Chewbacca to transport a shipment of educational materials, including an extremely valuable duplicator, to Brigia in exchange for two thousand credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo and Chewbacca had nearly completed offloading the cargo with Hissal on Brigia when they were accosted by Brigian Internal Security Police, who surrounded Solo's Millennium Falcon as Hissal and the smugglers took refuge.

Although Keek was much physically stronger than Hissal and shrugged off his efforts, his interference allowed Solo to blast Keek over the head with a scroll-gun, knocking him out cold.
