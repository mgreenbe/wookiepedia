The attackers were defeated by the Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ripoblus and Dimok governments have been at war with each other, but once the Imperial Navy arrived and intervened in order to bring the two sides to an agreement, they instead decided to team up against a common enemy. After a series of defeats, the Dimok and Ripoblus attempted a large offensive against a TIE/ad starfighter convoy that was supplying them to Admiral Harkov's fleet, in order to replace the TIE/LN starfighters and TIE/IN interceptors that were lost throughout the Imperial campaign."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the TIE/ad starfighters flew from the Ton-Falk-class escort carrier Tropsobor to the Protector, the Victory I-class Star Destroyer of Admiral Harkov, Dimok forces launched an assault starting with a MC40a light cruiser called Ben Het exiting hyper space and launched several squadrons of BTL Y-wing starfighters and Z-95 Headhunters followed by Modified Corvette Long Tan finally followed by two Cargo ferries Suoi Tre and Can Giouc. Maarek Stele, an elite TIE pilot, engaged the Dimok forces with several other TIE/LN starfighters and interceptors. They fought the attacking fighters to give time for the TIE/ad starfighters to make it aboard the Protector. After defeating the enemy fighters and defending the TIE/ad flights AA, AB, AC, and AD, the Imperial pilots engaged the Ben Het as well as the Long Tan, Suoi Tre and Can Giouc, holding of the attacking starships until they were either driven off or destroyed. Soon afterwards the Ripoblus joined the battle with Nebulon-B2 frigate Shemsher with two groups of Delta-class JV-7 escort shuttles, Raven and Seakyte. The Ripoblus faced similar results as their escort shuttles were destroyed and the Frigate was driven off, if not destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the fighting came to an end a shuttle called Omlaut arrived to board the Protector. Stele inspected it to find the shuttle carrying a high ranking member of the Rebel Alliance. The shuttle boarded the Protector and, according to a member of the Secret order of the Empire, the individual was taken directly to Harkov and they have been alone ever since. Combine this with the chronic shortages of weapons and equipment reported by Harkov, meant that it was clear that he was selling Imperial weapons and supplies to whoever has the credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Resupplied with new starfighters, Admiral Harkov forced the leaders of the two warring factions to meet him aboard his vessel and make peace agreements, ending the campaign and bringing a decades long civil war to an end. Elite pilot Stele was sent to the Pakuuni system afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle takes place in the game Star Wars: TIE Fighter. It is on Battle 2 Mission 5."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The canonicity of the mission is debatable as the bonus objectives of the mission in question is the destruction of all enemy spacecraft of both the Dimoks and the Ripoblus. This is extremely difficult as the player pilots a TIE Fighter and likely has to rely on TIE Bombers to help destroy the capital ships in the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
