In 138 ABY, she commanded the Sith contingent of pilots aboard the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer War Hammer, flagship of the First Sith Imperial Strikeforce. During Operation: Thunderstroke, the Sith Empire's attempt to capture deposed Emperor Roan Fel on the planet Agamar, Rauder led the 1st Imperial Center Core Defense Squadron into battle in Agamar's orbit. After the battle, which saw Fel successfully evade the Sith forces, Rauder participated in the devastation of Da Soocha and its moon, Napdu, with her and Skull Squadron eliminating any civilian vessels attempting to escape the planet and its moon. Later, Rauder was involved in the Sith Empire's assault on the planet Taivas, which was the location of the Jedi Order's Hidden Temple. During the fracas, Rauder ordered Skull Squadron's captain Gunn Yage to shoot down a starship carrying Jedi younglings. Yage refused and turned against Rauder, shooting down the Sith Lady's starfighter and killing her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Rauder was a humanoid female that was born during the time period of the Second Imperial Civil War and the Sith\u2013Imperial War. By 137 ABY, she had ascended to the rank of Sith Lady in Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Krayt's Sith Order, earning the \"Darth\" title. When the Sith-Imperial forces learned that deposed Emperor Roan Fel was secretly rendezvousing with members of the Jedi Order to discuss an alliance on the planet Agamar, Rauder and other Sith pilots accompanied the First Sith Imperial Strikeforce to travel to Agamar and capture Fel. As the fleet was in hyperspace, Rauder had the Predator-class fighters of the 1st Imperial Center Core Defense Squadron, led by Captain Gunn Yage, replaced with Sith-designed ships. When Yage questioned Rauder's actions, the Sith warned her to obey her orders or face death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rauder forced Captain Gunn Yage's Squadron to switch over to a new design of Sith-designed starfighter instead of the Predators they were more familiar with, causing Yage to protest.

During the battle, she ordered Captain Yage and the members of Skull Squadron to fire on pilot of the Bastion resistance who ejected from their starfighters. When Yage refused, the Sith Lady began to torture her using the Force and threatened to telekinetically kill her. However, Lieutenant Tev Rimon shot the pilot instead, sparing Yage the choice of killing an unarmed enemy.

Aboard one of these ships, Masters Tili Qua and K'Kruhk took a number of Jedi younglings to safety. Sensing their presence aboard the ship, Rauder ordered Skull Squadron to destroy it. However, Captain Yage refused to murder defenseless children, and, fed up with the Sith, obliterated Rauder's starfighter, and with it, Rauder herself.
