After much debate they decided to get those criminals from Kessel. So that they would not arouse suspicion, the New Republic decided to also take people who would be useful to the New Republic. They intended to get seventeen criminals and to negotiate with the head of Kessel to take some criminals off his hands if he would let them take some good people. Rogue Squadron was then sent to Kessel with New Republic operatives to complete the mission. After a flyby done by the majority of Rogue Squadron to disable Kessel's defenses, Corran Horn and Wedge Antilles landed on Kessel to negotiate. They only got sixteen criminals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
