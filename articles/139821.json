Selected as a Padawan by Jedi Master Agen Kolar, Tan constructed a green-bladed lightsaber which he wielded in battle. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Yuster accompanied his master to the planet Geonosis where he fought as part of a massive strike team to liberate Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from the Confederacy leaders. He did not survive the battle and during a lull in the fighting as the survivors regrouped at the arena's center gathering in a defensive circular formation Agen knelt down over his fallen Padawan to silently pay his respects."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tan Yuster was portrayed by Kalki Rose, a student of Byron Bay Kendo Club."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
