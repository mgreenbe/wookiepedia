Written by John Jackson Miller, Knights of the Old Republic saw a variety of different artists and cover artists draw various issues of the series, and KotOR serves as a sequel to the earlier Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi comic series and a prequel to the popular Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic video game. Set in 3964 BBY and later 3963 BBY, Knights of the Old Republic focuses on Zayne Carrick, a Padawan of the Jedi Order who is framed for the Padawan Massacre\u2014the murder of Zayne's fellow Padawans\u2014by the true perpetrators, Zayne's teachers, who are members of a mysterious Jedi Covenant.

From 1999 onward, Dark Horse did not produce any Old Republic era stories until the anthologies Star Wars Tales 23 and Star Wars Tales 24, which featured two stories\u2014\"Shadows and Light\" and \"Unseen, Unheard\"\u2014that tied into Knights of the Old Republic and its sequel The Sith Lords. By 2005, Dark Horse was eager to return to the Old Republic era. In early 2005, John Jackson Miller was just finishing a story arc of the then-ongoing series Star Wars: Empire with artist Brian Ching when Miller was approached by Dark Horse editors Randy Stradley and Jeremy Barlow, who were looking at the upcoming 20th anniversary of Dark Horse Comics in 2006."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Miller and Stradley began discussing some of the elements they liked seeing in Star Wars comics, such as drama, camaraderie, and humanity, and Miller started putting together thoughts on a series that would be launched during Dark Horse's 20th anniversary in 2006. Miller, Barlow, and Stradley studied the parts of the original Star Wars movies that they wished to recapture in print, and one of the main things that Miller found himself centering on was a quote by Princess Leia Organa in the Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope novel: \"They were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Naturally, they became heroes.\" The group also discussed the recurring theme in the prequel trilogy of the Jedi's failure to see what was going on around them, and that idea was focused on a single character and how that failure affected them. Miller reversed the theme of an apprentice betraying a master and considered what might make a Jedi Master betray a student, and that idea gave rise to the series' first arc, Commencement\u2014an arc that was originally titled Renegade. The series was originally developed without a specific era or time period in mind; the main focus of the series was intended to the character of Zayne Carrick, not the ongoing conflict of the Mandalorian Wars. Once the Old Republic era was decided on, Miller took a closer look at the Knights of the Old Republic games, and decided that his stories would work best if they were set series several years before the games; by doing so the series could draw on elements from both Tales of the Jedi and the video games. The Jedi Covenant arose from the idea of how a Jedi would respond to history's habit of repeating itself, and Miller made a pledge to himself that he would not introduce any mysteries in the series that he didn't know the answers to. Miller's pitch for the series received great feedback from both the developers for Knights of the Old Republic and LucasFilm. Miller changed little from the original pitch other than Hierogryph, who was originally an Ortolan\u2014a race known for their clever criminals. After the story was approved, Miller and artist Brian Ching began work on the series with colorist Michael Atiyeh. Michael Heisler was the series' only letterer, handling all fifty issues of Knights of the Old Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the character of Zayne Carrick, Miller took inspiration from the scene where Han Solo invites Luke Skywalker to become a smuggler. Carrick was also partially a result of Miller's desire to capture the feeling of the early levels of the Knights of the Old Republic video game: namely, the early stages where a player is still learning the controls. However, Ching soon realized that it would be hard to convey expressions on an Ortolan's mouthless face, so Miller suggested a Snivvian instead. Atiyeh and Ching developed detailed visuals for each of the series' characters, and by August 2005 at Comic-Con International in San Diego, most of the first issue was done, and Miller had scripted several issues onward. The script for the first issue had already been completed and turned in by May 2005. While designing Jarael, Brian Ching felt it was important to not have the character's appearance be overtly sexual. Ching's design for the character, particularly her tattoos and the way that her appearance was different than typical Arkanians, was a large part of Miller's inspiration for Jarael's backstory, and he filled in most of the details during the early years of the series. The series was officially announced in July 2005 at Comic-Con 2005 as part of Dark Horse's 20th anniversary celebration, and the series was set eight years before the events of the first Knights of the Old Republic game. Around November 2005, an ad for the series mistakenly claimed that the series was set eight thousand years before the Battle of Yavin, though Miller refuted the error and reaffirmed the date of 3964 BBY."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Production"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Commencement, Flashpoint, and Reunion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each issue of the series received a full plot which was then approved by the editors, and then Miller would script the issue. The artist would then draw the issue, and then the issue is colored and lettered simultaneously. Printing was the final stage, and took several weeks; overall, an issue took about one month to complete, but that month could be spread over an entire year depending on the issue and the creative team's work at the time. Miller made a conscious effort to make every detail in the series matter, and he developed broad plans on how the series would fit into overall Star Wars continuity. The first issue was released on January 25, 2006, 363 days after Miller and Stradley had had their initial conversation about the series. Miller deleted Ching's preliminary drawing of the double-page scene in Commencement, Part 1 from his hard drive to prevent himself from accidentally emailing it to fans, as he wanted to keep it secret until the issue's release. Ching and Miller also worked especially hard to create Carrick's and Lucien Draay's expressions for the final page of the issue. When the series was first launched, Dark Horse was disappointed by the initial sales of #1; however, the issue soon sold out and went to a second printing. By June, orders for Knights of the Old Republic had risen in numbers and was beating out Star Wars: Rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Miller chose to forgo an omniscient narrator and thought balloons that describe the action in the issues. The covers for the fist arc of the series were drawn by Travis Charest, and the cover for issue #1\u2014Carrick holding the slain Padawan Kamlin in his arms\u2014was designed well in advance based on general plot information. The inside cover to issue #2 incorrectly credited Brian Ching with the cover art instead of Travis Charest, and the dialogue balloons in that issue's garbage can scene were accidentally reversed. For the banquet scene in issue #1, Brian Ching originally depicted the banquet as a particularly busy scene with numerous details, but he scrapped it in favor of a set of panels that focused more on the five Masters and was less \"boring.\" Early on during the development of the first major \"meta-story\" for the series, Miller expressed to his editors a desire to explore the tensions between the Unifying Force and the Living Force, the two major schools of though on the Force. As a result, the Covenant Jedi in Commencement are dedicated to the Unifying Force to the point where it affects how they value the living. Carrick's speech at the end of Commencement was also one of Miller's earliest ideas for the series, and the fact that Hierogryph was responsible for Carrick's \"prophecy\" was an element that was presented in the series pitch. As Miller progressed with the development of Commencement, he realized that he had material for a prologue story that would help fans gain their bearings in the new era. Miller suggested the possibility of doing a prologue as a promotional comic for Free Comic Book Day, but editor Jeremy Barlow came up with the idea of a 25-cent special earlier in the year. Late in the process, Miller suggested the Taris Holofeed, basing the idea and format on the Star Wars Insider magazine. The production team paused in the development of Commencement, Part 3 to create the Knights of the Old Republic/Rebellion Special, lengthening the third issue's production time somewhat, and Knights of the Old Republic/Rebellion #0\u2014which contained Knights of the Old Republic 0\u2014was released on March 1, 2006, only a week after Commencement, Part 2."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While drawing the scene of the Covenant members fighting rakghouls and Gamorreans in the Undercity\u2014a callback to the presence of Gamorrean enemies in the Undercity sewers in the original video game\u2014Ching found the sequence to be shorter than he would have wanted, a problem that he found to come up several times in the early stages of the series' development. The Taris police officers that appeared in issue #3 had been developed by Ching and Atiyeh, who viewed the officers as analogous to the clone troopers from Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith\u2014there were numerous variations on the troopers' uniforms depending on which planet they were on. Atiyeh came up with the idea to give the officers different colors, and Ching developed new helmets and gear, but when the script for issue #3 was written, there was not enough room to feature the officers to the degree that the artists intended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Miller considered the heart of Commencement, Part 4 to be the conversation between Zayne Carrick and Master Tokare, and he particularly enjoyed using the conversation to introduce the possibility that Carrick was actually responsible for the murders of his fellow students. For Taris's Rogue Moon, Miller provided Ching with his own visual reference of the moon that he created by piecing together fragments of an image of a planet's surface. Miller also dedicated several pages to establish the working relationships between the crew of The Last Resort, as he felt that it was important to introduce their dynamics. Issue #5 saw guest artist Travel Foreman fill in for Brian Ching in order to keep the series on schedule, as the development of Crossroads had necessitated Foreman to fill for Ching. Travel Foreman took Miller's advice on the sequence depicting the Rogue Moon Prophecy, using a style reminiscent of the Doctor Strange artist Steve Ditko to create a vision experienced by several minds at the same time. Miller debated whether to depict Elbee's point of view during the vision, but he ultimately left it out. For the droid Elbee, Miller suggested that he be small enough to move around in The Last Resort, but large enough to resemble the loaders that appeared in the movie Aliens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his production notes for issue #6, Miller admitted that the chapters of Commencement that follow the Padawan Massacre mirror the five stages of grief: denial in #2, anger in #3, bargaining in #4, depression in #5, and acceptance in the last pages of #5 and in issue #6. Miller devoted a lot of attention to finding the tone for the scenes in Commencement, Part 6, particularly Carrick's final speech to the Masters. For Valius Ying, Miller suggested to Travel Foreman and Brian Ching that he be based on an alien Tony Soprano\u2014a gang leader who is full of himself and later realizes he's out of his depth. For Commencement, Part 6, Miller and Ching originally had Jarael plummeting towards the Jedi Tower's skylight in a background shot before she crashed into the Tower, but they ultimately removed her from the scene to preserve the mechanics of the scene. The mob scene at the beginning of the issue was one of Ching's favorite pages to draw, something that allowed him to include both new and familiar characters, and he added in several characters that were based on his own friends. The Commencement arc was later collected along with Crossroads in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Volume 1: Commencement, which was released on November 15, 2006. The trade paperback also identified the Senator from issue #1 as Senator Goravvus, who had gone unnamed in the original printing; however, The Taris Holofeed was not included."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dustin Weaver joined the creative team for the series with issue #7 as a joint artist for the series, alternating story arcs with Brian Ching. Flashpoint, Part 1 shifts gears to focus on the Mandalorian Wars, showcasing the influx of new recruits of many different species among the Mandalorians and hinting at the conflict between their culture's typically loose command structure and their status as an invading force. Miller was pleased to give more time devoted to Elbee, who he had hoped to develop further in Commencement before he decided to focus more on the Master's vision. In the production notes for the issue, Miller revealed that Elbee's name was derived from the character Bartleby the Scrivener in a story by Herman Melville. Because the series begins before the Knights of the Old Republic game, Miller was able to delve into the early stages of the Mandalorian Wars, and he compared the conflict depicted in the Flashpoint arc to the kind of military action in remote theaters that preceded all-out war. The Courageous, the flagship of Admiral Saul Karath, earned its name through an obscure connection to Karath's flagship Leviathan in the video game: the Leviathan was a reference to the real-life British Royal Navy class of the same name, and the real-world class was based on the design for the French vessel Courageaux. Rohlan Dyre's first name was partially inspired by the name of Roland, a paladin of Charlemagne. The Flashpoint arc and the Battle of Vanquo was something that had been in planning since the early stages of the series' creation; Vanquo was meant as \"the Mandalorian equivalent of Pearl Harbor\" in that it disrupts the lives and plans of the characters in the series with sudden conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ninth issue of the series, Knights of the Old Republic 9, was developed as a stand-alone tenth issue that focused on Lucien Draay. Miller had wanted to do a single issue focusing on the Covenant in the first year of the series, modeling it after stories such as the Marvel comic Star Wars 29 and Neil Gaiman's Hob Gadling story. However, Miller lost half of the script for the issue due to a hard drive problem, and both the file and its backup became corrupted after a power failure. Miller ultimately gave up trying to recover the script and rewrote it instead, but another problem came up with art scheduling. Dustin Weaver was originally scheduled to work on issues #7-9, the Flashpoint arc, while Brian Ching was to work ahead on #10, but when Ching finished his work first, the standalone issue was published prior to the unfinished final issue of Flashpoint. The events of the two issues took place simultaneously, and marked the transition from the year 3964 BBY to 3963 BBY, seven years before the Knights of the Old Republic game. The cover art for Flashpoint and Homecoming was handled by Brian Ching and Michael Atiyeh. While working on Flashpoint, Miller collaborated with Star Wars writer Karen Traviss for information about the Mandalorian culture and their language, Mando'a. In Homecoming, the creative team designed the flashback sparring scene between the Covenant Jedi so that it could show Lucien Draay assert his dominance and leadership over the others, and the Draay Estate's architecture was inspired by Moorish buildings in Spain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the issues following Commencement, the next six issues were originally planned to be broken up into three smaller stories: a three-part story, a standalone, and a two-part arc. Doing so would allow Dustin Weaver to join in as the series' second artist, but the scheduling issues saw a third artist\u2014Harvey Tolibao\u2014take over for the sixth issue, Knights of the Old Republic 12, which was also colored by guest colorist Jay David Ramos. The two-part Reunion arc was intended as a comical departure from the heavier tone of the preceding arcs and the storylines to come in 2007. The storyline, which was originally titled Target of Opportunity until Miller suggested renaming it to fit with the single-word titles of Commencement and Homecoming, was intended to showcase the working relationship between Hierogryph and Carrick. Reunion's title was also a hint to the identity of Arvan Carrick, and Miller described the bank on the planet Telerath as having a central tower with spidery veins spreading across a beautiful countryside; Ching expanded on the design, adding a sea, islands, and airships. The illustrator HOON drew the cover art for the two Reunion issues."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For issue #11, Ching used the issue as an opportunity to completely reinvent the appearances of Camper and Jarael, and he based Camper's \"Baron Margryph\" appearance on that of Mr. Peanut, giving him a monocle and a handlebar mustache. Having different artists for the two issues presented some art problems: the Moomo Brothers are identifiable by the colors of their scarves, though issue #12 reversed the colors of the scarves and created confusion as to which was which. Flashpoint, Homecoming, and Reunion were all collected in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Volume 2: Flashpoint, which was released on May 16, 2007. Volume 2 restored the order of Flashpoint, moving Homecoming to after the end of Flashpoint, but the creative team chose not to remedy the Moomo Brothers' scarf issue, opting instead to use one of the brothers' scars as the differentiating factor. The creative team also took time to go back into issue #11 and added sound effects and dialogue for the chase scene that had been excluded in the original release due to the scheduling rush."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Days of Fear, Nights of Anger"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Knights of the Old Republic became successful in early 2006, Miller began looking forward at 2007, and he developed an expansive storyline which would bring in multiple characters but could be broken down into smaller chunks so that the series' artists could alternate. This plan led to the development of four interlocking arcs: Days of Fear, Nights of Anger, Daze of Hate, and Knights of Suffering\u2014the names of which stem from Jedi Master Yoda's warning from Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace: \"Fear leads to anger; anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering.\" The names of the arcs were first announced officially in the Drawn By The Force department of Star Wars Insider 91, which discussed the upcoming arcs. While planning out the plots of the arcs, Miller was at one point forced to put every character's story path on a dry-erase board so that he could keep track of them all. Taking inspiration from Roy Thomas's decision to split up the main characters of the Marvel Star Wars comics in Star Wars 7, Miller decided to break up the crew of The Last Resort in the opening pages of Knights of the Old Republic 13. The four arc titles came to be referred to collectively as Days/Knights first unofficially by Miller himself and later officially, as part of the publisher's summary for issue #23. Miller later confirmed that the look that Carrick gives the \"camera\" in a scene in Weaver's Days of Fear, Part 1 was inspired by the look that Jim, a character from the US version of the television show The Office, often gives the camera."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also in issue #13, the creative team introduced Zayne Carrick's phrikite vambraces, the character's first unique piece of equipment and an element that had been a part of Brian Ching's design for the character since his inception. Dustin Weaver handled artwork duties for issues #13 and #15, while Brian Ching drew issue #14, the second part of Days of Fear. Days of Fear also saw the return of the backup news organs, with The Admiral's List: Jimas Veltraa Memorial Edition, The Adjudicator Special Report: The Outer Rim, and The Taris Holofeed: Siege Edition accompanying the three issues of the arc respectively. The character of Slyssk was partially inspired by Miller's childhood action figure of the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk, which had wider eyes than in The Empire Strikes Back, and the name of the Little Bivoli\u2014a ship designed by Dustin Weaver\u2014is a reference to a foodstuff in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. The Reliance's name comes from the same source as that of the Courageous: a ship in the British Navy of the Napoleonic era of the same class as the Courageaux. Miller's grandfather served aboard a large vessel known as a Landing Ship-Tank in World War II, and the LSTs\u2014which were used to deploy smaller vehicles and machinery onto battlefields\u2014inspired the scenes on Serroco's surface, particularly those that dealt with the logistics of the Republic Navy. The Deadweight was also inspired by the LSTs; the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide identified the ship's original designation as CBX-560, a reference to USS LST-560, the ship that Miller's grandfather served on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Days of Fear, Part 2 introduces the character of Carth Onasi, a companion character in the original Knights of the Old Republic game, and the creative team worked hard to ensure that he was consistent with his game portrayal yet also presented surprises. Looking back at the issue, Miller acknowledged the fact that he unknowingly staged the dialogue similar to that of the game, in that Carrick\u2014like the player character\u2014receives long expositions from Onasi in response to single-line observations and questions. Miller and Ching plotted out a vision of Serroco's destruction that was relatively similar to how the actual event would appear, and in the production notes for the issue, Miller acknowledged the questions of fans as to whether a bearded crew member on the Courageous from issue #8 was Onasi. Miller had intended Onasi to be present at Vanquo on the Courageous, but he did not specifically direct Dustin Weaver to draw the character, and Miller himself assumed that Weaver had drawn Onasi\u2014only to later learn from Weaver that the crewmember was actually a rendition of Miller himself. Zayne Carrick's reaction to the death of the Sterebs in Days of Fear, Part 3 was inspired Miller's personal reaction to the events of September 11, 2001. Ching and Atiyeh drew the cover artwork for Days of Fear, and the cover for Part 3 was directly suggested by Miller: he noted to Brian Ching how he liked one of Frank Miller's covers for Daredevil that featured Daredevil cowering on a white background. Ching took one of Carrick's postures in the previous issue and added Mandalore's mask and the flames. An earlier promotional image featured a redder mask, though the mask was ultimately changed to a brighter gold by the time of the release. Issue #15 was delayed for two weeks from its original scheduled release date of March 28, and was instead published on April 11."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Knights of the Old Republic 16, Miller was particularly pleased with Ching's ability to recreate the panel layout from issues #1 and #2\u2014the depiction of Carrick's discovery of the Padawan Massacre. The sequence also allowed Miller to return to Raana Tey and give insight into her motivations, something that he had wanted to do for a while. Nights of Anger, Part 1 saw the appearance of Arkania from Tales of the Jedi, and the fact that Brian Ching's designs for Camper and Jarael were divergent from that of typical Arkanians allowed Miller to deal with the subject of segregation. The broad strokes of Arkanian society stemmed from Miller's experience with student protesters against companies that did business with apartheid-era South Africa, and he brought in elements of the Russian communes from the 19th century. Colin Wilson handled the cover art for Nights of Anger, and his addition of word balloons on the covers of the issues was the idea of editor Jeremy Barlow: Barlow looked at the year's military storylines and saw an opportunity to pay tribute to the war comics covers by Joe Kubert. For the character of Zadawi, Miller asked Brian Ching to create a character who would hold a mirror up to Jarael, a way to show what Jarael's life would have been like if she had grown up on Arkania. The Tremendous battle group is also another reference to the British Royal Navy, as the Tremendous was a ship of the same class as the Courageaux."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Starting with Knights of the Old Republic 17, Miller began a storyline that was inspired by Archie Goodwin's work on the Marvel Star Wars comics that involved the Wheel space station: a high-stakes political game set in a visually interesting location. Miller also used the issue to involve the corporate life of the Republic and its relationship with military and political issues, as Goodwin did with the Galactic Empire and the House of Tagge, by linking Lord Adasca and Adascorp to Camper's past. Miller also found an opportunity to shed light on Jarael's past, and he used the character of Eejee Vamm to further the themes of class and racial division that appeared in issue #16. Harvey Tolibao drew issues #17 and #18, and Miller was pleased with how Harvey's art was reminiscent of Jim Starlin's work on the comic series Dreadstar, one of Miller's inspirations for writing Knights of the Old Republic. Miller originally had Vamm's first line addressing an \"Emergency Station,\" which he intended to mean a hospital receiving room aboard the Legacy, but Tolibao took the dialogue to mean an actual space station and drew the Legacy docked at a large space station. Rather than alter the artwork, the creative team chose to alter the dialogue: Vamm's comment was changed to \"receiving room,\" and a dialogue box was added that referred to the station as a refueling station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Adasca's mention of \"the Offshoot question\" was intended by Miller to be reminiscent of real-world \"questions\" involving ethnic groups, and Carrick's escape passage through the back of his cell is a reference to the writer's favorite scene in the movie The Shawshank Redemption. In his production notes for the issue, Miller noted that he had not seen any correct predictions on what was afflicting Camper, though he pointed out that the mechanic had not had a \"spell\" before The Last Resort launched in issue #4. The writer was also particularly pleased with issue #17's backup, the Adascorp Fiscal Period Financial Report and Outlook: Message from the Chief Executive, as he was able to mimic the style of real-life quarterly reports and adapt it to the Star Wars galaxy. The Taris Holofeed edition that accompanied issue #18 was inspired by Edward R. Murrow's \"This is London\" broadcasts from Britain during the blitz in World War II, and the reporter's sense of betrayal in regards to the Republic was also inspired by the real-life resentment of the Allies when they failed to protect places in World War II. Issue #16 was also accompanied by a news organ: The Admiral's List: Remember Serroco! Edition. Days of Fear and Nights of Anger were collected in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Volume 3: Days of Fear, Nights of Anger, which was released on January 16, 2008. The Knights of Suffering and Daze of Hate arcs were collected in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Volume 4: Daze of Hate, Knights of Suffering, which was released on August 27, and Miller was pleased that the paperbacks were able to include the names of their component arcs in the titles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even in his initial 2005 pitch for the series, Miller planned for the centerpiece of the series' second year to be the revelation of what Camper was hiding, and he outlined the basic design for what Camper had created as something biological, spaceborne, and enormous, a departure from a typical superweapon. However, as he approached the Nights of Anger arc, Miller grew wary of introducing anything drastically new to the Star Wars universe such as the living starship from Michael Golden's Star Wars 38. It was not until he watched a repeat of The Empire Strikes Back that Miller though of the exogorths, and he found that very little had been established about the creatures in the Expanded Universe, though what had been written fit with Miller's plans. He was still hesitant when he pitched the idea to Dark Horse, though his editors loved the idea, and the only challenge\u2014how to depict them\u2014was solved by Brian Ching at the same time that he designed the Arkanian Legacy. Harvey Tolibao took Ching's initial design and expanded on it to create the nest of stellar sea serpent-esque creatures that appear in issue #18. The issue also focused on Adasca and Jarael, using Jarael's presence to expand on Adasca's personality and motivations. The tour of the Arkanian Legacy was also partially inspired by Goodwin's stories about the Wheel and Lando Calrissian's greeting Han Solo on Cloud City in The Empire Strikes Back\u2014a kind of double game that forced Miller to work in order to keep the issue's script at a manageable size."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Daze of Hate, Knights of Suffering"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knights of the Old Republic 19 saw Miller bring together the various characters that he had been following over the last year, and the writer worked with galactic maps to ensure that all of the characters were in logical proximity to Adasca's auction; he also worked out timelines for almost a dozen of the characters in order to keep track of where they were and what they knew of each other's agendas. Miller originally spelled the name of the space slugs as \"exorgoth,\" but it was spelled \"exogorth\" during the lettering stage of the issue's production, and it was too late to change when it was noticed; the creative team decided to go with the spelling \"exogorth\" from that point on. Miller originally intended for Adasca to make a derogatory comment about Camper's Human-like hands when he ordered them to be removed, but the comment was ultimately removed due to space constraints. The Daze of Hate arc was drawn by Bong Dazo, an artist from Glass House Graphics, and the cover art was drawn by Chris Warner with two different colorists: Michael Atiyeh for issues #19 and #21, and Kelsey Shannon for issue #20."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When originally developing the Arkanian Legacy sequence, Miller did not include Lucien Draay at all: Carrick's prison break would have happened differently, and Draay would have simply missed Carrick on Telerath when the Courageous was destroyed. However, he decided to include Draay when he realized that the character had not appeared in almost a year, and he came up with the idea of the two working together to escape like the chained-together convicts in the movie The Defiant Ones. The addition proved logistically difficult, though Miller was ultimately able to fit in Draay's involvement and thereby remind readers of Carrick's status as a fugitive wanted by the Covenant. Miller chose to keep the design of Mandalore the Ultimate's axeblade consistent with that of Mandalore the Indomitable's mythosaur axe from the Tales of the Jedi, and he used the Daze of Hate arc to further illustrate the Mandalorians' transition from the chaotically individualistic armors of Tales of the Jedi to the color-coded uniformity of the Neo-Crusaders that appear in the Knights of the Old Republic video game. The food tray that splits a HK-24 droid's head in Carrick and Draay's escape was intended as a callback to the Bullseye comics by Frank Miller, the protagonist of which made use of a variety of mundane items as projectiles, though the panel evolved from Miller's original idea of just a debilitating strike to the eyes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Daze of Hate, Part 3, Miller worked to combine the various introductions between characters into as few scenes as possible, and when the creative team was discussing how to allow Draay and Carrick to view what was going on in the Observatory, they hit upon Eejee Vamm's \"crow's nest\" as a better setting than that of the towers on the hull of the Legacy, as Vamm had been killed in issue #20. While working on Cassus Fett's speech, Miller found inspiration for Fett's tone in the American Southwest: while Miller was traveling in the region, he was directed by a guide to the presidio, or fortified base, in Las Vegas. At the presidio in 1846, General Kearny claimed New Mexico for the United States, and the starkness of Kearny's speech served as the model for the tone of Fett's. Each of the Daze of Hate issues were accompanied by a news organ: Adascorp Fiscal Period Financial Report and Outlook: Field Report: Project Black Harvest\u2014a reference to the \"Blue Harvest\" production codename for Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\u2014The Adjudicator Special Report: Tools of the Trade, and The Taris Holofeed Special Proclamation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights of Suffering arc, the basic plot of which had been discussed by Miller and Ching as early as March 2006, saw Miller return to another major element that he had planned from the series' inception: a return to Taris while it is under siege. Miller used the arc to pick up the few threads that he had left on Taris in Commencement\u2014Shel Jelavan, Senator Goravvus, and the disappearance of Constable Sowrs' children\u2014and also to introduce the Hidden Beks, a swoop gang from the video game. Miller brought in a number of characters from the game, such as Gadon Thek, Brejik, and the Vao siblings, though his personal goal was to avoid cameos just for their own sake and bring in characters that would do something important. The four arcs of the Days/Knights cycle was originally planned to be alternated between artists, but several issues caused that plan to fall through early on; despite this, Dustin Weaver was able to draw Knights of Suffering at the same time Bong Dazo was drawing Daze of Hate, and Dan Parsons provided inks for Weaver's work on the arc. Weaver also took the opportunity to include several background characters who resembled characters from the Metabarons comic series, one of his favorite series, and Carrick's fall from the Moomo Williwaw was inspired by the first issue of the comic series The Incal. Miller had planned since the beginning to bring back Hierogryph in Knights of Suffering and also planned out how he and Slyssk escaped from Serroco, but found that the story did not fit well into the pacing of the current story, and he decided to save the segment for a later issue. The news organ The Admiral's List: Karath Home Safely accompanied issue #22, showing the repercussions of Daze of Hate, and Colin Wilson's cover artwork for issue #23 was included in the letters section for issue #22 due to the fact that issue #23 was already completed by that time. Miller initially considered naming Constable Noana Sowrs' children after his own children, but as he began working on Vector and realized that Sowrs would be turned into a rakghoul, he discarded the notion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Miller suggested the idea of a comic-sized handbook for the series in late 2006, believing that there would be enough information for one by the time it was released. Miller found the process of writing the handbook similar to writing the text page for a comic that he would typically send to an artist. The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Handbook was released on November 7, 2007, the same day as Knights of Suffering, Part 1, and covered the events of the series up until that issue while also including a significant amount of new information such as backstory on the Moomo Brothers and Hierogryph, The Handbook's entries were crafted with the forthcoming Vector crossover in mind, and the Handbook included original character and ship designs by Brian Chin, while Miller also suggested including Dustin Weaver's \"just for fun\" cross-sections of The Last Resort and the Moomo Williwaw. A miscommunication resulted in some confusion over the \"The Onslaught\": some entries in the Handbook refer to the Onslaught as involving Serroco, though that battle occurred several weeks later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While working on Knights of Suffering, Part 2, Miller encountered issues with the pacing of the arc, and was forced to cut down on certain plot elements such as Carrick's encounter with Shel Jelavan\u2014an element that was one of Miller's favorites in the issue. Carrick's interaction with Raana Tey was one of Miller's favorite panels in the entire series, though the writer was wary of the Resistance's mission to destroy the Jedi Tower: Miller felt that the destruction of a skyscraper was similar to the events of September 11, 2001, and Carrick's concern for the innocents in the neighborhood around the tower was something that Miller felt was an appropriate reaction to the situation. Miller made use of Karen Traviss's dictionary of Mando'a in order to name the Mandalorian ships mentioned by Cassus Fett, and he decided to make the Moomo Brothers more humorous characters by introducing their passion for explosives. The issue's news organ, The Adjudicator Special Report: The Colonies, reflects the events of the issue in relation to Lhosan Industries and Hierogryph, and also includes additional charges for Carrick that are the result of Admiral Karath's testimony on Carrick."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dustin Weaver especially enjoyed drawing the duel sequence between Raana Tey and Carrick in Knights of the Old Republic 24, the first time Carrick has dueled another lightsaber-wielder in the series. Before Miller turned in the final version of the issue, he learned that his editor Jeremy Barlow was moving to Dark Horse's Indiana Jones office, and Barlow was succeeded by Randy Stradley, who Miller had worked with in developing the original pitch for the series. Knights of Suffering, Part 3 was the final issue whose cover was drawn by Chris Wilson, ending the appearance of word balloons on the series' covers. The issue did not continue The Taris Holofeed, instead concluding with Galactic Republic Defense Ministry Daily Brief KD0092, which was intended to read like a real-world governmental \"daily brief.\" Miller had been thinking about the Republic's inner workings in preparation for the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide, and the page takes inspiration from a variety of different organizations in different governments. The Volume 4 paperback, which collects the Daze of Hate and Knights of Suffering arcs, breaks the Arkanian Legacy events in half; when the arc was in development, it was not originally planned that Nights of Anger and Daze of Hate arcs would be so intricately related with each other. Volume 4 also corrected a visual continuity error in #20 which had Rohlan Dyre given a gold set of Mandalorian armor, when the armor was in fact originally intended to be red like how it appears in Knights of Suffering."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Vector, Exalted and Vindication"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The idea for the Vector crossover originated in 2006, when Randy Stradley and Chris Warner visited a comic shop as the shop's staff unloaded the latest shipments of Marvel Comics' Civil War and DC Comics' 52 crossovers. Stradley contacted Miller shortly afterwards along with John Ostrander and Jan Duursema, the creative team of the Star Wars: Legacy comic series. In response to Civil War and 52, Stradley wanted to develop a crossover that would link together the four ongoing Star Wars series: Knights of the Old Republic, Dark Times, Rebellion, and Legacy. Miller immediately agreed, and the creative teams of the four series\u2014Miller, Randy Stradley under the pen-name \"Mick Harrison\" for Dark Times, Rebellion's Rob Williams, and Ostrander and Duursema for Legacy\u2014entered into a lengthy series of discussions as to how to bridge the chronological gaps between their series. The writers soon decided to have a sequential crossover that would transition through each other series, and Stradley first came up with the name Vector for the event. Miller had already finished the outlines for the Days/Knights cycle and knew that it would conclude with issue #24, and Vector would run through 2008 beginning with issue #25. The inclusion of rakghouls was an element that came up early on in the discussions of Vector, with Jan Duursema first mentioning their possible involvement, and the writers took inspiration from the flashes of light that heralded a transformation to introduce a supernatural element to the creatures related to the Sith. Duursema was also responsible for the initial character designs for Celeste Morne and Karness Muur; however, Duursema's original design for Morne had her as an Arkanian named Aurora. Upon learning of this, Miller intended to tie \"Aurora\" back to Days/Knights by establishing her as the niece of Arkoh Adasca, who had been mentioned earlier as Aurora by Adasca. This was ultimately discarded, as Vector was meant to introduce new readers to the Star Wars comics without excessive \"baggage.\" To resolve the fact that Aurora had already been mentioned, Miller decided to include information on her in the edition of The Admiral's List that appeared in issue #22."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because Vector was intended for readers of all series, Miller was forced to cut back on the elaboration he wanted to do for a number of events from the Days/Knights cycle; some events that were cut included the aftermath of the attack on Cassus Fett, the fate of the resistance, and the fates of Jelavan, Thek, and Del Moomo. In each successive draft for the crossover, Miller decided to shed more and more characters from the KOTOR segment, and ultimately the only characters the writers decided on using were Hierogryph, Carrick, and Lucien Draay. Miller's solution to the problem was to add a gap between issues #24 and #25, and while at a summit in Portland, Oregon, in late summer 2007, the creative team decided to add several weeks between the end of Knights of Suffering and Vector that allowed for all of the characters to be moved to their proper positions and also let Miller address the status of characters who did not appear in Vector without adding too much exposition. Randy Stradley's two \"missions\" for Vector was that the event had to be easily accessible to both new and long-time readers, and it also had to change the course of each series it touched; the second goal was easier for Miller, as he had always intended for 2008 to feature a shift in gears back towards the issue of the Covenant. The four issues of Vector were drawn by Scott Hepburn, and he was supported by the inker Joe Pimentel, while Travis Charest drew the cover for #25. Randy Stradley joined the team as editor starting that issue as well. The in-continuity news organs were discontinued in 2008, as it was hard to keep them in the correct places when reprinting them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knights of the Old Republic 26 allowed Miller to continue his work on the evolution of the Mandalorian forces by depicting their operations on Jebble, which was a planet that was first mentioned in the edition of The Taris Holofeed that accompanied issue #0. The character of Celeste Morne mirrored Miller's early ideas for Jarael, whom he originally intended to have a far more acidic personality, and the creative team developed a specific set of rules for how the rakghoul plague was transmitted. The character of Frazznik, who first appeared in issue #3, was originally intended to reappear in one of the early Adjudicator columns, but he was cut for space, and the arrival of transports from Taris was inspired by Great Britain's lack of available landing ships in World War II. Dan Parsons inked part of issue #26 alongside Pimentel, and he took over inking duties for the rest of the arc. Vector, Part 2 was the first in a series of covers that were drawn and colored by Dustin Weaver, and he was asked to make some changes to the cover upon completing it the first time. In issue #27, Miller took an opportunity through Lucien's description of Xamar's research on the Talisman to explain why the First WatchCircle was stationed so far away from the Core Worlds: they were searching for the Talisman. Randy Stradley came up with the term \"Mando-Raks,\" which was used in favor of Miller's \"Mando-Ghouls,\" and the two came up with the name for Dreypa's Oubliette with inspiration from the card game Magic: The Gathering."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Issue #28, which concluded the Vector arc for the series, changed very little during the development of the story, as the writers had already determined where the characters in Knights of the Old Republic would be going and how Celest Morne would transition between series. Miller particularly enjoyed having the opportunity to give the rakghouls a backstory and reason for existing. Bong Dazo, who would take over as artist for the forthcoming Exalted arc, designed Celeste Morne's pendant-key, while Miller developed a diagram of suggested panels for the nuclear destruction scene that would allow events on Jebble's surface to proceed vertically while Carrick's reaction moved diagonally. When Dark Horse Comics collected the Vector storyline in a trade paperback, they were initially unsure as to how to do so without splitting up Vector. Dark Horse's solution was to combine the first six issues of Vector\u2014Knights of the Old Republic #25-28 and Dark Times #11-12\u2014in a single trade paperback, Star Wars: Vector Volume 1, Chapters 1 & 2. Vector Volume 1 was also labeled as Knights of the Old Republic Volume 5 and Dark Times Volume 3, continuing both series' trade paperback numbering, and the era icons for all four publishing eras involved in Vector were displayed on the spine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Exalted was considered to be a key chapter in the series by Miller and the series' editors, and one of the major goals was to show the impact that Vector had on the storyline in order to demonstrate the event's importance in other series. Miller developed the story for the two-part Exalted arc while also writing the adaption for the movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, though it was not Miller's intention to purposely echo the Indiana Jones franchise or write an environmentalist story, as some suggested based on the Covenant's experimentation with artifacts on Odryn. The planet was Miller's invention, but he built upon pre-existing material for the Feeorin species, and Dustin Weaver's cover for issue #29\u2014which featured Jarael disguised as Celeste Morne\u2014allowed the creative team to hint that Morne might be staying in the Old Republic era. By the time Miller began writing Star Wars, he had stopped adding characters whose names were taken from people in real life. Miller's one actual case of \"tributing\" others in a name in Knights of the Old Republic was the name of Feln, which hides an easter egg that contains the name of his sister's four children. By shifting two letters backwards along the alphabet, \"FELN\" gives DCJL, the initials of Miller's nephews and niece Daniel, Christopher, Joey, and Laurie, some of whom helped Miller play through the Knights of the Old Republic video games."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In issue #30, Miller expanded upon the role of the Exalted in order to explain how Feln retained his status as leader even after becoming a Jedi, and it fit well with the pre-established idea that Feeorins grew stronger as they aged. Miller visualized the Feeorin village as being on an incline, allowing Carrick to leap the short distances up to the rooftops, but Bong Dazo perceived the village on a steeper incline, a decision that allowed for the inclusion of elements that Miller had suggested such as a rotten rooftop and carts drawn by the beasts of burden known as khadaroks. Bong Dazo also created the bone knives used by the Feeorins. Dustin Weaver drew the cover for issue #30, and Bong Dazo drew both issues of Exalted. Knights of the Old Republic 31, which was drawn by guest artist Alan Robinson and had a cover by Brian Ching and Michael Atiyeh, was the fulfilment of Miller's desire to have a story where everyone Carrick has helped turned around and helped him in return, and the time jump before Vector helped give time to move the characters to where they could do just that. Turnabout was also the first issue where Miller openly acknowledged that the characters of Alek and Darth Malak were the same character; the issue sees Alek adopt the alias of Malak to avoid an arrest warrant. The recording discussed by Vandar Tokare is the same recording that appears in Dark Times 11, a recording that helped bridge the gap between Dark Times and Knights of the Old Republic. Malak's experience with Republic immigration is a direct reference to the character of Vito Andolini Corleone in the novel The Godfather, who was assigned the name of a Sicilian town as his surname during the immigration process. Issue #31 was the first issue after the departure of Randy Stradley as editor, who was succeeded by Dave Marshall. In his production notes for issue #32, Miller stated that the titular \"Turnabout\" in issue #31 was intended to be Xamar's change from aiding the Covenant to working against them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knights of the Old Republic 32: Vindication, Part 1 was released on August 20, 2008, and it was preceded a day earlier by the release of the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide, a supplemental guide to the Wizards of the Coast Star Wars Roleplaying Game. The Campaign Guide, which covers much of and builds off the two Knights of the Old Republic games and the comic series, was co-written by Rodney Thompson, Sterling Hershey, Abel G. Pe\u00f1a, and Miller. The guide was first thought of by Miller in early 2007, when Miller learned from his colleague James Mishler that Wizards of the Coast was relaunching the Star Wars Roleplaying Guide, though he had no idea how to pursue the idea. Later that spring, one of Miller's friends at Celebration IV suggested the same idea and pointed out the Roleplaying Game's head designer, Rodney Thompson. Miller became sidetracked before he could speak with him, but a LucasFilm representative introduced Miller to Thompson after Miller's panel: Thompson wanted Miller to help create an already-scheduled campaign guide for the Knights of the Old Republic series. Miller was originally only tasked with continuity oversight, but as Miller had some background in roleplaying games, Thompson asked Miller to write some of the sections. Miller's wife Meredith helped him develop many of the stats and information needed for the game, and Miller ended up writing the guide's chapters on Mandalorians and the Republic; he used the guide as an opportunity to advance some of the stories that he had not yet had an opportunity to do so with in the comics, such as Haydel Goravvus. However, when it came to the subject of Squint and Malak\u2014whom the comics' creative team had always intended to eventually link together\u2014Miller suggested that they stay away from Malak's previous identity and early days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This resulted in a later problem: Alek's \"surname\" of Squinquargesimus, which was assigned by Republic immigration but not used by Alek, made its way into the Campaign Guide despite the fact that Miller had not yet explained in the comics that it wasn't really the character's last name. Another error resulted when a late-minute addition to the guide included a segment on the planet Bespin, the discovery of which Miller intended to use in Knights of the Old Republic 36. Miller had been unaware of the addition while working on issue #36, but he discovered the segment on Bespin shortly before issue #36 was completed. As a result, the \"Bespin\" that appeared in issue #36 was recolored and given a different diameter to differentiate it from Bespin. For Xamar, who is a member of the Khil species, Miller decided early on in the series to reflect the Khil's sibilant speech patterns by tripling Xamar's \"s\" sounds. However, as Xamar had more and more lines, Miller ultimately lessened the number of times he did so, as he felt that the verbal tic was becoming distracting; he reworked Xamar's dialogue to include fewer occurrences of the letter s. The Vanjervalis Chain was explained in the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide and the Handbook, but as the creative team strove to ensure that key story elements were not introduced outside of the comics, they chose to show the Vanjervalis Chain in action in issue #31 so that it would appear in the comics before the Campaign Guide. Brian Ching returned for Vindication, which meant that the creative team was mostly the same as the one from Commencement. For the ending of issue #32, the creative team initially considered ending on the cliffhanger of Carrick's ruse being exposed, but they decided to end with the issuing of Vindication instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vindication, Part 2 was drawn by Bong Dazo and inked by Joe Pimentel, though Brian Ching and Michael Atiyeh created the covers for the first three issues of Vindication. Miller had already developed Haazen's backstory as early as 2006 when he submitted the script for Homecoming, as well as histories for Barrison and Krynda Draay, though Barrison's name was not decided on until issue #12. Miller kept the story in reserve, as he did not know when exactly they would show the story beyond around the time of Vindication and he also did not know whether it would be actually depicted in a flashback or just covered in dialogue and short flashbacks. Following the development of Exalted, the creative team found that Vindication was turning out to be only a three-issue arc, and they decided to repeat the Flashpoint/Homecoming method of having a second artist draw a fourth standalone issue the story of which they would plan in advance. The team's next problem was determining how much of the setting from Tales of the Jedi to show, and Miller preferred to keep it at a balance between the settings of the two series. Looking at settings from the Tales of the Jedi era, they also decided to differentiate the two time periods by highlighting the more formal mindset in Tales of the Jedi and the importance of tradition and old money. The crystal oubliette that Krynda Draay was imprisoned in was originally simply a medical stasis casket, but when Dreypa's Oubliette was developed for Vector, the creative team decided to make it a prototype oubliette instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the very beginning, the Covenant meta-arc was designed to have an elastic timeframe, allowing for various other storylines to be slotted in between the arc's major plot points. Miller's personal preference for slow-playing certain subplots and having sudden and quick resolutions for them also played a role in planning, as he always intended for the major mileposts of the Covenant storyline to be unevenly spaced throughout the series, and Vector served as the \"big break\" that sparked the beginning of the rapid conclusion to the Covenant storyline. Vector also introduced a minor pause in the advance of the Mandalorians, allowing the creative team to return to the issue of the Covenant. While planning the resolution to Vindication, the creative team never considered the possibility of Lucien Draay becoming a fugitive like Carrick had been, as it felt contrary to Draay's personality. Miller considered depicting the Council meeting in which Carrick refused the Order's offer to rejoin them, but he ultimately decided not to. Brian Ching worked particularly hard on the scene that depicted the destruction of the Draay Estate, and a sound effect was foregone as the team felt it would be distracting. Carrick's line about the Force while in the vat came from his wife, who used a similar line when she read the scripts for the series, and Miller saved the line for an appropriate place to use it. Artist Dan Scott drew the cover art for Vindication, Part 4. Exalted, Turnabout, and Vindication later collected in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Volume 6: Vindication on April 29, 2009; the size of the trade paperback was expanded from six to seven in order to include the flashback issue #32, and the trade paperback was labeled Volume 6 because Vector Volume 1 already included Volume 5 for the series."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Prophet Motive and Dueling Ambitions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coming out of Vindication, the creative team wanted to immediately start the series in a new direction, choosing not to spend further time on Coruscant dealing the aftermath of the arc; they made use of the time-jump that was used before Vector to bring the main characters together again in a new adventure. While in the early stages of developing the arcs past Vindication, Miller spent time contemplating the subject of slavery in Star Wars, and when he was driving Maggie Thompson\u2014a longtime magazine editor and one of the primary founders of comics fandom\u2014to a convention, the subject of living slaves in a universe with artificial beings arose. When asked why slaves would be needed, Thompson responded with \"Entertainment value.\" Miller's thoughts on the subject eventually evolved into the Dueling Ambitions arc. The planetary auction in issue #36 was inspired by Miller's desire to introduce readers to new locations in the Star Wars universe as well as his experiences with financial markets. Issue #36 was the first time that Miller brought in an omniscient narrator for the series, as he felt that introducing such a narrator in the limited role of tour guide would be useful. The scene where Dyre and Demagol switch weapons in the middle of combat was Miller's idea; he imagined a midair exchange of weapons with some acrobatics, and the issue's artist Bong Dazo developed a page that depicted the exchange through multiple panels and multiple appearances of both characters in a kind of slow-motion animation. Nunk Plaarvin uses the line \"Fortunately, I am Nunk. I have the wisdom and the knowledge of the ages;\" the line was inspired by Miller's professor in his first newswriting class in college."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hot Prospect was designed by Bong Dazo, though it was Miller's idea to have the exterior of the ship be as chaotic as its inside. Miller designed the command deck, which is situated as a crow's nest above the ship; when Miller began doing sketches, his son helped model the bridge with LEGO, and the resultant design was a fusion of a command bridge, mess hall, meeting room, and crow's nest. Miller was unable to draw or describe the idea, so he simply sent images of the LEGO model to Dazo. The Hot Prospect was born primarily from Miller's dissatisfaction with the Deadweight, which he felt was too sleek for a vehicle that was supposed to be ungainly. Like the Deadweight, the Hot Propsect was directly inspired by the real-world LSTs that served in World War II, and its class designation, a Calispan 560, is yet another callback to the USS LST-560. The departure lounge was designed so that there would be both a suspended flooring and a suspended ceiling, while the observatory was a more difficult design: the interior of the dome needed to be visible from the exterior, but there also needed to be beam across so that Jarael and Dyre could be hung from it. The final design featured a circular object suspended by three bars, and the creative team imagined that the observatory's original equipment had hung from those bars before it was removed.

Michael Golden's art for the living spaceship in Star Wars 38 also played a role inspiring the story, and\u2014though Miller did not intentionally plan it\u2014like how Star Wars 38 immediately preceded the Marvel series' adaption of The Empire Strikes Back, issue #38 of Knights of the Old Republic also served as a stand-alone story preceding the main story of 2009. The story also allowed Miller to revisit the character of Elbee, as well as the subject of droids not understanding the motivations of their masters. Originally, the creative team planned for there to be no gravity on the Fillorean at the beginning and then for there to be a humorous scene where everyone and everything aboard the ship crashes to the floor when gravity is restored. The idea was ultimately discarded, as it felt out of place with the seriousness of the issue. The guest artist Dean Zachary drew issue #38, while the cover was the last to be drawn by Brian Ching.

In the Campaign Guide, the issue was addressed to a degree\u2014it established that the Sith had reinstated the Republic's ban, which ended after the Mandalorian invasion years earlier, so that they could prevent dueling legends from gaining popularity and reputations that would distract from the Sith's rule of the planet. Dueling Ambitions, therefore, allowed the creative team to deal with the original Republic ban. Jervo's World was intended to be different from similar stations in Star Wars such as the Wheel; the creative team wanted the station to be a kind of mecca for sports fan, similar to the real-world Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The playing fields were imagined as a series of arenas connected by tubes, as Miller's original idea for an icosahedral structure was abandoned because it would have been difficult to render consistently. The swoopdueling competition's organization was partially inspired by the bracket system of the 2009 NCAA men's basketball tournament, which started a day after issue #39 was released on March 18."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Goethar Kleej allowed Miller to remind readers of how Carrick had made himself at home on Taris, taking an interest in the local sports and sports heroes despite being an offworlder, and issue #39 in particular emphasized that Carrick was still a typical teenager. Goethar Kleej went through a number of iterations in the planning stages of Dueling Ambitions before Miller learned about how Gotals sensed the world around them through their cones, and it was that information that resulted in the subplot with Aubin Kleej. Brian Ching returned to drawing the series with issue #39, and the issue was the first to have its cover drawn by Daryl Mandryk. Mandryk also drew the cover for issue #40, and Brian Ching continued his work as artist through the remainder of the arc; his presence helped the team recreate the scene in the Jedi Tower from issue #6 where Jarael rescues Carrick. For the sound effect resulting from Jarael's crashing through the glass ceiling, Michael Heisler went back and reused exactly the same sound effect from issue #6, and the panel with Jarael's reflection in Dyre's facemask is a recreation of an identical panel in issue #10. Hierogryph's line about a \"tub of goo\" was inspired by David Letterman, the host of the Late Night with David Letterman talk show; in 1985 Letterman referred to baseball player Terry Foster as a \"fat tub of goo\" for several days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knights of the Old Republic 41 allowed Miller to do something he had been meaning to do for quite same time: ruin a happy ending. The reveal that Jarael was a former slaver was an element that had been in the work for most of the series' run and had been hinted at several times in various issues. The creative team originally considered revealing her past at the end of Vindication, but ultimately decided to delay it in order to bring other pieces into play; the delay also allowed the team to contrast how Carrick's group operated with and without the Covenant chasing them. The team placed particular importance on the establishment of Jarael's accuser as a sympathetic and credible figure, though Miller's original plans had the accuser as less formidable victim-like character. The reveal of Chantique and Jarael's past were both closely guarded secrets at Dark Horse\u2014solicitations for later issues of the series purposely excluded mentions of either element for the sake of the reveal. Issue #41 was also intended as a partial tribute to Archie Goodwin, as the first non-movie adaption issue of the Marvel series that Miller bought as a child was Star Wars 23, the final issue of the Wheel arc. The Mandallian Giant on the cover, which was drawn by Dan Scott, was one of the more obvious references, as a Mandellian Giant was one of the alien gladiators on the Wheel.

As the creative team began looking forward after completing Commencement, they decided to use the Revanchists as a countervailing force against the Covenant beyond the Jedi Council's neutrality, as the crusaders were also trying to pull the Council into action but in an opposite direction. As a result, Revan and Malak appeared in issue #0, and their storylines entered what Miller described as a helix, intersecting with Carrick's own story at important points. The creative team intended for readers who had played the video games to know or learn that Revan and Malak were the Revanchist and Alek, but Miller had always planned for the massacre of the Cathar species to be the moment in which Revan and the Revanchist were firmly linked together. The massacre is described by the video game character Juhani as happening many years in the past, creating a question as to how it would have an effect in the present\u2014but Miller came up with the solution to show the massacre in a vision of the past fairly early on, and chose to wait to use it until the time when the Revanchists were working officially the Republic. Miller originally suggested that the issue end with Malak standing on the ground watching Carrick and Jarael depart, but Ron Chan came up with the reserve idea of showing Malak looking down at the Hot Prospect as his ship departs. Issue #42 also features the first appearance of Captain Telettoh, a character who is a direct reference to Pete Hottelet, the winner of the Penny Arcade Child's Play Charity Auction.

The arc, which Miller originally intended to be called \"Cold Harvest\" before he realized that Dark Times was running a Blue Harvest arc, was drawn by Bong Dazo and featured covers by Benjamin Carr\u00e9 on both issue #43 and issue #44. Miller originally planned for the deep-space combat sequence that appears in issue #44 to appear in Dueling Ambitions, but the sequence was shifted to The Reaping; the Hot Propsect was in fact created for this scene, which allowed the creative team to make use of the variety of unorthodox weapons at the ship's disposal. The Prospect's centrifuge was inspired by Miller's science-fair project on rotational and angular momentum in high school, which was in turn inspired by the movies 2001: A Space Odyssey and 2010, and the winch attack was inspired by the LST which Miller's grandfather served on. Dace Golliard was imagined by Miler as a sort of rumpled and ruined figure who had destroyed his career but refused to give up, while the sky-reaper droids were Bong Dazo's creations.

By that time, Miller had already turned in the last script and the creative team had been working for a while to wrap up all of the loose ends left in the series over the course of the remaining arcs. Miller would move on to a new ongoing series, Star Wars: Knight Errant, set during the New Sith Wars. The decision to end the series did not bring about too many changes; Miller had already envisioned Jarael's storyline ending around the same time and both the Destroyer and Demon arcs were always planned to end the Crucible storyline. By cutting down Destroyer to two issues, the creative team was able to make Demon a four-part arc. In issue #46, Jarael's age was revealed, which was something that had been planned for some time and illustrated how little Carrick knew about Jarael. In his production notes for the issue, Miller revealed that the name of Bar'injar, the Magister Protector, was intended as a subtle clue to the real meaning of Jarael's name, as it shared the syllable \"jar\" and the same meaning. Masks, The Reaping, and Destroyer were collected in the trade paperback Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Volume 8: Destroyer, which was released on January 13, 2010."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knights of the Old Republic 47 centers on three major revelations, all of which had been planned for quite some time in order to follow up on various clues in other issues. The issue, which like the rest of the arc featured a cover by Benjamin Carr\u00e9, revealed that Rohlan Dyre had in fact been replaced by Demagol, a subject which had received significant discussion in fandom and one which Miller was relieved to be able to reveal. Issue #47 also allowed Miller to reveal the \"Goodvalor affair,\" a story which he had been saving since Knights of Suffering. Miller's original idea was to show the meeting with the Defense Ministry early in Daze of Hate, but around that time, Miller quit his day job to begin freelancing, and during that time he developed a number of concepts including the Handbook. Hierogryph and Slyssk's escape was envisioned as a potential humorous one-shot, but Miller acquired other work at the time and was forced to shelve the idea; while the story was forestalled over the rest of the series, the creative team made several references to it, and in the short story Interference, Miller included material originally created for the in-universe text pages that never made their way into Vector. Miller initially considered Valediction as the title for Demon, in keeping with Commencement, but ultimately went with the title of Demon. The scene where \"Demagol\" is escorted to his trial was intended to mimic the mob scene back in issue #6, which was also drawn by Brian Ching. In the initial script for the scene on Wor Tandell, \"Rohlan\" emerged from the tall weeds near Jarael saying that he had \"concluded his business,\" but after realizing the unintentional humor of the statement, the script was altered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In summer 2005, as Miller was completing the pitch for Flashpoint, he planned for Rohlan Dyre to slip aboard The Last Resort and then join the cast in Days of Fear, and Demagol would start his pursuit of Jarael in custody. Looking back at the story after making a note about the stowaway, Miller added another line: \"He might be Rohlan; he might be Demagol. Heh, heh, heh\u2026,\" and the ruse took off from there as it fit well into the story. Knights of the Old Republic 48 was accompanied by an essay in the letter column written by Miller that discussed how they handled the masquerade; in the column, he explained how the scripts for the series had included parenthetical art instructions about how to pose the character as a disguised Demagol. While the real Dyre was a brawler, Demagol had a more precise and elegant posture similar to a martial artist. As Demagol was unaware as to whether the real Dyre had ever removed his helmet, the character had to remain masked at all times, and the creative team made an effort to present Demagol's dialogue and actions hint at ulterior motives. Demagol's dialogue was tailored to include intentional slip-ups where Demagol would revert to his meticulous and intellectual manner of speaking, and the creative team even went back into the Flashpoint trade paperback to remove some of the contractions that \"Dyre\" used."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For issue #48, the creative team decided almost immediately to keep the narrative's impact focused on the present, as they needed to preserve space, and they ultimately abandoned an idea where Demagol's personal history would be interlaced with Rohlan's history of Demagol, as it complicated the flow of the issue and would result in Demagol's untrustworthy account conflicting with visuals. Through issue #48, the creative team linked together elements from virtually every story in the entire series, and allowed Miller to reveal that there had in fact been connections to Tales of the Jedi all along\u2014Jarael was genetically related to Arca Jeth. Demagol's appearances throughout the series were designed specifically to first and foremost show his devotion and interest in Jarael, and how he became ultimately obsessed with her. Miller discussed Jarael's origin with a geneticist friend of his, Cathe Smith, in order to help him understand the biology aspects of the story. The garage in which the Rogue Moon Project is headquartered was an extension of what Miller termed as an Infinities storyline for the series\u2014if the Covenant had not killed the Padawans and Carrick had washed out of the Order, Miller imagined that Carrick would have found work in a garage. That storyline, which involved Shel Jelavan, was something Miller considered from the beginning of the series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the space and combat sequences in Knights of the Old Republic 49, Miller originally visualized the sequence in space involving Dace Golliard's capture as lasting a page or so longer, while the combat sequence on Osadia would run shorter. However, Brian Ching developed the space sequence in a way that took up less space, allowing for more action sequences and an interior splash page. Issue #49 finally resolved the subject of Carrick's special relationship with the Force: Miller's experience as a parent led him to thinking about how children learn and adapt to physics, which in turn led to thoughts on how the Force affects probabilities. Even in his initial proposal, Miller suggested that Carrick existed at a \"right angle to the Force\" to the point where he couldn't manipulate outcomes easily like other Jedi; his reaching into the Force for a particular result might cause probabilities to wobble, creating an unlikely result in an undesirable direction and then further negative or positive effects as the Force re-established equilibrium. Miller's idea was built into the series throughout its run: for example, in the first issue, Carrick survives an improbable fall through the Force, but lands improbably at the feet of his teachers. This was partially reflected in the Star Wars Miniatures game, which had Carrick possess the abilities of Karmic Luck and Karmic Mettle. For the character of Saul Karath, Miller had always personally considered the dock worker at the Foerost Shipyards who was killed by Ulic Qel-Droma and Mandalore the Ultimate in Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Sith War 1 to be Craddock Karath, Saul's father. He expanded on this theory in issue #49, linking Dace Golliard and Saul Karath by establishing that Golliard's cowardice at Foerost led to Craddock's death. In his production notes for issue #49, Miller finally revealed who he \"heard\" when writing dialogue for Carrick: the actor Eric Stoltz from around the time of the 1987 film Some Kind of Wonderful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knights of the Old Republic 50 was released on February 17, 2010 as the series' final issue. Prior to its release, Miller ran a \"Countdown to KOTOR\" series on his blog where he answered questions from fans and gave further information on the series' production and development. For issue #50, Miller resorted to a magnetic storyboard to keep track of the events happening, using magnets created by his son. The magnets allowed Miller to remember which pages were which and also let him move around each page's card to link together events; Miller used the method for particularly eventful issues. Miller was not always sure whether or not he would go with the final twist of Demagol being Force-sensitive and Jarael lacking Force-sensitivity\u2014a hesitancy which caused every scene with Jarael's \"capabilities\" leave it open-ended as to whether she had powers. The Campaign Guide listed Jarael as \"Strong in the Force,\" as Miller decided to include a mention of the possibility because Jarael's \"powers\" would be mentioned in Prophet Motive, and while she is not immensely strong in the Force, the character does possess some ability. When considering the relationship between Carrick and Jarael, the creative team always felt that Carrick believed that he and Jarael could never happen given who they were, and even before Jarael's age was established, Miller had realized that Carrick was too young for her in both age and in terms of hardship experienced. As a result, the post-Vindication issues, which were designed around the concept that Carrick would be looking for trouble, addressed this gap\u2014Carrick looks into Jarael's past trouble and tries to prove himself, failing multiple times, but he earns Jarael's trust while doing so, and his apology before restoring her parents to her was viewed as an important example of the evolution of their relationship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his production notes for issue #50, Miller revealed that the source of Carrick's name was North Carrick Hall, his dormitory as an undergraduate at the University of Tenneessee at Knoxville. The sound effect from Carrick's impact when he crashes into the Osadia School is spelled the same as the effect used when Jarael crashed through the skylight of the Jedi Tower, a callback to that scene which had appeared several times in the series. For the final scene with Chantique and Demagol, Brian Ching was careful to establish the location of Carrick and Kun's lightsabers on the ground, and the entire page, which is Demagol's first active attempt at telekinesis, took less than a second in terms of the story. The ending for Rohlan Dyre, where the Mandalorian resumes his quest for answers, was one that Miller had always imagined for the character. Hierogryph was one of Miller's favorite characters to write in the entire series, and the writer managed to also get in closing moments with some of the series' main characters such as Elbee and Slyssk. Demon was collected in the ninth and final trade paperback of the original series, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Volume 9: Demon, on October 21, 2009. Miller always intended to follow up the first two overarching arcs of the series\u2014what he dubbed the \"Fugitive\" and \"Freelancer\" story arcs\u2014with a \"Footsoldier\" arc, though the series ended before he could continue. The writer would continue the planned storyline in the miniseries Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: War, which picked up some of the story elements and characters from the original series that Miller had intended to expand on in future storylines, such as Dallan Morvis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "References to the Knights of the Old Republic video games"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Taris is one of the primary settings of the Knights of the Old Republic comics, and the series expands upon the planet, which was first introduced in the Knights of the Old Republic game.

Originally thought of as a promotional short story for Star Wars Insider, the story was finished by Miller when he learned that StarWars.com was planning to present original fiction in 2007. \"Labor Pains\" is told in first-person from the perspective of Marn Hierogryph, and focuses on his and Carrick's attempt to scam an art gallery on Ralltiir. The second Knights of the Old Republic short story by Miller, \"Interference,\" was also published on Hyperspace on September 29, 2008, and allowed Miller to elaborate on an idea he had originally planned for the in-universe text pages of the series: a propaganda broadcast by a Captain Goodvalor. \"Interference\" follows a series of broadcasts made by Captain Goodvalor, a Republic propaganda figure, and the Mandalorian Koblus Sornell's reactions to his broadcasts, and is set between the Daze of Hate/Knights of Suffering arcs and the Vector arc. Sornell later appeared as a main character in the War miniseries, and the backstory for the Goodvalor character was finally revealed in issue #47. The Secret Journal of Doctor Demagol, which was released on April 29, 2010, was first thought of by Miller as a way to show what Demagol had been thinking over the entire course of the comics. Miller approached StarWars.com's editor Pablo Hidalgo about doing the story, and it was later published on Hyperspace. The story follows Demagol throughout the entire Knights of the Old Republic series, starting with Commencement and ending with Demon, and allowed Miller to also flesh out Demagol's plans for Jarael and his relationship with Chantique's mother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On October 13, 2011, Dark Horse announced that Knights of the Old Republic would receive a sequel miniseries: Knights of the Old Republic: War, also styled Knights of the Old Republic\u2014War. War was written by John Jackson Miller, who suggested the return to the Old Republic era in 2011, and the miniseries was drawn by Andrea Mutti; the series took its name from the similarly titled Star Wars: Legacy\u2014War miniseries, which was a sequel to Star Wars: Legacy. Essentially a continuation of the original series, War includes numerous references and elements from the previous series, and uses Miller's original plans for future storylines in Knights of the Old Republic. War is set in 3962 BBY, the year after the original series, and is primarily a solo title focusing on Zayne Carrick as he is drafted by his homeworld Phaeda into serving in the Mandalorian Wars. War is the fulfilment of Miller's plan to have a \"Footsoldier\" arc of the original series, and picks up on a number of elements and plot points that were left incomplete with the original series' cancellation, such as the characters of Dallan Morvis, who Miller had developed over the course of the original series for his role, and Koblus Sornell, who appeared in Interference. War was collected in a trade paperback entitled Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Volume 10: War, continuing the numbering from the original series' paperbacks. The series' entire 51 issues were later collected in three Star Wars Omnibus volumes, released in August 2013, December 2013, and April 2014 respectively. Star Wars Omnibus: Knights of the Old Republic Volume 1 was reprinted as Star Wars Legends Epic Collection: The Old Republic Vol. 1 by Marvel Comics in June 2015."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Continuity impacts and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "John Jackson Miller's other comic series, Star Wars: Knight Errant and Star Wars: Lost Tribe of the Sith\u2014Spiral, have referenced and expanded on elements created by Miller for Knights of the Old Republic.

The primary antagonist of the Lost Tribe series is Remulus Dreypa, the creator of the oubliette in which Celeste Morne was sealed at the end of Vector, Part 4. Spiral is in itself a follow-up to Miller's Lost Tribe of the Sith series of short stories, in which Miller makes additional references to Knights of the Old Republic: the Jedi Shadow Jelph Marrian was first mentioned in issue #25, and Miller used Marrian to address the question of what other members of the Covenant would think after the events of Vindication. Ludo Kressh's pedicure set, which first appeared in issue #29, is also referenced by the character Seelah Korsin, who was tasked with tending to Ludo Kressh's feet. The Vector crossover saw elements from Knights of the Old Republic appear in the other series involved in the event\u2014Hierogryph appears in a holorecording with Carrick in Dark Times 11: Vector, Part 1, and while Carrick is only mentioned in Rebellion 16, he appears in a flashback and then a vision to Celeste Morne in Legacy 28 and Legacy 31.

Similarly, the cannon \"Bitsy\" is mentioned as having been salvaged from an old derelict, and Miller confirmed in his production notes for the novel that \"Bitsy\" was the Moomo Williwaw's cannon, though the novel does not identify the derelict as the Williwaw. Knight Errant introduces Telettoh's Maxim\u2014\"Never let Malak aboard\"\u2014as a precautionary tale about allowing Sith Lords aboard vessels, and the book also gives the name for the sixth and final ship of the Inexpugnable-class: the Diligence. The Kedorzhan species, which was first introduced in issue #2. have gone on to appear in a number of issues of Knights of the Old Republic, as well as other material by Miller such as the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide and the short story Incognito.
