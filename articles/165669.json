In this volume, Xemlorn claimed that the Danchaf of the planet Garban were sentient beings capable of tool use and language. This view accorded with the legends of the Jenet species, which told of a period known as the Great Conquest, during which the Jenets fought a war against the Danchaf. Nevertheless, no other xenobiologist corroborated Xemlorn's claims, which were dismissed as having been influenced by Jenet mythology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
