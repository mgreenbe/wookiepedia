Normally worn by military or paramilitary forces as well as mercenaries and others who needed large supplies of ammunition, bandoliers consisted of many ammunition pouches sewn together or snapped to a belt. Though typically used to carry extra ammunition for blaster-type and other ranged weaponry, bandoliers could also carry grenades, supplies of syntherope, and other sorts of items useful on the battlefield or in covert operations. They were also sometimes called \"utility belts\" for this same reason. Amongst notable wearers of bandoliers were Chewbacca, Commander Gree, clone trooper Jek, Embo, and Boba and Jango Fett, as well as members of the Krozurbian War Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As in the real world, this word appears to have two different spellings in the Star Wars universe: the A New Hope novelization and the Knight Errant novel, among others, spell it bandolier, while the The Empire Strikes Back novelization and Scoundrels, for example, spell it bandoleer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
