The bunker had ammo and medical droids inside it to assist in the battle. During the battle, the Jedi Master Mace Windu, with the assistance of the 501st Legion, captured the bunker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Command Bunker 1 remains similar in both Star Wars: Battlefront II and Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron, the area around it was very different. In Battlefront II, there was a hangar behind the bunker, but in Renegade Squadron, the hangar was replaced by Command Bunker 2. Also, there was a great chasm to the right of the bunker that disappeared in Renegade Squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
