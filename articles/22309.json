Like Fett, CT-8910 stood 1.83 meters tall. During the Clone Wars, CT-8910 served the Galactic Republic as a clone trooper. In 19 BBY, he participated in a battle on the planet Cato Neimoidia and was stationed in a clone staging area located in one of the planet's bridge cities. During the battle, the clone troopers on Cato Neimoidia were issued Order 66, a command that told them to kill their Jedi General Plo Koon. Koon's Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor was shot down and crashed into the clone staging area, killing CT-8910 and 140 other clone troopers. Moff Marcellin Wessel reported on CT-8910's death to Emperor Palpatine of the Galactic Empire that had replaced the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "CT-8910 was first mentioned in the article \"Order 66: Destroy All Jedi,\" written by Daniel Wallace and published in Star Wars Insider 87 in April of 2006.
