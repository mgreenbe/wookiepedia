Armed with only a club, the candidate was faced with six large jars in a ten-meter deep pit. Five of the jars were empty, but the sixth contained a Maoi, an amorphous lifeform that attacked prey by slithering down the throat and devouring the internal organs. Without testing the jars\u2014although sensing them through the Force or Ta-Ree magic was permitted\u2014the candidate had to smash at least two jars without releasing the Maoi. The more jars that were smashed, the more the candidate was considered worthy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
