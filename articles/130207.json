The Imperium sought to expand its territory beyond the Ssi-ruuk Star Cluster into the surrounding space due to the dwindling resources in their region. The saurian Ssi-ruuk powered and controlled their technology through a process called entechment; a means of electronically transferring the life-energy of a person into a power source for a mechanical construct."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Between 2 BBY to 4 ABY, the Ssi-ruuk launched expeditionary forces against several Rimward worlds including G'rho, Cattamascar and Bakura. The former two were marginally successfully whereas the latter ended in disaster and exposed the presence of the Ssi-ruuk to the rest of the galaxy. A further campaign into the Chiss Ascendancy brought even more disaster on the Imperium. This was followed by a second punitive raid by a New Republic task force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "So great was the devastation of the Chiss attack that it was not until many years later that the Ssi-ruuvi contemplated renewing their expansion. Two major events occurred in that time. One was the birth of the Keeramak\u2014a mutant Ssi-ruu of mixed ancestry with all the colors of the different castes\u2014an event of major significance in the Ssi-ruuvi religion. The Keeramak himself was a master strategist and politician.

Gradually they formed tribes, each consisted of members with the same skin color. The most dominant were the Blue and Gold scaled tribes. The Blue scaled Ssi-ruuk possessed a great deal of political power, while the Gold-scaled began the Ssi-ruuvi religion. These two would form the Ssi-ruuvi upper class. The Ssi-ruuk eventually encountered the smaller yet more common P'w'ecks and conflict arose between the two species. Eventually, the P'w'ecks were subjugated and enslaved. The Blue and Gold tribes then made an alliance and selected the first Shreeftut. The Ssi-ruuvi Imperium was born and the Blue and Gold tribes then subjugated the rest of Lwhekk and divided them into castes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Conclave and the Elders' Council were formed and eventually the Ssi-ruuk expanded their empire into space. They conquered several worlds and enslaved their inhabitants, most of which were primitives. Eventually the Ssi-ruuk discovered the art of entechment and began enteching subjugated species. The practice of entechment of lower life forms became common; even the P'w'ecks, cousins of the Ssi-ruuk were used. But gradually it was learned that containment of these 'souls' for long periods would result in madness and it was decided that the Imperium needed to expand its realm once again. Another reason was due to the dwindling resources in their isolated region of space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime around 25,000 BBY an experimental Ssi-ruuk hyperdrive vessel crashed on the planet Garos IV.

He offered the Ssi-ruuvi dozens of worlds and millions of Humans to entech, in exchange for the use of Ssi-ruuvi technology. The Shreeftut agreed. In response, they decided to venture into Wild Space where they conquered the small Human colony of G'rho; capturing numerous members of the populace for entechment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among their captives was a Human boy named Dev Sibwarra, whom the Elder Bluescale brainwashed through mind manipulation techniques; what astounded them was the boy possessed strange powers to sense others. It was from this boy that the Admiral Ivpikkis discovered that Humans were the galaxy's dominant species. He also discovered that humanoids had longer containment time when enteched and could last longer than most other species. Due to Sibwarra's Force abilities and his ability to communicate with his fellow Humans, the Ssi-ruuk used Dev Sibwarra to calm the subjects being enteched."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Exploration"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Ssi-ruuvi dispatched three separate expeditionary fleets into the galaxy proper and the nearby Chiss Ascendancy as a means of capturing more humanoids for entechment. A sizeable expeditionary fleet led by Admiral Ivpikkis and Elder Bluescale\u2014who had brought along his Human prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Dev Sibwarra\u2014was deployed against the outlying Imperial planet of Bakura. The second was deployed against the Human world of Cattamascar which the Ssi-ruuvi only narrowly succeeded in conquering.

However, an Alliance fleet had defeated much of the Imperial presence during an epic space battle which also destroyed the second Death Star along with Emperor Palpatine. Prior to 1 ABY, the remote Outer Rim world of Bakura had been independent of Imperial control but its populace was divided.

However, Nereus also double-crossed the saurian aliens by secretly inserting parasitic Olabrian trichoid larvae into Skywalker's food during a meal. The larvae would eat into Skywalker's body upon hatching before killing the aliens themselves. Nereus would then add the Ssi-ruuk's jaw bones to his collection of animal bones.

Fearful of dying on an unconsecrated world, Ivpikkis and the surviving crew escaped the vessel in life-pods and were recovered by the other warships. In the space above Bakura, the joint Alliance and Imperial warships launched a devastating counter-offensive against the Ssi-ruuvi fleet. Due to the chaos onboard the flagship Shriwirr cause by Skywalker's escape and their fear of dying on an unconsecrated world, the Ssi-ruuvi were unable to continue the fight and were forced into a retreat. Every ship in the fleet fled for the safety of Ssi-ruuvi home space except the flagship Shriwirr."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Ssi-ruuk defeated, Nereus put his plans of seizing power and stabbing his Rebel colleagues in the back. He arrested the Bakuran leadership including Prime Minister Yeorg Captison and ordered the Imperial commander Pter Thanas to destroy the Rebel.

Ultimately, his efforts were thwarted by a popular rising of the Bakuran people and the last-minute defection of the commander of Imperial forces over Bakura, Pter Thanas.

Likewise, although several minor Chiss worlds were taken, the Chiss retaliation was massive and unexpected. In retaliation for attacks on several Chiss worlds which had seen several of their citizens enteched, the Chiss Ascendancy had launched a blistering campaign in Ssi-ruuvi territory; devastating the Imperium capital of Lwhekk and fragmenting of the Ssi-ruuvi socio-economic caste system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Voren Na'al of New Republic Intelligence later referred to the battle as the \"Bakura Incident\", and believed that it would be best if the New Republic attempted to prevent widespread public knowledge about the Ssi-Ruuk, advice that was taken controversially at best. To prevent a second Ssi-ruuvi attack on the worlds on the edge of Wild Space, the Rebel Alliance's successor state\u2014the New Republic\u2014organized an invasion force for an expedition into the Ssi-Ruuvi Imperium's territory.

To demonize the opposition and to deflect public attention, Cundertol arranged for himself to be kidnapped by members of the anti-New Republic Freedom resistance movement under Malinza Thanas. Freedom was secretly backed by Cundertol's deputy Blaine Harris as a means of reaching his goal of thwarting Cundertol and becoming the new Prime Minister. In order to allow a successful occupation of Bakura, Lwothin and the Keeramak arranged for Bakura to be \u201cconsecrated\u201d during a public ceremony at a Salis D'aar podium under the pretext of both species' religious fear of dying on an \"unconsecrated\" world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among those present were delegates from the Galactic Alliance including the former Chief of State Leia Organa Solo, her husband Han Solo, their daughter Jaina and Colonel Jagged Fel\u2014the son of the decorated Imperial ace Soontir Fel.

In space, the captured Alliance and Bakuran fighters were freed by the P'w'eck-piloted droid fighters after being led under the deflector shields of the Ssi-ruuvi cruisers. Led by Jagged Fel, the Alliance and Bakuran fighters launched a fierce counter-attack on the Ssi-ruuvi cruisers; capitalizing on their inability to lower their shields to bring in reinforcements without exposing themselves to enemy fire.
