Its interior was covered in glowing lichen. It was still a force to be reckoned with, particularly its advanced dovin basals, which were able to pull the Millennium Falcon from hyperspace. The Falcon was almost captured, but Han Solo released tons of hydrogen into space, which the dovin basals began to absorb. Solo then fired on the hydrogen, turning them into miniature fusion reactors, and overloading the vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sunulok survived Solo's trick and took part in the Battle of Coruscant.
