Distinctive traits of the deesco were free-form dancing and colorful lightings on the dancefloor. In the underwater city of Otoh Gunga, a hydrostatic bubble was specifically designed for deesco dancing. The Gungan Jar Jar Binks was known to be a motivated deesco dancer. Known deesco dance moves included the \"Jumping Jack\", the \"Ballet Spin\", the twist, giving high kicks in the air and waving one's arms high and slow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deesco dancing was one of the six activities featured in Star Wars: Early Learning Activity Center, a children's video game released in 2000 by Lucas Learning. The name and characteristics of that style hint at a parody of disco, a popular genre of music in the 1970s. A similar reference to disco would later appear in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike, where the opening featured several Star Wars characters doing disco dancing under a Death Star-shaped glitterball. The game's arcade mode would also activate a disco ball with Meco's disco-inspired remix for the Star Wars theme when the player approaches the Arcade machines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
