The creature's body consisted of a large thorax covered in jagged plates, five spindly legs set at equidistant points, and a spiny head possessing five eyes and a single mouth with five beak-like mouths. The creatures were roughly the size of a man, and clever enough to ambush prospective prey from behind. In addition, Nadir spiders were capable of spewing a jet of corrosive acid to a range of approximately 7.5 meters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
