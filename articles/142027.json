It was created sometime prior to 3678 BBY on the planet Bunduki by the Followers of Palawa, refugees of the planet Palawa, which was devastated earlier in a war somehow involving the Jedi Council. The Followers of Palawa created Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si solely to fight with Jedi, and presumably, ensure that another world would never be destroyed by the actions of the Council. The Followers of Palawa studied the Force and midi-chlorians, even though they themselves were not necessarily Force-sensitive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si enabled a user to develop extreme speed and an aptitude for anticipating strikes, most notably shown by clone assassins. In addition, Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si taught non-Force-sensitives how to close their minds to Jedi and Sith, thus protecting themselves from mental attacks. Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si also had a developed set of fighting skills, and Nine Edicts. Some lightsaber duelists used Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si techniques in combat, most notably Darth Maul. Jedi Master Anoon Bondara was also a master of Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si techniques, which he coupled with his lightsaber ability to duel. Jedi Knight Joclad Danva was also a Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si practitioner. Jedi Master Plo Koon was believed to be a Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si practitioner as well, since he was a master at hand-to-hand combat. It is not known how Jedi could have been trained in Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si, as the Followers of Palawa did not appear to be on friendly terms with the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phow Ji was a Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si champion who once defeated Joclad Danva.
