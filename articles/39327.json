During his tenure in this year, he hired a traveling spacer to destroy some kubaza beetle nests that had sprung up at a mining camp in an area of the planet known as The Burning Plains. He provided the spacer with a few explosive charges to hasten the job."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The spacer arrived at the camp to find it absolutely infested with the resilient beetle. He set to work immediately, planting the charges and blowing the nests sky high. This raised the ire of the beetles and they immediately attacked, but the spacer expertly killed every last one of them, ending the camps infestation once and for all. Returning to Donko, he was rewarded with 10,000 credits and a mounted kubaza beetle head as a trophy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Donko Jen was a non-playable character in the massively-multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
