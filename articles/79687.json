As with all worlds of the Lan system, except for Lan Barell, Lan Fellov was incapable of supporting life, having a barren and rocky surface and orbited by a single moon. The planet was extremely ore-rich, a fact which lead to its discovery by the Galactic Republic, sometime around 1300 BBY. Soon after, the Gaminne Group, Inc.\u2014a Human mining conglomerate\u2014purchased the system's mining rights from Lan Barell's native species, the insectoid Qieg, and began exploring it, shipping ore to many resource-poor systems. The Qieg and the Human colonists would in time form a stable government, the Human-Qieg Guild, administrating over the entire system. The system would eventually be under the control of the Galactic Empire, although the latter lacked official presence on it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lan Fellov first and only mention, so far, was in the article \"Lan Barell,\" written by Paul Sudlow and published within the Star Wars Adventure Journal 1 in 1994."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
