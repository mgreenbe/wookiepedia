Over the course of several years, Lyra became suspicious of Krennic's motivations for saving her family, and was able to persuade Galen to abandon his research into kyber crystals and flee Coruscant for Lah'mu with the help of Saw Gerrera. Four years later, Krennic and a squad of death troopers found the Erso family, and attempted to bring them all back to Coruscant. Lyra was killed by a death trooper when she threatened Krennic with a blaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, Jyn became part of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and stole plans to the Death Star battle station, Krennic's achievement.

In 22 BBY, a coup occurred on the planet with the help of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The previous ruler, King Chai, was killed and replaced by Marshal Phara, a Separatist ally. Galen and Lyra were caught while trying to escape Vallt, and Galen was arrested on fake charges of espionage against the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Galen was detained by the Vallti, Lyra was being held in the northern wing of the Keep in Tambolor.

While on the planet, the Ersos lead a self-sustaining life by growing crops and filtering water on their large homestead, procured for them by Saw Gerrera. Paranoid of being found by Krennic, the family created an elaborate plan to hide from Krennic, which included the building of an underground bunker beneath a small cave on their property. Krennic and a cadre of death troopers finally found the Erso family and confronted them. Lyra instructed Jyn to escape, but not before giving her a pendant of a kyber crystal fragment, which she had taken from Galen's research materials as they escaped Coruscant. She then fled and her husband Galen told Krennic that she had passed away during their time on Lah'mu. To Galen's dismay, however, Lyra returned and confronted Krennic and his troopers, threatening him with a blaster. Lyra was shot and killed by a trooper, causing her to shoot Krennic in his left shoulder postmortem, injuring him. Lyra's body was taken aboard Krennic's shuttle on a gurney on the Director's orders. Krennic informed Galen that they would have a funeral for Lyra as soon they reached Corscuant and would be honored."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lyra studied the history and philosophy of the Jedi as an outgrowth of her reverence to the natural world.

While living on Coruscant during the early years of the Empire, Lyra began wearing a red sash identified with sects of Force worshipers on planets such as Jedha.
