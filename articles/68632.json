At the time of the Invasion of Naboo, the Jafani were a relatively new presence in the sector, having only arrived as colonists around three hundred years prior, and as such the planet was ruled by the Jafan family, who had led the original settlers. The planet remained on its own for around three centuries before opening themselves to trade and other interactions with neighboring planets such as Naboo. Around 32 BBY, around three thousand Jafani citizens lived on Naboo, some of whom came to Naboo to become more successful artists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jafan featured a unique art style, with landowners commissioning artwork from artists who would use landscapes such as hillsides or rock structures to create large and dramatic pieces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
