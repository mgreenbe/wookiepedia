The base appeared deserted, but Rex advised Denal to be cautious.\nDenal and his squad of clones soon entered the base, only to find it swarming with droids. However, the clones managed to destroy all enemies. Denal was soon contacted by Rex again, who revealed him that unusual droid activity had been spotted in the desert. Denal was sent there. He soon received a distress call from a LAAT/i pilot, who claimed that he could not land because of the droids. Responding to the call, Denal cleared the area. However, even more droids were spotted. The clones, hiding behind the nearby walls, managed to hold themselves against countless waves of CIS droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Denal's next mission was to investigate a Separatist research station, that could have been connected to the new enemy project.
