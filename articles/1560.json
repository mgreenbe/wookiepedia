The first month of the year saw the Battle of Endor, one of the most decisive battles of the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic\u2014the battle saw the destruction of the second Death Star and the death of the Galactic Emperor Palpatine. Palpatine's death largely fragmented the Empire, with many Imperial officers becoming warlords and seizing territory, and the Rebel Alliance transitioned into the Alliance of Free Planets and then the New Republic in the month after Endor. The first few months after the Battle of Endor also saw the Bakura Incident, the first alliance\u2014albeit a temporary one\u2014between the Empire and the Alliance, and also the Nagai\u2013Tof War as the extra-galactic Nagai and Tof species invaded.
