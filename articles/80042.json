When the Sith were defeated he fled to the moon Susevfi where he discovered the lightsaber-resistant cortosis ore and crafted a suit of armor from it, convinced that the Jedi would one day follow him there. They never did, and he spent the last of his lonely days in philosophical musings about the Force, good and evil and his own dark deeds. The result was a journal that was discovered nearly 4,000 years later by the Jensaarai, who incorporated much of his ideas of \"integrating the shadow\" into their own teachings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
