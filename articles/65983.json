To dress up the spartan surroundings the offices of the Captain-Supervisor were lavishly decorated with fur, both real and artificial. The offices also contained a false wall hiding a Viewscreen. In the rear of the facility were holding cells for minor offenders, while another part of the structure near an outside wall had been converted into a secure jail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 ABY the headquarters housed the administration of Captain-Supervisor Grammel.
