After picking it up, he seemed to be cursed, suffering much misfortune. Menth wanted to go home and be rid of the shard, but could not afford a ticket off Mustafar. One day, he came across a spacer and offered to sell him the shard so he could afford the ticket. The spacer agreed and Menth purchased a ticket offworld, leaving the shard in the hands of a spacer. Some say the spacer suffered bad luck, attacked by swarms of lava fleas not long after the purchase, others say he destroyed the shard by throwing it into the lava."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Menth Paul appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
