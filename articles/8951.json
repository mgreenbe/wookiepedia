Somori became estranged from her mother, becoming the captain of a pirate crew. When her crew fell into debts with the Hutts, Somori regularly returned to her mother's village, forcing the inhabitants to pay them in goods and money. Upon one visit to the village, Somori found that it was defended by the consulars Urma Athantras, Velai, and Tione Zrar, who confronted the pirates. After the resulting standoff, Velai suggested that the pirates negotiate with the villagers, and come to a mutual agreement. During the negotiations, Zrar revealed Captain Somori's parentage, and proposed that the pirates protect the village from local narglatches, selling the creatures' hides for more profit than they could get from extorting the villagers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
