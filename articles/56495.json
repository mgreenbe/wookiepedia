It possessed two tracking modes, selected at the push of a firing stud on the missile launcher: EPR mode, which locked onto high-level infrared sources such as vehicular or missile exhausts, and the namesake GAM mode, which first tracks a target's silhouette until close enough to home in on the gravity-wave anomalies resulting from an active repulsorlift. The silhouette-tracking system could be evaded by careful maneuvering or confused by other objects above the horizon, but it was extremely unlikely to lose its target once close enough to acquire a repulsor signature. The missile was capable of pursuing its target for forty kilometers before expending its fuel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the PLX-2, GAM missiles could also be used by the PLX-4 Missile Launcher and the LX-80 anti-infantry missile emplacement.
