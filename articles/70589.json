A doctored recording of Jerec's testimony to the Galactic Senate was used to push for the Republic to intervene in Mandalore's struggle with the Death Watch movement. Jerec was then killed in a bombing on Kalevala. However, Duchess Kryze was able to obtain the full version of his testimony from Davu Golec of the Republic Ministry of Intelligence before Golec was killed by the Death Watch. The full testimony was then played before the Senate which vindicated Kryze and stopped the military intervention by the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
