Two rear vanes acting as ailerons, and side-mounted maneuvering jets mounted on six retractable rods helped the yacht reach an atmospheric top speed of eight hundred kilometers per hour. The vessel had a relatively slow Class Two hyperdrive rating thanks to a Koensayr CL-14 hyperdrive motivator slaved to a standard Ubrikkian hyperdrive unit. Some yachts, such as the one customized by Jabba the Hutt for personal use, were armed with six turbolasers that, while within civilian limits, had capabilities that far exceeded reasonable expectations. At 160 meters long, it was significantly larger than most personal starships.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jabba Desilijic Tiure kept a personal luxury space yacht as a space cruiser customized for personal business trips. The vessel, named Star Jewel,[source?] operated as a flying fortress, and became infamous for its gaudy appearance and the sordid dealings and \"social activities\" carried out within. The interior contained the Hutt's throne room, situated beneath a transparisteel dome, a droid labor pool, a vehicle hangar, a landing bay containing six Z-95 Headhunters and two landing shuttles, and sleeping quarters for Jabba and his guests. Jabba installed hidden gunports to surprise any pirates who might attempt to attack the vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jiliac Desilijic Tiron also owned a star yacht, named Dragon Pearl, which was equally heavily modified with high-powered turbolasers and starfighter hangars.[source?] The Nal Hutta Jewel was an interstellar pleasure craft owned by Ganis, and while his mobile base of operations was well-defended, the yacht was remarkably unostentatious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
