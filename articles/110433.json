During that time, a pirate named Fortombro hijacked an Imperial shipment of mining droids, reprogramming the cargo for combat purposes. Of the entire lot, only RN-18 survived the process, so Fortombro resorted to renting the droid to mixed customers throughout the Anoat sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One such customer was a young smuggler in opposition to the Imperial siege, who dispatched RN-18 on assorted missions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An ancient model of mining droid, RN-18 was humanoid and covered in white plating. The droid had four red photoreceptors, two large and two small, which saw through two openings in the front of a rounded faceplate. Originally programmed for mining, RN-18 was reprogrammed and filled with combat protocols, making the droid a methodical, deadly force and potent crew member. During engagements, RN-18 preferred an offensive approach over a defensive one."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "RN-18 was reprogrammed for combat, which enabled the droid to wield a blaster rifle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "RN-18 was created for Star Wars: Uprising, a canon mobile game developed by Kabam, Disney Interactive, and Lucasfilm for iOS and Android platforms. The game was released on September 10, 2015, and RN-18 became available on January 29, 2016, following the Droid Hero Event, an in-game challenge that revealed RN-18 and two other droid characters, Igniter and STALKER-1."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For a chance to receive RN-18, players had to complete twenty Repeatable Missions on Bespin, the fifth unlockable star system in the game, between January 29, 2016, and February 4, 2016, at 4:00pm PST. Previous events only required five Repeatable Missions to be completed, so many players were upset by the change. Kabam addressed this issue, saying that the amendment was made to reflect the odds of winning the character and difficulty of the levels. If players collected all three Droid Crew, they received the Hutt Guard Droid RZ-4 as a bonus reward, and if players were awarded RN-18 twice, they received a 3NX-series Protection Droid rather than a duplicate RN-18."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Uprising, RN-18 was a unique five-star Crew member who could be used on Crew Runs to collect helpful items, such as credits and gear. RN-18's specifications included an offensive preference, an Imperial background, and skills as a soldier, which made the character strong on Battle Runs. This article assumes 100 percent game completion, meaning RN-18 joined the smuggler and went on these missions. Unlike typical Crew members, RN-18 did not require the use of blueprints to upgrade, making the character one of the most valuable Crew members in the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
