Thanks to this device, the droid could \"see\" in several different modes, accepting signals from the photoreceptors and processing it according to the droid's internal commands. The \"Human\" mode allowed the droid to see in the visual spectrum of Human beings. Other modes included a neon mode that enhanced color saturation, and an infrared mode that allowed the droid to see in the dark."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
