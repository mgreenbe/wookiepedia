Unlike previous traffic regulation packages, the DX-300 could suggest the best track available to commuters by use of regulating signals. A lecture detailing the package was held on the Outer Rim world of Taris, during which the lecturer claimed the device was an invaluable tool for anyone looking to work as a civil engineer. The lecture was interrupted when Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick crashed his airspeeder into the building."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DX-300 package's first and only mention was in the second issue of the Knights of the Old Republic comic book series.
