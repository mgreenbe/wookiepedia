Born in the poverty on Ryloth, Rar and her sister Numa were enslaved and worked together as dancers to earn to survive in the ryll drug dens of the planet's major subterranean city, Kala'uun. They always witnessed the cruelty and hardships in the drug dens of the city. The two Force-sensitive Twi'lek girls were eventually rescued from their bleak existence by Jedi Knight Daeshara'cor and taken to be trained in the ways of the Force on Yavin 4. When the galaxy was invaded by the alien Yuuzhan Vong in 25 ABY, the Rar sisters battled the belligerent species on the front lines, leading a partisan resistance movement on the occupied planet of New Plympto. It was following the razing of New Plympto that her sister was killed due to being struck by corrosive acid. After being healed, Alema grieved for her sister's loss and began to sway close to the dark side. When the Yuuzhan Vong unleashed creatures known as voxyn upon the Jedi Order, the Twi'lek joined the Myrkr strike team, many of whom died on the Mission to Myrkr. During this affair, Alema began to find her way into the affections of Anakin Solo, whom she found attractive. Following her elevation to the rank of Jedi Knight, Rar fought alongside the New Republic Defense Force as a starfighter pilot, flying in Twin Suns Squadron and participating in battles at Ylesia; Ebaq 9; Bilbringi; and in the war's final engagement\u2014the Recapture of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Six years after the war had ended, however, Rar and the surviving members of the Myrkr strike team received a call through the Force from Raynar Thul, who had been abducted by Dark Jedi Lomi Plo and Welk during the mission to Myrkr and presumed dead. Traveling to the Unknown Regions, Alema Rar discovered Thul, now leader of the insectoid Killik species, engaged in a border dispute with the Chiss Ascendancy. The Killik hive mind, as it did to Rar's Jedi companions, soon rendered the Twi'lek a Joiner, her individuality largely subsumed by the power of the Killiks' natural telepathic bond. Unlike other Jedi who became Joiners, however, Alema Rar was made aware of the Gorog nest\u2014overseen by Lomi Plo\u2014which was secretly controlling Thul and the Killiks. Plo, in fact a Sith Master, manipulated Rar's still powerful emotions of grief and anger over her sister's death, thus ensuring that the Jedi Knight completed her fall to the dark side; the Twi'lek assumed the title of Night Herald of the Gorog and, turning against her former friends, became Plo's right hand in the resulting Swarm War. By the time the conflict had concluded, Rar had grown mentally unstable.

Once she had allied herself with the resurgent Dark Lady of the Sith Lumiya, Rar hunted her targets during the Second Galactic Civil War, engaging the Skywalkers and the Solos in a series of skirmishes upon her surprising return. When Mara Jade Skywalker was killed, in fact by Lumiya's new Sith apprentice Jacen Solo, the Twi'lek was thought to be responsible, and a Jedi strike team was formed to neutralize her. A brief dalliance with the One Sith, the possession of the ancient Meditation Sphere Ship, and even the knowledge of advanced Sith techniques were all ultimately unable to protect Rar; the fallen Jedi was tracked down to the late Lumiya's retreat, and died there at the hands of Jagged Fel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early years"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alema Rar was born around 10 ABY into one of the most dangerous ryll dens of Kala'uun, the largest underground city of the Twi'lek homeworld, Ryloth.

They grew up together in the cave warrens of Ryloth, and throughout her life Rar retained her preference for confined spaces. Together, they witnessed much of the cruelty and hardships of the galaxy. As a dancer on Ryloth, Rar would learn the grace and dexterity which would aid her in lightsaber combat in years to come, as well as the feminine charm found alluring by so many males. She came to love dancing, despite her status as a slave.

Alongside Numa, Alema became one of the founders and leaders of the resistance force against the Yuuzhan Vong on the occupied planet New Plympto. On New Plympto, Rar's anger and grief were tempered by the presence of her sister. The resistance, supplied by maverick Jedi Kyp Durron, saw many successes against the invading Yuuzhan Vong. As the leaders of the movement, Rar and her sister used their physical similarities to masquerade as a single Twi'lek woman, or even a Human with suitable disguises. At resistance meetings, only one of the two sisters would ever be present, maintaining the charade that only one leader existed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This deception fooled the Yuuzhan Vong, but Rar was faced with other, more personal issues. Her partisan war against the enemy was drawing her close to the dark side of the Force, and Master Skywalker, the head of the Jedi Order, felt that Rar was putting her integrity as a Jedi at risk. The Rar sisters soon suffered another loss; the New Plympto resistance became successful enough that the frustrated Yuuzhan Vong decided to raze the planet, rather than continue to attempt subjugation. All life was wiped from the surface of the planet, rendering it uninhabitable and killing seven million sentients. The Rar sisters were only just able to flee in time, hiding with several thousand other beings aboard a fleet of intrasystem ore miners until help arrived in the form of the Corellian cruiser Nebula Chaser, already loaded with refugees. The captain of the Nebula Chaser, Pollux, promised the Jedi sisters safe asylum.

The Rar sisters hid in Pollux's cabin, observing via a console feed as a group of Yuuzhan Vong warriors questioned the captain and his crew. With the Yuuzhan Vong, however, they sensed an unfamiliar, feral presence, somehow attuned to the Force. The Yuuzhan Vong boarding party had brought with them a voxyn, a bio-engineered creature bred from the vornskrs of Myrkr, able to hunt using the Force. Captain Pollux had claimed that there were no Jedi aboard the Nebula Chaser; Rar and her sister, suspecting the voxyn's ability to sense Jedi, were aware that if detected they would be placing their protector's life in danger. With their power to shut down their presences in the Force having no effect, Rar wished to confront and kill the voxyn. Her sister, on the other hand, knew that the Yuuzhan Vong would kill the crew once they discovered Pollux's lie."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sisters removed their lightsabers' Adegan crystals and used fleshglue to attach them in their navels.

In the ensuing chaos, Numa was struck in the face by corrosive acid, spewed from the voxyn's mouth. Rar held her sister as Numa died, suffering severe acidic burns in the process, and before long the escape pod launched into space.

Even without this knowledge, Rar was raging inside with grief and anger. While the Twi'lek recovered the threat of the voxyn grew greater. Several Jedi fell to the creatures, which were deposited on worlds and relay junctions across the invasion corridor to seek out hidden Force-wielders. Eventually, Jedi healer Cilghal discovered that the voxyn were being cloned from a single female, which was subsequently referred to as the voxyn queen. A mission to Froz was organized to retrieve more of the creatures for study and Anakin Solo and a squadron of fellow Jedi managed to return with several dead voxyn. By the time Alema Rar was out of the bacta tank, and informed of the destruction of the Nebula Chaser, it had been discerned that the voxyn queen was located on or nearby the planet Myrkr, which was itself deep within Yuuzhan Vong territory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rar attended a meeting to discuss the threat, where she began to inveigle her way into the affections of Anakin Solo, whom she found attractive. Using her feminine charms, Rar soon entered into a subtle rivalry with Tahiri Veila, a childhood friend of Solo's, over the young man's affections. Sexual pursuits, however, were soon put aside as the gathering descended into an argument. Anakin Solo had raised the idea of a team of Jedi turning themselves in to the Yuuzhan Vong, thus gaining access to Yuuzhan Vong occupied space, before traveling to Myrkr and ending the voxyn threat. Jacen Solo, who was pursuing a pacifistic approach to conflict, claimed that the Yuuzhan Vong would retaliate for any attack on Myrkr, killing the millions of refugees currently held hostage over the planet Talfaglio. Unable to bear responsibility for the deaths of her sister and the thousands of refugees who had died indirectly due to her actions, Rar took the line of blaming any innocent death on the Yuuzhan Vong themselves, and renounced any culpability for possible Yuuzhan Vong reprisals at Talfaglio."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mission to Myrkr was given approval by Luke Skywalker and other authority figures at Eclipse Station, and the team of Jedi was quickly composed.

The seventeen Jedi members of the team were supported by two Yuuzhan Vong Hunter S-series battle droids, recently developed by Tendrando Arms.

Among the diverse group, however, differences were already arising. Jedi such as Jacen Solo, Zekk and Ulaha Kore felt that it was imperative that the Jedi should not go into the mission feeling that any action was necessary so long as it enabled success. Alema Rar, on the other hand, was the principal adherent of the view that the ends justified the means\u2014if the dark side was to help them complete their mission, then Rar felt it was a simple choice to take up its power and save the New Jedi Order from the voxyn. The Twi'lek was supported in her views by Raynar Thul, who had recently lost his friend Lusa to voxyn and desired revenge. It was decided that the Jedi, in an attempt to promote team unity and uphold each other's spirits during the coming stress of interrogation, death, and battle, would form a Force meld. With such a tactic in mind the Jedi set off with Calrissian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lady Luck, with the Jedi on board, traveled to the edge of the invasion corridor and was soon intercepted and boarded by the Exquisite Death, a Yuuzhan Vong vessel. Calrissian did not inform Rar and the other Jedi that the Yuuzhan Vong were aboard the yacht, so that their surprise would appear genuine. Rar, however, sensed the presence of a voxyn, and the specter of another encounter with the beast filled the Twi'lek with fear. Rar was frightened less of the creature itself than what her own reaction would be\u2014letting the team down, and having their deaths on her conscience, was in her opinion worse than any voxyn. Soon, Yuuzhan Vong warriors stormed into the galley where the Jedi were eating. To grant the YVH droids time to attach themselves to the hull of the Exquisite Death, docked to the Lady Luck, the Jedi team created a disturbance, as part of the plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the Force, the Jedi tore weapons lockers open and took up arms while Tesar Sebatyne held Duman Yaght, the Yuuzhan Vong commander, hostage.

As the Yuuzhan Vong retaliated against the unarmed Jedi, and led them all too quickly through the docking membrane to their vessel, Ulaha Kore attempted to buy more time for the YVH droids to complete their clandestine mission. For her efforts, the Bith was stabbed through the back with a coufee blade by one of the warriors. Rar and every other member felt Kore's pain, but the Twi'lek was relieved that no one had actually died, and that she had not broken down.

Kore was tortured extensively; already suffering from the severe wound to her back and the puncture to her single lung, the Bith was supported by the Force Meld as best the Jedi could manage in their weakened state. Commander Yaght questioned Kore continually on the existence of the secret Jedi base, and when the other members of the strike team began to feel that it would be easier on the wounded Bith if she relinquished the name and location, Rar grew worried, able to see that Yaght's goal was not to break Kore's spirit, but the spirit of the strike team. When she communicated this fear to Jaina Solo, Rar was struck and rendered unconscious by her captors. Despite her wounds, Kore soon managed to bring about the death of the voxyn, and the Yuuzhan Vong commander became aware that the Jedi were too dangerous to be incarcerated for a long period of interrogation.

Ganner Rhysode was also being held hostage in an unknown part of the vessel, adding further complications. With Anakin Solo in the lead, Rar and the other Jedi worked their way through the vessel. The Twi'lek provided advice to Solo, careful to make her interest in him apparent, as well as going on point with the young man, using her lightsaber alongside his to cut a path toward Rhysode. The strike team reached the bridge, where they killed Duman Yaght and rescued Rhysode.

After a evening reception thrown in their honor, the new Jedi Knights journeyed to the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk, where Bothan admiral Traest Kre'fey was planning for a string of minor offensives against the Yuuzhan Vong in order to improve the experience of new rookie recruits. Admiral Kre'fey had been particularly interested by the Jedi art of battle meditation and the Force Meld, which he felt could be vital in coordinating strikes against the Yuuzhan Vong. Rar was also sent to Kashyyyk for another reason; it was hoped by the Jedi Masters on the High Council that with her companions, and with the Force Meld, the Twi'lek Jedi's grief and anger could be held at bay, until the emotions were eventually overcome."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alema Rar conducted several raids alongside Kre'fey's forces, led by the admiral aboard his flagship, the Bothan Assault Cruiser Ralroost. Before long, Jedi Master Kyp Durron approached Kre'fey with a plan to strike at the headquarters of the Peace Brigade, a group which collaborated with the Yuuzhan Vong, on the planet Ylesia, in the Cha Raaba system. By the time of the Battle of Ylesia, Rar was a squadron commander alongside Veila and Zekk. During the battle, however, Rar, Veila, Zekk, and Durron, along with Saba Sebatyne, held their squadrons back, as the motley Peace Brigade Fleet required the strength of only one of Kre'fey's three task forces to be defeated and forced to surrender. The Twi'lek lent Jacen Solo, who was flying in the battle with his sister's Twin Suns Squadron, a measure of her strength through the Force Meld, which proved a success throughout the conflict in the Cha Raaba system. Peace City, the Ylesian capital, was stormed and the surviving members of the Ylesian Senate taken into custody, including Pwoe, a pretender Chief of State. Although the arrival of a Yuuzhan Vong fleet toward the end of the battle threatened Kre'fey's departure, the arriving hostile force was beaten back and the New Republic ships left the system with another victory to their name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twi'lek was later present at an emergency congregation of Jedi aboard the Mon Adapyne, a MC80B Star Cruiser attached to Admiral Kre'fey's fleet. Jedi Masters Durron and Sebatyne had received an urgent message from Luke Skywalker warning all Jedi that the Old Republic Jedi Vergere, who had as an apparent ally of the Yuuzhan Vong protected Jacen Solo while in captivity, had gone on the run and was to be captured and detained if encountered. As Kre'fey's forces were still preparing, along with the Jedi, to initiate attacks on poorly defended Yuuzhan Vong worlds, Rar and the others could not afford to put aside time to hunt for Vergere. Strikes were conducted at Gyndine, Nal Hutta, and Wayland, all Yuuzhan Vong occupied worlds, before Kre'fey led his forces into the Deep Core. There, on the moon of Ebaq 9, a secret New Republic base had been set up. The centerpiece of an elaborate trap conceived by the famed Admiral Ackbar, the base on Ebaq 9 had been rapidly constructed, and word of its construction deliberately leaked to the Yuuzhan Vong spy network. Defending Ebaq 9 were the forces of Agamarian General Keyan Farlander, along with Twins Suns Squadron. The Yuuzhan Vong arrived, as planned, and engaged this small defense force. Jacen Solo, on the bridge of the Ralroost, was alerted by Farlander's forces, and in turn informed Kre'fey that the time was right to strike."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bothan admiral emerged out of hyperspace and began to attack the Yuuzhan Vong fleets; Alema Rar, along with Kyp Durron, Saba Sebatyne, the Corellian Jedi Master Corran Horn, and the other Jedi with whom she had been fighting alongside for the past months, piloted their starfighters into the fray. The battle quickly turned in the New Republic's favor, as more fleets exited hyperspace and forced the Yuuzhan Vong warmaster, Tsavong Lah, to order a suicidal attack on the base on Ebaq 9, where Jaina Solo, Lowbacca, and the rest of Twin Suns Squadron were sheltering. The Yuuzhan Vong warmaster landed 10,000 Yuuzhan Vong warriors on the moon and proclaimed that only Jedi could approach and land. Through the battle meld, Skywalker informed Rar and the other Jedi present that they were going to land on Ebaq 9 and extract Solo and her pilots. In the end, it was not necessary for Rar to descend to the surface of the moon and fight against overwhelming odds. Vergere, who had been hiding aboard the Ralroost, boarded an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor and sacrificed herself to ensure that Jacen Solo, who had traveled ahead to the moon to save his sister, survived. In the process she wiped out the 10,000 warriors on the moon and, due to these actions, Jaina Solo and the rest of Twin Suns Squadron were saved.

Rar flew with Twin Suns Squadron at the battle of the Duro system, once again under the command of General Wedge Antilles. In part of a carefully prepared plan to retake Fondor, Antilles took his forces on a extended advance through the Duro system. A heavy day's fighting ensued, and more and more Yuuzhan Vong forces arrived to reinforce their beleaguered holdings in the Duro system.

The Twi'lek bought herself some time by referring to the datachip, but as the Togorian began to crush the air out of her lungs, she was forced to stab him in the leg with her dart. A woman spoke out and put an end to the fight, and Rar was surprised to find over thirty hooded figures watching from the courtyard balconies. Another unknown figure spoke to her from one of the balconies and appropriated the datachip with the Force when Rar presented it.

Even more surprising for Rar was that the principal figure in the Sith delegation sent to meet Lumiya had been none other than Lomi Plo. The revelation that the former queen of the Gorog hive had been a Sith Master led to a string of further questions, which in turn led to Rar attempting to explain the Balance.

In fact, the Twi'lek remained on Korriban for three nights, while the Sith instructed her in the use of the Meditation Sphere and provided her with a gift for Jacen Solo. The gift in question was the holocron of Darth Vectivus, deemed as useless by the Sith and intended as an insult to Solo's status.

To Solo\u2014now Darth Caedus, a Sith Lord\u2014Rar projected a sense of hope and promises of victory and safety, as well as her customary sexual overtures. With the power of the Sith Meditation Sphere reinforcing her strength in the Force, Rar urged Caedus to advance toward the Bothan fleet.

In fact, Rar had targeted the new Sith Order for destruction, following her righting of the Balance with the deaths of the Solos and Skywalkers, who remained her primary objectives. The Twi'lek made her home in the late Lumiya's quarters and read the Sith Lady's extensive notes on an arcane Sith technique\u2014the creation of Force phantoms. The Sith art would allow Rar to transcend her mutilations and deformities for a time, as she transmuted her consciousness across the galaxy in order to hunt for her foes.

Rar's doppelg\u00e4nger emerged in the cockpit of the YT-1300 light freighter and threatened Han Solo, surprising the Corellian when she used telekinesis to whisk the blaster from his hand. As Solo threw the freighter into a series of emergency maneuvers, Rar's doppelg\u00e4nger was largely unencumbered, as the Twi'lek's phantom was not subject to the same laws of physics. She then directed the phantom to attack the light freighter's hyperdrive but was forced to battle both the swiftly alternating gravity as well as Leia Organa Solo's lightsaber.

Confident in her ability to eliminate her opponents, Alema Rar was nevertheless unaware of the true nature or agenda of the Sith intruders, who throughout the engagement planted high-yield explosives upon the Home. Moving quickly to the hangar, Rar left several bombs in the vicinity, in order to trap and kill the three pilots\u2014Jaina Solo, Zekk, and Jagged Fel\u2014upon their arrival. Retreating down into the depths of the asteroid, accessible only via a mine cart network, Rar then used her Force senses, heightened by the dark side power of the habitat, to locate the Millennium Falcon and the three members of the Alema Rar Task Force moving through the asteroid.

As Rar attempted to evade her former friend, the explosives planted by the Sith began to detonate, venting the mine shaft's air. Unaware of who was destroying the asteroid, Rar swatted Solo out of her way with an exertion in the Force and continued to ascend, only to be confronted by Jagged Fel. Below, Solo escaped, while Fel, using a jetpack built in to the modified armor he was wearing, pursued the Twi'lek up the mine shaft.

Triumphant, Rar delivered a short speech to Fel on his errors, as she advanced her lightsaber toward him telekinetically. Just as the Twi'lek sensed Fel's anticipation the Human's rigged blaster exploded in her hand, blowing off her good arm below the elbow and leaving her defenseless and in shock. Fel crossed the distance between them and took the Twi'lek's neck in one of the Mandalorian crushgaunts he was wearing. Aware that she was finally about to die, Rar looked to Fel for clemency.

In her last moments, Rar used the Force to speak directly into Fel's mind, urging him to recall the person she had been before her turn to to the dark side.

Rar's troubled and bitter childhood, although somewhat ameliorated by a love for dance, left Rar with a precarious attachment to her sister and Jedi mentor.

Despite the fact that Rar wished to preserve Killik lives and protect the Gorog hive, the Twi'lek was willing, however, to use the lives of the insectoids to her advantage.

Occasionally, the Twi'lek used the Force to manipulate the inoperable arm; it did, however, create problems for Rar in terms of combat and maneuverability. This was not to be the end of Rar's mutilations. During her duel with Leia Organa Solo aboard the Admiral Ackbar, the Twi'lek lost her right lekku to the a blaster bolt.

Her body took on a lopsided twist. Rar's deformities made her easily trackable once holocam imagery of her was obtained. As one of the few unaffected areas of her body, Rar's face, with its thin, straight nose and high cheekbones, remained her last prize. The coy smiles and suggestive looks the Rutian had once favored, however, became cold expressions despite her best efforts, due to the severe psychological and physiological trauma the fallen Jedi had suffered. Rar's body was further damaged during the Second Galactic Civil War; during her escape from the Errant Venture, Jagged Fel broke her left clavicle with a blaster shot.

Nevertheless, Rar was able to wait for an opening before eliminating the Jedi Master, utilizing Dun M\u00f6ch in conjunction with her lightsaber technique to undermine her opponent's confidence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Rar fought another Jedi Master, Mara Jade Skywalker, at Roqoo Depot, she was able to surprise the woman with her skill. The Twi'lek was able to hold a defensive technique for an extended period, in order to hold her opponent in place or delay their departure, and while doing so, was able to deflect blaster bolts from a skilled shooter such as Han Solo with little difficulty. Rar was also proficient in the fourth form of lightsaber combat. She often incorporated hand-to-hand combat in her fighting, kicking her opponents or even using her sharp Twi'lek talons as weapons. During duels, Rar could make use of the power of Force speed, enhancing the rapidity of her actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alongside her considerable capabilities in the Force, Alema Rar also possessed numerous other talents. During the Mission to Myrkr, she proved herself proficient with blasters and grenades. The Twi'lek was a capable sniper, utilizing a longblaster to eliminate opponents with headshots. She had knowledge of demolitions, using them herself to enter Lumiya's quarters, and was able to defuse high-yield explosives, possessing knowledge of both Imperial and Galactic Alliance detonators. Her knowledge of traps encouraged the other Jedi to place her on point several times during the Mission to Myrkr, and while infiltrating Lumiya's home she was able to detect and disarm numerous snares and traps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When she defended the Home against intruders, Rar also set up a number of her own traps in order to eliminate some of her opponents. Rar was also a proficient gunner, proving herself on the Millennium Falcon during an engagement at Borleias. She was a skilled user of a blowgun, although several of her crucial shots missed their targets. During her time as a leader of the New Plympto resistance, Rar also made use of her skills of subterfuge and was well versed on interrogation techniques, as proven when she saw through Duman Yaght's objective during the torture sessions aboard the Exquisite Death, as well as on guerrilla tactics and strategy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rar was an expert at disguise, and could act when the necessity arose, fooling Yuuzhan Vong and others on a number of occasions during the war. She could fix a hyperdrive and was able to pilot a diverse range of spacefaring vessels, including ancient Sith craft, Sekotan starships, and a Yuuzhan Vong frigate, along with starfighters and other vehicles such as skiffs and swoops. The Twi'lek was a skilled pilot, fighting in an elite unit such as Twin Suns Squadron and commanding her own squadron during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Rar's knowledge of starships and mechanics aided her in subtle acts of sabotage, such as the damage she inflicted upon the Millennium Falcon when she attacked the Solos in 35 ABY and upon the Jade Shadow at Roqoo Depot five years later. Her time spent in the caves of Ryloth during her youth gave her a strong sense of direction, which came in use during the Mission to Myrkr when she led the team through the voxyn warrens. Her self-proclaimed strongest talents, however, following her turn to the dark side, lay in the direction of surveillance and assassination. In unison with her extensive Force abilities, and her time spent with Lomi Plo and the Killiks, these talents made Rar a dangerous foe to her enemies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Knight of the New Jedi Order, a pilot, Dark Jedi and assassin, Rar possessed several lightsabers and other weapons throughout her thirty-odd years of life. The Twi'lek's first lightsaber, which she built herself, was powered by an Adegan crystal, and emitted a silver blade. When fleeing the Yuuzhan Vong aboard the Nebula Chaser, both Alema Rar and her sister were forced to abandon the signature weapons of the Jedi. The lightsabers were thrown into a disintegration chute, and the Rar sisters kept only their crystals, attached to their navels as decorative jewelry. By the time of the Mission to Myrkr, Rar had another, silver-bladed lightsaber, which saw her through the duration of the war and beyond."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35 ABY, however, when Rar fell to the dark side, she used the blade against the Solos when trying to maroon them. The silver-bladed lightsaber was later taken from her by Luke Skywalker during their duel on the moon of Kr. Skywalker subsequently used the weapon as he fought Welk, but Lomi Plo used her abilities to power down the weapon, rendering it useless. Rar soon built another of the signature weapons of the Jedi, once again powered by an Adegan crystal. When she confronted Luke Skywalker and Han Solo in the Saras hangar on Woteba, the Jedi Master appropriated her blade a second time. Following their negotiations, Rar demanded the return of her lightsaber and was outraged when Skywalker removed the crystal and crushed it with the Force, before returning the hilt to the Twi'lek."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Rar built her next lightsaber, she abandoned the silver-colored blade she had favored and created a weapon which emitted a deep blue blade, which almost appeared black. It was with this weapon that Rar combated Leia Organa Solo aboard the Admiral Ackbar and again on Tenupe at the war's conclusion. When Rar was eaten by the spidersloth, her sword arm was taken in first. Rar was able to use the blade to slit the creature's throat and retained the weapon until her duel on Roqoo Depot against Mara Jade Skywalker, using it to decapitate Tresina Lobi in Fellowship Plaza."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Twi'lek was knocked unconscious by Jade Skywalker outside Roqoo Depot's cantina, she again had her weapon taken from her. For the final time, Rar rebuilt a new lightsaber, once again with a dark blue blade, which she wielded against her opponents at Gilatter VIII and at the Home. Rar's last lightsaber was not recovered by the members of the Alema Rar Task Force and therefore was destroyed along with the Twi'lek's corpse when the asteroid habitat was obliterated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fallen Jedi's other signature weapon, following her two years in the Tenupian jungle, was her blowgun and poison darts. Rar obtained many of her toxins from her time on Tenupe, most notably a small amount of Tenupian flesh-eating bacteria, which she gave to the Togorian Morto as a \"salve\" for the poison-induced pain she had inflicted upon his leg. She utilized powerful poisons to eliminate her enemy, one dart containing enough to eliminate the World Brain on Coruscant and assumed by her to be fatal to an extremely powerful Jedi such as Jacen Solo. The poison rapidly eliminated any beings unfortunate enough to be hit by the darts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along with her lightsaber, Rar lost her blowgun to Jade Skywalker on Roqoo Depot, but soon acquired another, which she wielded against the Jedi who attacked her on the Errant Venture. The darts were not strong enough to pierce armor, however. Alema Rar's use of poison was well known to her opponents, and it was as such that Jacen Solo eliminated his aunt with a poison dart on Kavan, aware that investigations would point towards the rogue Twi'lek."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other than the Sith Meditation Sphere unwittingly bequeathed to her by Lumiya, Rar was not known to possess a personal vessel, although she piloted X-wings in the Yuuzhan Vong War and a StealthX in the Dark Nest Crisis and the Swarm War.

She was also equipped with other weapons such as concussion grenades and carried around with her equipment to be used in infiltration and reconnaissance, such as her datapad. Following her exile from the Jedi Order and her stint in the Tenupian jungles, the Twi'lek did not have access to funds, nor did she retain credits, choosing to abandon even large sums of cash when she discovered them at Lumiya's retreat during her search for the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alema Rar was introduced in Troy Denning's The New Jedi Order: Star by Star, in which her eventual fall to the dark side was prophesied by the principal Star Wars character Luke Skywalker. This prediction gave Rar's subsequent actions during the Mission to Myrkr plotline more context, as Rar's inner darkness and fearfulness came to the fore. Rar's character, as portrayed in subsequent novels in the New Jedi Order series, consistently showed this gradual fall; in The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey, which focused around Jaina Solo's similar descent in the dark side of the Force, author Elaine Cunningham had the Twi'lek portrayed as a kindred spirit of Solo's, and in Aaron Allston's The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream, Rar's exuberance in the killing of Yuuzhan Vong by this time typified the character's nature."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twi'lek also made appearances in Walter Jon Williams's The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way and The New Jedi Order: Ylesia, fighting as a pilot. Rar was included in Greg Keyes' The New Jedi Order: The Final Prophecy and James Luceno's The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force, the last two novels in the series, as a supporting Jedi character in a minor role. It was not until the Dark Nest Trilogy, written by Troy Denning, that Alema Rar would return as a leading character."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the first installment of the Dark Nest series, The Joiner King, Rar's turn to darkness was realized, with the backdrop of the Dark Nest Crisis to explain the final cause. Denning had Luke Skywalker recall his Star by Star prediction, and the author went on to portray the Twi'lek as the dark side nemesis of Leia Organa Solo, who was developed as a Jedi Knight throughout the trilogy. Organa Solo's ascension to becoming a skilled Jedi was reflected as she fared increasingly better against Rar, culminating in her defeat of the Twi'lek during the finale of the last novel, The Swarm War. When asked on TheForce.Net's Jedi Council Forums whether he had planned Rar's multiple injuries as a \"running gag\", Denning claimed that he had not and that he had only become aware of the character's propensity for injury during the writing of Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Denning, however, left Alema Rar's fate deliberately uncertain, her death unverified. He refused to answer queries as to whether Rar would be making subsequent appearances following the publication of Dark Nest III: The Swarm War. Indeed, Rar was subsequently included in the Legacy of the Force series as an antagonist with her own agenda. Although re-introduced in Denning's first book of the series\u2014Legacy of the Force: Tempest, the third in the series' chronological sequence\u2014readers were already made aware of her survival by means of a excerpt from Tempest which had been included in Karen Traviss' Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines, the preceding installment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his novel, Denning continued to focus on Rar's darkness but gave the character her own set of morals and agenda, while having her fight alongside resurgent Marvel Comics villain Lumiya. Denning felt that Rar's philosophy of the Balance was an indication that she saw the \"good\" and \"evil\" elements of Star Wars more clearly than most other characters and that her adherence to the idea of Balance was a natural reaction to the ordeals she had suffered. Denning also stated that he felt that by the time of the Second Galactic Civil War, Rar had replaced the object of her anger and grief at the loss of her sister with that of the destruction of the Gorog nest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While seen by some as Denning's \"pet character\", just as Traviss had Boba Fett and Allston, the series' third author, had Wedge Antilles, Alema Rar's role was nevertheless taken up in equal measure in Legacy of the Force: Exile, the novel written by Allston which took place after Tempest. In Exile, a plotline was developed which saw Jaina Solo, Jagged Fel, and Zekk hunting down the Dark Jedi. Allston professed during an interview that he had not immediately taken to Rar's character but later came to enjoy the Twi'lek's idiosyncrasies and traits, as well as the character's fighting spirit. Alema Rar played a minor role in Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice, the next novel, although following the death of Mara Jade Skywalker, the Twi'lek once again became the focus of the Solo, Zekk, Fel plotline, which was expanded upon in Inferno."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Inferno, a scene in which Rar meets with the One Sith, the antagonists of the Star Wars: Legacy comics series, provided a link between the Legacy of the Force series and the comics, which are set in and beyond 130 ABY. The Alema Rar Task Force plotline was to some extent a precursor to Jaina Solo's later targeting of her fallen brother in Legacy of the Force: Invincible, as well as a vehicle with which to develop the long-running Solo-Fel-Zekk love triangle, but nevertheless served to bring Alema Rar's story to conclusion. Contrary to the established view that Rar was Denning's pet character, the Twi'lek was in fact killed off in the latter half of Legacy of the Force: Fury, which was written by Aaron Allston."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
