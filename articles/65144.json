Under the control of the Galactic Empire, this base was used as a hiding spot for several stolen Rebel X-Wings. The Empire hoped to use these X-Wings for illicit purposes, in an attempt to turn public opinion against the Rebel Alliance. However, a Rebel operative working for Wedge Antilles overheard two Imperial officers discussing this plan in the city of Bela Vistal. To pave the way for disrupting their plans, this Rebel operative set off towards the base, eliminated a number of stormtrooper guards, and destroyed three security terminals within the base's bunker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Base on Corellia was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
