Although it was not as rare as its predecessor, the Death Star medal, it was still considered impressive, and many were awarded posthumously because of the deadly circumstances of the naval battle above Endor. It was essentially identical to the previous Death Star medal, as it featured a completed Death Star battle station with a small Aurebesh number two at the center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Similarly to the Death Star medal, the Death Star II medal was worn on a ribbon rack on a dress uniform or on the collar of a flight suit. Wedge Antilles was the only member of the Alliance Military who was permitted to wear both the Death Star medal and the Death Star II medal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
