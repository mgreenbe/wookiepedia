In 3956 BBY, two colonists, Calder Nettic and Rickard Lusoff, engaged in a drunken altercation in a cantina at the spaceport of Garang, the capital city of the Outer Rim planet Dantooine. According to the Garang authorities, after Lusoff accused Nettic of cheating him out of credits in a business deal, Tooka was dispatched to the cantina and resolved the conflict. The incident was recorded in the Garang archives as well as those of the Jedi Enclave. Later, Nettic was murdered by Handon Guld, another colonist, in Dantooine's Ancient Grove."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Knight Bolook and former Sith Lord Revan, who lost his memory and retrained as a Jedi, thus investigated the murder.
