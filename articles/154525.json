During the Battle of Hoth between the Empire and Alliance on and above the planet Hoth in the year 3 ABY, the individual was serving onboard the Mon Calamari cruiser Champion. As the Champion was about to leave Hoth, the scanner operator picked up an incoming starship on sensors. The starship was further identified by three other technicians as the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Tyrant. The captain of the Tyrant, Xamuel Lennox, ordered the Captain of the Champion to hand over Rebellion General Crix Madine, who had been recently rescued from the Tyrant by Rebel commandos. The Champion's captain refused to comply, starting a battle in which the Champion was eventually able to escape to hyperspace and reach the Rebel's rendezvous point."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel scanner operator briefly appeared in the mission text of the third scenario of the light side campaign from The Price of Victory, which was released in 2010 as the eighth set of the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
