Thorn's men landed in twelve specialized Republic gunships and one Consular-class Armed Cruiser. After corruption was found in the previous ruling council, Clovis was elected to lead the Banking Clan with the support of the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems on the condition that he would work in the interests of both factions. Upon arriving on Scipio, Amidala and Clovis entered the Main Vault fortress with the Separatist representative Bec Lawise, leaving Thorn and his troopers to guard their ships outside of the main compound. Thorn assured Amidala that the clone troopers would remain close by in case the senator required their assistance. Clovis assumed control of the banks but was later forced by the Confederate leader Count Dooku to raise interest rates on the Republic. Afterward, Dooku sent an invasion force to occupy Scipio so he could frame Clovis for conducting a Separatist takeover of the banks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thorn was inside the cruiser when another trooper alerted him or the invasion force that was quickly approaching them, and, realizing that his men's position on the landing platform was vulnerable, ran outside and ordered the clones to retreat into the city.

Unable to reach the senator, Thorn used a comlink to contact Amidala and advised her to find a way to escape from Scipio.
