Vareesa was the cousin of Vanster Enan, who ran a sop house on Cularin. On Ralltiir, Vareesa was befriended by fellow Ithorian Kikow and the Wookiee Furellas, though both apparently had ulterior motives. Furellas bought a Ralltiir tiger kitten for Vareesa and helped smuggle him offworld. Vareesa named the kitten \"Little Kikow\", unaware that he would grow up to be bloodthirsty and unmanageable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
