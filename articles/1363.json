During the Battle of Teth in 22 BBY, 4-A7 was stationed at a B'omarr Order Monastery, where the Confederacy had placed Rotta, the kidnapped son of the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. After the Republic's Torrent Company defeated the monastery's battle droid defense, Ventress dispatched 4-A7 to greet their enemies.

Dropping the caretaker act, he ordered the droids to kill Tano to prevent Rotta's rescue, but she quickly managed to destroy the three combat units.

During that year, Separatist Head of State Count Dooku launched a plan to manipulate the Hutt Clan into joining the Confederacy, which would give the Separatists exclusive access to the Hutts' secret hyperlanes and area of space, and 4-A7 was intended to play a part in the operation. Dooku's personal assassin and apprentice, the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress, kidnapped Rotta, the son of Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and brought him to an abandoned B'omarr Order Monastery that was occupied by the Confederacy on the Wild Space planet of Teth. 4-A7 and a force of battle droids were also stationed at the monastery.

However, their assault had been part of the Confederate plan; with the battle droids having played their role, Ventress, standing next to 4-A7 on a balcony overlooking the battlefront, sent the spy droid to meet with the Republic. Pretending to be the monastery's old caretaker droid, he approached the Republic forces and greeted their Jedi General, Anakin Skywalker, claiming that the Republic had liberated him from the Droid Army and telling them that Rotta was in the monastery's dungeons. After warning the Jedi Knight that the prison level was dangerous, 4-A7 claimed to think Skywalker's Padawan, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, was a servant girl and stated that she should not go down; she responded by activating her lightsaber\u2014which startled 4-A7\u2014and stating she was a Jedi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fortunes change"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "4-A7's role in the Separatist plot was to frame the Jedi Order in the kidnapping of Rotta.

He then stood by Ventress when she spoke with Dooku via hologram, and the recording, which had also been edited by her and 4-A7 into a montage that made it seem like Rotta was being abused, was sent to the count.

However, 4-A7 and several B1 battle droids were also in the process of boarding the ship, which was the G9 Rigger-class light freighter Twilight owned by the crime lord Ziro Desilijic Tiure, with whom Dooku had allied to orchestrate Rotta's kidnapping. The two Jedi arrived just before 4-A7 and the other droids could depart. Tano spotted the protocol droid, claiming she said she had wondered what happened to him, continuing to assume he was a caretaker droid. Although 4-A7 had been surprised to hear her voice again, he initially tried to continue his caretaker act, but Tano discovered the spy's true loyalties when three battle droids walked into view, one of which reported that everything was aboard, meaning they could leave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In an attempt to stop Rotta's rescue, 4-A7 ordered the combat droids to shoot Tano and then tried to flee up the ship's ramp.

Despite 4-A7 demanding that she not destroy him, Tano quickly decapitated the protocol unit. Repeating his last words, 4-A7's head fell down the ship's ramp and landed in front of Skywalker.

While he was loyal to the Separatists, 4-A7's appearance did not directly convey his allegiance, making Tano question if he was an adversary or ally when they first met. Upon learning his true loyalties, she compared the droid's plating to tin as an insult. He was also programmed as a spy and had the RA-7's distinctive insectoid head, which featured a vocabulator containing a sounding box. Therefore, 4-A7 was also able to speak in a number of dialects and languages despite his vocabulator's cheap components. Additionally, possessing large broadband photoreceptors, he was able to see across a very wide band and operate in almost complete darkness. These photoreceptors were among 4-A7's more impressive components.

During his act, 4-A7 showed respect toward Skywalker, calling him mighty and a friend.

His fortunes later turned, however, as Tano found him outside the Twilight before he could flee. He was surprised to hear her voice again and, after calling her \"young one\" and correcting himself, attempted to keep up his caretaker masquerade. After his true loyalty was revealed, Tano accused him of treason, but 4-A7 raised his voice and showcased that he was willing to kill his enemies, as he told the B1 battle droids to open fire. His show of force was short-lived, however, as he then attempted to flee before being confronted by Tano.

This made Director Dave Filoni state that 4-A7 was originally meant to be hiding behind pillars. When executive producer and Star Wars creator George Lucas wanted Ventress and 4-A7 to be on a balcony, the crew needed to design one for the scene. Later, Filoni recalled that 4-A7's death scene had been added in later on, as they had been disappointed that his fate was not revealed. He described the protocol droid as being slightly snarky in the scene, and Producer Catherine Winder revealed that Tano's last line to 4-A7, \"Why, you tin-plated traitor!,\" was what they called an \"Ahsoka-ism.\" These were pushed by Lucas and were when Tano, while in the middle of a serious battle and being earnest, would use what Winder described as \"pretty funny nicknames\" against her enemy. Winder stated that Tano had come up with these nicknames herself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Animation models used for the RA-7 series in various The Clone Wars episodes look very similar to 4-A7's model. In fact, the colorization of a model seen in the Season One episode \"Downfall of a Droid\" and one later seen in the Season Three episode \"Evil Plans\" are also very similar to 4-A7's own. For the Season Five episode \"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much,\" 4-A7's animation model was updated to better match the RA-7 units seen in the first Star Wars film, Episode IV A New Hope, from 1977. This updated model was used for the droid R-A7 in \"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much.\" R-A7's character illustration was done by Chris Glenn and is dated to November 2011 by the episode's concept art gallery on StarWars.com.
