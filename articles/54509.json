He began his career in the Republic's Judicial Forces, where he ascended the ranks and captained the assault ship Leveler during the Clone Wars. Pellaeon developed a strong attachment to the navy as an institution, and when the Republic became the Empire, he continued serving aboard the Star Destroyer Chimaera."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Battle of Endor, the Chimaera fell under Pellaeon's command, and he issued the retreat order. Captain Pellaeon remained one of the fleet's more prominent officers until the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn, who selected the Chimaera as his flagship and made Pellaeon his right-hand man. Pellaeon grew to respect and admire Thrawn throughout the Grand Admiral's campaign against the New Republic, but when Thrawn was assassinated at the Battle of Bilbringi, Pellaeon again was forced to call a retreat. After Thrawn's death and the failed return of Palpatine, the Empire crumbled around Pellaeon. He found himself serving as the second-in-command of the warlord Treuten Teradoc, but when Admiral Natasi Daala shared with him her vision of rebuilding the Empire and ending warlordism, he defected to her and played a key role in forming the Imperial Remnant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon Daala's defeat at Yavin 4, she turned command of the Remnant over to Admiral Pellaeon, making him Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet. He rebuilt the fleet and fought a series of campaigns against the New Republic, but was frequently driven back as the Remnant's resources shriveled. In 19 ABY, he finally accepted that the only way for the Empire to survive was through a peace treaty, and forced the Council of Moffs to accept a truce with the New Republic. When the Imperial capital fell to the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders years later, Pellaeon played on the Imperial fleet's absolute loyalty to him to overcome the old-line Moffs' resistance and join the newly formed Galactic Alliance, leading a series of victories over the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the war's close, Pellaeon retired, but returned to serve as the supreme commander of the Galactic Alliance Defense Force when his predecessor Sien Sovv was killed. In that capacity, Pellaeon led the Galactic Alliance through the Swarm War and the early stages of the Second Galactic Civil War before once more retiring. He returned to service as the head of state of the Imperial Remnant, but died in 41 ABY at Fondor, assassinated by Tahiri Veila when he refused to support Darth Caedus's faction of the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gilad Pellaeon was born in 51 BBY on Corellia, where he stayed long enough to develop memories of his homeworld. However, Pellaeon spent the majority of his formative years on Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Republic. Pellaeon did not care for the ecumenopolis, however, and always enjoyed departing it, having never considered it his home. Pellaeon was eager to become an officer in the armed forces of the Republic, and to that end he sought to enter the prestigious Raithal Academy. Not yet being old enough to enter, Pellaeon persuaded a slicer to alter his records before he submitted his application to the Academy around 36 BBY, when he was fifteen years old. The Academy never discovered Pellaeon's deception, and he was accepted. Pellaeon performed respectably but without distinction at the Academy, sharing his class with Dren Jamer. Pellaeon ultimately graduated with honors in the top third of his class and entered the Judicial Forces as an ensign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon his graduation, Pellaeon served in his first command assignment as an ensign aboard an escort craft for a convoy near Gavryn. When pirates attacked the convoy of transport vessels while it was entering Gavryn's orbit, Pellaeon evaded capture and disrupted the pirate ship's sensors by flying his vessel into the planet's magnetic pole. Pellaeon then attacked and destroyed the pirate craft when it moved to board the other ships in the convoy. Pellaeon earned a rapid series of promotions for his quick thinking in the incident at Gavryn and received commendations for fighting pirates, eventually participating in efforts to combat pirate activity throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As of 27 BBY, Pellaeon was placed high enough to hear rumors of the Outbound Flight Project, but not highly enough to know much about it. Pellaeon had an eye for women, and pursued a series of casual relationships and rendezvouses. Such relationships were considered unsuitable by his superiors, and kept him from promotion into the admiralty. As of 22 BBY, Pellaeon was in a relationship with Hallena Devis, a Republic Intelligence spy with whom Pellaeon was highly enamored. Each kept their relationship secret, and they spent time together whenever they could. Pellaeon kept a private yacht, and sometimes took her sailing on it."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Confederacy of Independent Systems formed and the Clone Wars began, the Judicial Forces were folded into the reformed Republic Navy. Pellaeon, sporting the rank of captain, commanded the Acclamator-class assault ship Leveler. Though he wondered where the clone Grand Army of the Republic had come from, he enjoyed working with its professional men. Pellaeon disliked his aide, Lieutenant Meriones, who Pellaeon judged had only gained his commission due to connections. He was committed to his men, and did not care to draw too many distinctions between himself and them; instead he wished the crew to be united. To that effect, he declined luxuries such as a private chef."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months into the war, Leveler was refitted at Kemla Yard with advanced concussion missiles. To test its prototype systems, Pellaeon took Leveler on a three-day shakedown cruise in the Dantus sector. He was accompanied by clone officer Captain CT-7567, known as \"Rex\" and with whom Pellaeon was friendly. Pellaeon granted Rex permission to bring aboard several new 501st Legion troopers and Ahsoka Tano, Padawan of Rex's commanding officer General Anakin Skywalker, in order to acquaint them with the class. The captain conferred with his chief engineer, Lammin, about the refit, cataloging the new equipment's problems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon's first lieutenant, Rumahn, alerted him when a Separatist fleet entered a nearby sector. In short order, it emerged in the Fath system. As the only Republic force in the area, Pellaeon felt that he needed to investigate, and took the ship in to surveillance range, though it was not yet truly combat-ready. There he was approached by the freighter Wookiee Gunner. Aboard it, Master Djinn Altis, leader of a dissident Jedi sect, informed Pellaeon that he had received a distress transmission from a Republic Intelligence agent on JanFathal. Cautious, the captain had Republic Intelligence confirm the presence of an agent. When they did, Pellaeon agreed to a mission to extract her, using Rex's 501st troops as the only ground forces embarked, and transferring Altis and his students Geith Eris and Callista Masana aboard. It was only after he made the decision that Pellaeon learned that the agent was Hallena Devis. He was immediately worried for her, but also concerned that his personal feelings might get in the way, and so felt obliged to announce his possible conflict of interest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The soldiers, Tano, and Altis's Jedi launched a commando raid to recover Devis which went relatively smoothly, with the exception of the death of clone trooper Vere. As they extracted, General Skywalker arrived in a V-19 Torrent starfighter and covered their escape. Before the shuttle could dock, Leveler was approached by a ship identified as the Discord, a Separatist light cruiser. Active sensors confirmed that it was actually the destroyer Reaper using a false transponder code. Pellaeon, knowing that the faster and more heavily armed ship represented a grave threat, decided he needed a new technique. Thinking that Republic encryption had been broken, Pellaeon ordered comm silence and had Leveler jump out of system, intending to jump back into the Fath system from a new direction and evade Reaper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That plan failed when the Leveler emerged in a different area of space. Benb, the civilian contractor from the yards helping test the systems, diagnosed it as an error in the ship's central chronometer which was causing glitches in several different software programs. As it would take six hours to reboot the system, Pellaeon had his officer prepare manual calculations for a hyperspace jump back to JanFathal. As he waited, he was approached once more by Wookiee Gunner, with Altis's Jedi trainees aboard. Their leader, Ash Jarvee, made contact, reported the break of encryption to naval command, getting new codes issued. They also volunteered to use their Force abilities on the navicomputer, allowing them to safely jump back to JanFathal. They did so, and there found Skywalker and the extraction team attempting to escape once more after having turned back to JanFathal when Leveler disappeared. They arranged to dock their stolen CR-20 transport aboard Leveler as they were pursued by two Separatist ships. Pellaeon led his ship head-on against the two Separatist destroyers, eliminating the first one just in time to avoid ramming it, but took enough damage to prevent a quick jump to hyperspace. On her return to the ship, Masana used her Force abilities to enter the malfunctioning targeting computer for the concussion missiles and repair the problem. She launched the full complement of missiles, destroying much of the Separatist fleet and forcing the rest to retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon eagerly visited Devis, but she was distraught from the death of trooper Ince in the medbay, feeling guilty over the deaths of two troopers in the rescue attempt. Pellaeon spoke with her again later, and found her disillusioned with the Republic due to the oppressive nature of the JanFathal regime she had been tasked to support, and the likability of the revolutionaries who had aligned with the Separatists. She confided in him that she planned to leave Republic Intelligence in secret and put her life in order. She would let him know how to find her. Pellaeon was heartbroken at the loss of the woman he loved, but accepted that he could not change how she felt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Approximately sixteen months into the Clone Wars, Pellaeon commanded a small fleet providing orbital support for Jedi General Ronhar Kim's invasion of Merson. The assault was a trap, however, devised by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to remove the troublesome Kim. Intelligence estimates vastly underrated the enemy presence, and Pellaeon had all he could do to preserve his ship, keeping him from rendering any aid to Kim and his troops pinned on the ground. In fact, Pellaeon judged the situation a complete loss and ordered a withdrawal, deciding it better to save his ships from destruction than to attempt to save the troops and die in the process. Kim's Padawan, Tap-Nar-Pal, indignantly ordered Pellaeon to hold his position, but did not have the authority to give orders to Pellaeon, and the naval officer made sure he knew it. Kim agreed with Pellaeon's assessment, approved the withdrawal, and ordered Tap-Nar-Pal, who was piloting a starfighter, to leave with Pellaeon. The Padawan refused and died in battle; Pellaeon withdrew and lived to fight another day. In that same month, Pellaeon, now under Jedi General Mas Missur, was assigned to take the Leveler to Gaftikar to support a rebellion by the Marit population which would secure the world's mineral wealth for the Republic. Pellaeon's small task force engaged Separatist ships over the world before deploying its forces to support the Marits, sustaining minimal casualties."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the course of the war, Pellaeon developed a respect for the clone troopers and regarded them as fully Human, unlike many other fleet personnel. Pellaeon later recalled fighting unstable clones as part of the fleet; he may well have spent the last months of the war serving in the siege of Saleucami, in which a clone Morgukai army was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Under the Empire"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Early Imperial service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars came to an end and the Galactic Senate declared Palpatine Emperor and reformed the Republic as the Galactic Empire, Pellaeon continued serving in the new Imperial Navy. In short order, the Imperator-class Star Destroyer was introduced and Pellaeon was assigned to one, the Chimaera, as soon as it was built. He served as part of the command crew and was quickly made executive officer aboard the ship. During the years after the Empire's formation, the Chimaera sometimes undertook slaving raids to Kashyyyk on which Pellaeon served. During those years, Pellaeon had the opportunity to serve under such various and illustrious personages as Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, Darth Vader, Admiral Firmus Piett, and Emperor Palpatine himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon had had a relatively promising career under the Republic, with promotions after the Gavryn incident and command of a small task force in the Clone Wars. In the New Order, however, his career seemingly stalled. Pellaeon spent some twenty years aboard the Chimaera as second-in-command without advancing in the fleet. Pellaeon's career was hardly floundering, as Bail Prestor Organa was able to point Pellaeon out to his daughter as a promising officer when Pellaeon attended the Grand Alderaanian Gathering in 9 BBY, but Pellaeon simply never moved from his position aboard the Chimaera. Pellaeon would later look on these years under Palpatine's Empire without fondness, though there was little evidence of overt discontent; certainly not enough for Pellaeon to have defected. Pellaeon was above all loyal to the Fleet as an institution; his main quarrels with the government were in the form of Palpatine's right hand, Darth Vader, whose easy spending of the officers under his command generated some significant measure of resentment within Pellaeon and many other Fleet officers; many officers also did not care for Palpatine's Death Stars, regarding them as bloated, inefficient expenditures that threatened the Fleet's position. However, Pellaeon's loyalty to the Empire overall did not waver. Pellaeon was sufficiently dedicated to the Imperial Navy to live life as a bachelor, considering the Navy his family. Around this period, Pellaeon reconnected with Hallena Devis, resulting in the birth of Mynar Devis. He also may have fathered Vitor Reige with another woman, though Pellaeon never confirmed Reige's ancestry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon's dedication to the Fleet was most evident in his expectations of his subordinates. He demanded that their conduct, discipline, and efficiency be worthy of the honor and prestige of an officer's commission in the Imperial Navy. He would not tolerate sloppiness, inefficiency, or casual demeanor from the Chimaera's crew but instead instilled his own sense of professionalism and pride in the Fleet within them."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Poln and Corellia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 ABY, still serving as second in command of the Chimaera under Captain Calo Drusan, Pellaeon was involved in Senior Captain Thrawn's plan to topple Nuso Esva, a warlord of the Unknown Regions. Thrawn believed Esva could pose a threat to the greater galaxy if he expanded his influence beyond the Unknown Regions, which is exactly what Esva planned to do at Poln Major, capital of the Candoras sector. Esva ordered the kidnapping of the wife and daughter of sector governor Bidor Ferrouz to manipulate him into providing aid to the Rebel Alliance, in order to draw the attention of the Emperor, who would then send an agent to execute Ferrouz. Esva also enlisted Rebel ambassador Vestin Axlon by playing on his desire for vengeance for the loss of his homeworld of Alderaan. Using Axlon to ensure Luke Skywalker would take the blame for the death of Ferrouz would make the Rebel presence serve as irresistible bait for the Imperial forces, and later, a distraction from the thrust of his plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Esva's greater goal, however, was to destroy or at least discredit Thrawn. In order to do this, he disguised himself as \"Lord Odo\" and came aboard the Chimaera with his assistant, Sorro. Though Pellaeon did not know at the time that it had been staged, he admired Odo's tactical ability in disposing of the raiders pursuing his Kazellis-class light freighter, Salaban's Hope at their rendezvous. On his own initiative, Pellaeon backtracked the order to ferry Lord Odo to a location in the Outer Rim where Grand Admiral Demetrius Zaarin was traveling aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Predominant. Conversely, after Odo's arrival, Pellaeon reacted with mild shock when Captain Drusan went beyond his orders in an unsuccessful attempt to determine Odo's species through a pheromone analysis of the life support systems in Odo's quarters, but he eventually came around to share Drusan's curiosity about Odo's identity. Drusan and Pellaeon had the crew of the Chimaera keep tabs on Odo and Sorro, monitoring their movements and even their eating habits, and searching all the files they could access for references to Odo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chimaera ferried Odo to several locations before heading to the Poln system. During the trip there, Pellaeon tried to engage Sorro in conversation but again failed to glean any useful information about him or Odo. He then assisted Odo in moving equipment, which he considered to be work fit for lesser officers but participated in so he could ply Odo for information. He learned little but was interested by Odo referencing the Song of Salaban, an Arkanian legend, in explaining how Sorro had lost everything he valued. This reference, combined with Odo's secretive nature, led Pellaeon to consider the possibility that Odo might be an Arkanian criminal. When he revealed this to Drusan, the captain claimed he had received a communique from Palpatine himself confirming that Odo was Arkanian and his orders did come from the Predominant, and Drusan commended Pellaeon for his persistence. Drusan further confided that Odo was sent to investigate Nuso Esva's incursion into the Candoras Sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The visit to the Poln system lasted only long enough to bolster the Empire's belief that the Rebels had subverted Governor Ferrouz, after which the Chimaera headed to the Unknown Regions. Captain Drusan believed the Chimaera was simply going to meet with Senior Captain Thrawn and the Admonitor to assault one of Nuso Esva's attack squadrons. During the hyperspace jump, Sorro conducted a sort of impromptu opera of mouse droids in the Chimaera's main engine control room. Lord Odo claimed that this was an effort to confuse any of Nuso Esva's Troukree soldiers who might be hidden aboard the Star Destroyer while he searched for their biomarkers with an Arakyd Mark Two seeker. Pellaeon allowed this to continue, but was sure to advise his subordinates in engineering to keep a close eye on their guests and to thoroughly examine the mouse droids when the \"performance\" was finished."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Unknown Regions, Chimaera dropped out of hyperspace at Teptixii directly into a battle where Admonitor and an Imperial task force were engaging some of Esva's ships, including eight Firekilns, and five Firekilns together could match the firepower of an Imperial-class Star Destroyer. Lord Odo advised Drusan to enter the engagement, and Esva's forces retreated, after which Lord Odo tried to persuade the Admonitor's Captain Voss Parck to join the Chimaera at Poln. Parck's counterargument was cut short by an emergency signal advising all nearby Imperial forces of the assassination of Governor Ferrouz, which required the Admonitor's task force to join the Chimaera. Esva's/\"Odo's\" plan was coming to a head. Lord Odo inquired as to the whereabouts of his target, Thrawn, and Parck advised him that Thrawn would likely join them at Poln. Unbeknownst to Esva, Thrawn was observing this meeting as part of his own parallel plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chimaera, Admonitor, and the task force arrived together at Poln, and Pellaeon was relieved they had survived the potential dangers of hyperspace travel in the Unknown Regions. Pellaeon realized that he admired the courage of Thrawn and the officers under his command who faced unknown peril with every jump in the largely uncharted Unknown Regions. During the jump, Thrawn was shadowing the Chimaera in a Mon Calamari DeepWater-class light freighter, but Odo had advised Captain Drusan that the freighter was likely one of Nuso Esva's agents, possibly Esva himself. After the jump, Lord Odo was nowhere to be found and failed to answer his comlink. Drusan assigned Pellaeon to find him as the commander had spent more time with Lord Odo than most aboard, and Pellaeon resolved to make Odo answer for leaving his captain hanging."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Pellaeon was searching the ship, Chimaera came under attack from within. Explosions went off in the engine control centers, the ship was flooded with vertigon gas, and the turbolifts were locked down\u2014except, mysteriously, for the one Pellaeon used to return to the bridge. Pellaeon came under blaster fire, making it clear to him that the ship had been sabotaged. Pellaeon encountered Captain Drusan, who had been mortally wounded by a blaster shot. Drusan confessed to Pellaeon that he knew \"Lord Odo's\" credentials were fake, but Odo had promised a crushing victory over the Rebellion. Drusan then died, another victim of Esva's manipulation. Pellaeon keyed his comlink to the emergency channel and was greeted by Senior Captain Thrawn, who revealed that Lord Odo was actually Nuso Esva."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn ordered Pellaeon to keep Esva from leaving the Chimaera, but Pellaeon had no time to locate a weapon. Under Thrawn's instruction, Pellaeon was able to sneak up on the figure he believed to be Esva and inject him with an empty hypospray, causing an air embolism. Upon unmasking his target, however, he discovered it was actually Sorro. As he lay dying, Sorro asked if he had redeemed his family, and Pellaeon suddenly understood the man's plight. Esva had taken control of Sorro much like Ferrouz, and forced him to participate in Esva's deadly scheme. Pellaeon mercifully told Sorro that his family would be freed, and he died smiling. As Pellaeon reported this latest deception to Thrawn, Esva cut into the communication channel to mock the Imperials. Esva revealed to Thrawn and Pellaeon that the earlier \"opera\" of mouse droids was meant to distract the crew while a group of Mark Two seekers followed him to his target areas of the ship. The Chimaera was locked on a collision course with the Golan I station defending Poln Major. No other Imperial forces would be available to prevent the collision\u2014as Esva had planned, they all went to Poln Minor to attack the Rebels, and Esva then jumped his forces in to pin them there. Thrawn, as the ranking officer, would have to decide whether the Chimaera destroyed the Golan platform, or vice versa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard the Lost Reef, the small freighter aboard which he had shadowed the Chimaera, Senior Captain Thrawn implemented a plan to thwart the latest part of Nuso Esva's scheme. Thrawn instructed Pellaeon to use the Star Destroyer's tractor beam to lock on to the Lost Reef to provide a sufficient gravitational nudge to pull the Chimaera away from its locked course. Pellaeon enlisted the only tractor beam operator available, a young but level-headed crewman named Mithel, and the maneuver worked. Mithel boldly told Pellaeon that the Chimaera would be fine, and Pellaeon admired the junior crewman's courage. The Chimaera then detected Esva's hidden starfighter forces rising from Poln Minor and set about releasing the Star Destroyer's locked weaponry to manual control to intercept them, but it turned out not to be necessary. Han Solo, on behalf of the Alliance forces, had infiltrated the Golan platform and knew where the fighters were based. With his falsified authority, he ordered the platform to attack the fighter base, and dealt another blow to Esva's plan. Esva was forced to bring in more of his own ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In fact, Esva brought in so many ships that it seemed the Empire was hopelessly outnumbered in the Poln system. But Pellaeon noticed that the open communication channel between Senior Captain Thrawn and Warlord Nuso Esva was being relayed and boosted into the Unknown Regions. This, finally, was the heart of Thrawn's plan. Thrawn taunted Esva into revealing his intentions to dominate, rather than ally, with several species of the Unknown Regions. Esva's plan to discredit Thrawn had been neatly reversed, and Esva was instead discredited before his potential allies. Once this was done, Thrawn sent a coded signal that Pellaeon did not recognize\u2014a coded signal to the Lord Darth Vader to bring in Death Squadron. Thrawn had enlisted Vader's aid by promising him the Rebel leadership, turning another part of Esva's plan against him. Upon the Dark Lord's arrival, Thrawn handed him command of the Admonitor and Pellaeon did likewise for the Chimaera. By the end of the battle, Esva's Eastern Fleet was shattered. A third of his military power was lost, and the truth behind his diplomatic lies was revealed to his allies in the Unknown Regions. Governor Ferrouz's family was freed, and Ferrouz was spared the fate of a traitor. Thrawn did not directly hand the Rebel command to Darth Vader, but through a listing of supplies provided to them by Esva's agents, he gave Vader the knowledge that they would be based on a cold, inhospitable world. Years later, Thrawn would remember the assistance of one Commander Gilad Pellaeon. Some time after the Poln incident, Pellaeon was assigned full command of the Chimaera, and under his command it became a model of Imperial efficiency."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY, the Chimaera had a stopover at Corellia for unknown reasons. He spent time on the ground in Coronet City, where he had a local agent recommended by Sergeant Hume Tarl carry out some minor tasks for him. Pellaeon entrusted the agent with a datadisc containing orders from Vader, which the agent delivered to Lieutenant Errad Brytok, a junior officer aboard the Chimaera. Pellaeon also made use of the agent to arrest Helfin Hundi, an information broker selling Imperial secrets, and to assassinate the leader of an industrial espionage ring before recommending a future in Imperial Intelligence to the agent. During that time, Admiral Ozzel had Pellaeon look into a requisition from Captain Lorth Needa for replacement probe droids.

The Rebel fleet began making significant inroads, and even the return of Grand Admiral Osvald Teshik could not hold back the Rebels. With the battle desperate and chaotic, Pellaeon decided that the situation was untenable. In the chaos, the rest of the fleet may not even have known that Pellaeon's commander was killed; with the Chimaera as the designated command ship, Pellaeon was the one to relay the order to retreat to Annaj, the nearest sector capital, a two-day journey that left Pellaeon agonizing over whether he'd made the right decision.

Prittick dithered for so long over what decision to make that Harrsk chose to break with the fleet, taking a significant portion of Death Squadron's ships into the Deep Core until a clear chain of command could be established (he later set himself up as the warlord of Zero Command).

Pellaeon was popular among the fleet and had an excellent reputation, but Isard refused to promote him to admiral for unknown reasons. Nonetheless, Pellaeon remained an important part of the Imperial fleet and played a leadership role, especially after Isard lost Coruscant and fled to Thyferra. Pellaeon did not see himself as a contender for leadership, but merely as a steward and caretaker of the Imperial Fleet and cooperated with other high-ranking officers to preserve it as best they could. He shepherded the remaining Imperial forces as their territory continued to shrink, hating the number of retreats he was forced to order.

It had not seen use since his death, but now a message from the Unknown Regions was incoming, complete with the proper command codes. Nervous and expecting to see the Emperor risen from death, Pellaeon knelt to receive the message and instead found the image of an alien who identified himself as Grand Admiral Thrawn. The Grand Admirals had all been thought wiped out, but here was one, claiming to have returned from the Unknown Regions. The transmission included a set of coordinates at which Pellaeon should meet Thrawn.

Adding greatly to Pellaeon's prestige, Thrawn chose the Chimaera for his flagship, making Pellaeon his effective second-in-command. Pellaeon coordinated and oversaw all Thrawn's operations, save only his most personal and tightly held ones; even so, Thrawn never shared more information than was absolutely necessary. After the initial rush of enthusiasm, Pellaeon had a hard time getting used to the idea of an alien officer; whether because of speciesism or the simple novelty of such a thing under the Empire is unclear. Pellaeon was also unused to Thrawn's command methods; he had never before had a superior so willing to accept criticism and eager to hear different ideas from his own. Pellaeon initially could clash with Thrawn, as when the two had a lengthy and heated argument over Thrawn's use of difficult-to-coordinate and highly unconventional hyperspace microjumps as part of a battle plan. As Pellaeon gained more experience with Thrawn, however, he developed a strong respect for him and a firm belief in his tactical genius, appreciating the direction Thrawn was taking the military and revitalizing his confidence in the possibility of victory.

In short order, the Chimaera was known as among the most efficient starships in the Imperial Fleet.

When a mystery freighter attempting to make a landing\u2014actually the Millennium Falcon\u2014acted suspiciously upon seeing the Chimaera, Thrawn had his fighters divert to intercept it. Thrawn's strategies very nearly captured the freighter, but Han Solo and Chewbacca were simply too experienced and daring to be taken in, and the freighter escaped Imperial pursuit. Pellaeon's subordinate, Commander Quenton, went to the surface to retrieve the painting, but a chase across the planet ensued, with the Solos going after the painting as well.

He undertook his first major strike, an information raid on Obroa-skai. The actual raid was performed by scout ships which returned to Chimaera, and Pellaeon went to Thrawn's private chamber to inform him in person. It was only then that he discovered what precisely Thrawn had converted the former entertainment suite to and what he did in there: the chamber was full of art, including holographic representations of famous pieces. Thrawn studied it to gain psychological insight into his enemies. Thrawn barely had time to engage Pellaeon on the topic of art before an alert was sounded: a New Republic task force had followed the scout ships back to the Chimaera. Pellaeon heard the report of four Assault Frigates arrayed against them and, deciding the odds were against the Star Destroyer and its inexperienced crew, ordered a jump to hyperspace, which Thrawn belayed. Pellaeon watched in confusion as Thrawn deployed sentry ships, watched the response, withdrew them, and then ordered the Chimaera into a vulnerable position and deployed the TIEs in a Marg Sabl closure maneuver. The simple tactic allowed the Chimaera to utterly defeat the opposing force; Thrawn had found through the fleet's first response that it was commanded by Elomin and then exploited their psychological weaknesses by using a disorganized attack pattern.

When Chimaera arrived over Myrkr, Pellaeon sent down two shuttles to collect ysalamiri, unusual creatures capable of repelling the Force. He was, however, contacted by smuggler chieftain Talon Karrde, who had a base in the forest.

In the city, they met only an old man, who promised to take them to the Guardian. He led them to a mausoleum, explained that the Guardian was dead, and attempted to kill them with Force lightning. The ysalamiri dissipated the attack, saving Pellaeon's life. Thrawn played to the man's vanity and was able to recruit him for his own purposes. Joruus C'baoth, the insane clone of Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth and Guardian of Mount Tantiss, was now one more factor in Thrawn's plan to defeat the New Republic.

When they returned to the Chimaera, Pellaeon went to speak with Thrawn, and warned him that he considered C'baoth unstable and dangerous to deal with.

Thrawn would soon have a clone army. Pellaeon received orders to prepare for the upcoming strike at the Sluis Van shipyards, but Thrawn was keeping all operational information extremely close to himself, and not even Pellaeon was allowed to see the whole picture. When C'baoth, present at the meeting, clashed with Thrawn over the promise to deliver the Jedi, Pellaeon was the one who proposed a compromise. Rather than C'baoth's demand that the Sluis Van operation not be undertaken until he could go and draw Skywalker to himself, he suggested that Imperial Intelligence find a world where C'baoth could conceivably have remained hidden throughout the Great Jedi Purge and begin seeding rumors of C'baoth's survival and reemergence.

Becoming unnerved by the superb performance of the task force, Pellaeon called up previous statistics and compared them to the Chimaera's present performance. The crew was currently achieving a forty percent increase over its previous performance. Pellaeon could no longer deny the theory he had been so unwilling to believe.

Thrawn ordered Pellaeon to arrange C'baoth's transport to Jomark\u2014and to then be ready to backtrack and ambush Skywalker along the route to Jomark. Pellaeon pointed out to Thrawn that killing Skywalker, as Thrawn was considering, could backfire and cause C'baoth to end his cooperation and leave for Wayland, where he could wreak havoc on the cloning operation. Thrawn agreed with Pellaeon's assessment and modified his plans as a result. The ambush itself failed, however, when Skywalker reverse-triggered his acceleration compensator in a risky maneuver that caused the tractor beams to lose lock. To add insult to injury, they instead attached to a pair of proton torpedoes Skywalker had launched and drew them in, destroying the projector.

Thrawn knew that Skywalker's hyperdrive would soon fail as a result of the maneuver, however, and had Pellaeon contact the local smugglers, including Karrde, and offer them a reward to pick Skywalker up while the Fleet was busy elsewhere. In addition, Thrawn's Mount Tantiss clones would require ships on which to serve.

At that instant, Pellaeon led Thrawn's task force into the system. As Pellaeon engaged the outer defenses, which put up stiff resistance, the mole miners burned their way into the bridges of the cargo-ferrying warships and deployed troopers to capture them. The plan went off without a flaw until Wedge Antilles, Skywalker, Solo, and Lando Calrissian observed a mole miner in action and were able to puzzle out Thrawn's plan. Calrissian had owned the facility the mole miners were stolen from, and used his override codes to start the mole miners' drilling equipment up once more, burning through the bridge's control systems and preventing Thrawn from taking control of the craft.

The display was broken up when Lieutenant Tschel handed Pellaeon a report on an unusual occurrence: a Noghri commando's ship had nearly been late in returning the recognition signal. Upon examination, further irregularities were uncovered. Thrawn noticed the minor commotion and, upon receiving the report, decided to pay a visit to the commando, Khabarakh, in his hometown.

Pellaeon went to Thrawn's suite to inform C'baoth that the assault was about to begin; C'baoth used the opportunity of finding Pellaeon outside the ysalamiri bubble to mind trick him into ordering the secret creation of a special clone at Mount Tantiss, and then to forget such a thing had even taken place. Pellaeon could hardly believe it as he said things he did not at all believe, but C'baoth's mind-twisting influence was too great for him to resist. Pellaeon stood by C'baoth as the Dark Jedi coordinated the strike. The Chimaera fired upon Ukio's planetary shield; cloaked dreadnaughts had been guided beneath the shield by freighters, and now they fired in sync with the Chimaera, controlled and coordinated by C'baoth, and the beams appeared to pass through the shields.

Skywalker was the one following the leads, and the Chimaera nearly captured him over Poderis, but he escaped their tractor beams with a covert shroud gambit. It immediately sprang to Pellaeon's mind that the last time Skywalker had done so, the tractor beam operator had died. Thrawn spoke with the operator, Ensign Rejlii Mithel, and discovered that he had made an inventive, if ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to counteract the covert shroud gambit.

That left the Chimaera free to perform its real purpose in the strike. The Star Destroyers deployed twenty-two cloaked asteroids and performed dry firings simulating the launch of nearly three hundred asteroids overall, then withdrew.

Daala sought Pellaeon's advice in formulating their attack plan; she recognized that she had done poorly in the minor campaign she had waged upon departing the Maw, and wanted Pellaeon's experience and honest opinions. Daala was looking for a target which would provide a significant and morale-boosting victory, yet be unlikely to seriously damage their forces. Pellaeon suggested the same world Daala had in mind: Yavin 4, the site of the Jedi Praxeum.

Pellaeon ordered his ships to proceed toward Yavin 4 on sublight power. Meanwhile, Knight Hammer reached the battle, supplemented by some of Cronus's Victories. Cronus himself was killed and the 13X destroyed by New Republic reinforcements, and Pellaeon only reestablished communications with Daala shortly before the Knight Hammer was fatally crippled. The battle was lost, and Pellaeon, sickened by the utter defeat of what had seemed to be a spectacular campaign, waited at the edge of the system, recovering what escape pods came his way. The last one was a command pod, and he found Daala inside. Upon climbing out, she immediately resigned and turned command over to him.

With his fleet bolstered and a new, more vital power base, Pellaeon took the offensive, building a strong Imperial state in the Mid and Outer Rim, plus isolated territories across the galaxy. The Moffs of the Imperial sectors formed the Council of Moffs, a deliberative body which retained most decision-making authority in the new government. Thanks to the support of Baron Ragez D'Asta, the Moffs unanimously recognized Pellaeon as the Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet. Pellaeon retained command of the military and was party to the Moffs' decision-making process. He was technically subordinate to them, but his legal control over the military and personal popularity among the military and citizens gave him significant leverage over the Council of Moffs.

Pellaeon was far from enthusiastic about the prospect, but he considered it the best of many bad options. After more than an hour of debate, the Council of Moffs ultimately agreed that a peace was in their best interests, before the New Republic turned its attention to eliminating the last few Imperial sectors. Pellaeon planned to send an envoy to General Garm Bel Iblis to discuss peace; Pellaeon respected Bel Iblis, an old military man and well-known tactician, and preferred to surrender to him over any other official.

Pellaeon's turbolasers rapidly fired low-power shots, busying the dovin basal singularity generators which shielded the Yuuzhan Vong ships, and then released full-power shots when they saw an opening. Shai had anticipated the strategy, however, and was able to counter it by using less-powerful singularities to catch the splinter shots. Kre'fey came up with the idea of boosting the power of the splinter shots to throw the Vong off-balance and conveyed it to Pellaeon. The strategy worked, damaging Shai's fleet and forcing it to withdraw. Meanwhile, on the surface, Shai received Horn's offer of a duel and agreed to a one-week truce before the combat. Horn won the duel, but Shai's lieutenant, Deign Lian, did not honor the truce, instead launching a deadly plague into Ithor's atmosphere, utterly destroying all life on the planet. When Lian moved to withdraw his fleet, stationed on the other side of the planet, Pellaeon put into motion a strategy he and Kre'fey had devised. An Interdictor jumped into the system, forcing Lian to devote more of his dovin basals' energy to pulling away from Ithor.

While they were not positioned to unseat him, they were sure to push for involvement in the war. When Quille began to bring up the issue, Pellaeon revealed that he knew of the offer and advised against becoming entangled in the war. After the meeting, Pellaeon received the news from his vast array of informal contacts that Solo had used the Force to choke a lieutenant to death on the bridge of his ship, leaving him yet more concerned about Solo's mental state."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo sent an envoy to Pellaeon to make the offer formally and persuade him to accept. Pellaeon granted an audience to the young woman, Tahiri Veila\u2014the Jedi who had fought under him at the Battle of Esfandia. Pellaeon, having lost faith in the Galactic Alliance's ability to bring about peace, decided that the Remnant would be best served by allying with Solo and coming out on the winning side, the better to influence the galaxy and bring peace after the war's close. He put the proposal to the Moffs, who eagerly agreed. Pellaeon, however, still did not trust Solo, and so used the signal that he knew would summon Daala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Daala arrived while Pellaeon was inspecting his new flagship, the Bloodfin, a member of the new smaller, more maneuverable Turbulent-class of Star Destroyer. Pellaeon, who had a fondness for smaller ships, was very impressed by the modern design. He spoke with Niathal by comm, each expressing the concern that Solo was unscrupulous and had not thought through the Fondor attack properly. After that, he welcomed Daala, caught up on her life since he had last seen her, and gave her a tour of the ship. She had a small irregular fleet which Pellaeon had her position near Fondor to act as support in case something should go wrong during the battle. Pellaeon presented her publicly as a reactivated adviser, making no allusion to her fleet, which he wanted as a secret backup."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon departed for Fondor shortly, with several of the Moffs, who hoped to acquire Fondor itself, present aboard Bloodfin. He kept a comm line secretly open to Daala at all times. He, Niathal, and Solo held a conference aboard Bloodfin. Realizing that they lacked the force to occupy Fondor, Pellaeon and Niathal suggested they offer Fondor favorable economic terms to rejoin the Galactic Alliance, to which Solo agreed; they were offered a period to surrender, which they did not, and then the Galactic Alliance occupied the orbital shipyards, softening up the planet. Solo left Veila aboard the ship supposedly as his liaison, though Pellaeon realized she was to be his spy and agent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon held the Remnant forces back, screening against the possible reappearance of Fondor's fleet, which they believed to be outside the system waiting to strike. Solo, meanwhile, led a portion of the Fourth Fleet against the orbital yards. However, it soon became clear that the fleet had been hidden within the shipyards, and it departed, trapping Solo's forces between itself and the planet's defenses while half of the Fondorian fleet engaged Niathal's portion of the Third, requiring Pellaeon's intervention to keep them from being overwhelmed. Solo was able to use the Force to convince the Fondorians to open their shields, allowing him to bombard their shield generators and Oridin, the capital city. Niathal again offered the Fondorian president, Shas Vadde, the chance to surrender, which he accepted. Solo, however, insisted on pressing the battle and making an example of Fondor. Niathal relieved him of command and insisted he stand down. Pellaeon insisted that the Imperial ships respect the cease-fire and take advantage of the lull in the fighting to salvage ships and provide medical aid, forcing Quille to back down in his contention that the Remnant should take advantage of the confusion to conquer Fondor. When Solo resumed fire, Pellaeon supported Niathal in her decision to attack him and protect the Fondorians, ordering his ships to attack any vessel firing on a Fondorian ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon retired to his day cabin to speak with Daala, but was followed in by Veila. She begged him to aid Solo, but he refused. She drew a blaster on him, but still he protested that he would not support Solo's tactics. Pellaeon realized she would shoot him if he did not give in, but refused to bow to pressure; instead, he realized he had the opportunity to choose how he would die. He ordered the fleet to engage Solo over the comlink, forcing Veila to shoot him. Quille heard the noise and stopped by the door. As Pellaeon lay dying, he saw Quille and his Moffs allowing him to die and planning to take power. He spoke Quille's name into the comlink he kept open to Daala and drummed the Darakaer signal before he died."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Moffs, however, were able to convince the rest of the fleet to join Solo, though they were trapped on the bridge when the Bloodfin's crew, led by Reige, mutinied. Daala brought her forces into the system, attacking Solo and forcing him to withdraw while Mandalorian commandos, hired by Daala and under the command of Boba Fett, boarded the Bloodfin. They killed the Moffs aboard, took control of the ship, and recovered Pellaeon's body, which Daala took back to Corellia for burial with Reige's approval. Though Solo still had command of the Galactic Alliance and the Imperial Remnant remained loyal to him, Niathal formed a government-in-exile at Fondor. In short order, the Jedi defeated Solo, making peace and forcing the Moffs to replace Pellaeon with Jagged Fel. Pellaeon's recall of Daala allowed her to gain the stature necessary to become the next Galactic Alliance Chief of State. Pellaeon remained popular in both the Galactic Alliance and the Empire, remembered fondly as a strong and principled leader. In 43 ABY, Tahiri Veila was arrested by the Galactic Alliance and tried for murdering Pellaeon. The jury was appalled after seeing a recording of Pellaeon's death, leading to Veila's conviction and death sentence, though she was able to escape from prison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon stayed a popular significant figure within the Empire, and his successor Fel maintained a strong admiration for the old admiral. Fel's flagship Star Destroyer was named the Gilad Pellaeon in honor of his predecessor. The Imperial Remnant eventually reformed itself as the New Galactic Empire, placing Fel on the Imperial throne. Pellaeon continued to be remembered fondly in the new regime, and the powerful new Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer, the new Empire's replacement for the Imperial-class, was named for him. Pellaeon's love of gardening was also preserved in the Pellaeon Gardens, where Emperor Roan Fel would later meditate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gilad Pellaeon was a military man at heart, dedicated to the fleet as an institution. He spent nearly his entire adulthood in naval service, from entering the academy at age fifteen to his death at ninety-two years old, minus only six or fewer years in retirement. Pellaeon regarded the fleet as the closest thing he had to family, his son Mynar Devis being unacknowledged. He spent far more time in space than he did on the ground, and considered no world home, and ultimately no ship as his home either\u2014though Chimaera came closest. He dedicated his life to the military, internalizing its values of discipline, order, efficiency, and obedience to authority, and respected the military as a prestigious and honorable institution. Pellaeon was a meticulous and efficient commander and expected the very best of his subordinates, and his ships were exceptionally efficient. Despite his discipline, however, he had a fondness for the female sex which resulted in his being something of a womanizer, though he never settled down with any one woman. This caused some friction with the promotions board as a young man, but Pellaeon felt no need to conform to their standards. He was perfectly happy as a captain commanding a warship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon's primary loyalty being to the fleet, he had little difficulty in making the switch to serving the Galactic Empire. Pellaeon believed strongly in the ability of the Empire, and especially its military, to bring order and stability where the Rebel Alliance and New Republic could not. He willingly fought against the New Republic until he was convinced that the Empire could only survive through peace. Over time, as Pellaeon adjusted to the new situation, he came to see the New Republic as a government with which the Imperial Remnant should not only be at peace, but allied. With it as the galactic government, Pellaeon felt it necessary to aid the New Republic against the Yuuzhan Vong. Pellaeon began to despair of the New Republic's ability to bring stability as it crumbled in the face of the invasion, but when the Galactic Alliance emerged, Pellaeon firmly saw it as the best hope for stability in the galaxy and gave it his full support. This faith crumbled by the time Jacen Solo took control of the Galactic Alliance, with Pellaeon considering it a disordered, power-hungry mess. He despised Solo, who had no military experience and seemed to wish to rule as a despot; it was this opposition which finally caused his death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon's Imperial Remnant was much reformed, compared to Palpatine's Empire. Slavery was outlawed, and anti-alien sentiment was discouraged; the Remnant became a state the New Republic had few troubles dealing with, and a respected member of the Galactic Alliance; its ethical reforms were credited largely to Pellaeon. Pellaeon also did not care for unaccountable secret police and extreme repression, resigning when the Galactic Alliance created its own secret police unit. Throughout the course of his career, however, Pellaeon had served an Empire many found reprehensible, and participated in the taking of Wookiee slaves. He could have defected but did not, instead choosing to continue to serve such a government. Also, while aliens who worked alongside him, such as Kre'fey, sincerely felt that Pellaeon was not anti-alien, many of the highest members of Pellaeon's government were, and Pellaeon was willing to turn a blind eye to such sentiments, facing the political reality that they were widespread among Imperial officers. Pellaeon did not enjoy the idea of an empire, and desired no emperor, but accepted that the orderly nature of the Remnant was the best way to bring peace to the galaxy. While Pellaeon was admired by many in the New Republic and Galactic Alliance for his \"progressive\" stances, others felt that, by knowingly and loyally serving the Empire at its worst, Pellaeon could not redeem himself, especially among some of the older moffs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon himself demonstrated a strong respect for his counterparts on the other side, especially as the Galactic Civil War ended. Committed and dutiful military men such as Garm Bel Iblis, Wedge Antilles, Traest Kre'fey, and Gavin Darklighter earned Pellaeon's respect even before he joined their side. Pellaeon also demonstrated a strong respect for the Jedi, Luke Skywalker in particular. Pellaeon had served alongside Jedi during the Clone Wars, perhaps giving him some measure of respect for the Jedi Order. Any support had been tempered by the Galactic Civil War, as Pellaeon had little compunction with Thrawn's actions against Skywalker and other Jedi. After the peace, however, even before Luke Skywalker helped save his life over Bastion, Pellaeon showed an uncommon regard for Skywalker, both as a religious figure and a former general. Once Pellaeon joined the Galactic Alliance, he openly supported the Jedi and counted Skywalker as a friend, even when Omas was feeling resentful of the Order. He made it clear that he trusted Skywalker's judgment more than almost anyone else's. Pellaeon also built a strong working relationship with Leia Organa Solo, who was consistently the New Republic's choice to conduct negotiations with him. Pellaeon also came to respect her husband, even if he could not quite bring himself to endorse Han Solo's rather undisciplined methods, the two had very clashing personalities. Pellaeon had a history of unusual regard for the clone troopers as well; he regarded them as fully Human and no less worthy of life than \"regular\" troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a young man, Pellaeon had loved war games, delighting in the exercise of strategy and the testing of new techniques. Over the years, however, Pellaeon lost that excitement as the grueling realities of war ground him down. Pellaeon was still able to take some delight in the devising of tactics and their implementation, in testing himself against an enemy, but it was not an aspect of his personality which he was particularly proud of, and consideration of the potential human cost of battle easily cooled his excitement. Pellaeon wanted nothing more than for war to end and to be able to turn all leadership over to builders like Ephin Sarreti. Pellaeon had seen four galactic conflicts over the years, and had no desire to see any more. As he grew older, he desired simply to leave the galaxy a more orderly place when he died, lacking grand ambitions of empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gilad Pellaeon was created for the Thrawn Trilogy by author Timothy Zahn, who named him after Pelleas, a knight from the King Arthur legends. He served as Grand Admiral Thrawn's right-hand man throughout the trilogy and provided the main Imperial point of view. Pellaeon returned in Kevin J. Anderson's Darksaber as the second-in-command of Admiral Daala before being promoted to leader of the Imperial Remnant, the capacity in which he appeared throughout Star Wars: The Hand of Thrawn Duology and The New Jedi Order series, after which he appeared in the Dark Nest Trilogy and the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force series as supreme commander of the Galactic Alliance before ending his life as the Imperial commander in Legacy of the Force: Revelation. Zahn was the only author to have written appearances for Pellaeon twice, for The Thrawn Trilogy and The Hand of Thrawn Duology, until Karen Traviss wrote Pellaeon in both Legacy of the Force: Revelation and The Clone Wars: No Prisoners. Anderson, Michael A. Stackpole, Walter Jon Williams, Sean Williams and Shane Dix, Greg Keyes, James Luceno, Troy Denning, and Aaron Allston each wrote Pellaeon for only one novel or trilogy, and John Ostrander wrote Pellaeon for one issue of a comic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon has been depicted various ways over time. The art inside the sourcebooks produced by West End Games\u2014Heir to the Empire Sourcebook, Dark Force Rising Sourcebook, The Last Command Sourcebook, and The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook\u2014showed Pellaeon as a thin, elderly man with a bushy mustache. The Essential Guide to Characters featured a similar take on Pellaeon, perhaps looking slightly younger. The comic adaptation of The Thrawn Trilogy, however, took a different tack, showing a clean-shaven and somewhat younger-looking and stouter Pellaeon. Pellaeon's Star Wars Customizable Card Game card and The New Jedi Order Sourcebook both featured illustrations seemingly based on the clean-shaven, harsher Pellaeon of the comics. Almost all other illustrations, however, correspond with the Essential Guide to Characters depiction. One exception was Pellaeon's appearance in Star Wars Galaxies, in which Pellaeon did not closely resemble any prior depiction. This rendition of Pellaeon also had black hair and mustache, in contrast to Pellaeon's appearance in Republic 64, where his hair is blond. Since his depiction in Galaxies was affected by the limitations of the game's character generation engine, this article assumes blond to be the correct canonical hair color."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Essential Guide to Characters listed Pellaeon's homeworld as Coruscant, whereas The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook had identified Pellaeon as being Corellian. This was reconciled in The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant, which indicated he had been born on Corellia but spent his youth on Coruscant. The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook also established Pellaeon as being in his seventies during the events of the Thrawn Trilogy, but current canon places him at sixty years old in that year."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon's rank has also been a matter of canonical confusion. Pellaeon was, after his assumption of the position of Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet, consistently referred to as \"Admiral\" or \"Fleet Admiral\" by all characters and the text until The New Jedi Order Sourcebook, which referred to Pellaeon once as a Grand Admiral; Pellaeon had been described at the corresponding point in the chronology, The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin, as wearing a Grand Admiral's white uniform but was never referred to by the rank. In The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way, set some three years later in-universe, Pellaeon is referred to consistently as a Grand Admiral, and that trend was continued throughout the subsequent literature. The role-playing adventure Nightsaber, however, refers to Pellaeon as a Grand Admiral as early as the Battle of Orinda. While no source explicitly prevents Pellaeon from holding the rank of Grand Admiral since 12 ABY, this would seem to be an anachronism considering that Pellaeon is consistently not referred to by the rank for another fifteen years in-universe. No canonical answer has yet been provided as to when Pellaeon actually assumed the rank, leaving it unclear if the use in Nightsaber should be considered an anachronistic mistake."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Heir to the Empire, Pellaeon recalled battling an unstable clone army; this was written at a time before most details about the Clone Wars had been established and it was assumed that the clone army had been the enemy.

However, in the comic arc Star Wars: Republic: Siege of Saleucami, Republic forces battled a clone army grown by the Separatists; Pellaeon's inclusion in the task force there seems to present the best explanation of Pellaeon's memories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Revelation, Pellaeon's is given as ninety-two years old as of 41 ABY, putting his birth year at 51 BBY.
