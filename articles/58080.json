Fisto manages to overpower a Quarren patrol and appropriate a couple of vehicles to get the fugitives to the surface quickly. However, Riff Tamson has anticipated that move and blows the ship up before the Jedi and Mon Cala can even reach the surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clinging onto the sinking debris, the fugitives allow themselves to be dragged down to the seabed, where they split up into two groups: Anakin goes with Padm\u00e8, Ackbar, and Tills while Ahsoka and Fisto accompany the prince, along with two rescued clone SCUBA troopers. Expecting Republic reinforcements to come here soon, Anakin and his groups proceed to the Mon Calamari central planetary scanner facility, where Anakin uses telekinesis to collapse the entire structure, rendering planetary defenses blind. In the meantime, Lee-Char witnesses from his hiding place how his people are led away into slavery. Desperate to aid them, but advised by Ahsoka to exercise caution in favor of recklessness, Lee-Char uses a seashell horn to inform his people that he is still alive and encourages them to hold on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, the Jedi Council is faced with the fact that they will have no clone force ready and equipped for underwater battle in time to aid the fugitives.

Tamson, however, quickly rallies his own forces and uses his Trident ships to create artificial whirlpools at the two battle sites, disorienting the Jedi and Gungan forces and thus facilitating their capture. Tamson himself goes after the Prince once more, but Kit Fisto manages to engage him in close combat for long enough to allow Lee-Char and Ahsoka to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As their friends are led into captivity, Lee-Char begins to despair over their loss and that only he and Ahsoka are left to fight on.
