Raids in Coruscant's Corellian Quarter were enacted by the Alliance's secret police, the Galactic Alliance Guard, with one such blitz being carried out in Jabi Town, led by two Jedi: Colonel Jacen Solo and his apprentice, Ben Skywalker. They approached a residence with locked doors, where their scanning equipment identified three individuals inside the premises equipped with heavy ordnance. Sergeant Wirut determined the hostile and uncooperative nature of the occupants and motioned Solo to stay back as he prepared to enter the building and round them up. Solo, however, insisted on assisting, and after confirming with Wirut that abeyance was the desired outcome, used the Force to send a paralyzing jolt into the spinal cords of all three offenders. He then telekinetically blew the locked doors open, thus allowing members of the Guard to enter unabated and apprehend the unconscious criminals. One of the troopers, a female, jokingly remarked to Solo about how his efficient search and seizure tactics would soon put the Guard out of business. She then coined the phrase \"REBJ,\" and when Solo inquired as to its meaning, the female trooper replied, \"Rapid Entry By Jedi.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo himself later used the term during another raid conducted by the Galactic Alliance Guard in Coruscant's lower levels. During that encounter, Solo used the Force to gain entry into the location, and to remove the blasters from the assailants' hands. He then telekinetically slammed one of them, a female, against the wall and pinned her there until the members of his squad were able to arrest both individuals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The term \"Rapid Entry By Jedi\" was only used in the second of the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novels, Bloodlines, by author Karen Traviss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
