The rebels grew tired of the Imperial-aligned government, and attempted to overthrow them under their leader, Dunlan, leading to a civil war. However, one of Dunlan's trusted lieutenants, Astor, betrayed the movement, and provided Darth Vader with the location of one of their safehouses. Shortly thereafter, stormtroopers under Vader's command attacked, killing most of the rebels there, but failing to eliminate Dunlan, who was present. Dunlan, though, was later tracked down and killed by Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
