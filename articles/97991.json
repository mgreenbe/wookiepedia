By the start of the Yuuzhan Vong War in 25 ABY, the Nomads were based off the MC80B Star Cruiser Allegiant in the Meridian sector and were under the command of Captain Tarrik.

Initially equipped with nimble Alliance Underground Engineering RZ-1 A-wing interceptors, Nomad Squadron's mission profile included reconnaissance and hit-and-fade assaults.

By the outbreak of the Yuuzhan Vong War in 25 ABY, Nomad Squadron was under the command of Captain Tarrik and was stationed aboard the Mon Calamari MC80B Star Cruiser Allegiant in the Meridian sector. At this time, due to the squadron's reputation of being able to fly almost any starfighter, Nomad Squadron's flight line comprised not only A-wings, but Incom Corporation T-65 X-wing starfighters and Slayn & Korpil B-wing starfighters as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the New Republic military was initially slow to act to counter the extra-galactic invaders.

This cross-training served them well, and by 25 ABY, the unit was equipped with not only A-wings, but X-wings and B-wings, giving them versatility in combat. Under Captain Tarrik, the Nomads were considered to be an excellent combat unit and were capable of performing ground operations as well as space-borne missions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nomad Squadron first appeared in On Wings of Rogues, an article in Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Gamer 9 that was written by Jim Swallow.
