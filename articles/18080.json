The Galactic Alliance, under the lead of Admiral Nek Bwua'tu, originally attempted to prevent the Killiks of the Colony to further expand towards Chiss space. Subsequently Alliance forces attempted to prevent the Dark Nest from escaping into open space. Even after it escaped, the blockade continued during the Swarm War, trapping many Killik forces within the Utegetu Nebula. The Battle of the Murgo Choke was one of the conflicts which was the direct result of the blockade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
