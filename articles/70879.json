A member of the prestigious Bakvalen family, the Bakvalen patriarch was furious when his eldest daughter Jhaka turned her back on her life as a Corellian noble and joined the Republic Navy as a starfighter pilot. Her father disowned her, leading Jhaka to change her surname to the more common \"Bakarn,\" and the man's daughter went on to become a renowned fighter ace.
