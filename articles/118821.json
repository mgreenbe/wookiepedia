An SSP05 was installed aboard the Millennium Falcon, replacing her original CEC-made Avatar-10 hyperdrive. The Falcon's SSP05 was substantially and illegally modified by Lando Calrissian, Klaus Vandangante, Han Solo and Chewbacca. During the Millennium Falcon's refit in 16 ABY by the New Republic, the SSPO5 was replaced with a Series 401 hyperdrive motivator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
