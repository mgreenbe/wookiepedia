His longest tenure came aboard the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Tharen before he was assigned to the Alliance High Command's Echo Base on the remote ice planet Hoth.

Ommis joined the revolutionary Alliance to Restore the Republic around 1 ABY, about a year after the Rebellion's monumental victory in destroying the Empire's first Death Star battlestation at the Battle of Yavin. He served as a skilled gunner aboard several Alliance corvettes, frigates, and starfighters, including his last and longest assignment as a gunner mate aboard the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Tharen, before being sent to the Alliance High Command headquarters at the secret Echo Base on Hoth, a remote ice planet in the Outer Rim Territories, by 3 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the onset of the Battle of Hoth, in which the Dark Lord Darth Vader's Imperial forces launched a full-scale planetary assault to destroy the Hoth Rebel base, Ommis was reassigned from starfighter duty, one of several personnel pulled from their regular assignments to serve as a gunner in the aft seat of the Rebels' T-47 airspeeders, dubbed \"snowspeeders.\" The move paired him with Rogue Group pilot Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian, also pulled from starfighter duty, under the call sign Rogue Four. The responsibility fell to Rogue Group to defend the base against the Empire's invading All Terrain Armored Transport walkers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels' defensive strategy called for Rogue Group's snowspeeders to delay the overwhelming Imperial invasion force as long as possible to buy enough time for Echo Base's evacuation transports to escape the planet. Once they received the withdrawal signal themselves, the Rogues were to assemble on Hoth's South Slope, just beyond the base, where they would then fly starfighter escort for the remaining evacuation transports. Ommis was wounded in the ensuing battle, a staggering Rebel defeat. Klivian's snowspeeder ultimately went down after being hit by AT-AT blasterfire and then crashing headfirst into the cockpit of Blizzard 1, Imperial General Maximilian Veers' lead walker. Nevertheless, both Ommis and Klivian survived the ordeal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kesin Ommis's combat abilities laid in his considerable gunnery skills, serving aboard Rebel capital ships, starfighters, and other craft.

The card, which established the character's original backstory and role with Rogue Group, identified Ommis as one of the Echo Base Rebel pilots appearing in the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back during Princess Leia Organa's pre\u2013Battle of Hoth briefing. However, the Rogues Gallery department from Star Wars Insider 146, released in December 2013, later changed the pilot's characterization from Ommis to Dak Ralter, Luke Skywalker's ill-fated snowspeeder gunner in the film. Research conducted by Lucasfilm's Pablo Hidalgo revealed that the actor in question was, in fact, John Morton\u2014who played Ralter in the film\u2014as confirmed by Morton's daughter, thus necessitating the character change."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ommis's background was greatly expanded upon, including establishing him as the gunner of Rogue Group pilot Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian during the Battle of Hoth, in author Josh Radke's Who's Who in Echo Base article from Star Wars Insider 74, released in February 2004. Given Ommis's pairing with Klivian, The Empire Strikes Back novelization, which describes a scene\u2014deleted from The Empire Strikes Back film\u2014in which Klivian suicidally crashes his snowspeeder into General Veers' AT-AT walker during the Hoth battle, is therefore considered Ommis's first in-universe appearance, albeit indirectly, in Star Wars canon.

In this film scene, the trailing snowspeeder's tailgunner, which corresponds to Ommis's character, is visible within the speeder's cockpit, making The Empire Strikes Back film the character's first visual canon depiction. However, a live extra for Ommis was filmed during the making of The Empire Strikes Back, for inclusion in the aforementioned scene of Klivian crashing into Blizzard 1.

Although the set's packaging features a likeness of what is now Ommis's incorrect appearance from The Empire Strikes Back, the action figure itself depicts Ommis with a mustache, a unique departure from any previous representation of the character.
