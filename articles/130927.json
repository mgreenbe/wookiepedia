Each shipment came with four magazines, and each magazine contained parts to build a 1:18 scale model of the X-wing, and always contained three departments: Creating a Starship Fleet, which focused on a behind the scenes look at the Star Wars films, Starfighter Aces, which took an in depth look at an individual starfighter pilot, and Build the X-Wing, which gave instructions for the parts that arrived with the issue. Premium subscribers received a diorama of the X-wing hangar from Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. The model itself has working lights, figures of Luke Skywalker and R2-D2, motorized wings, and a removable hyperdrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Issues"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
