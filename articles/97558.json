Olive-skinned and largely bald, Nimi wore his remaining black hair in a knot behind his head. He had blue eyes and black facial tattoos, and wore tan and white robes. An acquaintance of Master Orgus Din, Nimi was aboard Carrick Station in 3643 BBY, when Din's former Padawan\u2014just elevated to Jedi Knight\u2014arrived on the space station. Nimi discussed the Jedi's potential with the Knight, but advised the Jedi to choose one of two disciplines: the path of either the Jedi Sentinel or the Jedi Guardian. Recognizing both disciplines' benefits, Nimi instructed the Knight to speak with Master Cassa Hun for further training. Nimi also spent time on the Republic capital of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nimi introduces the mission \"Advanced Training: Jedi Knight\" for Jedi Knight players who have just completed the planet Tython in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.
