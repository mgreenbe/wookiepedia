They were confronted by Kenth Hamner, who had recently been removed from the position of acting Grand Master by the rest of the Jedi Council. He claimed that by letting the StealthXs launch, Razelle and Bwua'tu were committing an act of treason. When Razelle and Bwua'tu refused to stand down, he knocked them unconscious.

Meanwhile, exiled Grand Master Luke Skywalker encountered a new Sith Tribe, and the Jedi decided that they needed to send a strike team of StealthXs to assist him; however, the Galactic Alliance Sixth Fleet remained in orbit over the planet Coruscant, ready to engage the Jedi fighters in fear that the strike would be against the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a fall-out between acting Grand Master Kenth Hamner and the rest of the Jedi Council, Razelle was stationed alongside fellow Jedi Knight Yantahar Bwua'tu outside of the entrance to the Operations Hangar of the Jedi Temple while the StealthXs prepared to launch. Hamner had been confined to his quarters following the Council's vote of no-confidence in his leadership, but he escaped and made his way to the hangar, confronting Razelle and Bwua'tu.

Razelle recognized the threat that the Sith presented to the galaxy and refused to step aside to let Hamner into the hangar, even suggesting that he return to his quarters, where he was supposed to be confined.
