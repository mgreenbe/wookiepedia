It was aimed at the Jedi Initiates, who were nicknamed \"Junior Jedi\" in that book. The manual detailed the basic tenets of the Jedi way and also included a variety of information pertaining to the galaxy in general, such as an alien identification chart. A spoken narration recorded by a Jedi Master and included with the manual. Although the book could be used without the recording, some secrets were only revealed in the tape. Somehow, the Dark Lord of the Sith known as Darth Sidious managed to tamper with the record, adding some of his thoughts on the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
