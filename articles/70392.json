Daiman was shipping large quantities of baradium to his war forges near the front lines. Since the collapse of the Chagras Hegemony, the Grumani sector had become locked into a second series of family feuds known as the Second Charge Matrica. These conflicts had been encouraged and abetted by the Calimondra family matriarch Vilia Calimondra for the sole purpose of prevent any of her grandchildren from usurping her rule over her own empire. Vannar, a perennial foe of the Sith, wanted to knock out a portion of the Chelloan baradium production offline before Daiman could use it to alter the balance of power within the Grumani sector.

He brought a fleet of kinetic corruptors for the twin purposes of harvesting the volatile baradium compound and then destroying Chelloa. The large amount of baradium on Chelloa's surface made the planet a fiery powderkeg should someone ignite all its baradium deposits. At first, Treece's Operation Influx succeeded in infiltrating the Daimanate and landing on Chelloa. With the assistance of Palladane and the local miners, the Jedi party secured control of the spaceport at Jenith. However, Odion's forces then attacked and he deployed one of his kinetic corruptors.

However, Daiman managed to convince Kerra that Odion posed a greater threat to Chelloa because he planned to destroy the planet with his fleet of kinetic corruptors aboard The Spike, a large mobile war forge. The Jedi woman then hijacked one of Daiman's starfighters and head towards the space station. Her mission coincided with a failed Daimanate starfighter attack on Odion's fleet.

Odion was aware that his younger brother knew about the destructive capabilities of his kinetic corruptors but expressed his bemusement that Daiman would only send a small token force of starfighters. Jelcho reported that the Daimanites had been recalled back to Chelloa and also expressed his surprise at Daiman's change of tactics. Odion replied that Daiman probably became bored and was not taking the fighting seriously; vowing to crush Daiman's forces. Jelcho witnessed a starfighter pilot, later revealed to be Kerra Holt, ejecting from her starfighter.

The two were greeted by a Verpine Odionite and Jelcho complained that they had been kept waiting since there had been no droid stationed outside the station. That droid turned out to be GAD-3 who had already been reprogrammed by Kerra. However, Odion was unaffected by the delay and told the Givin to pay more attention to bigger things like finishing construction of the Corruptors and loading them aboard landing ships. Odion commented that Daiman had been making \"strange moves\" within his territory and he wanted to know more intelligence about his military plans on Chelloa.

However, Odion refuted the source's assertions as a lie since his forces had only knocked out one mine. This led Odion to conclude that either the source or Daiman was trying to play games with them. In response, Odion ordered Jelcho and his entourage to load all the kinetic corruptors into the landing ships and reiterated his command to destroy the planet. Odion wanted to deny any of his enemies including the Jedi and the Republic access to Chelloa's baradium deposits. He was also pleased that the Jedi strike force had been wiped out much earlier.

Odion engaged Kerra in a lightsaber duel which caused extensive interior damage to The Spike's facilities. At the climax of the fighting, Kerra managed to create a diversion that allowed her to escape the mobile space factory by ordering the reprogrammed GAD-3 to deactivate the overhead containment fields which exposed much of the station to zero-gravity space. Jelcho attempted to stop the labor droid but it was too late. The sudden exposure sucked several droids and workers into space where they were destroyed by compression.

In an ensuing cat-and-mouse race in space, Holt;s shuttle engaged Odion's gunship. Anticipating that Holt was going to ram her shuttle into his ship, he ordered his crew to open fire. However, the duel was interrupted by an incoming transmission from Lord Daiman. In a live broadcast from his Chelloan headquarters, a furious Daiman revealed to Odion that he had seized and tortured his informant, Gorlan Palladane.

To the relief of Jelcho, Odion chose to spare his crew due to the intelligence on Daiman's mining operations he had discovered from Holt. Rather than using his kinetic corruptors to destroy the surface of Chelloa, the Sith Lord ordered his elite Lightning Guard to be loaded into landing ships to capture Daiman's factories near the baradium mines.

They were about to seize the mobile munitions complexes for themselves when the vehicles suddenly shed their metal hulls to reveal that they were actually kinetic corruptors. Daiman had shipped a fleet of kinetic corruptors to Chelloa with the intention of destroying the planet's surface in order to deny its valuable supply of baradium to his enemies. This \"scorched earth\" tactic also involved the deaths of Chelloa's civilian population. Odion and his troops were trapped on the surface and his entire Lightning Guard contingent was wiped out by the magma flows triggered by the kinetic corruptors.

After several days, Odion was rescued and brought back to The Spike for medical treatment. Several cyborg surgeons began removing chunks of his armor that had become fused to his skin. While Odion was undergoing burns treatment, Jelcho and the Bothan spy Narsk Ka'hane gave an intelligence report about the Chelloan affair.

However, a furious Odion rejected Jelcho's optimistic report by citing the destruction of an entire legion of his Lightning Guard. He was also in an excruciating state of pain due to his burn injuries. When one of Odion's surgeons pleaded with the Sith Lord to remain still so that he could remove the shards of armor without causing further pain, the furious Sith Lord screamed that he wanted to remember the pain so that he could exact vengeance against Vannar's successor, Kerra. Following the Chelloan affair, the Odionate fleet returned back to Odionate space to recuperate. Kerra's actions also attracted the attention of the Calimondra family matriarch Vilia Calimondra.

Daiman had recently allowed one of Bactra's corporations, Industrial Heuristics, to recruit students from Darkknell and elsewhere in his territory\u2014known as the Daimanate\u2014in exchange for the fruits of the students' research. Daiman requested an arxeum, a mobile university dedicated to the science of war.

Despite Narsk's warnings that Daiman had planned a trap, Odion was more concerned with satisfying his nihilistic blood lust and assembled a large invasion force. It consisted of one-quarter of the Odionate home fleet, large ground units, and the giant mobile siege platform known as the Death Spiral. Jelcho would again serve as navigator aboard Odion's flagship Sword of Ieldis. Narsk was also present since the Sith Lord felt that he would need the Bothan to blow up more enemy assets. From their first meeting aboard the Sword of Ieldis, Jelcho and the Bothan spy Narsk Ka'hane took an immediate dislike toward one another since the latter regarded the former's species as physically unappealing.
