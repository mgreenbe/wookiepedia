It was orbited by the moon Pantora, which was long believed to be the only inhabited world in the system. It was the homeworld of the Talz species, but was considered to be a protectorate of Pantora until the presence of the Talz was discovered during the Clone Wars. The Pantoran Assembly gave formal recognition to the sovereignty of the Talz over Orto Plutonia following a brief war between the Talz and the Pantorans. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance hid its fleet in the planet's orbit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A desolate planet covered in ice wastelands, tors and snowy canyons, Orto Plutonia was located in the Sujimis sector's Pantora system, at the edge of the Outer Rim Territories close to Wild Space. The planet maintained a breathable atmosphere as well as a frigid climate, and orbited a single star. Far from any major trade routes, Orto Plutonia itself was rare to visits, with its moon Pantora serving as the center of political life in the sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
