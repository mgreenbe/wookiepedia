She assisted Pru after the original Mahjo regretted her actions and left. \"Evil Mahjo\" traveled to Gwongdeen with Pru, who was there to collect a thornsuckle plant to clone for the Mandragonian Mob. The real Mahjo Reeloo, who had hired Han Solo and Chewbacca to pilot her to Gwongdeen aboard the Millennium Falcon, accompanied by the pirate Hondo Ohnaka, encountered her clone, and fought her over the clone's blaster. The real Mahjo reported to Pru as if she was her clone, claiming to have killed her other self. Pru was fooled, allowing Reeloo to use her defoliator bomb to destroy the plant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
