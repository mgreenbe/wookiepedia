The OOM command battle droid was one of many battle droids dispatched during the Separatist siege of Hisseen. The droid led forces to capture the members of the Hisseenian parliament subsequently reporting to Count Dooku, who congratulated the droid, ordering to not let any prisoners escape. The droid disregarded Dooku's concern, believing they were safe from the Galactic Republic forces, but a group of clone troopers had located the captured parliament members, throwing EMP grenades into the area. The troopers deactivated and destroyed the battle droids, freeing the Hisseenians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
