The method involved staying ahead of updates to transponder code logs disseminated by the Imperial Navy, Sector Rangers, and the Imperial Office of Customs. Because updates took time to distribute, crimes committed in once region of space would not become known for a period of time to forces operating elsewhere. Records took days to update between star systems, weeks between sectors, and months between regions. Fast ships constantly on the move could stay ahead of transponder code updates for a long time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
