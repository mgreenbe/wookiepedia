In 20 BBY, the cruiser was part of a group brought to the planet Kadavo by Jedi General Plo Koon and Admiral Barton Coburn at the request of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker to help rescue kidnapped Togruta colonists from Kiros who had been enslaved by the Zygerrian Slave Empire. During the battle, Keeper Agruss, who was in charge of the Kadavo slave processing facility, set the floor of the prisoners' cells to open, which would drop them to their deaths in the caldera below, before destroying the controls, preventing Obi-Wan Kenobi from reversing it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On hearing the news Plo decided to move the cruiser into position to rescue the colonists, although this could not be done until Skywalker had taken out the facility's shielded turbolasers. Coburn had his bridge crew maneuver the Hand of Justice beneath the facility, scraping the ship's hull on the structure, before sending Clone Commander Wolffe and some of his troopers onto the top of the starship with jetpacks and cable guns to catch the Togruta. With the assistance of Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the clone troopers were able to rescue the colonists from falling. Once everyone was safe, the civilians and soldiers ran across the ship's hull to get inside, and the Hand of Justice extricated itself from beneath the facility. Subsequently, Plo had his gunships destroy the building, sending it falling into the caldera."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire.
