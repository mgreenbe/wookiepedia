The plant was grown in the Room of a Thousand Fountains, a greenhouse at the base of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.

The figure ran out of the room and the clone directed his squadmates to pursue it. However, the moving figure had actually been a illusion by the Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, who were then able to enter the freshly unoccupied room and continue their investigation into the Jedi deaths."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hylaian marsh bamboo first appeared in Matthew Stover's 2005 novelization of the prequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
