They were used to play the Alderaanian air, \"Tialga Hath Fallen.\" The air was played by the Galactic Alliance Navy Drum Corps during Admiral Cha Niathal's funeral on Coruscant in 43.5 ABY, although the Alderaanian flutes were replaced by sequential bells. Journalist Javis Tyrr, reporting on the funeral for the HoloNet, recognized and made note of the substitution of bells for the Alderaanian flutes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
