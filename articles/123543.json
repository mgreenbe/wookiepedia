Bipedal and covered in scales, they were extremely aggressive in nature, often hunting in packs. Bizzarely, when Doctor Juvard Illip Oggurobb studied the species, he was unable to determine their diet, as they did not consume the flesh of their kill or seemingly anything at all. Citing their defensive scales, Oggurobb theorized that the species rapidly evolved through an unknown process, possibly related to the Force. During Vaylin's Assault on Odessen, many Shade Stalkers were driven out into the open by the fighting and began assaulting both Alliance and Eternal Empire personnel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shade stalkers appear in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire Chapter 12: Visions in the Dark."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
