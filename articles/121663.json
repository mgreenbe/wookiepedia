An exact date is not provided for the battle, and it only illustrates the battle on the galactic map rather than in prose. The other battle at Iridonia is also illustrated on the map, marking a Sith victory which appears in the Wizards of the Coast supplement Iridonian Darkness. This battle, however, is placed at the front-end of the war, sometime in 3958 BBY, following the bombing of Telos IV. The second battle takes place at a time which has not been canonically solidified."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
