When a X'us'R'iia desert storm uncovered a wrecked Uulshos XP yacht buried beneath the sand of Jakku, Forna stripped the vessel clean alongside fellow scavengers Grand and Oth; however, the trio were unable to take some components from the vessel's main engine compartment, as they were to difficult to separate or transport. A month after scavenging the vessel, Oth, Forna and Grand were in the trading site Niima Outpost, where Forna ran into the scavenger Devi and let her know about the yacht. Devi then brought the news back to the scavenger Rey, who traveled to scavenge parts from the engine compartment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Forna was first mentioned in the collection of short stories Before the Awakening which was written by Greg Rucka and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
