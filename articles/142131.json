He was a member of a species that possessed fur and a compact frame. Tev was part of a team sent by General Jan Dodonna to survey the ice planet Hoth, a candidate for the location of a Rebel Alliance base, and his physical characteristics made him the most suited to the planet out of the group. In order to learn more about the planet, Tev and the team's naturalist, Kell Tolkani, convinced the other members of the team to track a tauntaun, hypothesizing that Hoth's large creatures resided in subterranean ecosystems. Tev and Tolkani suggested going alone, but the team's commander, Habria, refused to split the group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the evening of their first day tracking a tauntaun, they had been unable to learn anything, and Habria called for the group to make camp. While Tolkani insisted that they would lose the tauntaun if they stopped, Tev and the other rebels were not willing to risk their lives. Tolkani discovered that the tauntaun had stopped moving and correctly assumed it was playing dead, and the group continued to track it the next morning. The tauntaun led them into a glacial ravine and to an area where warm air rose from a crack, leading the team to discover a tauntaun family group. The Rebel Alliance's Echo Base was later established in the habitable location that the team had discovered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
