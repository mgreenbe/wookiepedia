It follows that a culture that actually employed such shields as defensive measures in warfare did not themselves possess any such restrictive moral codes or philosophies, nor were they in any degree bound by them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vagaari, a nomadic pirate species from the Unknown Regions, was one such culture that used living shields extensively in their raids on other planets and cultures within those regions and in Wild Space. Possessing no such philosophical moorings themselves that would cause such crippling hesitation in battle, the Vagaari came to boldly trust in the 'living shield' as a highly effective deterrent to employ against any world culture or force that was bound by such restrictive moral codes or law."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vagaarian living shield took the form of transparisteel-like plastic bubbles fitted all over the hulls of their armored slave and treasure ships.

Thrawn's aggressive stance, however, was in fact contrary to the fundamental military doctrine of the Chiss people, who believed in upholding a doctrine of \"peaceful watchfulness,\" and who refused to condone the preemptive military attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
