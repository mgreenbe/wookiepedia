Its structures, made from durasteel and plastoid, were slung between a pair of malformed planetoids in the Kafrene asteroid belt. Areas such as its aft docking bay were covered in lurid, phosphorescent graffiti. Roads led out from the docking bays towards the distant rock warrens of the planetoids, and the outpost itself was a labyrinthine sprawl of shacks, prefabricated housing, and countless maze-like corridors. Although there was some structure to the buildings around the main throughways, beyond these areas the layout of the Ring changed almost daily; shacks were made of sheet metal, and shelters utilized housing units recycled from foreign colonies. Alien housing complexes and tenements featured ventilation shafts that sent wafts of ammonia into the streets. The Ring acted as a junction between the Corellian Trade Spine\u2014which connected it to the planets Coruscant and Anoat\u2014and the Biox Detour, which connected it to the planets Takodana and Malastare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ring of Kafrene was constructed by members of nobility in the Galactic Republic, and was established as a mining colony to strip the asteroids and planetoids of the Kafrene asteroid belt of any valuable minerals. However, the founders soon realized that such coveted minerals were scarce in the Kafrene belt, and the failed mining venture became a trading post and stopover point for desperate travelers through the Thand sector. The Galactic Empire maintained a presence on Kafrene, and Imperial stormtroopers patrolled its streets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Liberation of Erso on Wobani, the Alliance to Restore the Republic sent Cassian Jeron Andor to the Ring of Kafrene to investigate why Imperial shipments of kyber crystals were being shipped across the galaxy.

After Chewbacca noticed a pair of bounty hunters watching them, Solo finished the deal, giving the Alaphani credit chips in exchange for the codes. The two bounty hunters followed them, but were ambushed by Solo, who took their weapons and promised them that Jabba would get his money. They boarded the Millennium Falcon and left the Ring of Kafrene, returning to Mako-Ta to discover that it was under attack by Darth Vader and his Death Squadron. After escaping the attack, he sold the data that he got from the Ring of Kafrene to Sana Starros on Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "0-0-0 and BT-1 were picked up by Imperials during a sweep of the Ring of Kafrene.
