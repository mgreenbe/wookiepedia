Its mission involved discovering a pathogenic disease that could continually shift its antigen needs, thereby making it impossible to eliminate. The disease could then be unleashed on rebellious worlds, and the Imperials could then arrive with the \"cure,\" an antiviral injection that actually released new forms of the disease into the system. The goal of the program was to instill loyalty to the Empire by forcing people to accept the Imperial cure, making them dependent upon it for their very survival. The work of Doctor Fesjo Negleem eventually created the FNV-23 virus, which was successfully tested on the planet Sedesia. However, a team of Rebel Alliance agents managed to thwart Doctor Negleem's plans, and obtained complete documentation on the program."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
