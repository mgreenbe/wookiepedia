The blaster's power pack contained enough energy for thirty shots before charging, and had three separate settings. At the first setting, the pistol released a sonic pulse, which utilized a controlled harmonic wave to cause intense pain, though no damage, to stun or knock out a target, depending on their resilience. The second was more powerful, and the third setting released a more powerful attack that was able to damage flesh on a molecular level. When fired on the third setting, however, used twice as much energy. Infamous assassins made use of these weapons to inflict pain and disorient their victims. In addition, this weapon had the capability to bypass many types of shields and defenses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
