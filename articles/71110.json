Consisting of a series of random slips, turns, dives and waggles using a craft's control stick and the etheric rudder. The idea behind jinking was to avoid giving an attacking enemy a solid targeting lock; though the pilot of the attacking ship retained his advantageous position, the longer he was forced to concentrate on achieving a viable shooting solution, the less aware he became of the situation around him leaving them vulnerable to counterattack from other starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
