Weapon-wise, the craft possessed the two laser cannons from the TIE's wings, while the Z-95's own cannons were attached to either side of the main fuselage. The fighter also bore a twin barreled cannon, resembling a BTL Y-wing starfighter's ion cannon turret, mounted on top of the \"eyeball\" cockpit. Interestingly, a port for an astromech droid was situated at the nose of the fighter rather than behind the pilot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Usage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Z-interceptors were starfighters used by Kavil's Corsairs and the Kintan Gunrunners.
