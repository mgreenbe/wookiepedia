In 34 ABY, Captain Imanuel Doza of the Colossus platform used a signal beacon in an attempt to rendezvous with his wife Venisa, a Resistance pilot, in the Outer Rim. However, the beacon's signal was picked up by the First Order Resurgent-class Star Destroyer hunting the Colossus, so the station was forced to flee into hyperspace after a skirmish immediately before Venisa's arrival."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
