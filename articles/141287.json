After the Empire abandoned the planet, Aylay thanked the resistance fighter Yendor\u2014who had been part of Cham Syndulla's Free Ryloth Movement\u2014while others Twi'leks packed up the camps. The old man then declared they would need the help of the New Republic to maintain their freedom, and suggested that Yendor should be the world's ambassador, much to the other Twi'lek's dismay. Despite Yendor's objections to the idea, the resistance member had indeed become ambassador to the New Republic by the time of the Napkin Bombing incident on the New Republic capital Hosnian Prime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tekku Aylay first appeared in an interlude in the novel Aftermath: Life Debt, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
