A variant of the blast bug, the snap bug was the Yuuzhan Vong analog of a Flash-bang grenade. When thrown, the snap bug would explode with a bright flash and a sonic boom. The snap bug would temporarily blind or deafen enemies. However, the Yuuzhan Vong were largely immune to the snap bug's effects, and would often use them while searching for enemies in dark places."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
