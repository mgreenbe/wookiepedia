Its articles outlined the tenets and operational structure of the government in general, statutory terms. The Charter was created by the Provisional Council to create a more unified and defined government in place of the transitional government established by the Declaration of a New Republic. It took effect in 7 ABY on Restoration Day. The Charter was based on, although somewhat different, the Old Republic's Galactic Constitution. When the New Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, the New Republic Common Charter underwent several major changes into Galactic Alliance Common Charter. This new constitution, with increased checks and balances and a new federal structure, strove to correct many of the flaws of the previous government."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Declaration set forth the basic principles and tenets of the republic, members were confederated under the Charter.
