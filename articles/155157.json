The Trandoshan and five other thugs who accompanied Akris at the time of the attack manage to escape with him into a Skar'kla base and seal it's blast doors behind them. The Trandoshan was one of the thugs closest to the door and was ordered by Akris to check if the Jedi was still chasing them. Before the thug could however, the Jedi impersonator began cutting through the blast doors with a stolen blue lightsaber. The Trandoshan and other thugs fired with blasters at where they thought the attacker would be once the door broke opened, but hit nothing. Once they ceased fire to find their target the enforcer rolled a Thermal detonator through the ruined door which exploded, completely obliterating the Trandoshan and two other thugs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The enforcer went on to kill all of the remaining thugs with his lightsaber and eventually Akris as well, whom he choked to death with a gas emitter designed to make it look like the enforcer was force choking the Bothan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trandoshan thug first appeared in the short story Reputation written by Ari Marmell and illustrated by Thomas Hodges which was published in Star Wars Insider 136 in 2012."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
