Prepared in boxes of fifteen, each chocolate came in various shapes and sizes, including four stormtrooper helmets, six Star Destroyers, four Imperial crests, and one large piece of chocolate resembling Darth Vader's mask. The box itself was colored black, and the lid was stylized with two blue and silver stripes, and a silver colored Imperial crest in the center.

In exchange for credits, the organizer would sell both these chocolates and bags of Order 66 Cookies, but only to loyal Imperial citizens. Suspected sympathizers of the Alliance to Restore the Republic were turned away from publicly purchasing these confectioneries.

The release included the special Empire Day and Remembrance Day events in Theed and Coronet respectively, to celebrate the fifth year anniversary of Galaxies. The chocolates were reintroduced during the subsequent Empire Day festivities in 2009, 2010, and 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In exchange for credits and/or Empire Day Tokens (depending on the item version), Imperial-aligned players could purchase two versions of the item during the Empire Day events. One version, requiring 2000 credits, was a consumable item which increased damage and reduced action cost for a player's combat attributes. Once consumed, the item would disappear from the player's inventory, and the provided attributes would only last for a temporary amount of time. The other version of Gracious Government Mix, costing 5 Empire Day tokens, was permanent, but non-consumable. This latter version acted as a house decoration. When examined, the item read, \"Spoil yourself like you were royalty with this mix of delicious chocolate said to be the favorites of the Emperor himself.\" Oddly, despite its pro-Imperial nature, some versions of Star Wars Galaxies had the non-edible versions being sold for five Remembrance Day tokens during Remembrance Day festivities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
