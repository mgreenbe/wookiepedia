Admiral Wullf Yularen informs Skywalker that the staging area is secure, to which Skywalker states that he doubts that the Bith will give them any problems, believing that the true threat is far from them. Yularen asks the Jedi Knight if he means the Separatists' new secret weapon, to which Skywalker responds by reminding the Admiral that it has made almost twelve attacks on the Republic Navy. Yularen reminds Skywalker that High General Yoda believes that it is important to keep a foothold in this part of space; Skywalker, however, thinks they are not doing enough. Skywalker's apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, then tells him that being in this system gives them a good vantage point to look at the Separatists' movements and shows Skywalker a chart she compiled of the secret weapon's strike points. Unfortunately for the Republic, these attacks are simply too random to form a pattern, and a prediction of the weapon's next strike would be just a guess."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, in the Phu system, a Republic task force, under the command of Jedi Master Ares Nune, is patrolling the system for enemy activity. Nune, aboard the bridge of his flagship, the Venator-class Star Destroyer Laudable, is talking to Clone Commander Kite about their mission. Nune jokes that Kite has a very singular outlook on life, to which Kite responds that he would prefer to fight the enemy on a planet rather than in space, so he can die with dirt under his feet rather than deckplate. As the two are finishing up their conversation, the Confederacy's secret weapon, the Subjugator-class heavy cruiser Malevolence, under the command of General Grievous, attacks the task force. The Malevolence fires an ion pulse at the Republic fleet, catching Nune and his men off-guard and disabling the entire fleet's deflector shields. The Malevolence proceeds to destroy Nune's task force, killing Kite, Nune, and everyone else aboard the Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on the Republic capital planet of Coruscant, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Jedi Masters Plo Koon, Mace Windu, and Yoda are discussing the loss of Nune's fleet in the Chancellor's Suite. Koon tells them that he has recommended an increase in the number of patrols in the region, and that he will lead the sweeps in the Venator-class Star Destroyer Triumphant. However, the others worry that it will still not be enough to stop the Separatists' weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Conception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Clone Wars: Shakedown is a six-page webcomic and the second issue in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars webcomic series, which ties directly into the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series.
