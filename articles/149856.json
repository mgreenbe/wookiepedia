He was also responsible for arresting Mezhan Kwaad and Nen Yim for their heretical shaping of Tahiri Veila. However, when Anakin Solo and Vua Rapuung appeared, Anakin forced the commander to allow Vua to question Kwaad for her role in his shaming. Vootuh, hoping to capture the brother of Jacen Solo and gain advancement in the eyes of Warmaster Tsavong Lah, reluctantly agreed. After Kwaad's confession, she killed Vootuh with her shaper hand. In review, Warmaster Lah said that it was better for Vootuh, as the Warmaster would have sacrificed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
