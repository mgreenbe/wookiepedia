Should anything explode, the IW-37's blaster-resistant durasteel armor meant it could generally take the hit and keep working. The droids chassis had a rechargeable battery module on its back and also featured two large flat-footed legs. The Open Circle Fleet utilized IW-37 droids, with its emblem marked at the front."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
