Although the amount was ridiculously low, 100 credits, Faeto hired a bounty hunter to kill Untas in order to preserve his reputation. The bounty hunter Boba Fett heard about the death mark and advised an acquainted bounty hunter to accept the mission. Bosshand Faeto met the bounty hunter in the Lucky Despot and they agreed with the terms of the contract. Faeto recommended the bounty hunter to first ask a woman known as Taibela about Untas. After Taibela, the bounty hunter met her fianc\u00e9 Oldksam, and later Untas' partner Sleash. The drug addict Sleash agreed with giving Untas' location, in the White Thranta Shipping offices, and the bounty hunter eventually killed Untas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Faeto was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
