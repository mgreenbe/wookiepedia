During the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems hired the Skakoan engineer Vylagos to build them a hyperspace warping device, which they planned to use to launch an attack on the planet Coruscant. Vylagos constructed the device inside a Separatist base located on the world Ando Prime, but before the machine could be used by the CIS, the base was attacked by the 313th Legion, a clone trooper unit. During the battle, the device was accidentally activated, and it transported the legion and the base's CIS garrison to an unknown world located beyond the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
