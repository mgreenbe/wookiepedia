According to Lady Bo-Katan Kryze, the Children of the Watch were a cult of religious zealots seeking to reestablish the Way, as the ancient faith had fallen out of favor with mainstream Mandalorian society. The Tribe were members of the Children of the Watch, but at least one of its members, Din Djarin, was unaware that they were part of the Children of the Watch and adhering to its doctrine. Instead, Djarin believed that all Mandalorians were like them until he met Bo-Katan Kryze and her Mandalorian warriors, Axe Woves and Koska Reeves, who were members of the more mainstream Mandalorian society when compared to the Children of the Watch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the French version of The Mandalorian, Children of the Watch is translated as Les H\u00e9ritiers de la Death Watch (The Heirs of the Death Watch), which may show some connection.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
