It was commanded by Captain Suubrin and in circa 19 BBY was sent on a mission to investigate an Abandoned Separatist base. It arrived in the system where the base was and attacked some Droid starfighters and some Z-95 Headhunters that were there. Troops were landed from it to the base, while Suubrin then flew it to investigate a mystery starfighter that had just arrived. This turned out to be flown by the Cerean Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi and he landed on the Vigilance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
