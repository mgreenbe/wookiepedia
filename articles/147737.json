It was set on Lorrd, a subject world of the Argazdan Redoubt, towards the end of the Kanz Disorders around 3970 BBY. Three hundred years earlier, the Argazdan Myrialites had enslaved the native Lorrdians during their conquest of the Kanz sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The last Argazdan Regent Torphceris\u2014a devoted Myrialite\u2014faced growing opposition to his rule over the Kanz Sector by the Galactic Republic. In desperation, he betrayed his \"beliefs\" in Vianism by making a pact with a demonic alien \"artisan-shaper\" who promised to give him the power to summon a destructive power. As part of harnessing this \"terrible\" power, Torphceris collaborated with her in organizing the construction of the Slave Pits of Lorrd through the use of Lorrdian slaves. Within the pits, it was said that she worked to create a \"destructive force\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The play was lenient in its treatment of the Argazdans since they were portrayed as unbelieving cowards motivated by power rather than being depicted as villains.
