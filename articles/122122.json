A master of Sith alchemy, Fulminiss created the Seeds as the ultimate achievement in his lifelong quest to develop new ways to corrupt other living beings. Roughly cylindrical and about as wide as an average Human's shoulders, the Seeds were designed to be buried underground, and they used a combination of the dark side of the Force and low-frequency transmissions to subtly manipulate the emotions and thoughts of any living creatures nearby. Over time, the Seeds drove their victims insane and contaminated them with dark side energy, resulting in a warping of both the victims and the surrounding environment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic War, Lord Tagriss, a servant of the rogue Dread Masters, stole the seeds from Arcanum and spread across a number of settled worlds.

At the same time, Jedi Master Cedral Gend summoned a Republic individual to find the seeds so that they could be destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the final mission on Ilum, on the mission \"Alchemy of Evil\" Imperial players can choose to either use the corrupted Jedi forge to merge the seeds into a device that transforms into an armor at the end of the mission (dark side dialogue) or just return the seeds intact to Darth Acina, who will hide them in a more secure location on Ziost (light side dialogue).
