When the weapon was fired, the magnetic rings accelerated the micro-grenades to high velocities, launching them from the barrel. The rings degraded after constant use, which could cause a grenade to jam in the barrel. Replacing the rings was recommended while perfoming maintenance on the weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
