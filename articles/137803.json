Dealing with the planet Prakith is much like dealing with Coruscant, except that the majority of the citizens are members of the Imperial Navy. The heroes must discover Master Denia's location without revealing their sympathies, a balancing act that can have dire consequences if they fail.\nThe heroes sneak into the Citadel and make their way to the top of the building, using stealth and subterfuge to avoid detection or capture. When they reach the top of the Citadel, they find Inquisitor Draco torturing Master Denia. He has clearly grown in power since their last confrontation and seems unbeatable in open conflict. But Master Denia sacrifices her own life to weaken Draco, which makes the battle more of a fair fight. Rather than fall to the heroes, Draco flees the Citadel in his personal shuttle. The heroes manage to escape Prakith, having lost Master Denia but having defeated Draco\u2014at least, for now."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
