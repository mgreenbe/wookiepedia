Though Nik threw the detonator directly at Hanson's feet, Hanson managed to use his jetpack to clear himself from the brunt of the blast and, while in the air, fired his blaster at Nik, managing to hit Nik, causing him to fall into an unconscious state. Once Hanson had recovered from his brief stunt, he made his way over to Nik's body and slapped binders on Nik's wrists, taking him to stand trial before the Rebel high command."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
