It began with a dispute over an abducted TIE Defender R&D scientist, in which the Rneekii demanded a ransom for the scientist's safe return. The Empire tricked the Rneekii by handing over the ransom, retrieving the scientist, then sending their code to attack the Rneekii \"full speed to Kiilimaar\" and take back the ransom into Imperial hands. The Rneekii pirate forces were destroyed by starfighter attack led by famous Imperial pilot Maarek Stele."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
