The same year he participated in a skirmish on Vulta with the rest of Xizor's team to try and capture Korr, yet Korr killed multiple members of the team and escaped with the assistance of Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer. Deron and the other survivors were picked up in the group's speeder afterward. Deron asked Xizor why a Jedi would be involved with a spice-running smuggler such as Korr, but Xizor was unable to answer and ordered the men to regroup at Ord Mantell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
