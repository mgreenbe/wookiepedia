In 44 ABY, he played a special role in framing Thaal when he was disguised as the General via a neoglith masquer created by fellow Wraith Viull \"Scut\" Gorsat. In this disguise, he helped kidnap famed pop star Ledina Chott, who Thaal was planning to marry. The mission to determine Thaal's guilt was successful and he was arrested as Thadley Biolan under the assumption that Biolan was posing as Thaal and that the real Thaal was dead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trey was Wraith Squadron's tech expert, Turman mentioned that he 'exercises constantly' and his muscular frame is mentioned throughout the story, so he is presumed to have above-average physical strength."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By Human standards, Trey was a fairly muscular and handsome man of fair complexion and brown hair that got lighter (blond) when exposed to sunlight.
