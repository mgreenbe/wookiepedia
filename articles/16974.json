Bilk had his blaster raised to both when Zippa took back the holocron and then proceeded to leave, ordering Bilk to deal with the two. Before Bilk could complete his task, however, I-5 used it's vocabulator to emit a high-pitched scream which was painful for the Gamorrean's ears, and while attempting to clap both of his hands over his ears, he dropped his blaster. Catching the blaster, I-5 stopped screaming and aimed it at Bilk. The Gamorrean either didn't notice this or was too enraged to care and whilst snarling, lunged at the droid and it's business partner. I-5 fired the blaster, which shot through Bilk's armored chest plate, through several internal organs, and exited between his shoulder blades, which resulted in him dropping to the floor, dead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like most Gamorreans, Bilk wasn't particularly bright and was slow to react to many situations, such as when he was insulted by I-5YQ.
