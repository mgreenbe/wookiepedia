His deathbed work, Nights of Ryscate and Diamonds, was a deeply sentimental and widely celebrated account of his life in Coronet City, the capital of his homeworld of Corellia. After his death, Ramak's funeral ashes were compressed into a soul diamond, as was Corellian custom, and it was put on display in the Museum of Fine Art in Coronet. His remains were stolen during the Battle of Corellia during the Galactic War between the Republic and the Empire, and rumors abounded that they had surfaced on Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Custo Ramak was first mentioned in the Codex entry for Coronet City in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
