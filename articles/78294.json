There, Kruuny piloted a starfighter in the Battle of Dubrillion against the Yuuzhan Vong forces and struggled to shake the pursuit of enemy coralskippers. After they voiced this struggle over the comm systems, Han Solo cautioned the pilot to stay calm and assured them that he would assist in the Millennium Falcon. Solo was true to his word and, acting as gunner, his wife Leia Organa Solo eliminated the pursuing fighter with the Millennium Falcon's quad laser cannons. Relieved after the close call, Kruuny thanked the Solos, an exchange that was overheard on the comms by the couple's three children, all of whom fought in the battle themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kruuny first appeared in the 1999 novel The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime written by R.
