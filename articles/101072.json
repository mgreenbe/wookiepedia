With the Sith Navy all but defeated and their commanding Sith killed in action, a young naval officer named Rycus Kilran took full command of the desperate forces of the Empire and led the Sith to a quick but efficient victory. This officer, Rycus Kilran, would later go on to become a Grand Moff after showing his tactical genius and commitment to victory in the Sacking of Coruscant. Three millennia later, during the Clone Wars, Jedi Quinlan Vos and Tholme used the planet as a clandestine meeting place. The planet finally disappeared from history at the outlawing of podracing by the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Podracing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the derelict state of the mining platform (or perhaps because of them), Ord Ibanna was used as a host for the podracing circuits. The head scrap scavenger, Dethro Glok, set up at least three courses involving these decrepit platforms. He enjoyed the high speed thrills of the races and listening to the screams of pilots as they tumbled down to the abyss below. The three Podracing tracks are as follows: Scrapper's Run, Dethro's Revenge, and Abyss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and differences"}]}
