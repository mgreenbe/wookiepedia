While he made his way through Kothlis' industrial sector on foot, intending to hobble to the spynet's hidden ship in a concealed hangar bay, SecOps Four was waylaid by a group of Bothan Spynet members who were of a competing faction. These Bothans, led by Vord'lya and loyal to Borsk Fey'lya, stunned SecOps Four and stole the case containing the Death Star II plans. They delivered the plans to the Alliance to Restore the Republic themselves, allowing Borsk Fey'lya's faction to take the credit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
