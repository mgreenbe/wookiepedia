It was also used briefly as a refuge by Celot Ratua Dil while effecting his escape from Despayre. It contained mostly replacement parts for assorted mechanical devices being used for construction of the Death Star. It also contained large gas tanks of oxygen and hydrogen, a locker with several Vac suits, and a general service droid in another crate. Most fortunately, a crate of Vulderanian grain flakes had also been mislaid on board the storage unit. Ratua made use of all of these items to in turn to finally smuggle himself on to the Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
