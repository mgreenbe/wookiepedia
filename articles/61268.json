He was a gaunt Sullustan with slightly sunken cheeks. He did not speak Basic well, so he tended to speak slowly. He preferred letting underlings deal with outsiders, but was not sure they would do so appropriately, so he met with those who came to the mines with questions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bryl was a fan of Sullustan sports, and kept images and trophies of such sporting events in his office.
