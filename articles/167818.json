When Organa then formed the Resistance following the end of the investigation into Di, Seastriker personally vouched for Bangel and some of the other pilots on the list, and they were invited to join the Resistance, attending the organization's first meeting in a hangar that Organa had privately leased. While in the Senate hangar bay, Bangel wore a tool belt.
