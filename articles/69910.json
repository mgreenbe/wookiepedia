Built in the ancient past before the Jedi High Council exerted its authority over the Jedi Order, the Enclave and training grounds were abandoned long before the fall of the Order at the end of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Constructed early in the Order's history, the Jedi Enclave of Aloxl was a sprawling compound of a dozen low stone structures surrounding the great training facility shaped like two crossed lightsabers. Built into a natural rock formation, the facility's exterior was ornately carved to resemble two lightsabers with blades crossed. The Enclave proper was situated at the intersection of the two blades, with the two entrances to the facility located at the ends of the hilt of each blade. The halls that wound through the facility were long and empty and connected chambers containing challenges for the competitors. Rooms such as the Chamber of Fear create temptation and threats in the minds of the contestants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Enclave proper at the heart of the facility was a kilometer-wide circular cavern situated at the intersection the blades. Four doors in the chamber stand across from one another, opening onto on of the four long halls traveling up the lightsaber formations. When a contestant entered the chamber, the doors sealed and they were assaulted by illusory attackers. If the opposing team were to arrive during the other team's fight, the illusion dissipate and the teams must fight each other. Defeat is dealt through incapacitation, not death. When the fighting is done, the winning team crosses the room from the door they entered to the opposing door to continue on their way. The losing team would once more be assaulted by illusions and could only continue once their foes were defeated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The terminus at the tip of each lightsaber formation was a ceremonial chamber wherein the winning team was presented with ceremonial robes of a distinct organization within the early Order. Saluted by illusory apprentices, the winners were taught a new ability in the Force before a concealed door allowed the competitors to exit. Losers received nothing, but could compete again in ten local days."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Designed by a long forgotten sect of the Jedi Order as a challenging obstacle course, the Enclave training facility was used as part as a race from one end of the hilt to the tip of the blade. The doors to the facility would only open if a team or contestant were situated at each entrance. The world traveled an unusual ellipsis around its star, causing the surface to be uninhabitable for 125 standard years at a time, before a brief twenty-five year period allowed Jedi to actively work on the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lost to the Order at some point in the past, the existence of the facility was known to the Inquisitorius of the Galactic Empire. Nearly two decades after the Clone Wars, the world was coming back into its period of habitability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
