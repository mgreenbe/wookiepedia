These rontos were seen making routine journeys to and from the desert planet's settlements, swaying under the weight of cargo or Jawa passengers. Rontos were seen in Mos Espa and were a common sight in Mos Eisley, where many were ridden by the spaceport's citizens. On one occasion during Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi's trip to the city, a reckless rider startled a ronto into rearing up and unseating his Jawa passengers, leaving one dangling from the reigns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grakkus the Hutt kept a menagerie of beasts in his palace on Nar Shaddaa, holding a ronto among his caged creatures at the time of Luke Skywalker's encounter with the crime lord during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early months of the New Republic, Cobb Vanth and Issa-Or owned two unruly rontos which required the steady hand of a beastmaster, and offered the job to Malakili after saving the former rancor tamer from the Red Key Raiders.
