Used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War, it had a maximum range of 50 meters. Uff Wogo owned at least one of these before he was killed by Durge, who then gave the weapon to a spacer working for Boba Fett. The spacer handed this weapon over to Fett as proof that Uff was dead, then Fett returned it to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
