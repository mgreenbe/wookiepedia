Essentially a larger version of the atlatl, the cesta was tipped with a cradle large enough to accommodate a single energy ball. When used to hurl energy balls, the cesta was slightly more accurate than an atlatl. A proficient Gungan warrior used his cesta to fling a booma around one hundred meters, though such throws were not always accurate due to the primitive nature of the weapon. Because of their culture, Gungans had a natural proficiency when wielding the cesta, whereas others who were not trained with it would have trouble wielding it. The cesta's cradle was often decorated with carvings of symbols and icons of personal significance to individual warriors. Survivors of the Battle of Grassy Plains memorialized their fallen comrades by carving their names into the handles of their cestas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Users"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cestas were commonly used by the militiagungs of the Gungan Grand Army.
