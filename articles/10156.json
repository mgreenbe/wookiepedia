In response to the failed Operation Trinity in 29 ABY, the Yuuzhan Vong launched an offensive against New Republic shipyards. The Hakassi and Kuat shipyards were first targeted. Soon after self-proclaimed Chief of State Pwoe visited Kuat, the planet fell to the Yuuzhan Vong. During the invasion, the Vong managed to catch many wealthy and influential families from Corulag who had fled their invaded world.
