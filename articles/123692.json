Due to shadow troopers typically operating in small numbers and their reliance on stealth, the standard Republic gunship was rendered counterproductive to the stealth troopers. In cases where a squad of clone shadow troopers needed to be dropped behind enemy lines, the Shadow trooper gunship was called in. The ship featured a highly advanced sensor-jamming package alongside specialized sensor-refractive armor plating, which made it virtually invisible to all but visual scans. It was also equipped with a wide array of armaments, including electromagnetic pulse missiles, laser cannons, and rocket launchers. In addition, the gunship had markings which resembled the clone shadow trooper in color."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Shadow trooper gunship was created by Hasbro in 2008, for their Star Wars: Titanium Series of die-cast vehicle models."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
