Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, it was present in the junk dealer Unkar Plutt's shop in Niima Outpost on Jakku shortly on the First Order's attack on the nearby Tuanul village. While the droid stood behind the booth Plutt worked in the scavenger Rey brought him several pieces of scrap worth one quarter portion of foodstuff. The droid moved away before the next in line, the pet trader Bobbajo, moved up to the booth. The next day, KT-310 was still in Niima and witnessed Rey knock down the First Order deserter Finn with her quarterstaff inside one of the outpost's structures. The First Order then attacked Niima shortly after."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "KT-310 first appeared as a minor background character in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, but was not identified.
