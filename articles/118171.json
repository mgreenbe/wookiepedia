Their respective mothers were very close friends and had secretly plotted to marry off their children. Ironically, the two women were the first to be surprised when Ruwee and Jobal actually fell in love with each other. After getting married, the young couple helped build their village in the mountains. Like her husband, Jobal was very generous and compassionate. While Ruwee donated his skills as a builder, Jobal fostered the village's community spirit. His wife eventually became pregnant\u2014first with Sola, then four years later, with Padm\u00e9."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ruwee was also a volunteer worker in the Refugee Relief Movement\u2014having joined the organization at the age of ten\u2014where his younger daughter Padm\u00e9 would later follow in his footsteps.

The Naberries also had the surprising visit of Senator Palpatine who had come to try and convince the couple to have Padm\u00e9 run for the throne.
