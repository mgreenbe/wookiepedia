Through the Cosmic Force, midi-chlorians formed a symbiotic relationship with living beings and communicated to them the will of the Cosmic Force. Because of this will, nothing occurred in the galaxy by accident. By clearing the mind of any thoughts and acting on instinct, sentient Force wielders could listen to the Force's will and become an instrument of it, fulfilling their predestined path. The Jedi were agents of the Force's will. Let'ij believed the will of the Force desired the flourishing of life, harmony, and community, and was only heard by those who operated as a larger organism, a community. However, all lifeforms attuned to the presence of the Force through the midi-chlorians could hear it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In death, one chose to enter the Cosmic Force; Leia Skywalker Organa Solo did not pass into the Force until her son Ben Solo died as a redeemed Jedi, where the two entered the Cosmic Force together and found peace at last. As explained by the former Jedi Ahsoka Tano, since the Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus became a part of the Cosmic Force after life, his will could manifest within a loth-wolf, which went by the name of \"Dume\" and briefly communicated with Jarrus' Padawan learner, Ezra Bridger. After the Galactic Civil War, the Cosmic Force became dormant and was seemingly quieted to those who could sense its presence. Turbulence within the Cosmic Force coincided with the awakening of latent Force abilities in individuals such as Rey and Finn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cosmic Force was first identified in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, albeit in a scene that was deleted from the film by the time of its release in 1977. The term was mentioned by Darth Vader, voiced by David Prowse, as part of the first mention of the Force in one revised 1976 fourth draft of the film. The final cut of the Star Wars film reduces the mention of the Cosmic Force to the Force, and the scene of Vader, who is dubbed by James Earl Jones, is instead placed after the scene on Tatooine where Obi-Wan Kenobi defines the Force to Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In canon, the Cosmic Force was first identified in the episode \"Voices\" from Star Wars: The Clone Wars.
