He assisted pilots Poe Dameron, Snap Wexley, Kar\u00e9 Kun, L'ulo L'ampar, and Jessika Pava. Before their departure, Muva expressed disappointment to Dameron that he was not accompanying them on the mission.

This turned out to be a trap set by Terex. After being separated, Oddy infiltrated Terex's ship Carrion Spike and managed to rescue his wife and several slaves with the help of Black Squadron.

When Muva expressed his wish that he could join them, Dameron reassured him that he would get his chance once he had received more training. Black Squadron's mission to Ovanis was complicated when Dameron discovered that somebody had planted a tracking device on his T-70 X-wing starfighter. This somebody turned out to be Muva.

Pava also told Muva that he was the best technician. When Pava invited him for drinks, Muva asked her about her new mission. Pava mentioned that they were going to a prison.

Muva subsequently supplied this information to Terex."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Black Squadron's Ovanis and Megalox missions, Muva supplied intelligence on the squadron's movements to Terex, who used it to keep ahead of Dameron.

After Dameron allowed Muva to fly his T-70 X-wing, Muva expressed gratitude and vowed to keep the ship safe. After the Resistance spymaster C-3PO informed Dameron that one of the Resistance spy droids on the Outer Rim planet Kaddak had supposedly acquired information about the location of Supreme Leader Snoke, Dameron brought Muva along for the mission and allowed him to fly a freighter.

He was startled when he witnessed a man being thrown to his death. Later, Muva along with Dameron and C-3PO visited a cantina in the Sliver's Level 45. When a nervous Muva asked what they were doing here, C-3PO explained that they were here to meet his operative, who would be here any moment. Shortly later, they encountered an MSE-6 series repair droid, which informed them that their spy droid had been captured by the Ranc gang. When Muva asked who the Rancs were, Dameron replied that it was better to fall off the sliver than to deal with the Rancs.

After helping Poe to his feet, Oddy told Poe that the Rancs had been trying to sell their spy droid but that C-3PO's spies were looking for it. The spy droid turned out to be the BX-series droid commando N1-ZX (\"Nunzix\"), who complains that they took too long. However, their rescue mission was complicated by the fact that Nunzix has a self-preservation programming that caused him to refuse to disclose the data until he had been safely returned to the Resistance base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before they could return to their freighter, Muva spotted Terex's ship Carrion Spike flying through the skies of Kaddak. \"Lord\" Terex, who had taken back control of the Ranc gang, ordered the people of Kaddak to capture Dameron.

Muva claimed to be a technician who had accidentally stowed but Zumgi pointed out that he had a blaster. Zumgi sliced his blaster with a vibroblade but Muva kicked him in the abdomen.

Muva vowed to exact revenge against Terex and ordered Zumgi to contact his master. However, Zumgi responded that Terex would beat those who tried to attack him and revealed that Terex had already disembarked in order to pursue Dameron and the droids.
