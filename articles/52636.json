As the atmosphere of their homeworld of Gand was composed of ammonia, they were required to wear respirators over their mouths in order to breath in oxygen-rich environments.

Portrayed by actress Catherine Monroe, the character's features were designed by Ralph McQuarrie and John Mollo, and the mask was crafted by Stuart Freeborn. The compound eyes of the mask were constructed with bubble wrap packing material, while the costume itself consisted of the full-head mask and attached cylinders that were filled with colored water, and the actress was instructed to blow air into the cylinders in order to create bubbles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zuckuss's species was first identified as Gand in Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back, a 1989 Star Wars Legends supplement written by Michael Stern for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
