Darth Vader then told him to make sure that Luke made it into the carbonite freezing chamber, where he would be frozen and delivered to Emperor Palpatine. In an effort to direct Skywalker to Vader, Bewil controlled Cloud City's lift tubes and hatchways. Bewil cut off Skywalker's pursuit of Lieutenant Sheckil and his stormtroopers holding Princess Leia Organa hostage by closing a nearby blast door, along with other nearby doors, ultimately directing Skywalker to the waiting Vader. Presumably, he may have also been responsible for sealing the Core Tunnel after Skywalker exited it during the ensuing duel between the two to further direct him to Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bewil appeared in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, in which he was played by Milton Johns.
