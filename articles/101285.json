The inspection terms typically involve a hefty bribe or a \"present\" from the captain's private store of liquors or the like. Ulum would normally suggest what he called an \"inspection fee\" of 100 credits, but usually expected at least 200."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He would typically inspect all cargo himself, leaving the customs troopers to watch the crew of the inspected vessel.
