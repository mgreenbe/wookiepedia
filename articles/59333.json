In 35 ABY, during the Mission to Kijimi, Resistance members Finn, Rey and Poe Dameron landed the Bestoon Legacy in the hangar, using a First Order Captain's Medallion to get clearance. The team split up, with Finn and Dameron trying to rescue Chewbacca. Later, Kylo Ren confronted Rey in the hangar, asking her to be his ally. Rey refused and the team escaped by her jumping onto the Millennium Falcon, which Finn and Dameron were able to retrieve from a different hangar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
