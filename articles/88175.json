Even when the citizens were in a panic to flee the planet before its sun went supernova, Mazzoney's remained open as a den of decadence and corruption. Mazzoney himself tended the bar. The establishment had a reputation for being a place to find information. In case of trouble the cantina was staffed with Gamorrean bouncers. Mazzoney was known to engage in brawls himself, as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
