Brell set up a number of water purification and waste disposal plants on Taris, intending to turn the waste from Taris's numerous factories into alternative fuel sources and to minimize the city-world's waste. However, when the planet was bombarded by the Sith Lord Darth Malak, many of the world's factories and plants were destroyed and spilled toxic waste across the surface. Hundreds of years later, the area around the Taris ChemWorks Factory had become known as the Brell Sediment, and an acid lake in the area had been named Lake Brell after the environmentalist, as a persistent legend stated that the lake had been formed by the waste from one of Brell's own factories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ark Brell was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the Brell Sediment in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011; the entry did not specify Brell's species or whether he perished in Malak's attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
