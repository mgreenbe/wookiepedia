The Security Division was responsible for all peacekeeping activities within the Corporate Sector, and their personnel was drawn from corporate investigators, planetary rangers, skip tracers, civilian defense advisors, and retired Imperial Security Bureau personnel. Subdivisions within the Security Division included Locational Enforcement, which was responsible for the physical security of facilities within the Corporate Sector; Situational Enforcement, which analyzed crime patterns throughout the Corporate Sector; Ground Forces, which provided law enforcement throughout the Sector; the Picket Fleet, the naval arm of the Security Division; and the Detention Taskforce, charged with providing correctional facilities for the Sector's criminals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Security Division maintained a large fleet but of relatively outdated vessels to patrol their territory. Most of the fleet consisted of first-generation Victory-I-class Star Destroyers, Invincible-class Dreadnaughts, secondhand Recusant-class light destroyers and Marauder-class corvettes. The Authority IRD was one of the numerous types of starfighters used by the Security Division, as was the former CIS Mankvim-814 light interceptor. The CSA began purchasing large amounts of Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers as soon as they were developed. At some point prior to the Battle of Yavin, the CSA military sold a number of its older Marauder-class corvettes to the fledgling Alliance to Restore the Republic.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
