LeisureMech risked their entire enterprise on the success of the line, but the Human replica droids were a commercial failure and as a result, the company went under. LeisureMech sold off their remaining stock and the Toprawan resistance leader Degan Cor acquired two non-functional BB-4000 droids at a lower price. The droid were taken to be stored within the resistance base Mountain Home on Toprawa and the Rodian mech-tech Geri later repaired one of the units, so that it could house the droid brain of the protocol droid I-5YQ."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
