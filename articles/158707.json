It was very useful in close-quarters combat since it had a wide blast cone. It could fire 5 shots before the power pack needed to be replaced. This weapon was favored by outlaws such as bounty hunters and smugglers who might find themselves trapped within a confined environment, such as in urban environments or aboard starships. Unlike a normal, single-fire blaster, the pulse rifle dealt a cone of energy damage, striking multiple targets within a 9-meter area. It was considered illegal to own this weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
