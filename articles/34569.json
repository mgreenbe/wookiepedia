Near the end of the war in 3653 BBY, Azamin's fellow Councilor Darth Vowrawn and the Sith Lord Darth Decimus arranged for a strike team of Jedi to infiltrate Azamin's stronghold and assassinate the Dark Councilor. The Jedi were successful in their attempt, though they were killed when Decimus arranged the explosion of their escape craft. Azamin's death allowed Decimus to ascend to the Dark Council, and the Sith Lord took over the Sphere of Military Strategy for the remainder of the Great Galactic War and the subsequent Cold War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Azamin was first mentioned in the Codex entry for Darth Decimus in the 2011 BioWare massively multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, and the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia revealed Darth Vowrawn's role in Azamin's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
