A swampy boneyard near the Western Sea, it was where the Yuuzhan Vong's biots went to die, and where young Warriors were trained. When followers of the Jeedai heresy rescued three hundred prisoners at the Place of Sacrifice, Shimrra Jamaane, the Supreme Overlord of the Yuuzhan Vong, ordered three thousand Shamed Ones executed at the Place of Bones, whether they were heretics or not.
