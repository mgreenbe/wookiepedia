During the fall, the leaves would fall to the ground and looked like giant rafts. A mist would shroud the forest which would reduce visibility. While difficult to navigate, the area was said to be beautiful from above, where it had the appearance of a huge field of glass shards caressed by a soft, diffusing mist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The forest was home to many ghost spiders, which made traveling through it dangerous because of the many webs woven between the trees."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The place was rumored to be a nexus for the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
