The breeders usually were healthy Humans (or Near-Humans), while aliens were most often turned into mere \"labor units\". Malelings were usually contained behind proximity shields. Breeders were generally killed after mating, though it was not always the case."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The more benevolent Witches of Dathomir would only refer to men in non-derogatory yet pragmatic terms such as \"males\" or \"mates\". They still considered them their servants and viewed them as property. For example, if a witch from a rival clan stole a male slave to take as a husband, it was considered unseemly for the man's initial owner to try and recover him. Male servants, however, could win their freedom by saving the life of a clan sister. \"Male witches\" or \"male spellcasters\" were considered a great prize."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 31 BBY, the Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos, a Kiffar, was captured by a group of Nightsisters.
