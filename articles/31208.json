Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's personal medical staff saw her as a genius, so he had them try to force her onto his staff. Due to this, and other corruption in the Republic, she defected to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and took her assistants with her. The Separatists stationed her and her staff on a space station in the Salvara system of the Mid Rim, where they worked on cyborg and droid technology for the war effort. When the Clone wars came to a close, she was rescued from incoming Imperial forces by her friend, Captain Rel Harsol and the Sa Nalaor, until they crashed on the Outer Rim world of Cholganna. She was among the survivors of the crash, and spent her time on Cholganna continuing her research."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
