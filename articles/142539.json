After a brief stint as a farm droid, he was repossessed by the Empire and assigned to a gloomy, remote outpost. One day, 264 learns that a Rebel prisoner has been brought in at the outpost. When he realizes it is Sabine Wren, one of the Spectres, the droid decides to free her from her cell, hoping for a chance to reunite with the whole crew when they come for her. The rescue mission goes without a hitch until the Spectres' ship, the Ghost, gets caught in a tractor beam preventing it from leaving the outpost's hangar. When he understands that he can either stay with the Spectres aboard the Ghost or run to the other side of the hangar to deactivate the beam, 264 is faced with a dilemma, but he ends up sacrificing his chance at friendship so the Rebels can escape. Incensed, the outpost's commander orders his stormtroopers to throw the courier outside, where he is left to freeze on a junk heap."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars Rebels Magazin #25: Die Ballade von 264 on Jedi-Bibliothek.de"}]}
