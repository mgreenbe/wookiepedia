It was in this bar that Captain Scarlet Bloodhawk met many beings, including Kelly Vermillion, Tyric, Nana, Red, Justice and Truth. While he was talking to Kelly and his gang, a thug known as Kronus entered the bar with his goons and proceeded to cause a brawl. During the fight he was killed in the explosion from a thermal detonator, dropped by one of his dead dupes, of whom all were killed. Maizie's wasn't clean for weeks afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
