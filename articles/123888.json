His vessel and two other Star Destroyers under the commands of Captain Conro and Commodore Idel respectively, were sent to the Castell system in order to prevent the escape of Galactic Emperor Palpatine's personal pleasure yacht Imperialis, which had been stolen from Imperial Orbital Shipyard CC-24 by the smuggler Lando Calrissian and his team of thieves. Upon entering the star system, Idel informed the two captains of their mission via hologram, and then destroyed Orbital Shipyard CC-24 to make an example of those who lost the Emperor's property. The Commodore then ordered Shan and Conro to stand by while he dealt with Calrissian and his companions, releasing a pair of gravity mines designed to stick to the hull of the Imperialis and prevent it from jumping out of the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The yacht's defense system destroyed the two mines before they could attach to it, prompting Idel to offer a million credits to the man that captured the Imperialis. Eager to claim the reward, Shan activated his Star Destroyer's tractor beam in order to pull in the yacht. The beam successfully locked onto the Imperialis, but Calrissian had piloted the vessel to lie directly between Shan and Conro's Star Destroyers. Conro had also activated his tractor beam to capture Calrissian, and the two Star Destroyer's tractor beams locked onto each other. Realizing what had happened, Shan screamed for his vessel to disengage but was too late, and the two Star Destroyers crashed into one another as the Imperialis escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shan was a fair-skinned human with brown hair.
