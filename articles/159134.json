It was located in a mountainous region a short distance northeast of Corellia's city of Doaba Guerfel. Decoration in the house included a throw pillow from Kuat and a Corellian corvette hologram. A shelf contained two mementos, including a hand-crafted Jawa idol from Tatooine and a rare, yet broken sculpture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, a group of hikers disappeared in the mountains, near that house. Arned was later interrogated by a spacer working for Commander Talte of the Corellian Security Force. The hermit was compliant and gave permission to search the place. The spacer discovered that some items in the house were tied to several kidnappings. Arned confessed that he bought most of these items from a traveling craftsman. He also explained that he found one of the art pieces in the mountains nearby just one day before. The spacer therefore went to investigate these statements. The spacer eventually discovered that the hikers were captured by the criminals known as the cave-dwellers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A valley home was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
