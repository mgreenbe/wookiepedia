Abbreviated as the UAE Orders, they were still in force at the time of the Clone Wars despite the fact that most officers regarded them as out-of-date bureaucratic burdens. Due to significant support within the Galactic Senate, they were difficult to revoke. They remained current into the early days of the Galactic Empire; however, by that time, word was circulating around the fleet that Palpatine was promising that the UAE Orders would be stricken from the books soon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
