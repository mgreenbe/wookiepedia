During his time with the SaberCats, Leonis also befriended the team's kicker Merei Spanjaf, a teenage Corulag girl who became his girlfriend and the team's fullback Beck Ollet, a Lothal human boy who was the son of jogan fruit farmers. While Leonis excelled in grav-ball, he found agricultural science boring and loathed his Current Events class. His Current Events teacher Tralls used the class as a platform to disseminate Imperial propaganda.

Dhara quickly worked out that Leonis had a crush on Spanjaf. The following day, Leonis met up with his friends Merei and Ollet after his Crop Management class. Spanjaf used her computer hacking skills to locate Ollet's old farmstead, only to discover that the Imperial authorities had classified the area for some unspecified excavation project.

When Leonis expressed concerns about the effect of the Empire's industrialization policies on ordinary people, his parents conceded that some things had to be sacrificed for the well-being of the galaxy.

When Leonis defended Hench, Fhurek lectured the youth that a leader could not allow his affection for his players to blind him to their shortcomings.

When Imperial stormtroopers arrived, Ollet told the authorities that the insurgents had fled north; when in fact they had actually gone south. This gave Leonis a hint that his best friend was somehow connected to these insurgents.

While Leonis saw the attempted bombing of the surveyor droids as a protest action by frustrated farmers who had lost their lands and farms, his father regarded them as troublemakers. Leo acknowledged that the Empire made mistakes but that it had good intentions. Leonis's mother Tepha understood the farmers' grievances but accepted the Imperial line that protests and civil disobedience would only lead to violence and anarchy.

Leonis noticed a profound change in Bunkle's character; the youth had abandoned his name in favor of his operating number DX-578 and took a humorless view of life.

Citing the lack of any league rule banning non-human players, Leonis refused to comply with Fhurek's wishes and kept the two non-humans on his team. Leonis related the incident to his parents who, while sympathetic to Leonis, advised their son not to antagonize Fhurek since that could jeopardize his plans to join the Imperial Academy. During the tournament, Leonis led the SaberCats to victory over the rival Forked River Mavericks by thirty-two points; which qualified his team to compete in the league championship. In retaliation for Leonis's insubordination, Fhurek transferred Kelio and Sina to the Technical Institute for Agricultural Research, a less reputable institution than AppSci."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That winter, Leonis's dissatisfaction with the Empire heightened after his friend Ollet revealed that the Empire had begun strip-mining several outlying former farms and orchards. The Imperials utilized giant construction droids which created extensive pollution. This incident greatly disturbed Leonis and forced him to question his long-cherished view that his beloved Empire would never do anything wrong. During a home visit by his sister Dhara, Leonis related his concerns about the Empire's policies to his big sister. In response, Dhara defended the Empire by arguing that the best way to reform the Empire was to work from within and that the status quo was preferable to the chaos of the Clone Wars.

Leonis's act of defiance only angered Fhurek, who sought every opportunity to make life difficult for Leonis.

Despite the peaceful nature of the protest, the Imperials deployed stormtroopers and AT-DP walkers. When the farmers refused an order to disperse, the commanding officer, Lieutenant Roddance, gave the order to open fire.

Leonis nevertheless suspected that the Imperials had covered the true reason for his sister's disappearance.

Later, Leonis punched the athletic director Fuhrek in the eye after the latter taunted him with the remark that disloyalty ran through the Leonis family.

According to Ollet's parents, their son was spending the holidays riding jumpspeeders around Lothal with his cousins prior to starting work as a harvest supervisor. In reality, Ollet had joined an underground anti-Imperial resistance group in Lothal.

The following day, Leonis and Spanjaf received a message from Ollet to meet him at his old school's grav-ball grid. During their meeting, Ollet revealed that the Imperials had traced his landspeeder.

The two resubmitted his application to the Imperial Academy which was promptly accepted. During a visit to the market, Leonis witnessed Imperial stormtroopers raiding a shop and arresting three suspected insurgents, including his classmate Ollet. One of the stormtroopers participating in the raid was his sister's friend Ames Bunkle, who was now only known as DX-578.

Regarding the tactical issue, he suggested that he simply needed to learn to select targets better. She noted his leadership qualities and asked if serving as a stormtrooper would be beneath him, but he replied that he just wanted to do his part. She then moved on to the issue of his sister, stating that she had abandoned her Academy training. Hiding his true reasons for joining the Academy, Leonis merely asked if there had been any news about her because he and his family were worried. She asked him if he ever dreamed about her.

However, another Imperial officer named Lieutenant Chiron intervened. After punishing Oleg, Chiron led Leonis to his office. While Chiron disagreed with Currahee's harsh training methods, he stressed that she wanted to create capable cadets who were willing to succeed at all costs. Chiron understood that Symes wanted to live up to his expectations but conceded that the Empire did not tolerate weakness.

During the training exercise, Leonis did his best to keep Unit Aurek together and to protect Symes.

Following the exercise, he related his experience to his mentor, Chiron, who commended him for his leadership, initiative, and improvisation. Despite getting \"killed,\" Chiron pointed out that Leonis had secured the objective of the exercise. When he asked about Symes, Chiron revealed that the cadet had voluntarily withdrawn from the Imperial Academy.

Aresko and Grint had been executed by the Inquisitor for their failures and Roddance was now ruling the academy. Though Roddance was not unhappy to see Chiron gone, he had actually been transferred there by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who wished for him to investigate Commandant Hux and a secret society. This, of course, was something Leonis knew about, but he was ill at ease about the idea of revealing everything all at once. He knew that getting into society might be his only chance to find his sister. He asked for a day or two, which Chiron gave him. He then asked Chiron if anyone had come with him, mentioning that the Inquisitor had visited recently. Chiron shocked Leonis by revealing that the Inquisitor was dead, killed by a group of insurgents that had been troubling the Empire's operations on Lothal. Leonis felt a great, but short-lived relief. Though it was true the Inquisitor was dead, the Empire had other servants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That night, Leonis was woken by the Commandant's Cadets and summoned the academy's banquet hall. There, le Hivre told him that his initiation task would happen during field maneuvers three days from then.

At breakfast the next morning, Leonis responded with shrugs and monosyllables when talking with Zarang. He wondered what he could do, feeling his task monstrous, but knowing he needed to join the Commandant's Cadets to rescue his sister.

Chiron was just as disgusted as Leonis was and said that this would stop now. Both, however, were stymied by the fact that they needed more information in order to be able to prove their claims. Leonis insisted that there was no way he could go through with the deed, but Chiron had an idea as to how it could be done without anyone dying, so long as Zarang trusted Leonis, which he did. Leonis was to bring Zarang to the diplopod pen two hours after lights out. Deedee would be placed on a special assignment, to prevent him from being caught. That evening, Leonis roused Zarang from the bed, warning him not to make a sound if he wanted to live. They arrived at the diplopod pen, Leonis explained the situation. Zarang was shocked, wondering why he would be chosen to be killed when other cadets had lower marks than him. Chiron had brought a bag with a side of nerf, which would be buried as a stand-in for Zarang's body as he was on a transport to somewhere else. Zarang was upset, not wanting to leave the Empire, but Chiron promised that he would raise his case with Governor Tarkin if necessary. Zarang looked to Leonis for confirmation, and Leonis told him that he could trust Chiron. When Zarang still hesitated, Leonis reminded him that it would have been a lot easier to kill him. Zarang reluctantly agreed to the plan, taking a shovel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, it was quickly noticed that Zarang was missing. Leonis was soon approached by le Hivre, who told him that he was finished for warning Zarang. Leonis, however, replied that this was hardly the case; he had killed him.

He told Leonis to dig him up and show him, but Leonis replied that he had already done the dirty work. le Hivre could do it himself if he wanted to do so, but it would not be pleasant, because things decayed fast. le Hivre and Razar dug for several minutes, eventually hitting something, a cadet's jacket. Tired, Razar gave up, but le Hivre suggested they could get a construction droid to find out for sure. Razar said that he could do what he wanted, but the class was starting soon and she did not want to get a demerit for being late.

Putting on his black dress uniform, he made his way to dinner, where Hux announced that with the addition of Leonis, their ranks were completed. They had proved themselves exemplary servants of the Empire and it was time for them to learn the group's ultimate purpose. He explained that prior to becoming a servant of the Empire himself, he had served as a junior officer in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, communicating tactics and strategy as determined by Jedi Generals. He felt that there was something they could learn from their defeated enemies. The Republic's clone troopers were effective not simply because they had been trained for battle, but bred for it. However, due to being genetically identical, they were susceptible to biological agents and pathogens, something that the Separatists had often tried to take advantage of. Hux's plan was to train nonclone soldiers from birth, similar to the way the Jedi trained their Padawans. The cadets cheered as Hux explained that they were to work alongside him to execute his plan, to create legions that would ensure the Empire would live forever.

They prepared to enter the Commandant's Cadets ceremonial room, but first had to wait for another group to exit. A group of boys and girls in orange jumpsuits exited the room. Hux explained that this was Project Unity; former dissenters who had come back to the Empire. Leonis observed the glassy-eyed, blank-looking individuals, wondering if they had been brainwashed or drugged. Then, to Leonis's shock, one of the individuals began marching toward him.

He was sure that had he been asked, he would have said anything to make the interrogator droid stop what it was doing to him. After this, he was thrust into a military tribunal.

Leonis pleaded guilty on all counts. When asked if he had anything to say in his defense, he replied that he had always wanted to be a servant of the Empire, to make the galaxy a better place, until he saw it for what it really was. The Empire taught him lies at school, subjugated alien races, murdered innocent people to advance its propaganda, and kidnapped his sister. He stated defiantly that the Empire could not kill everyone like him, or it would be an Empire that ruled nothing, that was nothing. Julyan coldly asked him if that was all, then laid out his sentence. He was to first be expelled from Imperial service. At this, the Commandant's Cadets stepped forth and stripped him of his uniform.

Leonis asked if he remembered the time the Empire ruined his family's jogan fruit orchards, how they killed people who only wanted to talk. Ollet's response was that those people were being used by the Empire's enemies, part of the contagion of separatism. Realizing the conversation was pointless, he told Ollet to get out. Chiron then came back in, and Leonis told him he would rather die than become a Project Unity drone. Chiron's response was that there was only one thing left, to ask him what he wanted his last meal to be and who would bring it. Leonis quipped that he wanted a properly prepared nerf steak brought by a pirate captain with a fast ship for hire.

Leonis disagreed and uncovered the tray to reveal two jogan fruits. He handed one to Ollet, telling him to smell it, as it would remind him of home. Ollet did so, and the effect was almost immediate. \"They...they destroyed everything,\" recalled Ollet, \"And when people wanted it to stop they killed them.\" He apologized, explaining to Leonis that the Empire had done things to him. Leonis replied that it was not his fault. Ollet asked about Dhara and Leonis told him that she was alive somewhere in the tower. Ollet told him it was hard to think straight, but they should go get his sister. Leonis asked if he knew the layout of the tower, but he did not. Leonis found this unfortunate but said that they would fight their way to the roof and try to get a transport.

The two then raced to implement their plan. Leonis told Ollet to shoot out the cameras while he tried to find Dhara, but he was unable to navigate the academy's unfamiliar computer system and was then shut out entirely. With laser fire sounding everywhere, it seemed as if all might be lost, until Leonis heard a familiar voice. It was his girlfriend, Merei Spanjaf.

Merei Spanjaf would slice into the computer there to find Dhara, while \"Dev Morgan\" (\"Spectre-6\" / Ezra Bridger) would hold the roof. The group worked quickly. Spanjaf already knew that Dhara was in cell seventeen, but still had to get around a lockdown to open the cell. While she took care of this, the group covered the elevators and Ollet said the situation reminded him of grav-ball, wondering how many points they were losing by and how much time was left on the clock. Leonis reminded him that it was the final score that mattered. Spanjaf finished her work and Leonis rushed for the cell, discovering Dhara, just as expected. She was in bad shape.

It was a happy reunion, but both were still in danger. As they left the cell, they encountered a retreating Spanjaf and Ollet, who had been pinned down by stormtroopers. The other group was in trouble also and there were TIE fighters inbound. Beck Ollet decided that there was no choice but to make a sacrifice. He would carry a detonator given to them by Wren, using it to obliterate the stormtroopers, even though he would most likely die in the process. He told the two Leonises that Lothal needed them, that they would spark a fire that would turn the Empire to ash. He left, saying that it was possible he might get lucky.
