This was a very tough part of the arena and many individuals lost their lives here. Contestants were required to tilt their vehicles to the side so that they would be thin enough to make it through the dangerously narrow formation. This section of the track was called Devil's Doorknob because one was required to turn their racer, just as one may turn a door-handle. It was the opening dividing the The Corkscrew from the Hutt Flats."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
