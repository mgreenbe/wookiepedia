When used in a lightsaber, the crystals formed an extremely wide blade that was more efficient at blocking blaster bolts. So rare as to be thought mere myths by some by the time the Galactic Empire was in power, these crystals usually found their way into the hands of people highly attuned to the light side of the Force. These crystals made for powerful but demanding blades; if a wielder's connection to the Force became too muddied by inner conflict, the crystal would not perform as well for them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
