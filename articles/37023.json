The shop was run by the Sullustan mechanic Jilaa San, who was competent at her work but lacked organizational skills,often taking on more work when she already had plenty. This resulted in her working slowly and often completing tasks far over the deadlines she promised for customers. This meant many customers had to constantly remind her of the work they needed doing, or accept half-repaired droids back from San. The small, poorly-lit interior of the shop was usually filled with half-repaired droids, shelves and boxes full of spare parts, and the sounds of those droids still active."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after a message pod was discovered near the Wheel an R2-series astromech droid unit left the Dented Droid, causing a spacer to dodge out of the way to avoid knocking it over while they attempted to rescue IT-3PO, a droid stolen by the crew of the YT-2400 light freighter Nightflyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dented Droid first appeared in 2013 in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
