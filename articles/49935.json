A dark side ability, Force shadow was used by the Force Hounds of the Infinite Empire to scout planets and distant areas, and the shadow was typically invisible to everyone. However, Force Hounds were capable of seeing a shadow, and four Je'daii\u2014Daegen Lok and the three Je'daii Journeyers Shae Koda, Sek'nos Rath, and Tasha Ryo\u2014detected Xesh's shadow when he cast it across the Tython system. The four of them perceived Xesh's shadow as a Force vision, not knowing of the Force Hound's ability. Xesh later utilized the ability to locate Predor Skal'nas's base on Ska Gora, when he himself was on Shikaakwa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
