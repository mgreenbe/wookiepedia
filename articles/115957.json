Controlled by the Galactic Republic, it was captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. This resulted in the Battle of Ringo Vinda, a Republic campaign launched in the year 19 BBY in a bid to retake the station from the Separatists. After the war, it was converted into a construction facility by the Galactic Empire to churn out Imperial-class Star Destroyers for the Imperial Navy, and rebel agents reported to General Airen Cracken about the industrial status of the station. The station had a command center and a communications center during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ringo Vinda space station first appeared in \"The Unknown,\" the first episode of the canon animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' sixth season, which originally aired in Germany on February 15, 2014.
