They were meant to provide a quick way up to the roof in the event of a flash flood. Storm ladders were made of jointed chains that remained bundled together until use. A button push would prompt the ladder's activation by releasing it from it's mooring. Around 4 ABY, Temmin Wexley, Jas Emari, and Sinjir Rath Velus attempted to use a storm ladder to escape an Imperial patrol, but failed when the mechanism broke off the roof."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
