Its primary objective was to retrieve the Jedi trainee Uldir Lochett\u2014who had joined Mage Orloc since he believed that the Mage would be able to awaken the Force powers within him and access the Galactic Republic Jedi Master Asli Krimsan's holocron;tasks which nobody at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 had been able to do so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Uldir then stole Ikrit's ship Sunrider and the two Jedi artifacts recovered during the previous adventure at Bast Castle on Vjun\u2014 Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber and the holocron of the ancient Jedi Master Asli Krimsan. Having arrived at the derelict space city, Uldir found Orloc whom took the youth as his student. The Mage had already set up his base on the moon and planned to create his own Jedi Order. In reality, Orloc had no Force powers but had actually used high-tech gimmicks to deceive others with demonstrations of so called \"Force power.\" Uldir did not realize it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New Jedi Order historian Tionne, Master Ikrit, the droid R2-D2 and Jedi trainees Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila set out to find Uldir on their transport Jemlaat-class yacht. Having arrived at the ancient Exis Station, they tried to convince Uldir that he had been deceived by Mage Orloc. The Mage attacked the four Jedi with his high-tech gimmicks and his Ranat mercenaries and servant droids. However, the Jedi fought back by using the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the duel, Tionne was wounded and Ikrit\u2014who had sworn not to wield a lightsaber until he had found worthy students\u2014made his decision and joined Anakin and Tahiri in their fight. Uldir then saw that Orloc was little more than a charlatan who used technological gimmiks to deceive others with demonstrations of power. Together, the Jedi defeated Orloc who disappeared and was never heard of again. Successful in their mission, the Jedi returned to the Praxeum with a triumphant Lochett and the two recovered Jedi artifacts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Background"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Earlier, a Jedi mission to Bast Castle on the remote Outer Rim world of Vjun led by Jedi historian Tionne had recovered two Jedi artifacts\u2014the lightsaber of the Clone Wars-era Jedi Knight and Jedi Purge survivor Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, during the mission, the Jedi had encountered a \"Mage\" Orloc\u2014a former Imperial Intelligence agent and false Prophet of the Dark Side who had survived a massacre by Grand Admiral Afsheen Makati. Claiming to have Force powers, the Mage sparred with the Jedi team before disappearing into a trap doorThe Jedi team then returned to the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Tionne and her team returned to the Jedi Praxeum with Kenobi's blade and Krimsan's holocron, Luke Skywalker welcomed her back, but he soon had to leave on another mission to investigate the whereabouts of the Jedi expedition Outbound Flight which was rumored to have ended up in the Unknown Regions. While waiting for Skywalker to return, Tionne decided to reward Anakin Solo, Tahiri Veila, and Uldir Lochett for helping her retrieve the holocron by letting them watch while she began to explore its secrets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Activating the device, Tionne asked the gatekeeper to speak about herself. The gatekeeper told the Jedi about Asli Krimsan and the purpose the holocron had been constructed for. In doing so, she mentioned the Jedi library on Exis Station, which Tionne then asked about, and the device projected a hologram of what the ancient library used to look like. Lochett mentioned that the Mage Orloc was from Exis Station. Tionne was surprised and put down the holocron to question Lochett, deciding not to access Krimsan's holocron again until Skywalker returned, since the gatekeeper had mentioned that it was intended for the use of Jedi Masters. Instead, she placed both the holocron and Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber in Skywalker's quarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lochett, who wished to become a Jedi but was not Force-sensitive, thought Krimsan's holocron could help him in his quest. During the night, he crept into Skywalker's empty quarters and tried to access the holocron. Unable to do so, he decided to steal both Jedi artifacts and go to Exis Station to see if the mysterious Orloc could teach him how to use the Force. To reach Exis Station, Lochett stole the Sunrider, a ship belonging to Jedi Master Ikrit. In the morning, his friends discovered that he and the Sunrider were missing. While they immediately suspected he had gone to Exis Station, the Jedi spent the rest of the day searching the grounds of the Praxeum for him. When Lochett did not turn up, Tionne, Ikrit, Solo, Veila, and R2-D2 traveled to Exis Station on Tionne's vessel, the Lore Seeker, to retrieve him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Confrontation at Exis Station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As soon as Uldir Lochett arrived on Exis Station, he was captured by Ranats working for Orloc. They threw a sack over his head, injected him with a drug to render him unconscious, and carried him further into the station. The Ranats brought him to Orloc, who questioned him. Lochett then offered Orloc Krimsan's holocron and Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber in exchange for teaching him magic. The Mage suspected a trap by the Jedi, but accepted Lochett as his student. When Orloc was given Krimsan's holocron in return, he unsuccessfully attempted to activate it. To disguise his failure, he claimed to Lochett that his own powers were far greater than the teachings of the Jedi. He told Lochett to concentrate on light, and the lights on the station dimmed. Encouraged by his apparent success, Lochett eagerly sought further instruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, Lochett's friends arrived on the station to rescue him and retrieve the stolen Jedi artifacts. Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila observed Lochett training with Orloc from an air duct grating high above the Mage and his pupil. However, their combined weight caused the pair to fall from the ceiling into the midst of Orloc and his Ranat and droid servants. Tionne and Ikrit jumped down from the ceiling to follow the children and telekinetically confiscated Krimsan's holocron and Kenobi's lightsaber. Furious, Orloc set his minions on the Jedi team, and the Jedi fled with the artifacts through a series of corridors into Orloc's control room. Orloc's forces engaged them there, and the Mage used his technological devices to unleash driving wind, steam jets, holographic enemies, and other hazards on the Jedi. During the fight, the Jedi lost possession of Krimsan's holocron while Tionne was wounded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Solo, Veila and R2-D2 fighting alone against Orloc's Ranat henchmen, droids and gimmicks, Ikrit\u2014who had sworn not to wield a lightsaber until he had found worthy students\u2014made his decision and entered the fight. Seeing true Jedi in action, Lochett joined the fight on the side of the Jedi and retrieved Krimsan's holocron from the floor. He tossed it to Veila, and it activated at her touch. The holocron projected an image of Asli Krimsan that filled the entire room. This helped Anakin Solo see past Orloc's holograms to reach the Mage. Solo then destroyed the devices on Orloc's costume that controlled most of his mechanical wonders. Using his last trick, Orloc produced a puff of smoke to distract the Jedi and escape. Krimsan's holocron and Kenobi's lightsaber where returned to the Jedi Praxeum, where the latter was later studied in depth by Tionne while the former's design was utilized by future Jedi apprentices including Anakin Solo and his older sister Jaina Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
