She was unusually independent for a Selonian and was considered odd by her sept. She felt most comfortable among her small warrior band or in solitude under the mountains. A deadly combatant, she killed without hesitation anyone she determined to be a threat to Kurtuln Den. She led a band of twelve battle-hardened Selonian females, who patrolled the Spine above and below. She knew the Kystes' Spine intimately and was known to concoct elaborate ambushes after following and secretly observing an enemy for days. She was an expert with blasters and the Selonian glaive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
