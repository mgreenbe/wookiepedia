This X-Wing replaced the astromech R2 unit with additional computer power, providing more maneuverability and increased in-flight options for the pilot. The New Republic began replacing its old, aging T-65As with the T-65D-A1, until Cole Fardreamer discovered that their new shipboard computers were rigged with Imperial detonation devices. The computers had been built under the direction of Dolph, who planned to detonate them from Almania at a specified time. Cole found the detonators while repairing Luke Skywalker's old X-wing, which was being refitted with the new computers. He showed the detonators to Wedge Antilles, who had originally ordered the newer X-wings to replace the old ones. Wedge began recalling the newer ships before they could explode, and new computer systems were ordered to replace the rigged ones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The T-65D-A1 was an updated version of the T-65 X-wing starfighter. This new model was equipped with an improved computer system that did not require the use of an astromech droid. As a consequence, the starfighter was not outfitted with a droid socket. The pilot had access to the computer from the cockpit which gave him the possibility to customize the fighter's systems in combat situations and during flights."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The T-65D-A1 was introduced seventeen years after the Battle of Yavin.
