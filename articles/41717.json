Should this person sell the goods to a different individual, then the new owner would be also buying the remainder of the debt \u2014 something that the seller could say to the buyer if an honest deal was made. Should the original debtor die before the payment was ended, then the debtor's inheritors would inherit both the goods and the remainder of the debt; if there were no inheritors, the goods might be sold.
