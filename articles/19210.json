Finn incorrectly suspected that Boolio would not have risked his life only to confirm the return of Palpatine, but as the Ovisian had not been able to decrypt the datafile, he had risked it without knowing the contents of the file at all.

It was decided that holding the head by the hair was too brutal, so curved horns were picked as the final solution. During sculpting, the horns were moved around so that it could be swung down and smack onto a table. Where the decapitation cut was be made, the angle and placement of the horns and the width of Boolio's jaw were also all thought about in terms of what would be needed for the shot of the head. Scanlan demoed the head for producer Kathleen Kennedy, director J.J. Abrams and actor Adam Driver."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A number of pieces of concept art of Boolio were created by creature concept designer Jake Lunt Davies, including a piece titled \"Alien Pilot 01\" that depicted Boolio as a red-skinned alien with a number of head tentacles that Ren could hold rather than horns.
