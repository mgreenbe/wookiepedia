It was a forest planet, and was home to massive trees, some as tall as 400 meters. The atmosphere was high in oxygen, so offworlders tended to become dizzy at first, particularly when they exerted themselves. However, they did not get as winded as they normally would. The high oxygen content also helped create the spectacular weather for which Yelsain was famous, with immense thunderstorms practically a nightly affair. The animals which inhabited Yelsain were large, averaging twice the size of a Human, and the carnivores were dangerous. The two most dangerous creatures were the trogliths and the garaths."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Period, the population suffered systematic denial of basic rights."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
