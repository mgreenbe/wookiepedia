She survived the mission, and was made an official Jedi Knight in a ceremony on Mon Calamari some four years into the conflict. Thereafter, she was part of the team that went to search for the living planet Zonama Sekot. During that journey, it was Tekli's healing abilities that helped save Admiral Pellaeon's life following the Battle of Bastion. During her trip on Luke Skywalker's task force to find Zonama Sekot, Tekli developed an ability which allowed her to read someone's life signs through the Force, enhancing both her healing prowess and her abilities as a Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, Tekli was one of many Jedi who defended the world from the Yuuzhan Vong Warmaster Nas Choka and the Alpha Red bioweapon.

This summoning led them to aid a species known as Killiks who had found themselves embroiled in a border dispute with the Chiss Ascendancy. In addition, prolonged exposure to the Killik's caused one to become a Joiner, as it did to the former members of the strike team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Luke Skywalker and company found the group, they were tested by Cilghal in the Jedi Academy on Ossus to determine what was causing the Jedi Knights to act as Joiners. Tekli later attended the Conclave on Ossus where she decided to stay a Jedi. Tekli, Tesar Sebatyne and Lowbacca were Joiners much like Zekk and Jaina Solo, but not to the extent that they could read each others thoughts and feel the others emotions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She along with Tesar Sebatyne and Lowbacca were exiled to Dagobah to meditate on their actions regarding Raynar Thul, who at the time was known as UnuThul and still thought dead by his mother, Aryn Dro Thul. They overheard the Masters discussing battle tactics, one of those being assassinating Raynar. Upon discovering that Aryn Thul possessed the only droid left that could fix R2-D2, they went to inform her of both her son's survival and the assassination plan.\nWhen Grand Master Luke Skywalker and his wife, Jedi Master Mara Jade Skywalker, went to to buy the droid that would fix Artoo, they were both shocked and outraged that any Jedi would divluge such information. However, the two kept their calm, and Aryn Dro Thul agreed to give them the droid if they promised to do everything within their power not to kill her son. It is unknown how long the three were made to stay on the planet, but the were back in time to help finish the three way war between the Killiks, Chiss, and Galactic Alliance. Later, she was on board the Megador with her former Master during the attack on the Dark Nest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike Zekk and Jaina Solo, Tekli was only partially affected by her exposure to the Killiks, and while she sympathized with their cause, she did not come into conflict with the Masters' Council to the extent they did."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Political tensions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 43.5 ABY, the relationship of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Alliance reached a breaking point.

In this capacity, she helped to alert the group to Seff Hellin's plan to free Valin Horn from prison. This led to the Darkmeld members capturing him and beginning the process of studying the strange Force disease that plagued him, in the hopes of discovering a cure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the apprehension of Natua Wan at the Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition by the Solos and fellow Jedi Knight Radd Minker, a report by Javis Tyrr revealed that the New Jedi Order had secretly been keeping Seff Hellin locked up in the lower levels of the Jedi Temple. Infuriated, Daala issued a series of demands to acting Grand Master Kenth Hamner, who had no knowledge of Hellin's presence inside the Temple. As part of the deal struck between Daala and Hamner, the Jedi conspirators of Darkmeld were unveiled and punished, including Tekli, who was forced to give a live interview discussing her role in the incident."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after that, Tekli took a human male named Josat as her Padawan.
