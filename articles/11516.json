Like all R-series astromech droids BO-LT5 was built by Industrial Automaton, and like all other R5 units, the droid stood 0.96 meters tall. BO-LT5's body plating was red and white in color, while its head was colored brown. During the war, BO-TL5 was offered for sale by the vendor droid 80-T5, who worked selling a range of goods from a small stall within the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant. At the time it was offered for sale, the astromech's head was decorated with a depiction of a mouth full of teeth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "BO-LT5's first appeared as a purchasable companion for players in the MMORPG Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures released by Sony Online Entertainment in 2010.
