With its integrated shipyard facilities, a Cardan III was capable of building and repairing vessels as large as a Victory-class Star Destroyer. While featuring considerably less firepower than a Golan space defense platform of comparable size, this ability to repair and construct vessels made it a valuable asset to Imperial fleets far from the Core."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
