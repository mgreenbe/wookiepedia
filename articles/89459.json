That meteor-shaped craft was designed specifically so the droid partners C-3PO and R2-D2 could land on the Empire-affiliated planet of Kessel, where a grand meeting was about to take place. Upon completion of their mission, the droids would reboard the pod, which would then shed its meteor coating so it will look like a spherical probe droid similar to the ones used by the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
