The sword was modified from a common vibroblade of that era, enhancing its versatility and deadliness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a street urchin struggling to survive on the streets of the Taris Lower City, the Twi'lek adolescent Mission Vao was forced to adapt with what little resources she had. As a result, her personal weapon originated as a generic vibroblade of the design common to the Jedi Civil War era, with a lengthy extension of the guard to protect the ricasso. Though cheap, as with typical swords at the time, it was constructed with cortosis-weave to afford it protection against lightsaber contact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vao was an adaptable individual who applied her ingenuity to the customization of her sword, increasing its deadliness. Unlike other vibroblades, her vibroblade was designed for ease of modifications. The power cell could be readily swapped out for higher quality vibration cells and the cortosis blade could be further reinforced with a layer of durasteel. Moreover, a chamber allowed for the installation of an energy projector, which enhanced the sword with the ability to discharge mild plasma energy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While common vibroblades of the era bore golden crossguards and pommels, these sections were colored indigo on Mission's vibroblade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vibroblade was the product of the resourcefulness of the Twi'lek teenager Mission Vao, who grew up as an orphan in the perilous environment of the lower levels of Taris prior to 3956 BBY. The crime-infested Lower City was rife with crime and swoop gangs, and the violence that pervaded the area only escalated during the gang war between the Black Vulkars and the Hidden Beks, concurrent with the Jedi Civil War. This, alongside Vao's penchant for exploring the Undercity plagued by rakghouls, necessitated that she develop a proper weapon for her self-defense and survival. While poor, Vao was able to acquire a basic vibroblade and through materials scrounged from her adventures, crafted a unique sword that was more powerful than even the conventional vibroblades that the soldiers of the Galactic Republic employed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3956 BBY, during a misadventure in the Undercity where her best friend the Wookiee Zaalbar was captured by Gamorrean slavers, Vao encountered the Republic soldiers Revan and Carth Onasi on her way back to the Outcast village for help. When her two allies agreed to assist her, having sought her aid as well to infiltrate the Black Vulkar Base, Vao was carrying her signature vibroblade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the rescue of Zaalbar, Vao would continue to keep her sword by her side as she joined forces with her new friends in their quest for the Star Forge, a mission that would ultimately result in a decisive Republic victory against the Sith Empire in the Jedi Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mission's vibroblade is a weapon in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. It is obtained simultaneously with its owner, the character Mission Vao, when she joins the player's party upon stepping outside the Outcast village of the Undercity of Taris for the first time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mission's vibroblade is identical in appearance to the prototype vibroblade recovered by the player from the corpse of a heavy Sith trooper on the first level, the Endar Spire. Both have the same base stats and are upgradeable through the same items: a vibration cell, a cylinder of durasteel bonding alloy, and an energy projector. However, these item upgrades produce different effects for the two weapons, with Mission's vibroblade falling short of the prototype vibroblade in terms of attack modifiers and physical damage, but delivering mild energy damage instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
