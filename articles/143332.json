Eventually, word reaches the heroes that they have been summoned back to Alderaan by Bail Organa. Senator Organa has learned that Master Denia was taken to the planet Prakith, in the Deep Core, and that reaching her will be nearly impossible thanks to Imperial security along those hyperlanes.\nHowever, the heroes learn that Lady Alya Aldrete, an Alderaanian noble, might have the means of getting them to the Deep Core. Apparently, Lady Alya employs smugglers, and she has managed to obtain passage for them through the Deep Core. She is the guest of honor on the first run of a new high-speed repulsortrain leaving the city of Aldera for a six-hour trip. The heroes board the repulsortrain and try to get an audience with Lady Alya, with little success.\nThings turn sour quickly when a group of mercenaries attacks the repulsortrain. The heroes must deal with the mercenaries and protect the noblewoman to get the help they need. After the attackers are defeated, Lady Alya reveals that her connections in the Deep Core go quite deep, and she has been marshaling an entire fleet of smugglers and pirates right under the Empire's nose. She agrees to give the heroes the documentation they need to reach Prakith safely, and the heroes earn a new ally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
