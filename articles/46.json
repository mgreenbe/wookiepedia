The sandwich contained a poached gorg egg, Klatooine paddy frog sausage, and a slice of jerba cheese, all served on a pedunkee mufkin. At some point prior to its destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's reign, the eatery known as Dex's Diner on the planet Coruscant served the sandwiches with a breakfast side dish for 6.5 credits each. The Besalisk chef and owner of the diner, Dexter Jettster, considered the food to be delicious and described it as a \"punky muffin\" sandwich."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Hungry Hutt\" breakfast sandwiches were featured in the 2009 StarWars.com Hyperspace exclusive article, \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written by Gregory Walker in the form of an in-universe menu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
