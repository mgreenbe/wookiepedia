The D-93's source of fuel was the highly flammable gel known as conflagrine-14, which was stored within twin outer fuel tanks that would be attached to the trooper's back. The tank was equip with a propellant pressure indicator for a small central pressurized tank housing the propellant gas that could launch the flame up to a distance of 75 meters; or as long as local wind conditions would allow. Connecting the tank to the double-barreled D-93w flame projector gun was a double-chambered reinforced hose. Upon the press of the trigger, a piezoelectrical ignition system would ignite the conflagrine-14 gel at the barrelhead of the D-93w flame projector gun, from where a mixing of the propellant gas would allow the user to fire the weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
