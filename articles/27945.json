On the harsh desert planet Tatooine, with whipping sandstorms and dangerously high daytime temperatures, most individuals kept their skin covered with practical material designed to wick away sweat and limit exposure to harmful ultraviolet radiation from the planet's twin suns. The human inhabitants of Naboo valued culture and beauty, which was reflected in their graceful everyday attires made of natural material. On the remote desert planet Jakku, food and drinking water were expensive and clothes were not something to waste money upon. Instead, settlers and war refugees cobbled together clothes from recycled material they scavenged. The urban city planet Coruscant was home to a myriad of alien and humanoid species, and clothing was as diverse as the population. On Bespin's Cloud City, the environment was controlled, therefore people didn't have to worry about the weather and were free to dress accordingly."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Occasion wear"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Occasion wear was reserved for special occasions and offered people the chance to escape from their everyday routines. Nightclub wear was designed to grab attention on the dance floor or gambling tables. Metal fabrics and eye-catching colors and sheer were popular among nightclub patrons. Opera house wear was characterized by extravagant clothing such as luxurious cloaks, formfitting dresses, bold prints and elaborate headdresses. Funeral wear required understated, respectable attire: For Padm\u00e9 Amidala's funeral, the senator's family wore dark tones to reflect their sadness and mourning of her death. Jedi, on the other hand, did not value worldly possessions, nor did they fear death, and most Jedi attendees would wear their usual daily attire for a funeral. Bridal wear referred to clothing worn by a bride during a wedding ceremony. Padm\u00e9 Amidala wore a beautiful, one-of-a-kind, hand-sewn white wedding dress for her secret wedding, with a matching lace overdress which flowed out in a train behind her. Nightwear was clothing suitable for wearing in bed. Padm\u00e9 Amidala had an extensive wardrobe which included luxury nightwear with fine materials designed to help maintain a comfortable body temperature while sleeping, while robes provided extra warmth before bedtime."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Work clothing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Work clothing was reserved for work. Many Galactic Republic senators proudly wore the traditional garments of their people, which reflected the culture of their homeworld. Others used their status and significant budget to pay for lavish clothes and wore elaborate creations made by the most famous clothing designers on Coruscant, using the finest imported fabrics. Some senatorial aides would follow the lead of their senator, while others, like the Umbaran Sly Moore, preferred to create an intimidating presence with their attires. In keeping with their simple yet strict lifestyle, most members of the Jedi Order wore traditional, earth-toned robes which were warm, comfortable and allowed great freedom of movement. However, the Jedi Order also permitted their members to wear robes from their own homeworlds, as exemplified by Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Padawan Barriss Offee, who both wore outfits of Mirialan design. While in hiding, the Sith wore clothing that obscured their identity but were still designed to instill fear in others. Naboo handmaidens served their queen as advisers and bodyguards and wore matching outfits and hoods which concealed their identities, while billowing cloaks concealed weapons used to protect the queen in the event of an attack."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Royal outfits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Royal outfits were worn by the galaxy's monarchs and were rich with symbolic embellishments. Monarch gowns worn by the queens of Naboo typically featured luxurious fabrics, costly jewels, and statement headdresses. Alderaan's monarchy, on the other hand, preferred to dress modestly, with relatively simple designs and muted colors."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Protective clothing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Protective clothing was designed to protect the wearer during the course of their work. Aprons were a simple form of protective clothing worn by people carrying out dirty work in kitchens and scarp yards. Mechanics wore coveralls made from durable fabrics to protect them from dirt and oil, while pockets and pouches held tools needed for work. Security guard uniforms were worn by those assigned to keep watch over dignitaries, royalty and other important individuals. Pilots wore flight suits designed to keep them safe and which carried life support gear and survival tools to be used in case of accidents. Camouflage clothing' was a special form of protective clothing designed to help soldiers blend in with their surroundings. Fabrics of clothes could also be made to be waterproof or even fireproof."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
