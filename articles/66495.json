Lando Calrissian was also on board, as a New Republic representative trying to defuse the crisis. When the Ishori flagship Predominance fired on the Bothan capital city of Drev'starn, Miatamia's fleet entered the battle. At the time, they were unaware that Imperial Intelligence saboteurs had taken control of weapons emplacements on the Predominance and attacked the city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, Calrissian managed to contact Ponc Gavrisom and Leia Organa Solo, who had been on the Predominance trying to convince the anti-Bothan alliance to stand down.
