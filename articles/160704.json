The high back kept the rider from falling off of the animal's back as it rose from a kneeling to a standing position. The stirrups were used to support some of the rider's weight and to give the animal signals. The rider would sit in a slightly reclined, straddled position."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
