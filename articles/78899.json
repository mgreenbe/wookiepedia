The range was named for Kystes, and the majority of Talus's Selonian population, including the Kurtuln Den, lived within the volcanic tunnels and caves beneath the mountains. The mountains were nearly impassable and were home to a number of deadly native creatures, and were prone to violent storms and groundquakes as well. Vast forests, shrouded in mist and clouds, stretch across the foothills of the range."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
