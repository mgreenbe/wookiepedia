During the war, she followed Altis into battle on the planet JanFathal alongside a contingent of clones and two orthodox Jedi, Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, in order to rescue a Republic Intelligence agent, Hallena Devis.

Many years later, Luke Skywalker and several other Jedi were brought onto the ship as it resumed its mission. Masana, in spirit form, communicated and began to fall in love with Skywalker. She later took the body of one of the other Jedi, Cray Mingla, after Mingla gave it up to stop the superweapon once and for all.

Abeloth then used Ming's spirit to reach out to Skywalker as he traveled to her, and tried to convince him that she was in fact Ming when he confronted her. Skywalker was surprised to realize how much he still loved Ming after so many years, but he was not fooled by Abeloth's trickery.

The ranch followed the planet's Algic current, ranging from the equator to the arctic circle. Masana's family was not wealthy, but they had a happy life, living mostly on the deep oceans as herders and farmers. From her youth, Masana helped out on the ranch, herding tsaelke cetaceans and wander-kelp. When the ranch was in the territory of the predatory wystoh and they needed to leave their floating home, the family sent out a foo-twitter, a floating device meant to distract the marine hunters. Masana also rode cy'een, fish native to the world. The first time Masana used the Force was to move some ice that had trapped her with several sea cows.

While heading to the planet Yarille on another relief mission, Masana advocated more directly aiding the Galactic Republic, stating that the presence of Altis' Jedi could make a difference, but Altis was reluctant to agree with her and Eris was opposed to the idea altogether. Before they reached Yarille, though, Wookiee Gunner picked up a distress signal from an undercover Republic Intelligence agent on JanFathal, Hallena Devis. Altis contacted a local Republic commander, Captain Gilad Pellaeon, whose ship, Leveler, was the nearest Republic warship, and offered the services of his Jedi in extracting Devis.

She then attempted to filter out communications of interest by ear in the midst of hundreds of simultaneous transmissions. Shortly thereafter, Tano questioned Masana's relationship with Eris\u2014by this time, the two were engaged to be married. The Padawan also attempted to persuade Masana to abandon what she saw as Altis' heretical teachings. Masana, bemused, did not argue with the Padawan, but pointed out that even within the Jedi Order, a high-ranking Jedi Master, Ki-Adi-Mundi, had not fallen to the dark side despite having several wives.

The Jedi eventually covered their retreat by collapsing a building down on the droids and then racing back to their shuttle. They took off, intending to link up with Leveler, but the Republic vessel had been detected by Separatist warships and had jumped to hyperspace to avoid destruction.

Once back aboard the Republic warship, Masana learned that its advanced concussion missile launchers were inoperable\u2014the weapons worked, but the targeting computers were offline. Masana, after obtaining Pellaeon's permission, was taken to the main targeting array, where she melded with the computer in order to control the missile launchers.

About two months later, Tur-Mukan asked Masana to meet her again, this time on Nerrif, a large Republic supply station in the Mid Rim. Before they spoke, Masana used the Force to try and raise the spirits of some of the wounded clones. While there, Tur-Mukan confessed to Masana that she had secretly taken a lover and had a child, which went against standard Jedi doctrine, so she wondered whether she could join with Master Altis and his renegade Jedi at some point.

Masana later developed this skill to the point that she was able to transfer her consciousness to and from a machine at will."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Masana was also a skilled gunner, as she operated emplacements on both the Eye of Palpatine and Nam Chorios to good effect. Even after losing her connection to the Force, she could still understand and explain training aids and techniques employed by earlier Jedi, although she longed to explore the Force for her own. In her previous life, she had been able to employ a number of Force powers, but once she assumed Cray Mingla's body, though she was still physically fit, she was unable to use the Force. When she did manage to tap into the Force on Dagobah and on the Knight Hammer, it was only in the form of the dark side; she was able to use that power to both employ a Force Whirlwind to hurl away predatory nightbats and guide her lightsaber to deflect blaster bolts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Relationships"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Geith Eris"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the traditional Jedi ordinance against romantic relationships and marriage, Djinn Altis allowed his students to develop serious relationships. Masana had one such relationship with Geith Eris, a fellow trainee who was a skilled pilot. By the time of the Clone Wars, the two were engaged to be married. Both survived the Great Jedi Purge, but in 18 BBY the two entered the automated Eye of Palpatine dreadnaught and attempted to disable it. Masana wanted to access the gunnery room and disable it from within by causing the enclision grid to misfire, but Eris disagreed and left in a Skipray to seek help, despite Masana's protests. The dreadnaught's gunnery systems killed Eris, and Masana later shed her body to stop the war machine."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Luke Skywalker"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In spirit form, Masana met Luke Skywalker when he was brought onto the dreadnaught thirty years after she transferred consciousness there. The two quickly grew attracted to each other, and another Jedi, Cray Mingla, gave up her body to stop the dreadnaught, allowing Masana to enter it. Skywalker and Ming's relationship deepened and grew more intimate, but was complicated when she discovered she could no longer touch the Force. They traveled together for some time in hopes of rekindling her connection. Despite Skywalker's best efforts\u2014Masana, now going by the surname of Ming\u2014realized that she would not be content unless she could touch the Force and that Skywalker's power was overshadowing and interfering with her progress. After learning she could only touch the dark side, Ming left Skywalker on her own journey to find the Force, although she readily admitted that she loved him. She stated at one point that she had hoped to return to him once she recovered her powers, but that opportunity never came to pass. In 13 ABY, a single look between them on Nam Chorios told both of them that their time together was over. After Abeloth killed Ming and took her appearance, she used her form to reach out to Luke Skywalker. While he discovered that Callista's appearance was an illusion created by Abeloth, Skywalker was shocked and pained that three decades after their last encounter, he still loved her. The relationship between the two ended with an aura of hope, as Skywalker was finally able to detach his past love from the being who had kept her captive for so long, causing Callista to show Skywalker her gratitude in her final glance before fading into the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Callista Ming was first created by Barbara Hambly for the 1995 novel Children of the Jedi as a love interest for Luke Skywalker. Hambly worked closely with Kevin J. Anderson in plotting what became known as the Callista trilogy\u2014Children of the Jedi, Anderson's Darksaber, and Hambly's Planet of Twilight. In many ways, Ming's personality is similar to Skywalker's, except that for much of the series, she is frustrated by her inability to use the Force, making her a dramatic foil to Skywalker's command of the Force. Ming later appeared in various other reference materials discussing the events of the trilogy. According to Kevin J. Anderson, Ming was originally intended to be \"the great love of Luke Skywalker's life,\" as part of an assignment from Lucasfilm to author Barbara Hambly, who created Ming. However, by the time Anderson started writing Darksaber, fan reaction over the character Mara Jade from the Thrawn Trilogy had become such that Lucasfilm decided that Skywalker and Jade would ultimately end up together. As such, Anderson worked with Hambly to find a way to slowly write Ming out over the course of Darksaber, without killing off the character."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Callista Ming's surname was not revealed until Murder in Slushtime, a short story by Hambly and set after Hambly and Anderson's trilogy. Her name is similar to that of the person whose body she occupied, Cray Mingla. The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia refers to her as Callista \"Ming,\" with the surname in quotes. In 2008, she made a minor appearance in the novel Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, wherein her original name was first identified as Callista Masana. The same author who wrote Order 66, Karen Traviss, later included Callista in another novel of hers, The Clone Wars: No Prisoners, which gave the character a larger role in a battle during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Barbara Hambly derived the name \"Callista\" from Callisto, one of the four largest moons of Jupiter and also a character in Greek mythology. In creating the character, Hambly sought to create a \"spiritual partner for Luke.\" Hambly felt that Ming could relate with Luke Skywalker about the spiritual aspects of the Force and had a similar background. Ming's personality was designed to be \"basicly (sic) sweet-natured\" and seeking wisdom over power. Hambly also stated that she envisioned a young Uma Thurman or possibly Winona Ryder portraying Ming's character, stipulating that it would have to be somebody \"tough and sweet.\" In devising Ming, Hambly also sought to create a character that would present issues that \"the Force can't help you with.\" Hambly felt that including those elements that left Skywalker helpless to change would contribute to his growing process as a character. Hambly also stated that she hadn't kept up with future novels featuring Ming, and while she had offered to write another novel featuring Ming at one point, she was rejected by Lucasfilm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
