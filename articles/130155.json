As part of the conflict, the latter carried out an orbital bombardment of the Expansion Region celestial body Immalia, where the Squintpipe then threaded the formation of the Signatories' starships. As a result, the bombardment was ended and the surviving vessels of the Republic's enemy rushed to the nearby hyperspace jump beacon to escape the star system. At a speech delivered on the 25th anniversary of Victory in the Waymancy Storm in 7786 BBY, the Republic's Supreme Chancellor Nagratha noted the Squintpipe's performance at Immalia as one of the heroic moments of the Waymancy Storm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Squintpipe was originally meant to be mentioned in the 2012 reference book The Essential Guide to Warfare by Jason Fry and Paul R.
