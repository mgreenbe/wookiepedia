The Padawan of Jedi Master Vollen Sor, the pair was dispatched to Alderaan in 3653 BBY as part of the Republic's delegation to a summit called by the Empire. While on Alderaan, the Empire sacked Coruscant and forced the Republic to sign a treaty which ended the war. Master and Padawan were in the Eeseen spaceport when rogue Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer was preparing to leave Alderaan to avenge her Master Ven Zallow, who had recently died at the hands of Sith Lord Darth Malgus during the Sacking of Coruscant. When Sor asked her what she was doing, she simply stated that she was doing something for Zallow. Sor, Keevo, and Leneer talked for a while in the spaceport, and Leneer said farewell and prepared to leave. Sor and Keevo followed her to her starship to find out what she was doing, but Leneer would not tell them before departing the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
