One such time was when Bror Jace was picking on Gavin Darklighter, saying that to date, he was the worst pilot in the squadron. Bror Jace wanted to decide what his \"punishment\" should have been\u2014namely to be \"apprenticed\" to the best pilot\u2014fetching caf, drafting reports, that sort of thing. However, Corran Horn argued that he was the best pilot and he wasn't particularly inclined to mess with Gavin the way that Bror wanted to. Nawara decided to argue his case before Wedge Antilles, Tycho Celchu and Captain Afyon of the Eridain. Corran agreed to add his kills to Gavin's and go by percentage averages than total number of kills. Unfortunately for Nawara, this meant that he was the worst pilot in the squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nawara also began to form a relationship with Rhysati Ynr in the early days of Rogue Squadron.

While he completely recovered after the first instance, during the second a micro-meteorite severed his right leg below the knee. Though fitted with a prosthesis, he was no longer fit for combat.

Although he was dismayed by Skywalker's plea of guilty and the fact that he was not a part of the final agreement between Daala and his client, Ven continued to defend other Jedi, including Tahiri Veila and Valin Horn. While he won Veila's case, Ven was defeated while defending Horn, successfully persuading the judge to deem the Jedi mentally unstable yet unable to prevent the man's sentence to confinement in carbonite. Ven later represented the entire Jedi Order, fighting the executive order Daala had imposed on them. He won, lifting many of the restrictions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
