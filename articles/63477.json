After events went poorly, several of the natives gave chase to Windu. During the chase, one of his pursuers fell into a canyon, and was shattered. Having realized the error of his ways, the young Jedi apprentice healed the being's broken body by piecing it back together with the Force. In gratitude, Mace was given some of the Hurrikaine crystals from the being's own body, which he used to create his purple lightsaber blade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Hurrikaine\" crystals appear in Knights of the Old Republic II and possess many of the attributes associated with Mace Windu's lightsaber, including its purple color.
