They helped engage Imperial ships above the planetary shield and defend the Alliance fleet, in order to buy time for Jyn Erso and the Rogue One team to steal plans for the Galactic Empire's new top secret battle station, the Death Star. Although the Alliance suffered heavy losses, including all Rogue One members, and commanders of both Alliance Starfighter Command and the Alliance Fleet, General Merrick and Admiral Raddus, respectively, it was considered a major Rebel victory as the Tantive IV managed to escape with the stolen plans. Prior to the battle, Wion Dillems, normally stationed on the Profundity, replaced Puck Naeco as Green Twelve after Naeco broke an ankle in a rough landing."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Yavin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Yavin, Green Squadron flew 10 X-wings, in support of Gold Squadron and Red Squadron, against the Death Star. Although a major victory for the Rebel Alliance, with the destruction of the Death Star and death of Grand Moff Tarkin, the Alliance suffered heavy losses with only three survivors from Gold and Red Squadrons. The outcome would have been worse had it not been for the last minute assistance from Han Solo and Chewbacca in the Millennium Falcon, which allowed Red Five Luke Skywalker to fire the killing shot into the Death Star's thermal exhaust port."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the evacuation of Hoth, the Alliance fleet's Fourth Division were attacked during a blockade at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three. Green Squadron's A-wing interceptors were amongst many other X-wing and Y-wing starfighters tasked to defend the fleet from waves of Imperial TIEs. Shara Bey called for the squadron to form up on her to A-wing to protect one of the transports. Due to the intense turbolaser cordon, none of the rebel ships were able to jump to hyperspace. However, the Millennium Falcon arrived, destroyed a squadron of TIEs and a turbolaser emplacement, which created a gap big enough for all the ships to escape."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle at Elessia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire's Commander Ellian Zahra intercepted a transmission that revealed the Alliances Fourth and Seventh Divisions were planning to rendezvous at Elessia, so Zahra initiated an attack that saw her split her forces to strike simultaneously. Zahra's primary strike force led an attack on the Alliance's Seventh Division, while her secondary strike force attempted to attack Leia Organa's Fourth Division, however the Fourth had already left their rendezvous point before the strike force arrived. The Imperial forces overwhelmed the Seventh Division's capital ships. TIE interceptors created a blockade of Home One's hangar bay, that prevented Alliance starfighters from launching."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly into the battle, the Fourth Division's ships emerged from hyperspace and immediately deployed their starfighters, led by Commander Luke Skywalker, who assumed the callsign Red Leader. Skywalker was accompanied by other starfighters, that included Green Squadron's Shara Bey (Green Three), along with Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca in the Millennium Falcon. Skywalker called for all Fourth Division fighters to form up on him, on an attack run on Home One's blockade, to push the TIEs back, while those starfighters who were trapped in the hangar bays prepared to launch, including Red Squadron's Commander Wedge Antilles. As soon as Skywalker cleared the TIEs, all the Alliance starfighters aboard Home One launched to repay the favor. Skywalker then left the space battle to board the frigate where Leia Organa was under attack from an Imperial boarding party, led personally by Zahra."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Endor, Green Group was led by Commander Arvel Crynyd and was entirely composed of A-wing starfighters. On arrival from hyperspace, Gold Leader determined that the Death Star's shield was still up and ordered all ships to pull up. Admiral Ackbar ordered all ships to take evasive action and for Green Group to stick close to sector MV-7. Upon turning away from the battle station, the Imperial fleet had appeared from behind Endor's forest moon and prevented the Rebels from escaping. As the Death Star's superlaser started firing upon the Mon Calamari Star Cruisers, the battle moved to the Imperial fleet. Green Leader Crynyd ordered Green Group to mix it up with the TIEs to thin out the enemy starfighter screen and take some of the pressure off the B-wing bombers. As the battle dragged on, Green Group lost more than two-thirds of its A-wing complement. Outnumbered but vowing to make a difference, Crynyd directed Green Group's survivors to execute fast-and-close strafing runs across Star Destroyer superstructures, knocking out turbolaser batteries with their concussion missiles and laser cannons. During the attack on the Super Star Destroyer Executor, Green Six (Kokely) was destroyed by one of the many TIE fighters defending the flagship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the deactivation of the shield generator on the forest moon below, Green Four (Shara Bey), Green Seven and Green Three, were tasked to screen Gold Leader's attack run on the surface of the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crynyd, still attacking the Executor, took a mortal hit to his A-Wing while passing over the bow of the ship. With systems failing, he forced his stricken starfighter into ship's bridge, killing the bridge crew and the Imperial fleet's commander, Admiral Piett. The Executor then crashed into the surface of the Death Star, causing a huge explosion and became the turning point for the Rebels. Following Crynyd's sacrifice, command of Green Group fell to Lieutenant L'ulo L'ampar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Imperial fleet started their retreat, Home One sent orders for Green Group and Yellow Group to watch for starships evacuating the battle station. One such craft was a Lambda-class shuttle, flown by Commander Luke Skywalker and accompanied by his late father, Anakin Skywalker. Shara Bey intercepted the shuttle almost immediately, but Skywalker identified himself as a friendly as the A-wing pilot was preparing to lock on to the Imperial ship.

Their job was to clear out enemy TIE fighters, so Feral Group's Y-wings could make their bombing run on an All Terrain Armored Transport using magnetising cluster bombs, which could magnetize to the armoured hull. Shara Bey's A-wing was hit by a persuing TIE fighter, which caused a coolant leak, but L'ampar destroyed the TIE before it could do any further damage. While the battle was another major victory for the Alliance, it resulted in heavy losses for both starfighter squadrons by the end of the confrontation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "After Cawa City"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "L'ulo L'ampar was eventually promoted to Captain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
