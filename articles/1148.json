While traveling to the base, 35 and several other clones discovered several abandoned podracers in a canyon. 18 denied the request use the podracers for faster travel, due to the high risk for humans attempting to pilot the high-speed machines. Upon entering the base, they found a Skakoan engineer who was employed by the Separatist to create a hyperspace warping device, which General Terrus planned to use for a surprise attack on Coruscant. When learning that the scientist, Vylagos, would die if his helmet was removed, Vargus struck a deal with him: if Vylagos could bring the 313th Legion back, Vargus would not take off the Skakoan's helmet. Vylagos then calibrated a device to transport all living beings within one kilometer of the device back to Ando Prime. While he was calibrating the device, the group met Clone Commander Cody and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who were also looking for the legion. 36 went through with Falco, Dom, 44, 35, 57, Clone Commander Cody, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, and 18. They were transported to a rocky, barren world that was, according to Vylagos, in the far reaches of the Outer Rim. 18 told Jedi General Po Bandis to gather all the troops into a one-kilometer radius, then the general sent them to destroy a Confederacy listening post, located nearby. The clones hijacked a Hailfire droid that had been modified into a non-droid tank, and used its missiles to destroy the listening post. As they drove back, Dom tossed out pulse grenades, forcing the legion to gather in the one-kilometer radius, so they were transported back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "36 was created for the book, The Clone Wars: Decide Your Destiny: The Lost Legion.
