Elite pilots had access to TIE/sf space superiority fighters, two-seater TIE craft equipped with enhanced weaponry and sensor systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War had seen the various flight academies under the Empire returned to local institutions, the TIE pilots of the First Order were trained directly within First Order-owned ships, whether they be newly created ships or Imperial survivors of the war. Largely because they could not afford to train an endless supply of pilots, the First Order treated its fighter pilots as important parts of its war machine instead of disposable assets; unlike its predecessor. Potential pilots were identified as children and given rigorous training, often within the corridors of warships, then tested ruthlessly throughout their careers to ensure their reflexes, visual acuity and coordination measured up. Due to the nature of their training, many of them never set foot on a planet during this time. In addition, the First Order's pilots had a higher life expectancy than their Imperial equivalents; largely due to their not having to be burdened with a restrictive galactic budget. In addition, those pilots who demonstrated both exceptional skill and unwavering loyalty were promoted to elite ranks within First Order during the Cold War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pilots of the Order included Major Elrik Vonreg, TN-3465, and \"Quickdraw.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "First Order TIE pilots wore a uniform consisting of a black jumpsuit with a chestplate with life support gear, pauldrons on the shoulders, gauntlets, a utility belt, boots, and a helmet with goggles. The helmet had a flexible gas transfer hose, which connected to the pilot's life support system. The helmet's goggles also had an interior viewplate that projected combat data to the pilots.\nPilots were typically issued with a SE-44C blaster pistol, which could be carried in a holster on their belt when not in use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
