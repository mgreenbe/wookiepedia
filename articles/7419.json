A skilled pilot and lightsaber duelist, Draco was fiercely loyal to and willing to die for Roan Fel, Emperor of the Galactic Empire and later the Empire-in-exile. Draco was trained in the ways of the Force by Master Eshkar Niin, and was an Imperial Knight as early as 130 ABY at the conclusion of the Sith\u2013Imperial War, when he fled the Imperial capital with Fel as the Sith Lord Darth Krayt seized control of the Empire and the galaxy, declaring a new order and driving Fel's forces into exile. When Eshkar Niin deserted the Imperial Knights, Draco was sent to kill him and left him mortally wounded after Niin murdered Fel's wife, the Empress Elliah. Draco continued to serve the Emperor, eventually becoming an Imperial Knight Master and the leader of the Order. In 137 ABY, he accompanied Fel as the Emperor retook the world of Bastion and established a fortress world from which he could assault Krayt's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Draco learned that Fel's daughter Marasiah was being pursued by Krayt's Sith agents on Vendaxa, he defied the Emperor's orders to not mount a rescue attempt, and brought his trusted friend Ganner Krieg to the world in an attempt to rescue the woman he loved from the Sith's clutches. Escaping the planet on the Mynock, a ship belonging to the bounty hunter Cade Skywalker, Draco and Krieg were able to return the Princess to Bastion, but at the expense of their Emperor's trust. Draco hoped to win enough of Fel's trust back to persuade the Emperor to allow him to marry the Princess, and grew very staunch in his willingness to obey orders. Over the next several months, he and Krieg were sent on missions to the Wheel space station and to the Jedi Order's Hidden Temple on Taivas. While at the Temple, they joined a strike team put together by Skywalker to assassinate Darth Krayt on Had Abbadon. The mission saw Krayt nearly killed, but the war continued to rage on. Draco later accompanied Fel to Agamar along with several other Imperial Knights in order to conduct peace talks with the Jedi Order, but the meeting was interrupted by forces of the One Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Draco ordered the Emperor's escape shuttle to ferry Fel away from Agamar and to safety, although it meant leaving Marasiah behind. The Princess was captured by the Sith, and Draco later led a rescue mission on the Sith world of Korriban. The mission was successful, but Draco remained onworld to buy her time to escape. There, he was taken prisoner by Niin, who had become the Sith Inquisitor Darth Havok, and Havok subjected him to agonizing torture in an effort to learn the Emperor's secrets. Draco broke under the torture and told Havok about the Jedi's Hidden Temple. He was then frozen in carbonite and made into a gift for Cade Skywalker, whom Darth Krayt wanted to entice into a confrontation. Skywalker brought Draco to the Temple, and the two joined in its defense as Krayt's forces attacked. The Jedi were evacuated, and Fel and his allies immediately launched a counterstrike at Sith-controlled Coruscant. During the battle, Draco stood aboard the Star Destroyer Jagged Fel at the side of the Emperor, who yet believed in Draco's unquestioning loyalty. Draco's loyalty was ultimately to the Force, however, and he held true to his oath as an Imperial Knight and slew his liege during the battle when the Emperor fell to the dark side and attempted to unleash a deadly pathogen onto Coruscant's surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the defeat of the One Sith, a new galactic government known as the Galactic Federation Triumvirate came into existence. Marasiah Fel became the new Empress while Draco became the head of the Imperial Knights. The Triumvirate's efforts to rebuild the galaxy were stymied by an underground One Sith insurgency and the appearance of a rogue Sith, named Darth Wredd, who wanted to destroy the One Sith and restore the Rule of Two. Following the Carreras Incident, Draco objected to the Empress' new policy of ignoring Darth Wredd and letting him kill the One Sith but followed his orders nonetheless. Draco later implemented the Empress' \"Most Wanted\" campaign to hunt down war criminals from the Second Imperial Civil War. During this campaign, the junk dealer Ania Solo was arrested for allegedly murdering the Imperial Knight Teemen Alton. Draco personally headed the three\u2013member military tribunal prosecuting her but was forced to acquit her after the Imperial Knights Yalta Val and Jao Assam presented evidence clearing her name. Later, Draco had Jao arrested on charges of deserting the Imperial Knights. After Darth Wredd kidnapped Jao Assam, Antares Draco commanded an Imperial Knight force against One Sith forces during the Battle of the Floating World.

Instead, the Imperial Knights served as a personal bodyguard to the Emperor. Following the Battle of Caamas, which saw the defeat of the Galactic Alliance and the end of the war, Draco and fellow Imperial Knight Mohrgan Fel accompanied the Emperor to his private chambers on Coruscant as Fel prepared for a meeting with the Imperial Moff Council. Fel planned to arrest Grand Moff Morlish Veed, whom he suspected had disobeyed him by ordering the Massacre of the Jedi Order at Ossus. Fel instructed Draco and Mohrgan to kill Veed if he made any suspicious moves and to keep a close eye on Director of Imperial Intelligence Nyna Calixte. At that moment, Calixte revealed herself to be in the room with them and eavesdropping on their conversation. After being held against the wall by Mohrgan's use of the Force, she informed them that Fel's Sith allies were planning to kill him.

Concurrent with these events, Fel and Draco made an underground escape from Coruscant through Sublevel 12's maintenance tunnels to a waiting ship that had been arranged by Calixte. As the two destroyed guard droids that attempted to halt them, Draco felt the deaths of his fellow Knights in the Force. Fel told him that they would honor their sacrifices by escaping.

When Niin abandoned his vows to the Emperor and deserted the Order, Draco was sent to kill him and located him on the rooftop of a city filled with skyscrapers. Niin had himself hunted Fel's wife, Empress Elliah Fel, to the rooftop, and both Draco and Elliah engaged him in a lightsaber duel. Niin ignored their pleas to remember his vows and Force-shoved Draco away before striking the Empress down. Draco attacked and mortally wounded him in retaliation, and afterward believed his former Master to be dead.

Draco accompanied Fel as he arrived on-planet, along with two other Imperial Knights, Sigel Dare and Draco's trusted friend, Ganner Krieg. After securing the loyalty of the Imperial forces stationed on the planet, Fel believed that his Empire could now become a more potent threat to Krayt, although Draco cautioned him that Krayt would now know where to find him. Fel was then informed by General Oron Jaeger that Elke Vetter, an Imperial Knight and the bodyguard of Fel's daughter, Princess Marasiah Fel, had been killed on Socorro, and that Marasiah was missing. Draco immediately volunteered to take three Knights to Socorro to rescue her but was forbidden from doing so by Fel, who would not allow his new base to be discovered just yet. A distraught Draco told Fel that he did not understand, but would obey. Nevertheless, Draco continued his attempts to convince the Emperor to mount a rescue mission, proclaiming that he would die before revealing that Bastion had been retaken. Reminded by Krieg that they had sworn an oath of loyalty to the Emperor, Draco wondered if loyalty was the same as obedience."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their orders, Draco and Krieg made their way in two stolen Predator-class fighters to Vendaxa, where Marasiah and her companion, Astraal Vao, had been picked up by the bounty hunter Cade Skywalker and had rendezvoused with two Jedi Knights, Wolf Sazen and Astraal's brother, Shado Vao. Arriving at the site of Skywalker's grounded ship, the Mynock, the pair's fighters were shot down by a Sith Fury-class starfighter. Draco and Krieg managed to escape the flaming wrecks of their ships and arrived on the scene simultaneously with the Sith Lords Darth Talon, Darth Nihl, and a legion of other Sith that had been pursuing Marasiah since her escape from Socorro. With his hood up, Draco appeared to the Sith to be Fel himself but revealed his identity and told them to run while they still had the chance. Along with the Jedi and the Princess, Draco and Krieg ignited their lightsabers and engaged the Sith in combat. Despite seven years of tension between the Jedi and Roan Fel's Empire, the Jedi and Imperial Knights were fighting side-by-side against their common enemy, the Sith. Marasiah was angered by Draco's attempt to rescue her, which she suspected had been forbidden by her father. Draco's reasoning was that he loved her, a fact that she informed him she was already aware of.

When Sazen attempted to return to the battle, Draco held him back, insisting that Marasiah's life was more important than anyone else's. Sazen was distrustful of Fel's Imperials due to the Massacre at Ossus, but Draco revealed that the said Massacre had happened against the Emperor's orders and managed to convince Sazen to do whatever he could to heal the Princess. Draco rushed back outside of the ship, only to find that it was taking off, with everyone but the Sith aboard.

As the Sith had likely tracked the Mynock to Bastion, Fel believed that he was now in a stalemate with Krayt's Empire. Draco, ready to receive any punishment that the Emperor wished to hand them, was shocked when Fel told them that they would be receiving medals. Fel was retroactively approving their mission to Vendaxa, rather than having news of their insubordination undermine his authority. Draco's and Krieg's punishment was thus that they were being declared the Empire's foremost heroes and thenceforth being tasked with its most dangerous missions. Fel then told Draco to forget the idea of marrying Marasiah and sent the two on their next mission: escorting Captain Mingo Bovark to the Wheel, a space station in the Besh Gorgon system that had remained neutral throughout Fel's conflicts with the Galactic Alliance and the Sith. Bovark would be discussing a possible alliance against Krayt with Admiral Gar Stazi of the Galactic Alliance Remnant, and Draco and Krieg's mission was to ensure Bovark's safety at all costs and to see that the negotiations went smoothly.

A firefight erupted between the Imperial Knights and the Galactic Alliance Intelligence officers, and Krieg held off the guards while Draco burst into the room to retrieve Bovark, Force-pushing an angry Stazi against a bulkhead. Wheel Administrator Pol Temm and several security guards arrived and called on the Imperial Knights to surrender their weapons immediately. Draco refused, and Temm ordered the Imperials off of the Wheel, declaring the station off-limits to all of Roan Fel's forces.

Because of her status as a former Jedi and a childhood friend of Skywalker's, Rae was able to learn of the existence of the Jedi's Hidden Temple. As she prepared to follow the Mynock to the temple in her ship, Rae relayed the Temple's coordinates to Draco, Krieg, and Marasiah, who were waiting nearby in a ship of their own. Although both Draco and Krieg suspected that Rae might be setting them up, the three Imperial Knights set a course for the Hidden Temple on Taivas.

In the Council Chamber, Skywalker, Rawk, Sazen, Vao, Draco, Krieg, and Marasiah appeared before Jedi Masters K'Kruhk, T'ra Saa, and Tili Qua. Saa believed that the Force had allowed the Imperial Knights to come to the Hidden Temple for a reason. Draco stood by as Marasiah gave a long speech that revealed that her father had not ordered the Massacre at Ossus and called on the Jedi to open talks with him so that they might join forces against their common enemy, the Sith. Skywalker chimed in, revealing knowledge of Darth Krayt and the One Sith that he had learned during his time as their captive, and proposed a plan of his own: assassinate Darth Krayt. Although the Jedi Council was taken aback by Skywalker's proposal, the Imperial Knights were impressed by it\u2014Draco deemed it to be the first thing Skywalker had ever said that he liked. Ultimately, the Council did not support the mission, but Skywalker decided to proceed without their assistance. Marasiah assigned Draco, Krieg, and Rae to accompany him on his mission, while she would stay behind to continue negotiating an alliance with the Jedi. Draco was appointed the leader of the Imperial Knights' mission. Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, opened the cargo bay doors of the Mynock and allowed Draco and Krieg to load their TIE Predators into the ship's hold.

Draco observed that there were no TIE Predators meeting them and that the Star Destroyer's hull had taken fire damage from the inside. After the Mynock was locked in a tractor beam, Vao and Skywalker sensed the presence of a Force-user on the ship, and the crew set out to explore the derelict vessel. Skywalker ordered Draco and Krieg to investigate the corridors connected to the hangar bay, where they found several bones, some of which had been gnawed on. Following an attack on Skywalker, Rae, Vao, and Jariah Syn by beasts known as Rakghouls, Draco contacted Deliah Blue on the Mynock and suggested that Skywalker was dead and that the mission be called off. Blue ignored him and rushed into the interior of the ship, and Draco and Krieg followed her. The trio located Syn and Vao in front of a locked door, along with several tame-seeming Rakghouls, beasts that Morne was able to control with the power of the Muur Talisman, an ancient Sith artifact that housed the spirit of the Sith Lord Karness Muur.

With his new instructions, Draco interrupted a tender moment between Krieg and Rae and got into a verbal quarrel with the two of them, both of whom questioned Fel's new order. After Rae stormed off, Draco told Krieg that he would have to kill her if she disobeyed their Emperor and was met with a heated rebuke from his trusted friend: he would have to kill Krieg first.
