Pelts of Rori creatures usually fetched handsome sums on the black market and unscrupulous poachers did not care about destroying the entire ecosystem. In addition to the many hunters and poachers, the male Weequay by the name of Tombl Blaus was situated within the battle. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, a spacer visited the battle zone to recover a head belonging to an R2-series astromech droid. Around this time, a spacer also spoke to Tombl Blaus to help reverse engineer a Corellian fried ice cream fryer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Poacher vs. Creature Battle appeared in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
