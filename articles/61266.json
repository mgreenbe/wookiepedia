When the cubes were not contained in a recess, any lighting around them became fuzzy, which made them easy to spot.

When activated, these relays would transport light from one side of the cube to the other. As such, if a cube was placed in a wall recess in a similar manner to a safe, it would appear as though it was just another section of the wall. While it was moderately difficult to spot a cube hidden in such a manner, the containers were easy to spot if not in a recess, as they created a fuzzy effect on the lighting around them. Small objects could be placed inside of the cube to be hidden, with magna locks\u2014which were difficult to pick\u2014used to secure the container."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The company Veretrex Securities produced the SCT-1000, which was associated with the Bith species.
