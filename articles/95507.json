According to the race coordinator, a 3PO-series protocol droid, the Nashal River Race was used primarily for recreation and youth races, with very few professional events having been staged for the track. Given that the track primarily stuck to major waterways around Nashal, it impractical to use the track for mounts or foot racing. However, on a hover vehicle, it could be considered a delightful afternoon outing."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Race legs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nashal River Race appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
