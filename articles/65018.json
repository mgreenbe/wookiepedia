Darth Plagueis, a Sith Lord in the years prior to the Clone Wars, lusted for immortality. According to his apprentice, Darth Sidious, Plagueis manipulated the midi-chlorians to both create life and seek immortality. Those who followed the light side of the Force and had the appropriate training could achieve a form of immortality by retaining their consciousness after their physical deaths. Qui-Gon Jinn rediscovered this ability and, in turn, taught Yoda and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi how to attain it. The redeemed Anakin Skywalker accomplished the state of immortality, as well, likewise his children, Luke Skywalker and Leia Skywalker Organa Solo, years later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Sidious was able to cheat his upcoming death by transferring his spirit into a clone body while falling into the reactor core of the second Death Star.

Sidious also stated that his master was slain in his sleep after the knowledge was passed on to his apprentice. Finally, however, he retracted that statement and admitted he had not attained the deceased Plagueis' knowledge, insisting that it could be discovered if Skywalker and he worked together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Sidious shared the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis with Skywalker, he asserted that the dark side of the Force could provide one with abilities deemed by some as contrary with nature. He maintained that stance in 35 ABY shortly after the broadcast revealing his forthcoming revenge to the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to Plagueis' skills, which allegedly enabled him to save people from death, there existed a method allowing one Force-sensitive to resuscitate another.

Once transformed from the living into the cosmic Force, the majority of them lost their consciousnesses and sentience, with only a handful gaining the ability to preserve both their self-awareness and physical appearance, occasionally manifested in the form of bluish Force spirits. The Jedi did not recognize that possibility to the final days of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The notable individuals to master the technique included the Force Priestesses and the Shaman of the Whills. The latter relayed the knowledge to Qui-Gon Jinn, yet since Jinn's training remained incomplete by his death in 32 BBY, his body did not vanish, as did the corpses of other Jedi. In effect, Jinn was only capable of communiting through his voice, lacking the ability to manifest as a spirit. Despite, during the Clone Wars, he was the matter of a few visions to Anakin Skywalker, which some came to believe were his actual spiritual manifestation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Foreseeing Yoda's relevant role in training the one who would preserve the balance of the Force, Jinn communicated with the Jedi Master during the final days of the Clone Wars and instructed him on his way to the Force planet, where he was supposed to undergo a preliminary training supervised by the Force Priestesses. With Yoda's suitability proven, Jinn promised to conduct the training onward. Yoda himself passed on the knowledge to Obi-Wan Kenobi and taught him to communicate with Jinn. Both Yoda and Kenobi were soon among a handful of the last Jedi survivors and both preserved their consciousness in 0 ABY and 4 ABY, respectively. In 4 ABY, Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One, who had once fallen to the dark side and declared himself as Darth Vader, was redeemed and his spirit soon joined those of Yoda and Kenobi before appearing to Luke on Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker became another Jedi to reach immortality, his corpse vanishing on the planet of Ahch-To in 34 BBY.

In 19 BBY, while Asajj Ventress' body was being buried on Dathomir, they could be heard whispering and murmuring something to one another. During the Imperial Era, Maul allied with their spirits via his promise to provide them with physical bodies to serve as new vessels. In return, they consented to merge his mind with that of Ezra Bridger, and when the ritual was complete, the ghosts possessed Kanan Jarrus and Sabine Wren, even though Ezra Bridger eventually liberated them by fracturing the altar, as they could only appear within a short distance from it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition, the Nightsisters could arrange a special ritual to resuscitate the dead in the form of zombies."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Existence in artifacts"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Presence was a Sith known to retain a facet of her presence in the holocron once belonging to her.

When a clone of him parented a child, he enjoined that the girl be brought to him so he could pass on to her body.

Sidious renewed his plan in 35 ABY, though, futilely encouraging Rey to kill him for all the Sith living in him to pass on to her. Regardless, the clone body was ultimately restored to a powerful version through the extracting of the power shared Rey and Ben Solo as a dyad in the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, the Emperor's vision of a galaxy eternally ruled by the Sith ended when his clone body was destroyed by his own power.
