Seeing as the Republic seemed unwilling to deregulate the banks and instead opted for initiating peace negotiations with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Saam together with fellow representatives Lott Dod and Nix Card conspired with Count Dooku to stage an attack against Coruscant, in an attempt to convince the Senate into passing the bill."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much to their chagrin, the Separatist Parliament extended a peace offer towards the Republic, though Dooku assured his representatives in the Senate of him preventing an end to the fighting.
