It was discovered at some point between 72 BBY and 53 BBY, during one of the races through the moon's interior when one of the racers, Likk Nibk, took a wrong turn while trying to pass a rival YT-1300. Nibk blasted through the end of the worm and ended up winning the race. After that, scientists went to explore it, and races were routed away from the worm's location."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
