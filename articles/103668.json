In Coruscant's distant history, the Gree had a hand in building some of Coruscant's infrastructure, so at some point during the Cold War, the Galactic Senate reached out to the Gree for aid. Isolationists, the Gree themselves did not come. Instead, the Gree Enclave sent droid representatives to aid in the rebuilding efforts. These representatives included Pat-aK, the lead ambassador droid assigned to work with Senator Oranda, Hib-R-ak, the subordinate droid responsible for the waste processing system, In-iK, the droid responsible for the power systems, and Nam-aK, the droid assigned to the hydrosupply."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially, the Gree droids had difficulty communicating with their Human collaborators due to their tendency to fall back on Gree speech patterns when their Basic speech programming was insufficient to convey their ideas. An agent of the Galactic Republic who had traveled to Coruscant on other business, happened upon Oranda and Pat-aK attempting and failing a conversation and was able to discern much more about Pat-aK's troubles than Oranda was. The Republic agent was able to determine that Pat-aK's subordinates had fallen under attack by hostile forces who had taken control of various sections of Coruscant's lower levels, interrupting the repair work. The Republic agent needed to access these areas anyway in the course of their other business, and so they agreed to take on some jobs for Pat-aK and Oranda to help repair Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pat-aK sent the Republic agent, designated in the Gree language as a \"black bisector\", to Nam-aK. Nam-aK had been assigned to repair Coruscant's water processing systems, but Pat-aK did not inform Nam-aK that the systems were in Black Sun territory. The agent aided Nam-aK, In-iK, and Hib-R-aK, and in gratitude Pat-aK gave them pieces of Gree technology. Thanks to their efforts, Pat-aK and Senator Oranda ratified an official treaty between the Gree Enclave and the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pat-aK and the other Gree droid ambassadors were largely similar to basic model protocol droids, but were somewhat dissimilar in their programming.
