The three Imperial escorts each attempted to intercept the Republic fleet and suffered heavy damage doing so. The squadron member continued towards the Overlord, attacking Mark VI Supremacy-class starfighters and the escorts while nearing the warship. The hero was tasked with damaging four shield generators and twelve Laser cannons on the Overlord, as well as eliminating 75 interceptors if the opportunity arose. As the battle commenced three additional Terminus-class destroyers came to the aid of Overlord, one of which was destroyed directly after assisting. The battle ended minutes after beginning and the hero left Makem Te's atmosphere, a disabled Imperial warship orbiting the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Makem Te Assault was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. It appears as one of the first Space Combats available to Republic players, accessible after the player receives their ship and uses their holocomm to speak with Flight Commander Judin. In the Space Combat, players must destroy four of the Overlord's shield generators and then fourteen of the ship's sixteen turbolasers. The two-part daily mission \"Operation: Noble Gambit\" includes completing both Makem Te Assault and the Space Combat: \"Archenar Interception\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There are also three bonus missions present in the battle. The first is taking out a total of 75 Mark VI interceptors or turrets on the defending ships, and another is destroying the Terminus class destroyer's engines (six in total) and shield generators. A third bonus mission, which can only be completed once a day, is to deal enough damage to the Overlord's bridge via proton torpedoes that the ship itself will be destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
