Several months into the campaign on New Plympto, Jennir's clone troopers executed Order 66\u2014declaring all Jedi enemies of the Republic\u2014and attempted to kill Jennir. He evaded them, eventually finding refuge among the Nosaurians he had been fighting against.

The Uhumele ferried Jennir and Bomo to Esseles, where Resa's buyer, Dezono Qua, lived; they attacked his fortress, cornering him, but Qua had already killed Bomo's daughter and eaten her. Jennir murdered the man, but Greenbark and the Uhumele ultimately left Esseles without him. He continued to live his life as a Jedi, however, vowing to stay true to the Jedi Code and find redemption.

Though Jennir saw through this, Chankeli was shot by Sang's droid. Sang fled, and when Jennir attempted to heal Chankeli with the Force, he passed out from the effort. He later woke on board of the Uhumele, with Bomo Greenbark at his side.

He was regarded by his superiors as having a poor connection to the Force, and being \"average\" in every respect, though he did not fail when it came to concentrating. When one Jedi Master reported to Grand Master Yoda that Jennir would never become a \"great Jedi\", the young Padawan sullenly listened nearby, hidden behind a pillar. His master taught him that if he could not walk away from a fight, he should take control of it, forcing his opponent to fight him on his own terms. Jennir never forgot the lesson. At one point, Yoda told him that even with his average abilities, the galaxy still needed him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jennir was made a Jedi Master by the time of the Clone Wars, becoming a Jedi General of the Grand Army of the Republic when the galaxy-spanning conflict began. Close to the war's end, he was sent to the planet New Plympto, located within the Core Worlds. Commanding a sizable contingent of clone troopers, Jennir was tasked with dealing with the native Nosaurian population\u2014who had allied themselves with the Confederacy of Independent Systems\u2014as well a large amount of Separatist battle droids, and reclaiming the world.

He was able to evade his attackers, however; confused and disoriented, he fled into the forest, hiding from his pursuers in the underbrush. Eventually, the clones left the area to continue their search elsewhere, and Jennir continued his flight into the jungle. Eventually, he encountered Bomo Greenbark, a lone Nosaurian soldier. Greenbark was unarmed, his weapons lying on the ground beside him; fearing that the Nosaurian would alert the clones to his presence, Jennir attacked him. He managed to pin Greenbark down, and made him swear to be extremely cautious and quiet. Eventually, however, Greenbark realized that Jennir was a Jedi, and gathered up his weapons, ready to strike. The Jedi Master was able to calm him down, telling him that changing circumstances meant that the two were on the same side. To Jennir's sadness, Greenbark confirmed to him what he had feared\u2014throughout the galaxy, many Jedi had been slaughtered by the soldiers under their command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greenbark decided he could trust Jennir, as they had a common enemy, and began to lead the Jedi back to the Nosaurian settlements. En route, Greenbark told his companion of his people's recent hardships; their main export, rikknit eggs, had been their key to gaining a place within the Galactic Republic, but the Republic had refused their entry and cracked down on the exportation of these eggs. With few other options, they threw their lot in with the Separatists. This information had never been given to Jennir, who found himself warming up to the Nosaurian people after hearing of their plight. Greenbark's fellow Nosaurians, however, were less easily persuaded that the Jedi, whom they had been fighting against for months, was now a friend; upon meeting a group of the natives in the forest, Jennir was attacked. They ignored Greenbark's pleas, though under the orders of Commander Rootrock, they eventually backed off. Rootrock and Jennir conferred, and the aged commander told Jennir of the supposed grab for power the Jedi Order had made on Coruscant. They both knew such allegations to be false. Rootrock attempted to recruit Jennir into his army; without the Separatist droids, they were susceptible to attack from the newly formed Galactic Empire, and Jennir could provide them with protection and leadership in battle. Jennir, however, wished to visit the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to witness the extent of Order 66 for himself.

Jennir could do nothing but watch as a young Jedi, calling for the Order to be rebuilt, was cut down by clone trooper blaster fire; if Jennir had revealed himself, he too would have been killed. The crowds dispersed, though Jennir sought out another Jedi Master, a Bothan by the name of Kai Hudorra, who had also witnessed the event. The two spoke briefly, Hudorra encouraging Jennir to dispose of his hidden lightsaber and forget that he had ever been a Jedi. Jennir, though, had made promises to Rootrock, and refused. He attempted to recruit Hudorra to his cause, but the old Bothan was adamant that he would live out his life in anonymity. Jennir left Coruscant, feeling that it had been a complete waste of time to have made the excursion in the first place, though he came away with a renewed belief in the Jedi way."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Half-Axe Pass"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jennir returned to New Plympto, upholding his promise to Rootrock, and became a general among the Nosaurians' armed forces. The Imperial forces remained on New Plympto, hoping to purge the world of its Separatist presence; however, under Jennir's leadership and guidance, the Nosaurians fought back. They principally used guerrilla warfare, attacking Imperial forces in valleys and quickly retreating back to their forest dwellings. Jennir found that he still had several allies in the planet's main spaceport, and used them as spies; they told him of any Imperial arrivals on New Plympto. Despite this, however, the Nosaurians incurred heavy losses during their skirmishes with the Empire, and after several weeks of warfare, Jennir knew that the Nosaurian Separatists would eventually be defeated by the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after Order 66, the Nosaurians themselves realized they would die fighting, and made arrangements for their loved ones\u2014children, wives, and parents\u2014to be transported offworld.

The Nosaurians did poorly in the initial stages of the conflict, and Jennir\u2014who had taken to using conventional blasters in place of his lightsaber\u2014knew they would likely perish fighting. Bomo Greenbark was tasked with evacuating the Nosaurian civilians, escorting their single transport toward the planet's spaceport so they could travel to Sullust; Jennir, Rootrock and the others held on to their lives knowing that for every extra minute they occupied the Imperials, the civilians would have that much longer to escape. The Imperials continued their onslaught, killing General Rootrock and Commander Limbfree and bringing in heavy TX-130T fighter tanks, which the Nosaurians were unable to defend against."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greenbark eventually returned to the fighting, having ensured the departure of the civilian transport. Jennir told his friend of the situation, and pleaded with him to order a retreat. The Nosaurians refused, knowing that holding the Half-Axe Pass was a key part of their attempt to evacuate their families. Jennir improvised, using his lightsaber to cut down a large tree, which damaged an Imperial tank and blocked the path of further vehicles. He planned to use this tactic to continue distracting the Empire while the other Nosaurians made a retreat. The stormtroopers had realized this, though, and when Jennir moved into position to cut down the next tree, a powerful blaster shot from one of the Imperial tanks sent him and Greenbark sprawling. The tree was upended and the two soldiers, unconscious, fell into a pit created by the tree's movement.

After seeing the bodies of their comrades, which upset the pair, Greenbark wanted to launch a suicide attack against the Imperials there and then. Jennir's counsel prevailed, however, and the two covertly made their way into the planet's main spaceport so that they could find passage offworld. Once they had arrived, however, the Jedi noticed that the port was nearly filled with docked and berthed ships; they had expected it to be deserted, with many spacers ferrying the Nosaurian women and children to various parts of the galaxy. Suspicious, they skulked around the port for a time, eventually entering a smuggling ship called the Uhumele. A woman, Crys Taanzer, was acting as a sentry, though Jennir managed to silence her when she noticed the two in her ship. They walked into the ship's main entertainment area, however, where the entire crew of the Uhumele had gathered\u2014the captain, Schurk-Heren; Mezgraf and Ko Vakier, who acted as gunners and bodyguards; the navigator, Lynaliskar K'ra Snyffulnimatta; and Meekerdin-maa and Janks, the ship's engineers. Once Jennir told them of his and Greenbark's situation\u2014omitting the fact that he was a Jedi\u2014Heren agreed to transport them to whatever destination they wished; he was no friend of the Empire, either. They told him of Greenbark's family, and that the refugees should have arrived earlier in the day. Greenbark's family and all the other civilians, however, were never in the spaceport, as their transport had been intercepted by the Empire. To Greenbark's immense distress, Heren told them that all of those captured had been sold to slavers on Orvax IV."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two outlaws were given quarters on Heren's ship and told that they could stay with the Uhumele for as long as they wished. Despite Jennir's attempts to calm him, Greenbark was still distraught at the news of his family's fate. They had little time to settle into their quarters, though; Crys Taanzer reported that Imperial stormtroopers were searching every ship in the starport, and Heren, who had illicit cargo of his own, called a meeting in his lavish living quarters. The Yarkora captain informed the crew of the situation, and asked them what course of action they each wished to take. Several of the crew were eager to attempt to blast their way out of New Plympto, but Jennir, knowing they would be destroyed before they were successful in any such attempt, proposed an alternate plan. If all of the other ships in the port took off simultaneously, the Uhumele would be able to escape in all the commotion, according to the Jedi Master. The plan was shot down by the crew, who had doubts about the trustworthiness of some of the other ships docked on New Plympto. Determined to see himself and his friend offworld, Jennir decided to give the other ships a reason to leave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He left the Uhumele and made his way back into the jungle, hiding in the underbrush and lying in wait for an impending Imperial convoy. As the convoy passed, the Jedi Master killed a lone stormtrooper of the 501st Legion, taking his armor. Jennir returned to the city, now disguised as a stormtrooper, and commandeered a V-wing starfighter. After contacting the crew of the Uhumele and telling them to prepare to take off, he began firing on parked vessels, with the intention of scaring the various crews into fleeing. With the Uhumele in front, every ship in the spaceport took off, leaving the Imperials confused and stretched for personnel. ARC-170 starfighters were sent in pursuit of Schurk-Heren and Jennir, though the combined firepower of Jennir's starfighter and the Uhumele held them at bay.

A former slave on Orvax IV himself, Mezgraf told Greenbark and Jennir of the planet's horrors. Greenbark was appalled and extremely worried for his daughter's and wife's safety, though Jennir urged him to remain hopeful for the future. Jennir, however, was having difficulty holding on to that hope himself. He was unsure of what path to take in life, and was frightened at the prospect of the Sith wiping out all of the Jedi. Jennir was also becoming suspicious of Heren's hospitality towards the two of them, and began to wonder if the Yarkora had an ulterior motive in aiding them. He voiced his concerns to Greenbark, though the Nosaurian reasoned that their assisting the Uhumele in getting off-planet made Heren indebted to the pair. Jennir's suspicions did not subside, though."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Schurk-Heren announced that they had arrived at Orvax IV. Mezgraf and Heren believed that it was likely that the Resa and Mesa Greenbark had already been separated and sold, though Bomo and Jennir were determined to track them down. They had realized that, should they locate the group of Nosaurians taken from New Plympto, Bomo would have to leave behind many of his friends when rescuing his family; they would be unable to release so many prisoners in secrecy, though Bomo felt that he would be strong enough to leave his fellow Nosaurians.

On the planet, Mezgraf guided them to where the slaves were kept, though en route they inadvertently caused a Vulptereen driving a swoop bike to collide with a huge, lumbering creature walking on Orvax IV's streets. The creature became flustered and began to stampede through the boulevard. Mezgraf managed to climb onto the beast's back, though, and subdued him, moments before he would have trod upon Jennir. In dismounting the creature, however, Mezgraf accidentally revealed the tattoo on his bicep that marked him as a former slave. A nearby being alerted the T'surr guards to his presence, though Jennir was able to use a mind trick of the Force to dissuade them.

The seller was a wealthy Chagrian by the name of Orso Meeto; after using some more overt methods, Jennir discovered he lived in a penthouse apartment in one of Orvax IV's richer districts, and that he would be staying in his home that evening. Armed with just a single blaster pistol, Jennir ascended the many stories of the building until he reached Meeto's abode. He climbed up onto a balcony, opening a set of doors into a room where Meeto was watching a holographic Chagrian female dancing. Before Meeto could summon his guards, Jennir held him at gunpoint, showing him a tiny holograph of Resa Greenbark, and asked where the girl was currently. Meeto responded that she had been sold to a man from Esseles named Dezono Qua. With all the information he needed, Jennir was left with a difficult decision: kill Meeto and escape without incident, or leave him alive and able to warn Qua. Realizing that he would be departing the path of the Jedi forever, Jennir fired at him from point-blank range, killing him instantly. He initially felt that he had made the right decision, and was exhilarated by the freedom of not having to follow the Jedi Code. The Chagrian's guards, however, entered the room at the sound of the shot. Jennir dodged their blaster bolts and leaped out the balcony window, beginning a lengthy plummet towards a domed building.

He handed over Dezono Qua's coordinates, and Bomo thanked him profusely, but Jennir wished to be left alone. He mulled over what he had said to Kai Hudorra on Coruscant, that he would continue to be a Jedi, but realized that in just a few months, he had already made a great many compromises and had committed foul deeds.

Qua was a recluse, and though the local authorities had suspicions about him, his bribes dissuaded them from looking into things. Jennir told the others that Qua's fortress was guarded solely by battle droids, and volunteered himself and Greenbark to carry out the raid on the mansion, since they both knew the capabilities and limitations of battle droids from their time serving in the Clone Wars.

Greenbark, Meekerdin-maa, and Janks made for where the droids could be deactivated, while Heren, Mezgraf, and Ko Vakier assaulted the mansion's ground floor. Jennir used the Force to leap up onto the higher levels of the fortress, using the abilities afforded to him as a Jedi to destroy any droids he came across as he traveled towards Qua's location.

Qua simply mocked them, telling them that Resa, like all the other younglings he had purchased, was dead\u2014he had eaten her. Bomo, Ko Vakier, and Mezgraf all prepared to attack the Human, but Jennir reacted the quickest, shooting him three times in the chest. Bomo was furious at Jennir for killing Qua; the Nosaurian wanted to find vengeance himself, and shouted that Jennir had no right to kill the man.

His search for a job led him to a shady Cato Neimoidian cantina, reputed as a place to find off-the-record jobs without hassle. As each job offer was posted directly by the client, who then chose from its applicants, it was a closed system for hiring mercenaries, smugglers, and their ilk, hidden from the Empire.

After noting that some of the slaves the Spicers used as labor were Nosaurians, H2 went back to the ship, leaving Jennir to wreak havoc on the gang members. Using the \"Sword Law\" against the Spicers, Jennir used his blaster with extreme prejudice. As he took down the guards, Jennir noted how his role had changed; as a Jedi, he had been a peacekeeper, whereas now, without laws or the Republic, he had become a peacemaker, working against those who preyed on the helpless. After breaking a standoff with a guard who threatened a Nosaurian slave (who had recognized Jennir), he told the slaves to take the Spicer's ships and leave for a safer place, saying that he still had work to do. He then returned to Telerath, after leaving a knife from one of the Slavers that would be easily identified."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon his arrival, Jennir met again with Demanna, who brought him into the estate - and presence - of his master, Boss Musori. At Musori's command, Demanna engaged Jennir to test his skill with a sword. Jennir struggled somewhat, being more used to handling a lightsaber, but managed to give a good account of himself nonetheless.

Jennir immediately departed, and upon finding the young man, reasoned with him, explaining the difference between strength and honor.

As Dado remarked in astonishment that they were breaking the Sword Law, Jennir replied that the erupted war had nothing to do with honor, only destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jennir returned with Dado to Ember's Fire and encouraged everyone to escape, but it was too late; Chankeli had figured out Jennir's machinations and reported to Ken-Kiba, who came back to the hotel with her just in time to capture Jennir and commence beating him for the damage he'd caused. With help from Nikollane, he escaped through a trapdoor to the river below, where he was rescued by Fish. He awoke the next morning in Fish's house, where his retainer brought him up to speed on what had happened the night before. The Slavers were all dead (with the notable exception of Demanna), and Ember Chankeli was being held prisoner by Ken-Kiba, who believed that she had manipulated him through Jennir for her own benefit.

When he awoke, it was morning and the creature's leg was fully healed. Jennir then proceeded to catch up to the slavers. He attacked the caravan directly, and fought his way through them before reaching Chankeli and her fellow captive, Maddie. Unfortunately, Sang had caught up to him as well and disabled the hover barge, causing Chankeli to fall overboard. Deflecting sniper fire from Sang, Jennir was unable to help her. Chankeli pleaded with Jennir to take Maddie and run, which Jennir was forced to do. Finding refuge in a valley, Jennir instructed his mount to protect Maddie and guide her back to her village.

He guessed that Sang was in hiding, expecting him to just walk up. Therefore, he disguised H2 as himself with his cloak and hat to simply walk up to Chankeli; Sang shot the droid, after which Jennir revealed himself. As he threw the assassin against the barge, Sang revealed that it was H2 who had brought him there. Denozo Qua's family had hired him to hunt down Qua's murderers.

Jennir then feared that Chankeli met the same fate, only for Bomo to reveal that she was alive and recovering aboard the Uhumele. Jennir then impulsively ran into her room and kissed her, causing the crew to decide to leave them alone. He then broke off the kiss and stated his regret, as Jedi were supposed to control their feelings. Chankeli became concerned for Maddie's safety; Jennir went to Schurk-Heren to request that they return to Prine, but was refused, as an Imperial battle cruiser was searching the planet for him. Eventually the conversation shifted to Darth Vader as well as Sahdett himself, whom Jennir did not know. Schurk-Heren explained that he was another Jedi, but had assumed Jennir did in fact know him. Jennir explained that there had been thousands of Jedi, and while it was possible that they had met before, he did not remember.

Jennir felt a need to repay Bomo Greenbark for saving his life in the aftermath of Order 66; he forsake the principles he believed in to try to find and rescue Bomo's family.
