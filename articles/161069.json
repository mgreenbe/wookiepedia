While Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were on planet Utapau on a mission during the Clone Wars, their Dactillion rides were shot down by an Amani working with Sugi arms dealers and the Confederacy of Independent Systems wielding a precision laser dart. The Devaronian Cikatro Vizago, criminal leader of the Broken Horn Syndicate, carried a Vilmarh's Revenge. The weapon was easy to customize to one's liking, as the barrel adapter could fit various kinds of attachments. Vizago's pistol, for example, had a barrel shroud with cooling vents. The Vilmarh's Revenge pistol also had a pressure-sensitive trigger. Increased pressure on the trigger would result in an increased rate of fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
