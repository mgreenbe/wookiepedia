He and the rest of the Republic troops used Republic gunships to make their way to Point Rain, but heavy anti-aircraft fire stalled their forces. As they reassembled their troops, Jet requested air support from Admiral Wullf Yularen, but Yularen informed him that they could not as it would overextend their forces. Eventually, Jet met up with Mundi and a group of clone flametroopers, who followed Mundi into a cave that Mundi believed would be the quickest route to the rendezvous point.
