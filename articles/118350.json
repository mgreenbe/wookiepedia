They were spread over the galaxy, their original homeworld forgotten, even to them. They had two theories about their origins: the first being that they were descended from thousands of musicians hired out to a world swept clean of artists, the second that they were the descendants of mercenaries deployed against an Inner Rim threat. The second gained credence due to the fact that the Ryn contained many military words and phrases, most notably the fact that the words for non-Ryn and civilian were related."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to their homelessness, musical talent, natural secrecy, and avoidance of written records, Ryn developed a nomadic culture and a reputation for confidence games, leaving many species prejudiced against them. In some sectors it was legal to enslave or hunt Ryn. Their language was outlawed in many locations, and a large number of Ryn women were used as slave breeding stock."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The largest concentration of Ryn was located in the Corporate Sector due to the fact that it was far from those who would persecute them. Also, a Ryn healer saved the life of a CSA Executive officer. The Ryn claimed to have invented sabacc, originally as a means of divination. They were a very musical people, being able to play their beak-like noses like flutes. They could even call droids with them, by being able to play pitches very precisely."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War, a number of Ryn refugees were based on Duro, and later attempted to settle in Senex-Juvex following that world's fall.
