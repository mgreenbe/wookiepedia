The pirates had long planned to invade Tammuz-an and to that end captured Tosh's team as a step to keeping Tammuz-an in a weaker position for their imminent attack. But the pirates underestimated Tosh and his allies which led to a series of events that scattered the pirates (damaging their base in the process) and allowed for Tosh and his friends to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Tammuz-an was one that the pirates had long wanted to attack. But a successful attack in part depended upon Tammuz-an's fuel situation which provided the pirates a chance. Their plan was to prevent fuel being delivered to the planet in an effort to weaken their fleet to make them easier targets when the pirates decided to attack. But King Mon Julpa decided to send his allies to transport fuel supplies before the pirates could find them. Jessica Meade and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 oversaw this assignment with Jann Tosh as their escort; the pirates attacked and boarded the ship before capturing Meade and the droids. Tosh was tractor beamed alongside the freighter and taken to the pirate's mountain base on Tarnoonga."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ren decided that Tosh would be fed to the Miridon creature in the ocean and the following morning was dropped into the ocean; the droids in turn dove in to save him and fled the creature when it began to give chase. The three manage to outmaneuver the Miridon in a sunken ship before heading towards the base and cutting through a net that had been installed to prevent the Miridon from entering it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meade prepared her own escape and attempted but failed to distract Ren with a remote seeker droid before managing to fool Ren's henchman and getting back towards her ship while using the blast doors to trap her captor. It was at this stage that Tosh and the droids attempted to find Meade before departing even though the pirates became aware of their efforts and tried giving chase. The three commandeered a sea skimmer to shake off their pursuers but the Miridon entered the base and focused on the pirates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ren meanwhile managed to confront Tosh and the droids before Meade subdued him in a net.

But Tosh and the droids were captured though managed to once more elude their pirate captors and causing chaos after sabotaging them.
