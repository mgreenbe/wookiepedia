Prior to 2975 BBY, Lord Hilts, at the advice of his wife Grand Consort Iliana Hilts, assigned Squab to work for his rival, High Lord Korsin Bentado, as an aide. By doing so, the Hilts rankled Bentado by forcing him to include a deformed Keshiri among his retinue of otherwise physically perfect Human staff.

Squab and his Sith master Bentado were among the surviving Sith members of the Ebon Fleet. They then traveled to the Alanciari capital of Sus'mintri where the Sith forces infiltrated Vaal Hall, the headquarters of the Alanciari government, and wiped out the War Cabinet.

He used Vaal Hall's semaphore system to communicate with Hilts and warned his master about Bentado's plot. Bentado was also opposed by another High Lord, Edell Vrai, who had recruited an Alanciari guide named Quarra Thayn. While Vrai and Thayn sparred with Bentado and his bodyguards, Squab secretly countermanded Bentado's orders to destroy the Good Omen and allowed Hilts' airship to land safely in Port Melephos, a coastal port in Alanciar. In the end, Bentado was personally executed by Squab, who informed his master that Hilts had sent his \"regards\" to Bentado.

As with all of the Keshiri who had lived on the continent of Keshtah Minor since 5000 BBY, Squab was taught to revere and worship the Sith Tribe as the descendants of the Protectors, ancient gods in Keshiri religion. He was a servant of the ruling Grand Lord Varner Hilts and his wife Iliana Hilts. In 2980 BBY, Iliana and Hilts assigned Squab to work as an aide for High Lord Korsin Bentado, the leader of the Korsinite League and the designated commander of the invasion fleet that would invade \"Keshtah Major\", another continent in the planet Kesh's southern hemisphere.

The Tribe's chief engineer Edell Vrai eventually developed airships, which were held aloft by helium. While Bentado was unhappy to hire the hunchbacked Keshiri, he feigned delight and accepted Squab into his retinue of \"perfect\" human specimens. As the leader of the Korsinite League, Bentado revered the Tribe's founder Yaru Korsin and his daughter Nida Korsin, and regarded the Testament of Yaru Korsin as scripture. The Hilts had assigned Squab to work with Bentado because they knew that the High Lord secretly harbored ambitions of usurping the Grand Lordship from Varner Hilts. Squab was part of Iliana's spy ring and he was assigned to keep an eye on Bentado in the event that the latter was plotting to overthrow the Hilts family.

However, his airships were shot down by the native Keshiri, who called themselves the Alanciari and their homeland Alanciar. Despite these heavy losses, Edell and six other crew members survived and they managed to capture the Alanciari sailing vessel Mischance, which they would use to sail back to Keshtah by the Sea of Flames. In addition, the Sith party also captured two Alanciari: the signal officer Jogan Halder and his secret lover Wardmaster Quarra Thayn. While Edell's crew returned to Keshtah, he and Quarra remained behind for a ground reconnaissance mission into Alanciar's interior and capital of Sus'mintri. Edell's thoughtcrier Taymor also managed to transmit a telepathic warning that the expedition had encountered trouble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, she was killed before she could finish the message and the Iliana's thoughtcriers only received a garbled message of surprise, shock and confusion. Despite the poor intelligence on the Keshiri in Keshtah Major, Squab's liege High Lord Bentado insisted on proceeding with the invasion. He requested an audience with Grand Lord Hilts and was accompanied by Squab and eight other Korsinite League members. During the meeting, Squab carried a note which showed that Bentado's listeners had intercepted Taymor's call a few hours ago; confirming that Edell had finally found the \"hidden land\" that Korsin had revealed to them. While Hilts suggested that Bentado wait until Edell return, Bentado reiterated that the Grand Lord had already promised that if they found anything, his forces would immediately be ready to strike.

Squab joined Bentado and his followers in kneeling before the Grand Lord of the Tribe. However, he caught the hint a moment too late and nearly hit the floor trying to follow suit. Unknown to Bentado and his followers, Grand Lord Hilts and his Consort were secretly planning to send the Ebon Fleet to their doom.

Squab accompanied Korsin Bentado and served aboard his flagship Yaru which contained a mixed crew of Human Sith warriors and Keshiri servants, who served as translators. However, the Alanciari had prepared for the arrival of the Sith for the past two millennia. In 4975 BBY, the Keshiri exile Adari Vaal had fled to Alanciar and warned the locals about the Tribe. As a result, the Alanciari evolved into a warlike and industrialized civilization that was built around resisting a Sith invasion. Due to their well-trained and equipped military and effective semaphore communications network, the Alanciari were able to mobilize several ballistae units within minutes. These fired flaming javelins at the Sith airships, downing several of them and killing many of the Sith invaders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bentado's flagship Yaru was hit in the gondola by several flaming javelins.

Squab survived the crash as did his master Bentado and several Sith warriors and Keshiri servants. Bentado suffered several burns on his head and a broken leg from the fall. Despite the disaster at the Western Shield, Bentado and the surviving crew of his dirigible managed to escape the battlefield and traveled to Sus'mintri, the capital of Alanciar and the headquarters of the War Cabinet, Alanciar's military government.

Thus, Bentado was able to control Alanciar from behind the scenes and immediately used the signal tower to order the Alanciari sentries to deliver food. In addition, they used the signal tower's thoughtcrier facilities to order the Alanciari military to bring their Sith captives to Vaal Hall, where they were reunited with their Sith comrades. The Sith were also able to lure Quarra Thayn, a former thoughtcrier in the Alanciari military, and her Sith captor Edell Vrai into the building.

Within a minute, the shrill whistles above Sus'mintri stopped and this effect was also felt throughout the entire continent. He then ordered Squab to bring the other Keshiri servants in the signal tower to a ready state in preparation for the next wave of Sith from Keshtah Minor.

He also compared the Keshiri on Alanciar favorably to their counterparts on Keshtah, and dismissed Squab as a \"waste of flesh\" which Hilts had saddled him with. While the Tribe's founder Yaru Korsin had found sculptors and painters, Bentado had encountered a warrior race of builders and armorers.

Bentado attacked Edell with Force lightning but Quarra managed to wound the former with her hand-ballista. They then escaped into Adari Vaal's secret library, which was hidden behind a tapestry of the ancient Herald. Bentado's men pursued them but were unable to find them.

Bentado ordered Squab to order the Alanciari to dispatch uvak diamong-flak teams to shoot it down. Bentado knew that the Tribe had just sixteen airships left and was hoping that Hilts would have sent them all. However, Hilts had by then learnt about the military capabilities of the Alanciari from Edell's lieutenant Peppin and had mounted a grand deception operation designed to convince the Alanciari that the Tribe did not pose a threat to them.

Shortly later, Quarra emerged and startled Squab. One of Bentado's female followers then attempt to aid Bentado but Edell shoved her aside by using the Force. This distraction enabled Bentado to recover and snare Edell's ankle, causing him to fall to the ground.

While Quarra could undo Bentado's grip on Alanciar from the tower, Edell feared that she could bring a host of Alanciari on his head. Before Quarra could pursue Squab, Bentado used the Force to throw her against one of the lower belfies, knocking away her lightsaber. Standing over the Keshiri woman, Bentado threatened to kill her unless Edell stayed away from him. In response, Edell threatened Squab with his lightsaber.

After Squab emerged from hiding, Bentado ordered the Keshiri to pick up Quarra's lightsaber while he took care of his two enemies himself. Bentado intended to execute his two wounded opponents but was interrupted by a message from Squab. Squab had received a parchment from another of Bentado's other Keshiri servants which carried the news that Grand Lord Hilt's airship had landed at Port Melephos.
