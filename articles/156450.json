The ferry droid had the appearance of an R-series astromech droid, though it had been modified to have legs and two sets of arms, which he used to row the boat down the river. When Din Djarin, Cara Dune, Greef Karga, and IG-11 were attempting to escape Moff Gideon's forces with Grogu, they boarded the droid's keelboat, and the droid began to take them downriver. However, Djarin noticed a number of stormtroopers waiting for them at the end of the tunnel, and Dune urged the droid to stop the boat. When the droid continued to row, Dune shot the droid's head off, but his destruction did not stop the boat from moving."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ferry droid first appeared in \"Chapter 8: Redemption\" of The Mandalorian.
