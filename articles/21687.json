During the war against the First Order, he served as a heavy weapons expert in the Resistance military. In 35 ABY, Hansid was amongst the Resistance personnel stationed in a base on the jungle moon Ajan Kloss who traveled to the planet Exegol to battle the fleet of the First Order and Sith Eternal. Hansid was part of the Resistance's ground forces, whose target was a navigation tower that was necessary for the fleet to leave Exegol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ground forces traveled to Exegol in the YC-123B transport hauler Fortitude, but upon their arrival, the Sith fleet switched the navigation signal from the tower to the command ship Steadfast. On General Finn's orders, the Fortitude landed on the hull of the Steadfast and the ground forces deployed onto the starship, where they battled the Sith troopers and Sith Jetpack Troopers of the Sith Eternal army. Ultimately Finn and the former stormtrooper Jannah managed to disable the navigation signal, at which point the Resistance ground forces withdrew back into the Fortitude. Hansid was amongst these forces, but Finn and Jannah remained to destroy the ship entirely. When General Poe Dameron contacted the transport, Hansid was stood with others who had survived the battle next to technician Rose Tico as she informed Dameron that Finn was not on board. The Resistance ultimately won the battle and then returned to Ajan Kloss to celebrate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Witnessing the First Order's technology fail on his homeworld only strengthened Hansid's preference for the weaponry and gear he used to be as straightforward and uncomplicated as possible. He was distrustful of electronics and of droids, the latter of which was rare in the Resistance. Hansid had fair skin, brown hair and gray eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hansid wore a camouflage tunic over a brown shirt and used a similarly camoflauged hat with a glare-blocking visor brim. In battle he favored a HH-12 rocket launcher with an optical scope, a design that had not been touched since the Galactic Civil War with its optics merely being shaped lenses and its targeting system by eye."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Byrco Hansid was created for the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
