They were native to Tertiary Kesmere. Their personalities were marked by an inherent aggressiveness which made them dangerous but useful as pets. One hornaguant called Grendel was kept by the droid information-broker 8t88. This same Grendel later ate his owner's head but was then killed by Kyle Katarn who sought to retrieve it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
