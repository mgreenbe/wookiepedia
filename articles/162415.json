During the initial start of their mission, WAC piloted on a collision course to get the Providence-class Dreadnought's attention. After boarding the dreadnought, WAC was able to distract the battle droids stationed at the dreadnoughts vault. After acquiring the Encryption module, WAC and the rest of the squad were then confronted by the dreadnought's super tactical droid, Aut-O.
