The towers were made of mirrsteel and stood as tall as Wroshyr trees from the planet Kashyyyk. They were joined by a number of pedestrian bridges which reminded the Wookiee Chewbacca of the mazes down in the shadowlands on his home planet. Found near the Sasal Center and the Wauth Complex, they were visible from Chewbacca's quarters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
