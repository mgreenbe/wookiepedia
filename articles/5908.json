He represented his house in the annual inter-house Vor-cal safari hunt in which he once came second. Lord Adannon was a loud and arrogant man who was angered when his house Privy Council disinvited him from representing Cadriaan at the Vor-cal shortly before the battle of Endor. He had broad shoulders and often wore a reptilian hide cloak that he claimed was from a Krayt dragon but was in reality from a Rodian Swamp Lizard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
