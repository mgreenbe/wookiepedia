He captained a pirate ship and among his crew was the Twi'lek Force Adept Reeayah, who Dorel had a very close working relationship with. During the Confederation Rock Rush in c. 31 BBY, Dorel and his ship were present in the Cularin system asteroid belt. Reeayah used the dark side of the Force to track the Neeva-Beelo, a potential target for the pirates. It docked in an asteroid, so Dorel landed his ship there and along with Reeyah and ten human pirates, he attacked the Beelo's crew, the Heroes of Cularin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
