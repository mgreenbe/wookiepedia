The plants were capable of reaching heights of 16 meters, and protected themselves with spikes. They gathered water from occasional storms, storing the liquid in their spongy leaves and stems for slow use in times of drought. They also grew deep roots to extract liquid from the soil."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Slith often rested in the shade cast by the tall plants."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
