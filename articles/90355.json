The earpieces were made of clear plastic glasses or another unknown component, the latter having wheat-lamps or pilot lamps twinkling randomly (though the rest of the earpiece is opaque), three extra control knobs below the earpieces, and a socket plate on the back hood; as well as having planted-on rivets as well as enameled clear visors. The evaporator controls on the arm portions of the chair were made of a Pearlcorder that would be used to play the cassette tapes. In addition, on the back of the chair were various plastic model kits and dummy doors, as well as a vent and planted-on clear plastic multimeter measurements by Olson Electronics."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
