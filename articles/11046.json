The strike cruiser attempted to negotiate a deal into selling a kidnapped scientist to the Galactic Empire as they were the highest bidder. But they underestimated the Empire. They sent Maarek Stele as a pilot escort for the ransom, and as soon as the transfer was complete he attacked their transport and disabled it. Then the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Red Claw then arrived and trapped the pirates, and the Ayenzii and the R-41 Starchasers were all destroyed, despite interference from the Nami who attempted to capture the scientist and destroy the Red Claw. As for the transport carrying the ransom it was captured."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
