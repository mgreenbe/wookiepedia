Then it flashes back to one week earlier.\nTag and Bink are undercover as Imperial stormtroopers, and are meeting in a Tatooine cantina with Lando Calrissian. Lando is also undercover, posing as Tamtel Skreej. They are discussing their plot to take the Carbonite-encased Han Solo from Boba Fett's ship, Slave I. Lando asks them to hit him and leave, and they do. Soon afterwards, two aliens come up to Lando and offer him a position in Jabba the Hutt's organization."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Tag and Bink attempt to stall Fett with excessive nonsense, while Lando tries to sneak onto Slave I.

He ties them to a pole, and kicks them into the Great Pit of Carkoon. The pole gets lodged in the Sarlacc's gullet. Flash Forward to five days later.\nThe Battle of Carkoon begins above them, and Jabba's thugs begin falling into the Sarlacc. One of them unties Tag and Bink as he falls. The two hang on to the pole as they were in the beginning of the story. They wish for a jetpack to get out, and, lo and behold, Fett falls into the Sarlacc's mouth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, they and Fett escape from the Sarlacc. They make a pact with Fett, saying that they will never reveal that Fett screams like a girl, and that he was not defeated by a blind man swinging a stick. They will say that he was at a bar in Mos Espa, with them and their two sisters. Fett runs off, shouting that they are even. Tag and Bink may not trust him, but they have his gun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"Bob's Big Boy\" logo can be seen on the menus in the cantina.
