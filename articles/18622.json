Jango taught Boba much, training him to become a skilled bounty hunter as was his father-figure before him. In 22 BBY, Jango was killed at the Battle of Geonosis, which opened the Clone Wars.

Though no one in recorded history had ever escaped from the Sarlacc, Fett was able to escape, though not unscathed.

Jango raised and cared for him with the assistance of the Kaminoan, Taun We, who ultimately took on the role of being a foster mother to him. Fett was aware of the fact that he was a clone of his father, however, he would often question his conception. Jango assured his son that he was a \"true clone\" and his real son.

Sometime before the Clone Wars, Boba met Sith Lord Count Dooku (Darth Tyranus), who had hired his father to take up bounties that would be beneficial to him and his master in the events that followed. On one such mission Boba accompanied Jango to the planet of Kuat, where Jango used the boy as bait to lure his bounty into the open. Afraid, the young Fett threw a thermal detonator and fled into the tents. Once he located the boy, the colonist was horrified to learn the young boy was the son of the man sent to kill him. Jango, having finished assassinating the remaining members of the camp, tracked down Boba and demanded that Larbo release his son, slashing his way through the tent's canopy. Disgusted, Larbo asked what kind of man would use his own son as bait, and Boba replied, \"Only a son can know his father's heart\". After killing his bounty, Boba escaped with his father on their ship and informed the Count of their successful mission.

Fett's father, Jango, ordered for Fett to close his closet door containing his armor in Huttese before allowing himself to undergo questioning by the Jedi.

Obi-Wan had actually hid on an asteroid. As the Battle of Geonosis started, Boba stood with Jango on the platform in the Petranaki arena with several Separatist leaders, including Count Dooku, Viceroy Nute Gunray, and Archduke Poggle the Lesser. When Jedi Master Mace Windu arrived, Jango kept Boba from harm as the Jedi task force attempted to rescue the captive Obi-Wan, Anakin Skywalker, and Padm\u00e9 Amidala. During the battle, Boba watched his father get trampled by a reek, and, as a result, eventually beheaded by Mace Windu when Jango attempted to challenge him.

The group went to visit the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance, where Windu was stationed with Anakin Skywalker.

His attempt was nearly successful, as Windu was only saved by chance by a clone trooper, who inadvertently triggered the tripwire instead. With the cruiser on high alert, Aurra Sing urged Fett to bring down the entire cruiser by destroying the main reactor. Though it was against his own wishes, as Fett's desire was to kill only Windu, Fett was forced to go through with her command, and infiltrated the reactor chamber, where he coaxed a clone trooper into handing over his blaster. Using the blaster, Fett destroyed the reactor, compromising the entire ship. Fett managed to regroup with the Youth Brigade as they were loading onto the ship's supply of escape pods. Upon ejection, Fett disabled the pod, allowing the other bounty hunters to pick him up in the Slave I."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon discovering that Windu was still alive, Fett and his allies traveled to the crash site.

Sing also took the time to execute any survivors of the crash, save for Admiral Shoan Kilian and Commander Ponds, as well as an unidentified clone, who she took as hostages. Fett objected to this, as did Castas, who both agreed that the situation was getting out of hand. Windu managed to survive the helmet trap, which was triggered by Anakin Skywalker. The resulting explosion incinerated half of his father's helmet and caused the cruiser's bridge to collapse, pinning the Jedi under the rubble.

Following the Endurance incident, Sing executed Ponds in a holotransmission to Windu, after Boba refused to do it himself. Sing hoped his death would lure Windu to them. After the execution, Sing chose to take refuge on Florrum, where she hoped to get the assistance of her former lover, Hondo Ohnaka, a notorious spice pirate. In a bar on Florrum, Sing overheard a plot by Castas to turn the others in for a bounty, and responded by casually killing him with one shot from a blaster. Her emotionless brutality deeply affected Fett, who really started to see all the horrors he created."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This murder would allow the Jedi to trace Fett and the others to Florrum. However, because of Windu's injuries, Jedi Master Plo Koon and Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, were sent to bring him in. This enraged Fett, who demanded Windu. This confrontation would culminate in a swift firefight in Ohnaka's bar, which began with Fett carelessly taking a shot at Tano. Fett, abandoned by Sing, was apprehended by Koon. Koon brought Fett to Ohnaka, who gave Fett a lecture about his father's honor. Ohnaka managed to convince Fett to give the coordinates of the Slave I and the hostages, being held at riflepoint by Bossk.

Bossk and Latts blackmailed her into joining them in Oked's place, and the six of them traveled to Quarzite. Major Rigosso, their employer, informed them of the details of their job: helping Rigosso deliver a certain chest safely to his Lord, Otua Blank.

In the ensuing battle, the warriors knocked the members of the posse out of the tram one by one and killed Rigosso. Only Fett and Ventress were left. In a duel with the Kage Warriors' leader, Krismo Sodi, Fett inadvertently toppled the chest over and, much to his surprise, caused a young woman to tumble out. As Fett attempted to protect her, she slapped him across the face. Surprised and confused, Fett was caught off guard, allowing Krismo Sodi to leap at him and knock him unconscious. The woman was in fact Pluma Sodi, Krismo's sister, who was to be forcibly married to Otua Blank. Before the siblings could escape, Ventress arrived and defeated Krismo Sodi in a quick duel. Pluma's pleas struck Ventress, since they reminded Ventress of her own past. Fett and Ventress proceeded to argue about Pluma's situation, a heated debate that ended with Ventress choking Fett with the Force. Finally, the tram arrived at the orbital station, where Otua Blank was eagerly anticipating his bride-to-be. After Ventress collected her payment for delivering the chest and departed, Blank opened it and was shocked to see a bound, gagged and extremely angry Boba Fett in Pluma's place; Ventress had been paid by Krismo to release Pluma into his care. Meeting up with the other members of Fett's posse, she split the payment as planned, telling them to make sure Fett received his share and adding that he would \"turn up\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the events on Quarzite, Fett was constantly on the run. He recovered Slave I at one point from Hondo Onhaka, along with his father's armor. Later, Fett managed to secure a minor bounty on an assassin before reaching safety. With nowhere left to go, young Boba found himself in the custody of Jabba Desilijic Tiure, a prominent Hutt crime lord. One of the reasons Jabba accepted Boba was to repay the favor Jango Fett did him by apparently killing Gardulla the Hutt a decade earlier. While working for Jabba the Hutt, Boba had befriended one of Jabba's cooks, Gab'borah, and his daughter, Ygabba (whom he had rescued earlier, after first arriving on Tatooine). In gratitude, the two had Jango Fett's body armor re-sized to fit the young Boba's frame."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gilramos Libkath was the first bounty assigned to Boba by Jabba Desilijic Tiure, the Hutt crime lord of Tatooine. Jabba had also assigned the bounty to Durge as well. Boba had the advantage over Durge of already knowing where to start looking for Libkath. Libkath was the master of Ygabba and the underfed child thieves that had been responsible for stealing his helmet only a day before. After receiving the assignment Boba, realizing he had been left with no weapons and no transportation, sought out Gab'borah, the chef that had helped him while on board Jabba's sail barge. The chef gave him a jetpack and directions to leave the Dune Sea. Boba quickly realized as he flew over the Dune Sea that he wouldn't make the trip to Mos Espa with just a jet pack, and quickly stowed away aboard one of Jabba's cargo barges that was heading towards the city. Once he arrived in Mos Espa, he fled, but was pursued by Durge. After some evasive maneuvering, only to find Durge waiting ahead of him, Boba made his escape by using the reflection from Tatooine's twin suns on Durge's armor as a blind spot, where he dipped low into the streets and alleys of Mos Espa. There he located Gilramos' hideout and followed the voice of his prey to a central location of the crashed starship. Boba initiated the looming confrontation with the toss of a brick that struck Libkath in the back of the head, followed by another. Boba then revealed himself, however, he was weaponless. Suddenly, Durge arrived, ready to take both the bounty and Boba. The young bounty hunter skillfully managed to escape using his jetpack, stealing Libkath's hat on his way out, which represented prestige to the Neimoidian and proof to Jabba of the bounty. Durge fired at Boba and one of his stray blaster bolts struck a fuel cell, causing the ship to explode, covering Fett's escape and killing Libkath in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hunt for Jhordvar had been a short but intense one, leading Boba to the Dune Sea.

He managed to get inside the fortress, Mazariyan, and escaped Nuri by forcing him into a clump of poisonous xabar fungus, which carries a toxin that causes temporary paralysis. However, the arrival of General Grievous foiled his plans, as Fett proved no match for the Kaleesh warrior. Young Fett only survived because he faked his own death by using the xabar fungus.

During this time, Boba repainted his armor, which was identical to Jango Fett's, into the green color scheme that he is most identified with, thus making it his own. Even though Skywalker had helped him repair his ship, he was intent on taking Fett in for violating air space in a Republic controlled military zone. Boba convinced Skywalker, that he had information vital to the Republic's survival; information he would only tell the Supreme Chancellor.

Few details are known, but Fett did seem to consider himself morally superior to Solo, due to the honor that Fett upheld and felt that Solo did not. In Tales of the Bounty Hunters, Fett is portrayed by Daniel Keys Moran as an idealist who strives to maintain the social order and enforce the law without giving consideration to the morality of specific laws. For this reason he hopes to see the Rebel Alliance defeated, as their goal of overthrowing the establishment is in direct opposition to his goal of keeping it in place. During an argument with Leia, he declares that the Galactic Civil War started by the rebellion is morally wrong, describing it as \"An uprising against the authority legally over them, and threatening the system of social justice which permits civilization to exist,\" and with outrage that Solo is \"a mercenary who has never done a decent thing in his life,\" and that \"he deserves punishment because he illegally smuggled spice.\" When Leia points out that Fett's employer, Jabba, has many more criminal deeds to his name than Han does, Fett rationalizes it by saying \"Necessity makes allies. Once the Rebellion is over, I expect the Empire will deal with Jabba. But he is less a threat than the Rebels,\" before putting an end to the conversation. This version of Fett and his belief system was contradicted years later by Attack of the Clones and presumably done away with, though his desire to see the continuation of the current form of government, whatever it may be, may come from his dislike of Count Dooku, who was indirectly responsible for his father's death (and who later betrayed Boba himself). Another possible reason for Fett's hostility towards Solo stems from the incident on Nar Shaddaa where Calrissian and Solo robbed him of all his weapons, including a recently acquired pair of Mandalorian dart shooters that were both rare and valuable. No matter what the reasons, Solo is one of the only people to elude capture by Fett on multiple occasions.
