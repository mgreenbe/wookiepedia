Aiming the CloakShape's concussion-missile launcher at the silo, Skywalker was successful in destroying it, but the powerful blast's shock waves sent his fighter into an out-of-control spiral, down through Nallastia's atmosphere to the moon's surface, where it crash-landed. Skywalker was later retrieved by his Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Bultar Swan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
