In 3951 BBY, the Jedi Knight Meetra Surik killed the Sith Triumvirate's leaders, Darth Sion, Darth Nihilus, and Kreia, and persuaded the prospective Sith Lord Atris to reject the dark side of the Force. Surik and her followers then rejuvenated the Jedi, but despite Surik's successes and the obliteration of other Sith due to in-fighting in 3950 BBY, the Sith Lord survived the conflict, continuing Sith teachings and the usage of the \"Darth\" title. The Sith Lord's actions enabled the organization's traditions to be passed down during the centuries to come."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Lord was mentioned in the 2005 reference book The New Essential Chronology, written by Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
