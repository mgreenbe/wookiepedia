He was a member of the Ranc gang, which was based on the Outer Rim world of Kaddak and led by Wenda and Bett. In 7 ABY, he and the other members of the Ranc gang entered the Rothana Imperial Shipyards with the former stormtroopers Corlac and Terex. Terex managed to use his knowledge of the base to help the gang take over the abandoned shipyards. Corlac along with Wenda and Bett wanted to build a pirate empire.

While Wisper made the gang rich, he never commanded the same level of respect as Terex. In 34 ABY, Terex returned to take back leadership of the Ranc gang. When Wisper objected and tried to reassert his authority over the gang, Zumgi shot him dead with a blaster. Zumgi told Terex that they were all very excited to receive his call and welcomed him back to the gang. Terex thanked him for his loyalty.

Zumgi and his men prevented the mob from taking the bounty on Poe's head by breaking a few skulls. Terex reassured Zumgi that their plan was working and that Poe was a resourceful enemy.

Terex reassured Zumgi that he and the other Rancs were his family. Since they were tracking Poe's T-70 X-wing starfighter which had already entered hyperspace, Terex instructed Zumgi to prepare the fleet and let him know when Poe reentered realspace.

Oddy claimed to be a technician who had accidentally stowed aboard. Zumgi realized that he was lying because he had a blaster in his holster. Zumgi drew a vibroblade and managed to damage Oddy's blaster. However, Oddy kicked him in the torso. When Zumgi taunted his opponent, Oddy Muva responded that he had come to rescue his wife and punched Zumgi under the chin, knocking him to the ground.

Zumgi knew how to shoot a blaster, which he killed Wisper with. As one of Terex's lieutenants, Zumgi knew how to break a few skulls. Zumgi knew how to wield a vibroblade but was outmatched by the Abednedo Resistance agent Oddy Muva.
