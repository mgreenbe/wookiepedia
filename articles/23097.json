The Rodian built the droid by combining the head of an RX-Series pilot droid with the body of a P2-series astromech droid, and he named it Candy because he considered the droid to be a \"sweet tin can.\" Candy resided with Geri in the underground resistance base Mountain Home on the planet Toprawa, and in 18 BBY Geri introduced Candy to the Whiplash operatives Den Dhur and I-5YQ, who had been taken to Mountain Home after being rescued from their stricken starship by the Antarian Rangers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
