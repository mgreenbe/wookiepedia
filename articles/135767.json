Corporal Purpruff of the Alliance to Restore the Republic's Special Forces was equipped with a sticky mine when she traveled to the planet Hoth while scouting for a new location for the Alliance's headquarters. After discovering huge subterranean caverns on Hoth, the corporal tested their structural stability by attaching a sticky mine to a stalactite and detonating it; however, the stalactite did not even shudder during the explosion. Purpruff later included the results of this test as part of a report on Hoth she submitted, which ultimately ended up being included in The Rebel Files, a collection of physical records documenting the history of the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sticky mines were first mentioned in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Rebel Files, which was written by Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
