The journal was eventually rediscovered during Xoddam Lothipp's tenure as Deputy Director, as part of a restoration of the archives led by the archive droid TR-33NA. While in storage the journal had become faded and damaged, and so the archivists were unable to determine its author, although some claimed the sketches resembled the work of the Ithorian Gammit Chond. The archivists then restored the journal, pairing the sketches and annotations with data from their scientific records."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
