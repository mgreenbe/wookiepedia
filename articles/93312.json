The bar was located on the north side of the common room, left of the entrance in relation to an entering patron. A stage was located across the common room opposite the entrance and on the east end of the cantina. Vik was the cantina's male Devaronian bartender, and was kept informed of the goings on in Mos Shuuta. He was tending the bar when a group of adventurers entered to hide from Gamorrean guards sent by Teemo the Hutt to capture them. After the group had a brief encounter with the guards, Vik expressed that they would need to get off-planet, and informed them of a freighter docked at Landing Bay Aurek. He stated, however, that the ship belonged to a Trandoshan bounty hunter named Trex, and that they would need to replace its hypermatter reactor igniter before they escaped with it. After directing them to local junk shop owner for a possible source for an igniter, Vorn Tel-Ovis, Vik then ordered them to get out of his bar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The name of the cantina is revealed on the back page of each folio in the image of a coaster with the logo depicting a silhouetted profile of the spaceport, and the name of the cantina written in both High Galactic characters and in Galactic Basic Standard around the circular edge.
