The occupation was resisted by the Wookiees with repeated uprisings, but resulted in vicious retaliation by the Empire. A large Imperial force remained on Kashyyyk after the Battle of Endor, led by Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck. Tolruck had the local population subjugated by use of inhibitor chips and even hunted Wookiees for sport on top of imprisoning them in the repurposed prison ship Ashmead's Lock and using them for slave labor. The Empire's occupation of Kashyyyk was ultimately ended in 5 ABY, when it was liberated by the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
