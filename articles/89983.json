Rather than let their business be shut down and submit to capture, her parents tried to kill the Jedi and went down fighting. Mika held a grudge against the Jedi for the rest of her life. Eventually, she was brought into the bounty hunting business by Stroth. Over the years she rose to power in Crimson Nova, and became the group's leader. She developed a romantic bond with fellow Farghul Harll."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Mika accepted a bounty for several Jedi from Kh'aris Fenn. Officially she was in it for the credits but unofficially she was out for revenge. Jedi Masters Mace Windu, Agen Kolar, Kit Fisto, and Saesee Tiin came to her hideout to stop this contract, which led to Harll's death. Mika was stunned by Stroth when she refused to surrender to the Jedi, and was then arrested by the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mika's daughter, Breela, became a bounty hunter around the time of the Battle of Yavin.
