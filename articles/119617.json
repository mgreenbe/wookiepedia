He brought it to a deep-space rendezvous point within the Tapani sector in the year 23 BBY to meet with Margravine Quenelle of Nallastia to negotiate salvage rights in a Jedi Order-sponsored attempt to avoid a civil war. Rodd kept a CloakShape fighter and a Z-95 Headhunter aboard the salvage hauler. He allowed the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker to borrow them during their mission to the Fondor system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both Rodd and Quenelle claimed salvage rights to what they said they believed was the Sun Runner, an ancient vessel that had recently, by all outward appearances, reappeared (the derelict was, in fact, a counterfeit ship fabricated by Groodo the Hutt in a scheme to destroy the Fondor Shipyards and surface factories). Jedi Knight Bultar Swan, with Kenobi and Skywalker also present, oversaw the salvage rights negotiations within the salon pod of the Republic cruiser Unitive. If an agreement wasn't reached within one standard hour and fifteen minutes, however, Rodd professed that he was worried that the Sun Runner would drift into the Rimma Trade Route, and all parties involved would inevitably lose any claim they might have to pirates or Kuat Drive Yards salvagers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But when both Fondorian and Nallastian representatives refused to budge, Swan appealed to Kenobi for help. Kenobi's deciding judgment, which he was on the verge of presenting, was forestalled, however, when the cruiser's lights went out and a ship-wide power surge fried every onboard system. The Unitive commandeer, Captain Pietrangelo, located the negotiation group and explained that the surge had been caused when the Sun Runner's sublight engines fired, and Swan put an end to the negotiations in order to stop the alleged ancient ship and rescue any potential innocents trapped aboard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Rodd led Kenobi and Skywalker through a Unitive docking tube to the salvage hauler, where his CloakShape and Z-95 Headhunter awaited them. The Jedi used the starships to infiltrate and destroy the false Sun Runner, thus foiling Groodo's plot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
