Until the late 1980s it boasted 6 large stages, all used by George Lucas for the original Star Wars trilogy. The largest Stage 6 was built specifically for Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back in 1979. This sprawling studio facility housed a complete film unit of costume, construction, and film-processing departments. A substantial portion of the complex was razed to the ground (including Stage 6) and is now the site of a supermarket. The result being that very little of the prequels were filmed at the Studio. Only a few pick-up shots for Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith were shot there. Fox Studios, Sydney and Leavesden Studios were used instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The studio has begun rejuvenation with a newly constructed George Lucas Stage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
