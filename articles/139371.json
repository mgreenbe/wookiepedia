An angry Crater told Emil that he needed the laser welder to fix the  power stabilizers and that Noni knew that his repulsors were not working like they should so he couldn't fly up and steal the laser welder back. Crater never understood the Graf family obsession with Kowakain monkey-lizards, including his grandfather, Milo Graf who Crater tried to convince to get a more appealing pet. The BB-series astromech droid, BB-00 beeped to Emil about Crater's complaining, Emil agreed but acknowledged that Crater had a point.
