Abrams. After developing his story, Johnson pitched it to Abrams for approval. Johnson explained: \"From the very start, Kathy [Kennedy] at Lucasfilm, but also Bob Iger, Alan Horn, Alan Bergman, the folks at Disney that we dealt with, they not only allowed to make the movie I wanted to make, I was actively encouraged to find what was personal in it and to go after that.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Johnson partially derived his story from one of George Lucas's ideas for Episode VII, in which Luke lives in seclusion in a Jedi temple and reluctantly trains a young girl named Kira.

[\u2026.] I started by writing the names of each of the characters, and thinking, 'What's the hardest thing they could be faced with?'\" While writing, Johnson regularly met with the Lucasfilm Story Group and members of the cast to share ideas and drafts of the script; \"For me, I outline outline outline, and I notebook notebook notebook, then the last 10 percent of the process is actually typing the script. I plan it all out first. So while I was doing that, I was going in twice a week and sitting down and just vomiting these ideas out and talking them through with Kiri Hart and her whole group.\" Johnson also screened select classic films such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, Gunga Din, Letter Never Sent, Sahara, Three Outlaw Samurai, To Catch a Thief, and Twelve O'Clock High."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was some confusion over Abrams' relationship with Johnson's script.

[\u2026] We also knew that certain things were inevitable in our minds but that didn't mean it would be inevitable for whoever came in next.\" \"Larry Kasdan and I, who wrote the script together, definitely were setting things up and were conscious of the fact\u2026 which is a really weird opportunity in features to know that this was going to be the beginning of a three-picture story. So we were working on versions of what we knew we would have done or wanted to do and had meetings with Rian and Ram [Bergman], who is a producer, very early on and went over what we were thinking. But also knew that Rian had his own ideas coming in. He was going to take this thing in the place that he felt right.\" \"So the story he told took what we were doing and went in the direction that he felt was best but that is very much in line with what we were thinking as well.\" Greg Grunberg also claimed that Abrams was so impressed by the script that he regretted not directing it himself. Abrams later clarified: \"I think that my enthusiasm for VIII is enormous. I think [Grunberg] also might have invented a couple of the quotes that he gave, but I am very much excited for and very jealous of anyone, especially Rian, who gets to work so closely with this extraordinary cast and crew.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Production"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Preliminary filming took place in September 2015 on Skellig Michael, an island off the coast of mainland Ireland.
