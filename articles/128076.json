There, they found two prisoners, Katt Mol and Lika, walking in the jungle. Sochek killed Lika with his blaster after Ratter killed Katt Mol. Later, the Padawans that were also captured as prey formed a group to stop the Trandoshans. This group consisted of Ahsoka Tano, O-Mer and Jinx."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sochek was later present alongside Lo-Taren and the Trandoshan leader, Garnac, near a crashed HCT-2001 Dragonboat-class Reugeot 905 freighter that had been sabotaged by the Padawans, resulting in the death of both pilots of the ship and the release of their latest prisoner, Chewbacca the Wookiee. Sochek and the rest of the Trandoshan crew were present on the Trandoshan floating fortress when it was attacked by the Padawans and the Wookiee. At first, the Trandoshans managed to outnumber them, but the tide had turned in the Padawans' favor when a group of Wookiee soldiers\u2014having been contacted earlier by Chewbacca\u2014arrived. As the fight proceeded, Lo-Taren and Sochek hid behind a hover pod and fired at the Wookiees. However, one of the Wookiees killed Lo-Taren, distracting Sochek to mourn his death. But in the distraction, Jinx used the Force to raise the hover pod, allowing the same Wookiee to fire at Sochek, killing him too."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sochek's name and physical appearance are a reference to Walter Sobchak, a character in the 1998 comedy film The Big Lebowski."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
