Including its own power generator to keep it functioning no matter the state of any external power supply, it was designed with simplicity in mind and could be quickly set up from pre-fabricated parts at any Imperial installation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The flak pods had an extremely high rate of fire, blasting high-velocity projectiles that ignored shields and detonated with an air-burst effect at any airborne target. Short intervals between firing were required to prevent the turret from overheating, however. They could be manually directed to fire at ground targets, but their specialized anti-aircraft rounds were practically useless against armor plate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bp.5 was part of a series of basic turrets built by Taim & Bak specifically for sale to the Imperial Army in order to give them an edge in the competitive Galactic weapons market. It was readily adopted by Imperial garrisons and saw widespread action, particularly earlier in the Galactic Civil War. Other turrets in the series included the Bp.2 anti-infantry turret and the Bp.4 anti-vehicle turret."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
