They began by conquering the planet of Taris before advancing their forces to carve three paths through Republic territory. One path took Mandalorians through the Zongorlu system, where they won a battle, and that group split between those that would attack an arboreal world, Ithor, and those that moved to assault the planet of Ord Mantell, one of the Republic's Ordnance/Regional Depots. Mandalorians harassed and conquered the Zabrak colonies in the Outer Rim Territories at this time as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle on Ord Mantell was one of many the Mandalorians won during their invasion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Ord Mantell, the Mandalorians moved on to take the planet of Iridonia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 24 ABY, historian Vilnau Teupt mentioned the battle at Ord Mantell in an overview of the Mandalorian Wars during his delivery of the keynote address at the 412th Proceedings of Galactic Anthropology and History, in which he spoke on the Mandalorian race's development."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was first referenced in The Essential Atlas.
