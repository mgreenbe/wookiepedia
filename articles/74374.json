Preserved in ancient Kashoonara folklore was the story of Hurrungat, the bringer of twilight. He was believed to emerge from the underworld to bind together the day and the night to form dusk and morning. In The Twilight Chant, the Kashoonara implored Hurrungat to lead them into darkness. Hurrungat was believed to ride upon a giant humbaba known as Aarwynn. Standing six Kashoonara tall at its shoulder, Aarwynn was considered the first of the humbabas. Because of Aarwynn's central role in their mythology, the Kashoonara considered all humbabas to be sacred. Consequently, in recorded history of the Kashoonara, no humbabas were ever hunted for food, and the Kashoonara would even defend them from offworlders. Other figures in Kashoonara folklore included the Tree-Queen and the Tyrant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kashoonara armament included the halberd, several meters in length.

The Kashoonara rebelled against this invasion, but were initially brutally oppressed by the Empire. Under the Imperial occupation, the Kashoonara did what they could to protect the humbabas from stormtrooper attacks, but despite their best efforts, a great many of the creatures were killed. The Kashoonara later received aid from the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Utilizing guerrilla warfare tactics and making use of the humbabas, the Alliance drove the Empire off Kashoon, freeing the natives from Imperial domination."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following that victory, the Kashoonara were largely left alone by the Alliance, although occasional offworlders visited the planet.
