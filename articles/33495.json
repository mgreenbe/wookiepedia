To almost everyone who knew him, Kretch was a lonely, unhappy man with a domineering spouse and a minor position in his planet's bureaucracy. However, his frequent \"business trips\" were actually spent pursuing fugitives from Imperial justice. Kretch used his connections in the Imperial bureaucracy to get the information necessary for his hunts. He hoarded the credits from his bounties, intending to save up enough to leave his mundane existence for good."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on the hunt, Kretch carried a blaster carbine, a hold-out blaster, stun grenades, and various explosive devices.
