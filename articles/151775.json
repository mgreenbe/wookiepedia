It was in that capacity that he met with two squads of clone commandos at Republic Intelligence headquarters, where he tasked them with a mission to the Mid Rim world of Ord Mantell. The officer explained that a diplomatic package bound for Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from Malastare diplomats had been intercepted and stolen by a gang of Trandoshan bounty hunters, who were aiming to sell it to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Because of its importance, the ARC trooper tasked the two squads to travel to Ord Mantell and reacquire the package from the Trandoshans, in order to deliver it to the Republic capital of Coruscant. The package was successfully recovered and the Trandoshan mercenaries killed. However, all of the commandos in both squads perished during the mission, with the exception of Sergeant RC-1013."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of Jango Fett, the ARC officer stood at 1.83 meters in height. Many ARC troopers were personally trained as an ARC trooper by Fett and possessed the Mandalorian's ruthlessness and efficiency. These troopers were trained to be self-sufficient, although they were not entirely independent, and were also taught to rely on themselves, although they were not completely independent. The ARC officer wore a set of Phase I class armor, equipped with a blast-dampening kama and a rank-signifying pauldron; the armor itself was adorned with yellow markings. The yellow markings most likely signify the rank of a Commander. He expected both squads of commandos to risk their lives in order to ensure a successful retrieval of the diplomatic package."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ARC intelligence officer was introduced in the short story The Package, which was one of four comics compiled in the third volume of the Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures trade paperbacks.
