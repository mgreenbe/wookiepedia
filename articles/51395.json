The droid was tasked with the difficult primary objective of keeping Gerrera alive, as he had previously inhaled near-lethal levels of Geonosian insecticide, and much of his body had been replaced with cybernetics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During its treatment of Gerrera, G2-1B7 worked out of the Partisans' base in the Catacombs of Cadera on the moon Jedha, where it was regularly deactivated in order to prevent it from building up an ethical case to stop Gerrera's treatment. Gerrera's disability was so severe that droid also had to be heavily modified in order to bypass programming that would stop it dispensing the dangerous amount of drugs that he needed to function. G2-1B7 treated Gerrera and the other Partisans from a diagnostic station that included a refitted flight chair, a plethysmograph, and an analysis computer that tracked the purging of the insecticide from Gerrera's lungs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 0 BBY, G2-1B7 was present in Gerrera's quarters when he was reunited with his former ward, Jyn Erso. The droid stood stationary in a corner of the room while Gerrera showed Erso a holographic message from her father, Galen Erso. When the message ended, Erso and many of the Partisans were forced to flee the catacombs as they were destroyed by the shockwave of a blast from the Empire's Death Star superweapon, although Gerrera remained behind and perished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "G2-1B7 was a medical droid equipped with a 55VH Vocabulator and swappable servogrip pincers. G2-1B7 was modified so that it could dispense drugs at intervals that were too dangerous for a standard 2-1B droid's intrinsic programming to allow. It was also capable of formulating ethical cases based on the condition and treatment of its patients."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid did what it could to help its master, but was baffled as to how Saw Gerrera was still alive by the time of his reunion with Jyn Erso, and was usually amazed at his patient's will to survive. The droid noted Gerrera's grim determination as they prepared to face the deadly onslaught of the Death Star. Like all 2-1B surgical droids, G2-1B7 was manufactured by Industrial Automaton and stood 1.77 meters tall. It had white, yellow, and silver plating."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "G2-1B7 first appeared in the 2016 Anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.

The 55th issue of the Star Wars Helmet Collection magazine, which was released in 2018, erroneously refers to G2-1B7 as a \"G2 unit\" rather than a 2-1B medical droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
