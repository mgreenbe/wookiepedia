However, Sinn and Sish Sadeet both come to acknowledge that Kir Kanos could not have been involved in the attack based on how well and how ferociously he fought the stormtroopers. Sinn and Sadeet determine that there must be a traitor within their ranks. Tem Merkon appears and informs them that he will be returning to the city to keep an eye on Shev's forces.

Jax, however, used the situation to his advantage and tortures her for information regarding Kanos. Meanwhile, Jax's forces seeking Merkon discover his body \u2013 wrapped in explosives. When Jax resumes torturing Sinn, the Star Destroyer Steadfast has arrived in orbit to join Emperor's Revenge. When Sinn continues not to divulge anything regarding Kanos, Jax orders an orbital bombardment of Collo Fauale, the location given by Merkon. Hoping to spare her comrades, Sinn tells Jax that Kanos has gone to the spaceport in Chinesti. Jax, however, sees her lie through the Force and slaps Sinn. Sinn then tells Jax that Kanos has gone to Yinchorr \u2013 which was true. Jax orders the Steadfast to continue firing on Phaeda and prepares to depart for Yinchorr. True to word, Jax allows Sinn to escape alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Sinn returned to the base, Sadeet met her and knocked out a Kubaz spy sent by Jax to follow her.
