In close orbit of its smaller twin world of Mustafar, Jestefad's gravitational field subjected the volcanic planet to immense tidal forces, and its large electromagnetic field swamped the small volcanic planet, which created wild electrical storms, and was constantly trying to make Mustafar into its moon with its gravity. However, influence from a further second gas giant, Lefrani, pulled the smaller planet away from Jestefad, effectively turning Mustafar into an unstable world of magma and rock."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several millennia ago, Jestefad and Lefrani were pulled out their orbit around the star Priate during a cataclysmic struggle between the Jedi and Sith.
