As it inspected the shipping crates at the docks, it detected a presence inside of a crate. The members of the Black Sun and the Pyke Syndicate inside the crate busted out and took it, a police captain, and several police guards captive and shut them inside the shipping crate. Later on, it was leaning on and pushing the door of the shipping crate and fell forward when the door was opened by the Death Watch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
