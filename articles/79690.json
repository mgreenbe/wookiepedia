As with all worlds of the Lan system, except for Lan Barell, Lan Tundi was not capable of supporting life, possessing a barren and rocky surface, and orbited by four celestial bodies. The world was considerably ore-rich, a fact which directed to its discovery by the Galactic Republic, sometime around 1300 BBY. Later on, the Gaminne Group, Inc.\u2014a Human mining conglomerate\u2014purchased the system's mining rights from Lan Barell's native sentient species, the insectoid Qieg, exploring the planet's resources, shipping ore to many resource-poor worlds. The Qieg species and the Human colonists eventually formed a stable government, the Human-Qieg Guild, administrating over the whole system. In time, the system came under the control of the powerful Galactic Empire, although the latter lacked any official presence on it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lan Tundi first and only mention, thus far, was in the 1994 article \"Lan Barell\" written by Paul Sudlow and later published within the Star Wars Adventure Journal 1."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
