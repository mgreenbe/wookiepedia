The house was located on the edge of one of Talus' major cities, Dearic. Around 1 ABY, the technology-hating Meatlump criminals damaged several speeder bikes that were parked outside the house. When Vani Korr, a Corellia Times reporter who was investigating the Meatlumps learned of this attack, she tasked a spacer to investigate. The adventurer met Sul Prine at his place and the latter confirmed that the Meatlumps were responsible of the attack. Prine also gave the spacer a Meatlump map he had found. The map allowed the adventurer to eventually find the location of the Meatlump Camps on Talus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sul Prine's Place was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
