He had little interest in school as a child, and left to pursue a career of collection at an early age. After building up a small fortune in funds, Oolak hired several professional treasure thieves to do his work for him, most notably Aach Een."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oolak was always accompanied by a pair of hired Gamorrean guards, and would spend most of his free time learning everything possible about his collection. Though obsessive-compulsive and slightly insane, he was very thorough in his planning, and was never careless, rash or free with money. He owned a Luxury 3000 space yacht, the One in a Million."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
