Around 3645 BBY, Khypes was sent to the recently-discovered planet of Voss with a battle cruiser and several army divisions to conquer the world and its powerful Force-sensitive natives. Khypes arrived in the Voss system, but before the general could contact the Voss, Khypes's battle cruiser exploded, and the escort ships were destroyed only moments later. Khypes's death and the loss of the fleet astonished both the Empire and the Republic, who were unable to find the cause of the explosion, and the Empire declared Khypes to have been a rogue officer as they made diplomatic overtures to the Voss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Khypes was first mentioned in the Codex entry \"The Imperial Attack on Voss\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011, though the general's species and gender were not identified."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
