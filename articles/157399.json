She used the rifle on multiple occasions, such as a precautionary measure when a group of Galactic Republic clone troopers that included an injured Clone Captain Rex sought out shelter at her husband's Farm. Her husband Cut Lawquane also used the slugthrower days afterward to fight off droids in his home with the help of Captain Rex. She again used the rifle years later to fend off a nexu that was attacking a young girl named Omega soon after the rise of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker also owned a rifle of this model during his youth on Tatooine. He took the rifle with him when he went to search for runaway droid R2-D2 in his X-34 landspeeder.
