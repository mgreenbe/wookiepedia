While Dos' double, the ISB operative Nonul Weran, visited the club and pretended to be Dos, Dos observed Weran from a balcony, to see if anyone approached the decoy. ISB agents were not normally permitted to visit the Outlander Club, but Dos blackmailed the establishment's owners into allowing him to perform his scheme, and the operation carried on for some time, with limited success. Shortly after the Battle of Nizon, a team of Alderaanian Resistance agents traveled to club and defeated Dos and Weran in combat, then stole Dos' code cylinder and used it to access Imeici Spire, the headquarters of the Sarlacc Project."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
