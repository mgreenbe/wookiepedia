When combined with high-grade inertial compensators and thrust regulators, the STAR-94 system enabled pilots to perform a barrel roll that boosted the ship's evasive capabilities beyond the norm. The system was one of Vokoff-Strood's first products after entering the starfighter market; however, they ended up issuing recalls on several batches of engines due to defective manufacture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
