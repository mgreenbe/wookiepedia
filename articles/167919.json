In 0 ABY, Zeb mentioned on the entry for the GV/3-series guardian droid that they owned one and employed it as a scouting assistant by adding sensors, tracking SkillWare and an automap. In 0 ABY, commenting on the entry for the F1 exploration droid, Zeb revealed that they had worked with a number of F1s during early scouting missions. Unlike other scouts who disdained using droids for exploration, Zeb disagreed and tasked the units with perimeter security. A few months later, Zeb commented on the ASP-7 labor droid entry, stating they were good workers, easy to modify, but not very intelligent. In 1 ABY, Zeb commented on the entry for the Wanderer Scout Surveyor. Zeb used to use a Wanderer and while it was a capable droid, it didn't fit Zeb's preference for droids with more personality. Zeb tried to update its personality matrix, but found that the new protocols would be ignored. Several months later, Zeb left a comment on the TS-Arach series Pest Control Droid entry. By hooking up an automap to the droid, Zeb found that it was extremely capable of scanning and mapping large areas, in additional to having detailed holos of the local wildlife."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
