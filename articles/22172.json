While the CR90 would see initial use within the late Galactic Republic and Imperial Senate, many vessels would be appropriated by the early rebellion and Rebel Alliance against the First Galactic Empire, despite not being designed as a combat-oriented vessel.

Measuring 150 meters in length, it featured two dual and four single turbolaser turrets, and had the ability to reach a maximum speed of 950 kph. According to Luke Skywalker, some combat-outfitted CR90 ships could be equipped with six dual turbolasers. Capable of carrying an entire diplomatic escort, it had a passenger capacity in the hundreds. Although the ships were not built as carriers, three RZ-1 A-wing interceptors could be attached to the docking rings, allowing for a small escort. They would serve as the backbone of the early rebellion and Alliance. Though not particularly heavily armed, CR90s possessed enough forward firepower to destroy a Gozanti-class cruiser quite easily."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CR90 line was in service during the Clone Wars.

Three of them were used to assist the rescue of Lothal rebel leader Kanan Jarrus. After the loss of the flagship in the Siege of Lothal, Commander Sato took one of the corvettes, Liberator, as his new flagship. The Liberator and another corvette, under the callsign Transport One, were used in an attempt to bring relief supplies to the starving people of Ibaar. Transport One was destroyed in the first to run the Imperial blockade. It was later replaced by one of the other corvettes for the second attempt, which was successful thanks to the Prototype B6. When Phoenix Cell was discovered to have been hiding on Garel, forces led by Admiral Kassius Konstantine led an assault on them. As the Liberator tried to escape, it was captured by Konstantine's tractor beam. However, the tractor beam was disabled by the Ghost, which freed the Liberator and escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Mon Mothma declared the formation of the Rebel Alliance, several CR90s traveled with many more rebel ships to her location at Dantooine. Shortly after, General Jan Dodonna took three CR90s with his fleet to meet Phoenix Cell, and their three CR90s, at their base on Atollon, in preparation to attack the TIE Defender project on Lothal. However, Grand Admiral Thrawn's forces ambushed the fleet of rebel ships. In the ensuing battle, three of the six CR90s were destroyed. The final three fled with the remaining rebels back to Phoenix Cell's base. When Thrawn's ground forces overran the base, the Liberator and one other CR90 escaped and attempted to run Thrawn's blockade. The Liberator escaped, but the other corvette was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A number of years later, after the Alliance to Restore the Republic stole the plans to the Death Star, Princess Leia Organa traveled aboard the Tantive IV to bring the plans to Alderaan.
