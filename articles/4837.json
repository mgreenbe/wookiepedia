The moon was notable for the abundant resources to be found amidst its expansive forests and temperate oceans. It was also home to several unique species such as gnasps and Maru. Alaris Prime was untouched by civilizations for eons, and sometime after a skirmish on the moon, during the New Sith Wars in 1002 BBY, the moon disappeared from galactic view.

There, the Wookiees learned to gather the moon's natural resources and also became engaged in a war with the Trade Federation, who sought to illegally subvert Attichictuk's claim. After a united offensive removed the Federation from the moon in the Battle for Alaris Prime, the Wookiees retained their colonies there, making the world a thriving technological hub in the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alaris Prime was the site of multiple invasions from the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the first month of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY. The first targeted the production facilities of the Decimator, a war machine built by the Wookiees, while the battle on Alaris involved the enslavement of most of the moon's population and the testing of an ancient Sith artifact; the Force Harvester.

In the system resided the star Kashyyyk, of which Alaris held the fifth orbital position. The system was part of the Mytaranor sector in The Slice portion of the Mid Rim, and lay on the intersection of several hyperlanes; the Durkteel Loop, the Great Kashyyyk Branch, the Nightroad, and the Randon Run."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alaris Prime was hidden from galactic view because of it's small size compared to Alaris, causing it to be untouched by civilizations for eons. In spite of its isolation, the wroshyr trees, thought to be native from the planet Kashyyyk in the same system, were also found on Alaris Prime, though they were smaller than those on Kashyyyk due to the moon's different climate. The Wookiees from Kashyyyk created several legends about how the trees could have migrated across space but no accepted scientific theory developed. The moon was covered in thick forests and temperate oceans and was rich in natural resources, with its stockpiles of nova crystals and ore deposits making it a desirable target for colonists. muja fruit bushes also grew there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alaris Prime was home to a multitude of species, including many dangerous predators such as swarms of the insectoid Gnasps, the reptilian Maru, gundarks, and rancors.

The ambush resulted in several casualties on both sides, including the Gloom Walkers' Lieutenant Ulabore, whose execution by his subordinate Lucia for an earlier grievance went unreported. Sometime after the skirmish Alaris Prime disappeared from galactic view and was forgotten. At some point an ancient grove and a holocron associated with the Jedi Order were left on the moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his adolescence, the Trandoshan Cradossk made visits to Alaris Prime to shoot at gnasps.

He sent a portion of the Trade Federation Droid Army to begin colonizing Alaris Prime and establish a secret manufacturing operation there. One of the first structures built was a power core, but when it came under attack from gundarks the Federation was driven from that area. Attichitcuk was selected as the leader of the Wookiee colonists as a reward for his senatorial representation, and he along with the multitude of other colonists departed for the moon aboard the Thalmussen and three other colony ships between 39 BBY and 36 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After their ships landed in a clearing near a river Attichitcuk was the first Wookiee to personally explore Alaris Prime, where he established their first camp and left markers to lead the way.

Their official advisor, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, was surprised to see an artificial structure on an untouched world and advised the two Wookiees to destroy it. After doing so Attichitcuk's camp was attacked by gundarks, reminding the colonists of the dangers of their new world.

Along with Chewbacca, these workers fought off a group of gundarks, an attack that galvanized Jinn and the Wookiees into seeking a permanent solution to the problem. At another base near a forest, Chewbacca and Jinn trained a group of bowcaster troopers and marched towards the gundark nest, but B1-Series battle droids of the Trade Federation had already begun exterminating the gundarks.

In their base, his Wookiees built and used aquatic transport ships to cross a river to reach the outpost which was successfully destroyed. Shoran and Chewbacca also established two camps with which to practice trading using Corellian HoverFreighters and spaceports. Shoran also found the ancient Jedi holocron in his camp, which prompted Jinn to request permission from the Jedi Council to construct a Jedi temple in Chewbacca's camp, which was granted. With the temple built Jinn sent his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi to retrieve the holocron, as only a force-sensitive individual could carry it.

The Wookiee colony had only quickly recovered from the battle when Anakin Skywalker was taken to the moon by Count Dooku and Cydon Prax. Dooku intended to subject Skywalker and the population of Alaris Prime to a test of the Force Harvester, the power source of the Dark Reaper.
