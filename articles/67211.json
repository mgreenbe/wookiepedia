Their objective was to destroy a Jedi farming colony established by Master Gnost-Dural after the Eternal Empire's conquest of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3636 BBY, the Eternal Empire under led by the former Sith Emperor Vitiate attacked both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. This onslaught forced many surviving members of the Jedi Order into hiding. By 3630 BBY, Jedi and Sith led by the Eternal Alliance's Commander initiated a revolt against the Eternal Empire that would culminate with the death of the former Sith Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the conflict, Master Gnost-Dural's vision for Ossus was to help the colonists grow crops in order to better support them while Jedi Knight Tau Idair wanted to send out teams to find surviving Jedi. However, Gnost-Dural did not take such action as to ensure that the Jedi remained hidden from the Sith. Sometime after the end of the war against Zakuul, the Sith Empire learned that Jedi Master Gnost-Dural was alive hiding on the Jedi farming colony on Ossus. The Empire sent an attack force to the planet under the command of Dark Council member Darth Malora, while Republic General Daeruun sought to reinforce the colony before the Sith could destroy it. With the Eternal Alliance's waning power in the galaxy, they feared a conflict with both main factions, and decided to side with the Jedi and Republic, and the Alliance Commander arrived to assist in the defense of Ossus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Ossus both the Republic and the Sith Empire learned that Darth Malgus had survived his supposed death above Ilum.

If the player sides with the Empire, they can take Gnost-Dural as a prisoner for Light Side points or let Malgus kill him for Dark Side points. If the player sides with the Republic, Malgus will seriously wound Gnost-Dural and leave him in the library.
