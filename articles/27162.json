Over the centuries, they had mapped and gathered information on a number of hyperspace routes known only to them. The Guild maintained a base in Tree Vikkilynn in Kachirho; a sealed vault contained the guild's navigation data center, powered independently by a generator. The vault included data input and analysis stations as well as data stacks with information stored in indigenous manufactured HoloGrids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, rumors of the Wookiees' knowledge of secret hyperroutes drew the Confederacy of Independent Systems to attack Kashyyyk in 19 BBY in an effort to claim the data. The Galactic Republic counterattacked to protect the Guild's information, but the Guild chose to dissolve itself rather than hand over their data to the new Galactic Empire. The Claatuvac data was distributed to the Guild's most trusted scouts who went into hiding as the Empire subjugated Kashyyyk, and it was not until the Galactic Civil War, nearly twenty years later, that a legitimate source of Claatuvac data came to light in the hands of Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Claatuvac Guild was responsible for discovering the other bodies of the Kashyyyk system, including Alaris Prime, before the Galactic Republic reached the Mytaranor sector. After Wookiee navigational prowess became known, the Claatuvac routes became the stuff of legend. Most spacers operating in the Mytaranor sector claimed to know of at least one secret Wookiee route in the region, with rumors telling of hundreds more that the Claatuvacs were honor-bound to guard with their lives."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 19 BBY, Gumbaeki was the Master of the Guild, with Chak as an apprentice.

However, after witnessing Order 66 and the clone troopers' execution of their Jedi officers, Gumbaeki grasped the nature of the Galactic Empire that had just been proclaimed on Coruscant.

Gumbaeki then destroyed the data held in the vault in Tree Vikkilynn and made himself conspicuous in Kachirho's defense, giving the rest of the Guild time to escape.

Both Imperial and Rebel intelligence agents pursued rumors of Claatuvac data during the Galactic Civil War, but it was not until 3 ABY that a legitimate stack came to light: Chewbacca, first mate to the smuggler Han Solo, had been entrusted with a HoloGrid, and he shared this information with Solo, allowing the pair to become accomplished smugglers. In the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth, Chewbacca gave his stack to Princess Leia Organa, and the Rebel Alliance put the information to great use in its battle against the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
