Like other Jedi of Tholothian decent, Katooni donned a traditional headdress of dangling seedpods recovered from the planet Tholoth. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Order's members were forced to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic. As the war was waged across the galaxy, Katooni was deemed to be one of the top members of her clan and suitable to travel to the sacred Jedi world of Ilum to participate in the ancient ritual known as The Gathering. Escorted to Ilum by Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Katooni and other Initiates entered the hidden Crystal Caves and met with Grand Master Yoda inside the caves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Katooni and other Initiates entered into the caves in search of their crystals for use in their personal lightsabers, Katooni accompanied her fellow Initiate Zatt as they searched deep into the labyrinthine caves. Coming across a massive cliff, Katooni found her crystal lays at the peak of the frozen wall of ice, Zatt then departed from Katooni to find his crystal. Climbing up the rock face, Katooni retrieved the crystal and found a passage way at the top of the cliff. Choosing to take the path rather then climb back down, Katooni rushed into the passage way. While Katooni rushed her way out, she fell through a weak patch of ice. Trapped in a frozen chamber near the mouth of the caves, Katooni called for help and saw Petro on the other side. Asking him for assistance, Petro, however, refused to help as his time was almost up and he had yet to find his crystal. Alone and fearful of freezing to death, Katooni gave into despair and wept. As the gates were almost frozen over, Petro realized his error and returned to Katooni and gave her the courage needed to escape the ice cave and made her way back out of the caves to the applause of her friends. As the younglings retrieved their crystals, At outside of the caves, Master Yoda commended Katooni in having confidence and other younglings as well."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Attack on the Crucible"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Gathering successful, Tano prepared to escort them back to Coruscant. While the Crucible departed into a deep space, Katooni and other younglings continued their training under the direction of Professor Huyang: the expert tutelage of the Jedi's prime lightsaber designer and engineer. Huyang showed the younglings the countless models of lightsabers and asked them to visualize their models. While Katooni and other younglings begun the construction of their Lightsabers, Hondo Ohnaka and his pirates attacked the Crucible to steal the younglings' crystals so that Ohnaka could convert them into easy profit on the black market. After the pirates finally boarded the Crucible, Huyang ordered the younglings to hand over their crystals to him for safekeeping but Petro, however, didn't hand his over. Katooni and the others then hid in the ventilation shaft where Tano ordered Ganodi and Zatt to make their way to the cockpit, find R2-D2, and secure the ship's bridge. Katooni, Byph, Petro and Gungi would follow Huyang and seal themselves in the ship's hold and await Tano's command.

Petro then pulled out his Lightsaber, opened its crystal chamber, and inserted his shard but Katooni warned him that his lightsaber would explodes. However, he ignited his blade, looking to fight, but the gleaming blue shaft faded out. The pirates chuckled and snatched the lightsaber, but Petro's lightsaber exploded in the pirate's grip.

Unfortunately, Katooni and her fellows couldn't make it to the hold. Ohnaka and his pirates stood in the way, the younglings were surrounded by pirates. Ohnaka demanded the young Jedi to hand over the crystals. Suddenly, Tano arrived. She Force-pushed most the pirates out of the way, allowing Katooni and her fellows to get to the hold.

However, Kenobi suffered a surprise attack by General Grievous and Kenobi would be eventually defeated. In the meanwhile, Katooni and the younglings continued their guidance of building their lightsabers aboard the ship but only Katooni couldn't finish her lightsaber. When Petro wanted to disobey Kenobi's advice and rescue Tano by the younglings themselves, Katooni was not in favor of the plan, but when it appeared that the ship's coolant was leaking, the younglings had to travel to Florrum. While leaving R2-D2 to repair Huyang and Ganodi to watch the ship, Katooni went with the group and were able to persuade themselves by joining Preigo's Traveling World of Wonder, a circus act led by Preigo as an acrobats.

When they fled to get Ohnaka's private fleet of ships, Katooni traveled with the pirates aboard Starhawk speeder bike.
