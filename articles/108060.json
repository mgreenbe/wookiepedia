During one of these ambushes, Wraith Squadron was able to capture Night Caller and learn the nature of Project Morrt. The New Republic then located the Morrt droids infesting their fleet, and used them to create a false traffic pattern which would lure Zsinj's forces into a trap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although intelligence analyst Gara Petothel was able to detect the New Republic's misinformation, Wraith Squadron was still able to lure Zsinj's ships Provocateur and Constrictor into a trap and destroy them in the Morobe system.
