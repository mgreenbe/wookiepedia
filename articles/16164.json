Executing Order 66 on Coruscant, the Sith Lord Darth Vader and the 501st Legion marched on the Jedi Temple to purge its occupants, including Bene. As the clone troopers stormed the Temple, Bene fought alongside Padawan Whie Malreaux and Battlemaster Cin Drallig against Vader. Despite their combined efforts, Bene, Malreaux and Drallig were killed by the new Lord of the Sith with Malreaux being the first to fall. Bene then attacked Vader in concert with Drallig, but Vader batted Bene's blade aside before grabbing her by the throat and strangling her whilst he dueled Drallig one-handed, killing the trainee Jedi before finishing off Drallig."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The duel between Bene and Vader was recorded by the Temple's surveillance system, allowing Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover her fate while reviewing the security logs.
