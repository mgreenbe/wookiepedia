Growing up in the Anoat sector of the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories, Deathstick began her criminal career as a hired assassin. Through a series of spectacularly public murders of gang leaders, she ended up moving into the drug trade. At some point, she had a run-in with the Galactic Empire that cost her a great deal of her face, prompting her to wear a mask that only left her eyes visible."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Deathstick was head of the Kouhun, a highly secretive and structured order of assassins based on Mataou. Under her leadership, the Kouhun murdered several high profile individuals in the sector, including the wife of Governor Ubrik Adelhard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Deathstick was hired by Lady Qi'ra of Crimson Dawn to hunt down the bounty hunters Beilert Valance and Dengar on Nar Shaddaa. While Valance conversed with Devono Vix on his knowledge about Crimson Dawn, Deathstick shot Vix's head off, killing him. She then shot Valance in the arm, wounding him and damaging his core."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Valance and Dengar managed to escape in a ship. They then thought they saw Deathstick aboard the ship, but they played it off as being nothing. However, Deathstick quickly tracked them to the hideout of Mama Stammoch and her crew. Upon reaching the hideout, she overheard Stammoch warn Valance and Dengar that the assassin would kill them all. When Dengar suggested that she was overreacting, Deathstick blew up the entrance to the hideout and assured Dengar that she wasn't. Upon entering the hideout, Deathstick and her droids laid waste to most of Stammoch's crew, forcing her, Valance and Dengar to make an escape. Throwing a thermal detonator, they managed to blow a hole through the wall and flee from the hideout in a landspeeder. The three of them were chased by Deathstick's droids, but they jumped out of the speeder as it crashed, getting the droids off their trail. However, Deathstick had still not lost her targets and kept an eye on them as she contacted Qi'ra. When she insisted on killing them, Qi'ra told her that herding them in the right direction was an important part of her plan. She then assured the assassin that she would get to kill them soon enough."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months into the Iron Blockade, Deathstick was introduced to the Smuggler, a young scoundrel from Burnin Konn who had forged an alliance with the Ivax Syndicate and the Noble Court-in-exile. Shortly thereafter, the Smuggler underwent and passed the initiation rites of the Kouhun. Although Deathstick did not think the scoundrel could embrace the Kouhun's philosophy, she nonetheless agreed to join the anti-Empire alliance, which came to be known as the Uprising. As their first major joint operation, the Nobles, the Syndicate and the Kouhun made plans to abduct Commander Bragh, leader of the deadly Imperial Purge Troopers. It was Deathstick who outlined the plan and provided some of her assassins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
