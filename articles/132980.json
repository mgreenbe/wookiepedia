Originally published by Daumkakao, the first episode of the web comic was uploaded on April 10, 2015 while the English version was published by LINE Webtoon on October 1, 2015 with the first three episodes. The web comic retells the story of the original trilogy in all-new way from the perspective of Luke Skywalker. Due to cultural interpretation, some of the dialogue and order of events have minor changes from the film placing the comic's canonicity in a \"grey area.\" The comic was uploaded every Thursday and Sunday for free at LINE Webtoons. The original title is translated directly to Star Wars: Story Before The Force Awakens, implying its purpose to promote the then upcoming movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens to Korean audiences."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Chapters"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
