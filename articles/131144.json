They managed to get off the moon in a repaired ship that holds up just long enough to crash land in a place that leaves them in an awful lot of trouble. Meanwhile, Darth Vader has embarked on a program to train the assassin he captured in the last arc, Out of the Wilderness. He's now being trained by Vader for a special mission; he's given a choice, he can do what Vader tells him to, or he can die."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot Summary"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Issues"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
