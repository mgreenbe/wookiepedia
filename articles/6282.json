The Wookiee colonists, led by Attichitcuk, along with his son, Chewbacca, and Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, traveled to Alaris Prime and began colonizing the moon. However, the Trade Federation also sought control of the moon to use it as a trade center and illegally established a competing colony."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Alaris Prime, both sides faced attacks by predatory gundarks, prompting both the Wookiees and the Trade Federation to send their forces to the gundark nest to eliminate them. The Trade Federation's Battle Droid Beta Versions reached the nest first and, once they had killed all of the gundarks, attacked Wookiee bowcaster troopers led by Chewbacca, who fought back and destroyed all of the battle droids. Following the encounter, Attichitcuk and two Wookiee troopers began a scouting expedition in the forests of the moon to learn more about the Trade Federation's activities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, at another base, Chewbacca and Jinn began preparing for any future encounters with the Trade Federation by advancing to a new level of technology and gathering various resources.
