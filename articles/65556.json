It was temporarily quartered in an old stone hospital taken over by the Galactic Empire. Candidates were taught to be submissive to authority and to pilot starships, using simulators and real ships. Fifty degrades would result in expulsion; expelled students served time in the Mining Corps. The schoolmaster was former Senator Sano Sauro. Students attended the Academy for at least three years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It possibly was established from the Naval Academy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
