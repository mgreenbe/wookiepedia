It was commonly formed into small fist-sized cubes and used for both civilian and military demolitions. Very tiny detonite charges - sometimes known as micronite - were also used in pyrotechnics and more precise engineering applications."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The detonite was used in grenades, particularly the C-22 fragmentation grenade and MM-40 thermal charge.
