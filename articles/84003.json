Originally manufactured by Gallofree Yards, Inc., the modified Luminous featured a boosted hyperdrive at the expense of diminished armor and cargo capacity.

Many of Gallofree Yards' remaining transports ended up in the hands of the Rebel Alliance. The Rebellion purchased these outdated vessels at greatly reduced prices, but they required a fair amount of maintenance. The Luminous was one such transport serving in the Alliance Fleet during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 ABY, shortly after the Battle of Yavin, the Luminous played a vital role in evacuating the Rebellion's Yavin 4 base during a large-scale Imperial invasion. Grounded on a small island while preparing to depart the base, the Luminous fell under attack from a wave of Imperial loader shuttles attempting to dispatch All Terrain Scout Transports to the surface. Commander Luke Skywalker, flying an X-wing starfighter in defense of the Rebel evacuation, succeeded in destroying each of the loader shuttles to open a launch window for the Luminous. As the Luminous departed Yavin 4, it would next need to pass through a sizable Imperial blockade waiting in space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, in 4 ABY, the Luminous took part in the climactic Battle of Endor, in which the largest armada ever assembled in the Rebellion's history attacked and destroyed the Empire's second Death Star battlestation over the Forest Moon of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Luminous's crew was trained for reconnaissance and swift intergalactic transport.

The player, as Luke Skywalker, must defend the Luminous from attack by destroying a force of six inbound Imperial loader shuttles ferrying AT-ST walkers. If the player allows any of the shuttles to land, each unloads a single AT-ST, which then begins firing on the grounded Luminous. As it is possible to quickly destroy the shuttles before they can unload any AT-STs, the exact nature by which the player satisfies this game objective is left ambiguous for this article."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
