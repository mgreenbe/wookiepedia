He continued to work with Ackbar after, keeping him safe. He was assigned to Shantipole Project with the commander; after meeting the Quarren Salin Glek, he did not either trust or like him. However, he had no evidence to base his assumption on, so held his counsel to Ackbar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When an Alliance team arrived at Shantipole to hand-deliver a holodisc to Ackbar, Pollard escorted them to the commander after they were initially barred from proceeding by Glek. During the assault on the facility by District Commander Bane Nothos' forces, Pollard assisted the Alliance team. At one point, he held off an squad of stormtroopers to allow the team and Ackbar to escape the Command Base in a life boat. He was wounded in the effort, and captured by the Imperial forces. During the team's mission to Research Station Shantipole, they found him in the base's Detention Area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Netrem Pollard's life had been long and hard; he had a scarred face, and death held little mystery for him. He had an ageless quality, but people considered him to be sinister on first meeting, although he soon won them over. He was dedicated and loyal to the Alliance. He rarely spoke of his past, but he was a natural leader. However, Pollard was not an ambitious man; while it was believed that he would do well in a command position, Pollard preferred to work in important secondary roles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pollard was skilled in the use of a blaster and unarmed combat, and could pilot a starship and use its weapons.

Pollard and making him a key part of the adventure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A figure of Pollard was released in the summer of 2008 to accompany Hasbro's Dagger Squadron B-wing Fighter toy.
