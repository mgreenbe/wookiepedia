A native of the Core Worlds planet Ralltiir, McQuarrie's Clone Wars service saw him command a Consular-class cruiser in the Republic defense of the vital agricultural planet Ukio.

Early in the war, McQuarrie captained a Consular-class cruiser as part of a Republic mission to prevent the politically divided agricultural world of Ukio, a major food-producer for the Republic's armies, from falling to the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Joining a task force consisting of a Venator-class Star Destroyer and another Consular-class cruiser under the overall command of Jedi General Keelyvine Reus and Admiral Dron, McQuarrie helped form an orbital patrol of Ukio in response to intelligence suggesting that the Confederacy was targeting the planet. Although Ukio boasted a powerful planetary shield system capable of preventing any sizable invasion or bombardment from enemy forces, the Separatists nevertheless concocted a plan to breach its defenses. The Republic task force soon detected on the far side of the planet a single Confederate Lucrehulk-class battleship that was releasing into the atmosphere a series of seismic tanks, which in turn were dropping a strange dark cloud over Ukio's shields."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Dustup over Ukio"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Dron's prompting, McQuarrie reported to Reus and the admiral that his cruiser had identified the cloud to be an electrostatic soil compound with photoreactive properties from the badlands of the planet Moorja. The compound adhered harmlessly to the shield yet moved in concert with the system's sun, regardless of Ukio's rotation, thus creating an effective means of blocking out any sunlight from reaching the planet's crops. The Confederacy thereby succeeded in using Ukio's shield system against itself\u2014as McQuarrie noted to Reus, the native Ukians would need to lower their shields for the cloud to simply dissipate into the atmosphere and save their crop fields, but by doing so they would open the planetary surface to Confederate attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reus quickly conceived a plan to save Ukio. The Ukians would create an opening in their shield around the cloud just long enough for the disturbance to dissipate, while McQuarrie and the Republic task force would engage the Lucrehulk battleship to keep it preoccupied and unable to launch any vessels through the shield gap. However, the Republic attack would need to be carefully coordinated so as to counteract any complications from the Lucrehulk's powerful jamming signal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ensuing attack from McQuarrie and the Republic task force succeeded in destroying the Confederate battleship, while the Ukians lowered their shields to rid themselves of the disruptive cloud. Although the Republic earned a tactical victory by eliminating the enemy presence from Ukio, negative market reports of the turbulence there caused Ukio's stock prices to plummet, allowing the Confederate-allied Commerce Guild to purchase a controlling interest in the planet."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Against the Empire"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Ralltiiri Rebel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his active duty in the Clone Wars, McQuarrie served as a respected military advisor for many years on his homeworld of Ralltiir, but the escalating Galactic Civil War once again forced the former Republic officer into action. In 1 BBY, three weeks before the Battle of Yavin, McQuarrie watched as the Galactic Empire enacted a brutal subjugation of Ralltiir to clamp down on the growing number of Ralltiiri Rebel sympathizers. The Imperial occupation force devastated Ralltiir and its 10 billion inhabitants, even barring relief organizations by sealing off the entire Ralltiir system. In response, McQuarrie fled his home planet to seek aid from the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coincidentally, the Alliance had just learned that a Ralltiiri Rebel cell had come into possession of information concerning the existence of the Empire's new secret superweapon, the first Death Star battlestation. Working in tandem with his close friend and fellow Ralltiiri Jeroen Webb, McQuarrie returned home, sneaked past the Imperial blockade of the planet, and took command of the local resistance.
