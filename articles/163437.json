When Hondo Ohnaka, the captain of the gang, led the pirates to the planet Vanqor in 22 BBY, the gang encountered and captured Count Dooku, the political leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The count was taken to the gang's base on the planet Florrum, and handcuffed with energy binders, after which he was placed inside a cell. Ohnaka planned to bargain him to the Galactic Republic, in exchange for ransom paid in spice. However, as Dooku tried to escape the captivity several times, the Weequay cell guard was positioned to guard him incessantly. The Weequay stood in guard in front of Dooku's cell, when Representative Jar Jar Binks of the Galactic Senate, who had arrived to deliver the spice to the pirates, accidentally destroyed the power couplings of the base. As a result, the whole base's power went out, disabling the locking system of the count's cell. Noticing this, the Sith Lord silently opened the cell's door, sneaked behind the cell guard, and strangled him to death with his energy binders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A pirate of the Ohnaka Gang, the Weequay cell guard was trusted with guarding Dooku, an important prisoner worth one million credits to the gang via the ransom.
