According to the Epics, the gardens were built at the Great Jedi Library by the Neti Jedi Master T'alla, who later planted herself at the centre, becoming a tree. The Epics further claimed that the gardens continued to grow over millennia, and that the tree thought to be T'alla was a favoured spot for visitors to meditate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
