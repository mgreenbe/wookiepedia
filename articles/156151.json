After the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra subdued Vader within a kyberite confessional within the Martyrium of Frozen Tears on Tython, she hijacked Vader's suit to send a command to the comms jockey that sabotaged the Imperial records from Project Swarm, the search for the base of the Rebel Alliance. The comms jockey was hesitant to implement the commands, but did so after Aphra threatened him using Vader's vocoder. The Empire eventually discovered what had truly happened, but were unable to reverse the damage. The rebel spy Thassilio Smeuse, while undercover within the Empire, spoke with the comms jockey, hearing of the sabotage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
