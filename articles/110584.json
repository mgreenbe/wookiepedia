She eventually attended a prestigious school and studied a variety of arts, including sculpture, acting, impression, However, despite being a talented artist, she eventually began a forgery ring at her school, selling to unwary offworlders. When the operation was discovered, multiple students were suspected to be involved. Forced to choose a subject at school before she was kicked out, she chose music as she had not found anything unwary to do with it. When hard evidence confirmed Tonsort's involvement, she was forced to drop out of school, with the school attempting to save face and not expel a gifted student."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the incident, Tonsort did not have many options. However, in 32 BBY, Captain Quarsh Panaka of the Royal Naboo Security Forces approached her and offered her a position as a handmaiden for recently-elected Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Panaka believed that her criminal background and many other talents could allow her to teach the new queen how to \"cheat\" and be deceitful, although Tonsort believed after meeting Amidala that Panaka had underestimated her. Tonsort agreed, swearing her loyalty and life to Amidala. When the roster of handmaidens was filled, she suggested that all the handmaidens should change their names to match Amidala's as a sign of loyalty and for the purposes of subterfuge, taking the name Rab\u00e9 and becoming Amidala's wardrobe mistress."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Invasion of Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year year, the Trade Federation invaded Naboo and successfully captured its capital Theed. As the Federation's vessels landed throughout the city, Amidala and the handmaiden Sab\u00e9 switched places, with the queen donning a handmaiden's garb while Sab\u00e9 dressed in the royal regalia to act as a decoy. To finish the ploy, Rab\u00e9 applied Sab\u00e9's makeup while Sach\u00e9 attended to the decoy's hair in the queen's dressing room in the Theed Royal Palace. Once finished, Rab\u00e9 pulled away the cloth around Sab\u00e9's neck that had protected the royal clothing from spilt makeup."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Acting as queen, Sab\u00e9 ordered that they would await the Federation forces on one of the palace's balconies.

With the aim of eventually reaching the Republic capital Coruscant, the royal starship was forced to stop first on the desert world of Tatooine to locate a new hyperdrive.

After several days, the group returned with the hyperdrive the ship needed and the young slave boy Anakin Skywalker, who Jinn was bringing with him to train as a Jedi.

As Amidala was preparing to address the Galactic Senate in her royal regalia, Rab\u00e9 informed Skywalker that Padm\u00e9 was not present, but was interrupted by Amidala who wanted to know who was visiting.
