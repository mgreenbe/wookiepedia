She met Galen Erso there, working under the \"Professor\" title during this time, and eventually mentored Lyra Erso who gained the surname after meeting and being proposed to by Galen within the program. Along with Nari, Demesne attended their wedding. Her topic of research changed when she was drafted by Orson Krennic, newly appointed head of the Special Weapons Group by the Corps of Engineers, into the shield generator program at some point during the Clone Wars where she began work on defensive shield generators designed for capital ships and the soon-to-be named Death Star battle station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, Demesne reunited with Galen on Coruscant for the first time in years after he was rescued from his unwarranted improsonment on Vallt. She invited him to an upcoming alumni reunion at the end of their conversation. Two weeks later at the reunion, Demesne got a chance to speak to and catch up with Galen's wife, Lyra. She also attempted to prevent a skirmish between Erso and fellow scientist Dagio Belcoze near the end of the event after Belcoze accused him of being a Separatist sympathizer who revealed Republic secrets during his detainment on Vallt. Belcoze would later call Galen to apologize, blaming the alcohol he consumed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unable to contact Galen, Reeva later unexpectedly commed Lyra and asked her if her husband had recently spoken to Belcoze (making her aware that he was stationed on Malpaz), quickly changing subjects and telling Lyra that she was located on the plant of Hypori. She mentioned that she was also part of Project Celestial Power before the call abruptly ended. Lyra understood from Reeva's uneasiness that their communication was tapped and that Reeva wasn't able to talk the entire truth and speak freely. Ersa shared this information with her husband. Three weeks later in a conversation with Krennic, Galen brought up his concerns of why Reeva was working on Hypori and not on Coruscant with himself as they were supposedly engaged in the same topic of research. Krennic foresaw this concern as he was secretly listening in on the Erso family's conversations of suspicion within their apartment, responding that he would look into it; a sham promise that would not be mentioned again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reeva would be one of the primary scientists to witness an early test fire of superlasers being designed for the Death Star. She asked Krennic how the energy required for such a weapon would be stored after the successful destruction of the Hero Twins black hole, him answering that that wasn't for her to worry about. When she pressed further about the project and wanted out since it would supposedly bring peace through fear, Krennic promised to reassign her and the other scientists to another place \"permanently\". Not long thereafter, he ordered the energy research facility destroyed, killing Reeva and the other scientists. Later, the Ersos dived deeper into the conspiracy and realized that Galen's work was being weaponized once they saw sensory data of the remnants of Hypori after one of the Empire's so-called \"energy research facilities\" exploded when an experiment trying to duplicate Galen's work commenced and unexpectedly failed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Demesne had powdery green skin, her face tattooed in vertical bands of dark diamonds. Her full lips were pigmented in iridescent blue scales. She had gray hair. When meeting with Galen Erso, she wore a scarlet robe that reached the floor and a cowl that covered most of her hair. Lyra Erso described her as having a dark complexion with exotic face tattoos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reeva Demesne was first featured in Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel written by James Luceno and released in 2016.
