Since strills were hermaphrodites, being of both genders, Mird was often referred to as \"it\" in conversation and in writings, which was considered acceptable given its sexual structure. Mird was despised by Kal Skirata and his Null troopers after the strill attack on a young Ordo and because of the horrible smell that strills had. At some point in its life on Kamino, it killed a lower caste blue-eyed Kaminoan during the training of the Grand Army of the Republic on Kamino. During the Clone Wars, Mird accompanied Vau to Coruscant and accompanied Kal Skirata as part of his civilian disguise in dealing with Separatist terrorists, even aiding on a couple of missions along the way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Walon Vau's bank heist on Mygeeto of his family's secured holdings, Mirdalan stayed behind with him when he became trapped in an ice worm hole, helping lead Kal Skirata to his location, aid in rescuing him and rewarming him by blanketing Vau's body with its own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, he would accompany Vau and Skirata in the ship Aay'han on the search for former chief geneticist Ko Sai, and then to Mandalore, where Etain Tur-Mukan concealed herself prior to the birth of her son, Venku.
