Sometime around the year 3000 BBY, the Gungan Boss Gallo of Otoh Sancture sent Captain Marsune to the base to get the assistance of the company in defeating the warlord Boss Rogoe by way of donating bongos to the Gungan Grand Army. The company agreed and gave Gallo ten bongos. The base consisted of three prefab shelters, a fortress, a command center, two shipyards, three turrets, and two power cores. The base was located in a small clearing in a forest next to a body of water where the company stored its bongos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base made its only appearance in the 2001 PC video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its expansion pack Clone Campaigns.
