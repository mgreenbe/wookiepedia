The interior of the palace was designed by Christian Piccolo, a concept artist who joined game developer Bioware in December 2011 and contributed to the SWTOR first expansions, including the \"Rise of the Hutt Cartel\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the game there are two palaces on Makeb: Archon's Palace and Toborro's Palace. Because Toborro's Palace was built and designed by Doctor Juvard Illip Oggurobb during the Conquest of Makeb, Christian Piccolo's concept arts  \u2013 the first one portraying a palace before and the second one after the takeover by Hutt Cartel \u2013 have to depict Archon's Palace. It can be assumed that Archon Palace must have been built before the Conquest of Makeb and commandeered by Szajin, the Hutt Archon, after the planet's invasion by Hutt Cartel's forces. The characteristic white statues of animals seen in the artworks are also seen in Archon's Palace in the game. Although Toborro is seen on the second concept art, it is likely that he first took over the palace as his temporary headquarters and gave it to Szajin after Oggurobb built for him the new, bigger and more impressive, palace which became known as Toborro's Palace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
