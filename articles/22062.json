CH-1 was granted unique self-improvement programming by its creator and, seeking to continually modify and upgrade itself, the droid turned to bounty hunting in order to raise funds. After gaining membership of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, the droid took on various bounty hunting assignments, and after the Pyke Syndicate placed a bounty on the rogue Kadas'sa'Nikto bounty hunter Kaa'to Leeachos, CH-1 journeyed to the planet Coruscant to take on the assignment. Working alongside several other Pyke-affiliated agents, CH-1 and the other operatives tracked Leeachos through the Coruscant underworld, coming into conflict with the criminal cartel Black Sun along the way, and they eventually confronted Leeachos in an abandoned annex of the NovaCORE kelerium processing plant in The Works."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
