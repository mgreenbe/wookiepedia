The rancor could only be obtained as a random reward from a sealed cargo crate, an object which players earned by completing mini-games and then had to open using access codes bought with station cash, a premium in-game currency. Barnibus was one of many possible items a player could obtain from such a crate. Given that obtaining Barnibus was entirely optional, this article makes no assumptions about if it was owned by a character."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
