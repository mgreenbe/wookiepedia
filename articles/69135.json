The field projectors found in the weapon's limb and the blaster barrel combined to propel custom arrows with greater speed, distance, power, and accuracy. The arrows consisted of polarized power-sink \"sturm dowels\" from spent blaster ammunition packs attached to shafts of aluminum. To nock an arrow, Jannah drew it back through a repurposed blaster shaft, which subjected it to the electromagnetic field. The arrow's flight was stabilized by polarizers built into each limb of the bow. If enough unspent energy remained in the dowel, it had the potential to be an explosive shot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jannah's energy bow first appeared in the 2019 film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker.
