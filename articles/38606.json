Impervious to blaster shots and able to paralyze most species with their venom, the divviks preferred to dine on live prey. It was said that their acidic saliva could melt through plasteel, and crushing one would release toxic gases. A Jedi lightsaber could seal the gaps. Divviks planted their larvae in the brains of living beings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Six months before the Invasion of Naboo, approximately two thousand divvik pupae were on a freighter detained above Tatooine, to be delivered to Jabba the Hutt. However, the grubs were too developed, and they all hatched. The crew was killed, and the only survivors were Sylvn, the daughter of Jedi Knight Ki-Adi-Mundi; her boyfriend, Maj-Odo-Nomor; her friend, Twin; and Chevin smuggler Ephant Mon, hiding in an escape pod. Ki came in his starship and attempted to rescue them. Mon threatened to destroy them by firing the pods thrusters, causing it to explode against the closed external hatch. Maj was shot, and Ki manually opened the hatch, saving them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
