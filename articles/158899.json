The sensor units were mounted on the shoulders and chest of the suit, so the wearer could still perform manual tasks without being encumbered. The sensors could store their data on a small on-board computer or use the comm relay programs built into the helmet to send the data back to a ship. It could perform such tasks as radiation level scanning and mineral analysis. Vagabond suits cost 2,500 credits each."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
