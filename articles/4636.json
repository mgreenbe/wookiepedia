These nine massive ships scattered across the planet and landed in separate locations, releasing those held within to settle the planet. The Tho Yor themselves would serve as the very foundations for these travelers' new homes and places of study."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ninth and largest of these Tho Yor remained at the place where the others met, hovering above an open air temple used by the Je'daii Order to teach balance through introspection and meditation. A flat pavilion defined by eight thick minarets are all that make up the temple; at the center was a circular pool of water around which lessons were taught and Je'daii Masters waxed philosophically on about the balance between Ashla and Bogan; the light and dark side of the Force. The Je'daii Temple Master, the Je'daii who served as steward of the facility and oversaw its functions, was oft times considered the wisest of all the Masters. In 25,793 BBY Master Ketu, a Human, was the Temple's overseer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pinnacle and the foliage surrounding the temple depicted in Dawn of the Jedi 0 is very similar to what is found in Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, which is famous for its pillar-like rock formations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
