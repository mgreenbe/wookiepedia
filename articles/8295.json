He managed to hunt several famous bounties, such as the Exelis Hunters who terrified the Strabin sector. His nomadic nature led him to move after a certain time in the same place. He spent a time working for various Hutts in the Y'Toub system. While in this job, he was introduced to a fellow bounty hunter, Kiran Tatch, and they began a partnership. Tatch appreciated Arcuse's quietness, especially when contrasted to the boastful Hutts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 1 ABY, Tatch's disdain got the best of him and, during a visit to the Hollastin system, he spat on Glorga the Hutt. As Tatch had been a good employee for a long time, he was ordered to leave instead of being executed. Arcuse decided to leave with him, and both of them were blacklisted. Arcuse knew he would have had a stellar career as bounty hunter should he remain there, but he had decided it was a good time for a change. While departing Hutt Space, they encountered Rodick Tag, an Iotran Braceman who had also taken leave of the Hutts. The three of them formed a slight partnership, and then they met assassin Callandri, who wanted to create a group of bounty hunters. Arcuse decided it would be a good team to join, and the others followed him. The Granse Confederacy was formed with some other members\u2014a team of bounty hunters who almost specialized in hunting Rebel Alliance members."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arcuse's knowledge of hideouts and his vast network of contacts throughout the galaxy were two of his most valued abilities for the Confederacy. Rebel lieutenant Akul Witig wrote a report on Arcuse specifying that Arcuse showed no cruelty when working and that he was respected and even liked\u2014he had too few enemies for a bounty hunter. Nevertheless, although the Task Force on Alliance Security feared Arcuse's threat, they also thought he would eventually feel the need the leave the Granse Confederacy. But as of 2 ABY, Arcuse still worked with the Granse Confederacy, and had been last seen on Draria."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
