She was one of his favorites, and accompanied him to events. She was often seen wearing revealing outfits, which Jabba was fond of. In 32 BBY, Shaliqua attended the Boonta Eve Classic podrace alongside Jabba and his Twi'lek majordomo Bib Fortuna, where she was standing next to him and wearing a dancing-girl costume when he announced the race's beginning. After the young slave Anakin Skywalker won the event, Jabba fell asleep and Shaliqua left the viewing box. Shaliqua had pale skin and blue hair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
