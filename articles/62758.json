Bossk acquired the ship after Han Solo and Chewbacca destroyed his former ship on Gandolo IV."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The exterior was smooth and rounded, with an elongated, rectangular hull originally meant for cargo transport. The ship also had a three-deck design and was protected by shields and reinforced armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hound's Tooth's main deck contained Bossk's private quarters, a training chamber, an armory and an advanced medical bay. Its aft section was modified into a prison equipped with a series of magnetically reinforced holding cages which were connected to a force-field generator activated by motion sensors in the event a breakout took place. The prison also held Bossk's trophy collection and interrogation devices, as well as a skinning table for skinning his Wookiee captives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The command bridge was situated on top of the main hull and provided access to all the Hound's Tooth's systems. Its cockpit was equipped with a monitor bank which relayed information from hidden sensor screens, allowing the Trandoshan to monitor the entire vessel. The vessel also had an interior scanning system for monitoring cargo, motion sensors which were linked to neural stunners, sub-q injectors and shock panels, and voice-recognition security systems which prevented unauthorized access of the ship's ramp. These included anti-personnel blasters, a durasteel net and an electrocution array."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bottom deck contained the Hound's Tooth's engines, power core, and weapons systems. The vehicle's armament were a turret-mounted quad-laser cannon, a secondary ion cannon, and a forward-firing concussion missile launcher that carried up to six missiles. A scout ship, Nashtah Pup, was stored in the interior for emergency operations. The Hound's Tooth was later stolen by Tinian I'att Azur-Jamin and Chenlambec. However, Bossk eventually retrieved his ship, even though Boba Fett would later steal it as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its propulsion system was simple though it gave the Hound's Tooth a considerable amount of maneuverability despite its size. Its standard ion engines generated thrust while a pair of long maneuvering fins linked to the engines provided vertical movement. Two main drive nozzles between the fins of the vessel controlled turning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The onboard systems were controlled by an X10-D droid brain that was capable of responding to verbal commands from anywhere on the ship. It also controlled most of the Hound's Tooth's systems including weapons and security. The bridge and Bossk's private quarters also featured datalinks connected with the droid brain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
