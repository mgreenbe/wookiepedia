Their purpose was to sabotage enemy positions. With this in mind, they had matte-black plating and featureless faceplates as part of their humanoid frames. Their plating contained integrated and advanced sensor masking features allowing the droids to surprise a target before quickly escaping from sight. They utilized strike-and-fade combat protocols as part of their programming that dictated their tactics. Armaments were stored in internal compartments allowing weaponry to be hidden by the stealth features of the droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During operations, these saboteur droids were deployed in small, independent squads that moved separately from primary droid divisions.
