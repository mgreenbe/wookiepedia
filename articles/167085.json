The recipe for making Yowvetch custard-filled donuts was among the 2400 donut recipes kept on the database of a Crisp-E-O donut droid owned by the Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster. The droid made use of its internal oil fryer to make the donuts in a traditional Adarian style, and did so every morning. The donuts were then served in Dex's Diner, an eatery owned by Jettster and located in the CoCo Town district of the planet Coruscant. Yowvetch custard-filled donuts were one of several types of donut which were always available at Dex's due to their popularity and the fact Jettster considered them delicious, costing 1.7 credits each. They were served at the eatery at some point prior to its destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's reign."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yowvetch custard-filled donuts were featured in the 2009 StarWars.com Hyperspace exclusive article, \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written by Gregory Walker as an in-universe menu for Dex's Diner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
