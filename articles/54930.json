Glocken, along with his partner Uri, served as enforcers for the under-the-table dealings of the cantina's owner, Merl, who specialized in hiding desperate people willing to pay. A specialist with his heavy blaster pistol, Glocken was known to be quick to draw his weapon if anyone threatened Merl. In 0 ABY, notorious cyborg bounty hunter Beilert Valance arrived in Merl's while searching for Tyler Lucian, a Rebel deserter Merl had helped conceal on Centares. When Valance threatened Merl for information, both Glocken and Uri jumped to his defense, only to be immediately shot down by the quick-trigged hunter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glocken first appeared in Star Wars 29, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1979, where he was illustrated by Carmine Infantino.
