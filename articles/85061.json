Thus, any Wookiee who lashed out against another Wookiee (or any other living being) with their claws was deemed to be a madclaw. The title was a grave dishonor, since the Wookiees viewed the use of claws for anything other than tools as feral, and madclaws were usually sent into exile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiees were not the only species that believed in this philosophy.

However, he realized that his new addition to canon caused a discrepancy: if the Wookiees had indeed claws, Chewbacca would have used them in the original Star Wars movies. Five years later, Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook resolved the discrepancy, explaining that it was a matter of honor that Wookiees never used their claws in combat, but kept them strictly for climbing. In Star Wars canon, a similar Wookiee honor code appears in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
