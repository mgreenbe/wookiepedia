Although it was one of Doodnik Sharpelz's signature drinks, it was also served at Dex's Diner, which was located in CoCo Town, Coruscant. Authentic circuit cider was made by filtering the liquid through spare droid parts. At Dex's Diner, it was made with parts repurposed from a dishwasher unit that was no longer in service after the waitress droid WA-7 learned it had gossipped about her with other appliances. Dex's Diner charged 2.7 credits for the beverage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
