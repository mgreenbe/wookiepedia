Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Pooja Naberrie tasked a spacer with locating Adala and escorting him back to the city of Dee'ja Peak on Naboo.

However, due to a bug, many of the NPCs in Naberrie's quests were not properly sequenced. For instance, in the quest to escort Adala, players actually encountered an individual known as Lim Paddu, who was supposed to appear in the following quest. The character model for Turon Adala likewise erroneously spawned for Naberrie's third quest, in which the player was supposed to encounter an individual named Jumis. Nevertheless, it was possible for the player to complete the mission and advance to the next quest. This article assumes that the content of Naberrie's quest dialogue is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity, and that Adala, not Lim Paddu, actually appeared during her fourth quest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because Turon Adala spawned under the generic \"naboo_police\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of two possible depictions. He could either appear as a brown haired, brown eyed Human female, or as a brown haired, brown eyed Human male. Because the quest dialogue identified Adala as male, this article assumes that the Human male depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity. Examining the NPC also revealed his name to be Turon Idala. This article assumes \"Adala\" to be the correct surname, as it was consistently used in the quest dialogue. The questline that involved Adala was eventually removed from the game when Pooja Naberrie was relocated to Theed as part of the newly introduced Legacy Quest, released as part of Publish 25's New Game Enhancements on November 15, 2005."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
