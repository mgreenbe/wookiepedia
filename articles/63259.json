The hull scrubber used controlled bursts of electromagnetic energy to keep a droid or homing beacon from attaching itself to the hull of a starship. One of the drawbacks to using a hull scrubber was that it did not remove pulse-shielded droids, such as combat droids, that could shield themselves from the electromagnetic energy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
