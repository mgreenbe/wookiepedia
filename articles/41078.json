However, according to comments made by Atlas co-author Jason Fry, as revealed on TheForce.net's Jedi Council Forums, the Online Companion's database listed star systems according to names of well-known celestial objects, rather than proper system names, and that the database's listing was not intended to create new system names or override previously established continuity. Given this declaration, this article treats the \"Kammia system\" as conjecturally synonymous to the Drynn system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
