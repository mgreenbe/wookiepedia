He was defeated in the fight but managed to escape in his crippled TIE interceptor.

If the player defeated DS-181-4, the Imperial was not destroyed. Instead, a message was displayed to the player, indicating the successful defeat of the pilot.

Because DS-181-4 only appeared in the space portion of Star Wars Galaxies, originally added with the Jump to Lightspeed expansion pack, he could normally only be seen inside his respective TIE interceptor. However, a comm display could appear during the battle, displaying DS-181-4's face. In addition, the collection icon depicted DS-181-4's physical appearance. While DS-181-4 piloted a TIE interceptor in the game, there is no indication it was Saber 4.
