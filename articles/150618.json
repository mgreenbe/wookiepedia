Han Solo was running the spice for Jabba Desilijic Tiure from Kessel to Tatooine, but actually jettisoned the spice in fear that he and Chewbacca would be arrested and the Millennium Falcon impounded. He also had a group of children he had rescued from the Ylesian spice colonies after the Rebel raid. Capucot and the search team failed to find any spice. However, due to Solo's heroism, Capucot decided to escort him to Corellia where he would drop the children off.
