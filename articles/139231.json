The plot began from an alliance between Death Watch and the Sith brothers Maul and Savage Opress; Death Watch had been attempting to takeover the government of Mandalore for some time, while Maul hoped to create a base of power. Both sought revenge against Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and thus agreed to work together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Together, Maul and the Death Watch leader, Pre Vizsla allied and formed the Shadow Collective. Under Maul's vision, they created an army made from various elements of the criminal underworld, including Black Sun, the Hutt Clan, and the Pyke Syndicate, all of whom fell under the banner of the Shadow Collective. To undermine the rule of Duchess Kryze, the criminal army began attacking the Mandalorian capital city of Sundari, creating panic and chaos as the New Mandalorian government was unable to contain the criminal forces. Death Watch arrived under the guise of rescuers, saving citizens and police forces alike, who saw them as the ones who saved Mandalore from attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the successful execution of their plan, Vizsla gained the support of the people and dethroned the Duchess and replaced her as leader of Mandalore. His ambitions, however, saw him betray the Sith and imprison them. As his reign began, the politicians of the planet either joined him or were executed. While in prison, Maul allied himself with former Prime Minister Almec, who had been imprisoned on corruption charges. The Sith broke free from prison, and Maul challenged Vizsla to a duel for leadership. Vizsla accepted, and the two fought throughout the Sundari throne room. Maul emerged victorious, killing Vizsla and taking his place as the leader of Death Watch. Some Death Watch forces refused to bow to Maul, however, leading to open conflict amongst Death Watch. Maul then installed Almec as Prime Minister to serve as a puppet ruler, keeping his presence a secret from the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
