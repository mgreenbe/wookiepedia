The conditions of the deal were worse than expected, as the owner of Bartyn's Landing, Hugo Bartyn, deceived and openly enslaved the immigrants. Violence between species was common, as the city was crowded and Quarrens and Mon Calamari never got along at all."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A big number of Quarrens approached Bartyn and asked him to allow them to settle in their own town of fishermen, still working for him. Bartyn answered by leasing them some land in the other side of the bay. The Quarrens then created their town, known as the Shoals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
