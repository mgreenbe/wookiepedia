The husband of fellow commando Tala-Reh, the commando had gone to his death at the request of the Mystic Valen-Da and killed twenty Gormak warriors before he himself was slain, and his wife favored the poem above the other hymns and songs written in his honor after the man's demise. She recited it to the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython while working with the Jedi, as the Knight reminded her of her husband despite being an outsider."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The poem first appeared in the Jedi Knight class mission \"Vault of the Gormak King\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011.
