However, Tor-Ro-Bo's rival corporations learned of Tor-Ro-Bo's planned violation of the contract and they dispatched some security forces to attack the processing center. To cover up the spacers' presence in the facility, Tor-Ro-Bo activated the procedure protocol 514, which caused the memories of 5T4 and the other droids in the facility to be wiped. 5T4 subsequently forgot about the spacers and ceased to help them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
