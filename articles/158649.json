He was a young, slender boy with long, sandy hair that reached to his shoulders. His parents died during an outbreak of Toli-X when he was two standard years old. He enjoyed the company of animals and secretly kept them, even though he could be sent to the Re-Learning Circle if anyone found out. He was a student of the The Learning, sent to the Learning Circle when his parents perished, instead of starting at the typical age of four. When he was nine years old, he became a friend of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Siri Tachi while they were stuck on Kegan. He was caught trying to help the two Jedi Padawans escape the Circle, resulting in the capture of his two pet ferbils and two lizards. As a result, he was sent to the Re-Learning Circle. He later escaped with the help of the two Jedi and their Jedi Masters and became the child of V-Nen and O-Melie, after their daughter, O-Lana, was taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant for training."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
