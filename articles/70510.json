And what about the Republic Commando game? Doesn't seem to be incoherent with the movies or TCW at all and was cool\u00a0:)\nJH: Would still be considered \"Legends\" I suppose but it's still a great game!"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\u2192 Jennifer Heddle (@jenheddle) on Twitter (content obsolete and backup link not available)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Q: Vhat about upcoming FFG books? they are old EU? while ongoing?\nJH: That's a million dollar question.\u00a0;) Tricky area.
