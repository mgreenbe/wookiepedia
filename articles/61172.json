During the war he was stationed on the moon of Endor in a bunker housing a shield generator which provided protection for the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station battlestation being built in Endor's orbit. The Major, alongside Commander Igar, supported the station's commander, Colonel Dyer. During the Battle of Endor, in which the Alliance attacked the incomplete Death Star, a team of Rebels was sent to the moon's surface in order to destroy the shield generator bunker. The Rebel General Han Solo successfully tricked Hewex into sending several squads of Imperial troopers stationed in the bunker out to aid in the fighting, allowing a group of Rebels to enter the bunker. Hewex and the remaining men in the bunker were then forced to surrender to the Alliance soldiers, who began to plant charges inside the bunker before Imperial reinforcements arrived and captured them. The Rebels were ultimately successful in destroying both the bunker and the Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hewex had fair skin and brown hair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hewex was played by Anthony Smee[source?] in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi and received no name in the film.
