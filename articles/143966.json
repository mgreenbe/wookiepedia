Nyax, his mind having been replaced almost entirely with electronic parts, is bent on opening a Force nexus located beneath the old Jedi Temple. Meanwhile, Tsavong Lah, taking Viqi Shesh's advice to heart, discovers a conspiracy amongst members of the shaper caste and of the priest caste who plan to control him through manipulation of his implant. With the help of shaper Nen Yim, Tsavong Lah discovers the traitors involved, which include Ghithra Dal and Takhaff Uul, and executes them by use of a rancor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han and Leia Organa Solo are traveling to sectors of the galaxy that are most likely to join the Yuuzhan Vong in order for leniency for their own planets, people, and especially governments. Han and Leia's goal is to make contact with secret resistance cells on each planet in order to support them in making sure that their governments won't align with the Vong, and that they'll also be able to fight the invaders. One particular journey to Aphran IV gets them locked away in a prison cell, which forces C-3PO and R2-D2 to help them escape. Han and Leia fight past the forces holding them and they escape, with the government of Aphran IV unlikely to join the Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on Borleias, Wedge Antilles continues to operate the defenses there, holding Czulkang Lah's forces off for the majority of the events and increasing Yuuzhan Vong sentiment that both Jaina Solo was the physical manifestation of one of their Trickster goddess Yun-Harla, and that the pipefighters were capable of being utilized as a superweapon to attack Coruscant's defense fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke, Mara, and Tahiri were able to kill Nyax with the help of Wraith Squadron, but not before he was able to open the Force nexus he'd been after. Following Nyax's death and during the strike team's escape from Coruscant they confronted Viqi Shesh, who had been sent to the planet to help capture them. At the same time Denua Ku, the dying Yuuzhan Vong warrior who'd led the Yuuzhan Vong warriors to find the Jedi on Coruscant, caught up with her.
