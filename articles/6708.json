Located at the city's heart, the Ancient Quarter contained the foundations of the original city established by Boss Gallo circa 3000 BBY. The district was dedicated to preserving the city's ancient history, and contained museums housing machinery and tools from the ancient past. Administration of the district was tasked to a small army of volunteers who passionately maintained the ancient structures and museums. While a prominent tourist attraction in its own right, the Ancient Quarter also had residential sections where the most prestigious and expensive manses were located. Home to the old-blood families that maintained their ancestral estates, the residents of the quarter frowned upon new residents taking up lodging in the district."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
