Jedi, however, were known to have been trained to resist mind probes, requiring the use of other methods to procure information from them. An IT-O was attempted to be used on Avi Singh by Captain Bragg, though it never got the chance to torture the Separatist Senator since Clone Force 99 and GS-8 arrived to rescue him. One IT-O droid was used to interrogate Kanan Jarrus aboard Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's Star Destroyer Sovereign. However, torture was eventually handed over to The Grand Inquisitor. Another IT-O was used by Governor Arihnda Pryce to interrogate the rebel Hera Syndulla after the failed attack on the Imperial fuel depot for the TIE/D Defender Elite project."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An IT-O was later used aboard the Death Star to extract information from Princess Leia Organa, although she proved to have considerable resistance to the mind probe. The IT-O was later deployed on Yavin 4 during the Empire's cleanup operations at the former Alliance base. Decades later, the First Order used a new model of interrogator droid that harked back to the IT-O model."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
