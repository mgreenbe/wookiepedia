Although accounts differed, the Jedi Knight Noga-ta arrived on the planet of Barab I just as the native Barabels were about to erupt into warfare. Two large factions had begun to fight over a hunting territory, and were readying themselves for war. Noga-ta created a peace treaty that ended the conflict before it began, potentially saving countless lives. The Jedi's prescriptions for peace\u2014including giving a tribe's largest kill of the night to a neighboring tribe\u2014were still enforced centuries later. Noga-ta's service on Barab I became legend, with the story of the \"great warrior from beyond the clouds\" being passed down from generation to generation through the use of cave paintings and oral recitations. Forever after, Barabel held all Jedi in the highest regard, and because of Noga-ta's actions, they always heeded the word of a Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Conception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Noga-ta was first mentioned in the sourcebook Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds.
