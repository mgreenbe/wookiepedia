Hadiya's forces, the Despot Army, invaded the Je'daii homeworld of Tython with the intent of destroying the Je'daii. During the fighting, Hadiya was approached by a Je'daii Ranger named Daegen Lok who claimed to have defected from the Order and was willing to pledge his sword to the queen. Agreeing to have Lok by her side, Hadiya was impressed by his ruthlessness and quickly promoted him to general within her army. Launching her attack on the Je'daii Temple of Kaleth with Lok by her side, Hadiya fought on the front lines, killing the mother and father of Shae Koda at the gates of the Temple. Despite her superior numbers, Hadiya's armies were ultimately outmatched by the Je'daii but were still willing to fight to the death. By the time they had reached Kaleth, Hadiya had taken Lok as her lover and allowed him to sleep in her tent beside her during the evenings. Late in the battle, Lok caught Hadiya asleep one evening and drew a small dagger. While Lok hesitated, Hadiya awoke and attacked her assailant, slashing at his right eye and scarring his brow before he grabbed her with the Force and killed her. Without their cruel queen to drive them onward, the Despot Army collapsed in on itself and Je'daii Lok was hailed a hero for his part in her demise. Hadiya was replaced by a weak Kral, or overlord, who was easily manipulated by the heads of the Nine Houses in the years after the Despot War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A charismatic leader, Hadiya was described by her lover, Daegon Lok, as cruel and beautiful as well as highly persuasive.
