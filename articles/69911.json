The Republic funded the enclave because of the many Force-sensitive Kel Dor coming from the planet. While the Kel Dor Jedi Masters taught exceptional Force abilities, Dorin's isolation and unique atmosphere made it nearly impossible for any offworld species to study regularly at the enclave. However, many Jedi visited the facility to study under the masters with the use of breath masks. Following the Jedi Civil War, most of the Jedi at the enclave were killed by Sith assassins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
