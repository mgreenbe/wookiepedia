After two of the captives, Katt Mol and Lika, were killed, Ahsoka and the remaining Padawans stormed the Trandoshan floating fortress, along with the freed Wookiee captive Chewbacca. Ratter personally fought Chewbacca while the surviving Padawans wreaked havoc on the fortress and eventually got the upper hand, but he was ultimately killed when O-Mer whacked him across the back with his own rifle, making him lose his concentration and allowing Chewbacca to throw him over the edge of the fortress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Talents and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ratter was a skilled pilot of the MSP80 Pteropter and was proficient with blasters.
