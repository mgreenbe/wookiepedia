As a male Lanai from temple island, he was a member of the group known as the Visitors, which was a fishing and hunting fleet of handcrafted vessels that spent most of its time traveling across the ocean to other islands in search of food. Hesper-Inguza and the other male Lanai only returned to temple island once a month to deliver their haul to the female Lanai, who were known as the Caretakers. Upon their return they would celebrate in a multi-day festival. He could play the opah-bladder bagpipes and wore a dark brown robe over a light brown robe along with a woven hat. Hesper-Inguza's skin was a mixture of gray and white in color."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hesper-Inguza was created to be a part of the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi; however, the scene he appeared in was ultimately cut before the final release.
