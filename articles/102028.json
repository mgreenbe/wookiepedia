Qennto privately regards the alien Commander as a naif, but Car'das is quick to discern that Mitth'raw'nuruodo is actually very cunning and dangerous.

Sidious's agents discovered the existence of this empire some years ago, and since then he has been doing his best to prepare the Core Worlds for the invasion he believes is inevitable.

Rather than let such a valuable officer be killed, Thrawn's fleet drops a lethal radiation bomb into the vessel's bridge, killing C'baoth and all the other Jedi on board, except Lorana.
