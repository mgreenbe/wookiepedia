That year, the Mandalorians had initiated an operation they referred to as Mandalorian Triumph, a campaign to take control of the Core World of Duro. One prong of the advance took the Mandalorian forces from their territory to the Vena system. After taking Vena, the Neo-Crusaders passed through the Japrael system, where they had taken the planet of Onderon earlier in the war, to absorb troops from that planet's moon, Dxun, and continued on to Ambria. Once the Mandalorians had taken the system during the battle, they took the Zel system and eventually conquered a number of other systems as they continued their march Coreward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle is only referenced once in 2009's The Essential Atlas.
