It was headed by Senator Mina Bonteri of Onderon. The bill was stalled, however, because no one on the Core planets wanted to admit that there were poor areas on their worlds. Sometime later when visiting Bonteri, Padm\u00e9 Amidala asked to listen to her plans for educational reform, which Bonteri agreed to. The pair then spent thirty minutes imagining how they'd rework the system if they had unlimited time, money and personnel, before they discussed what Bonteri could do with the resources she actually had."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
