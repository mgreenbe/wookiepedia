They were a development of the Trade Federation, who utilized them as excavation vehicles. Their purpose was to burrow their way through the ground to find hidden stores of minerals beneath the surface of a planet. They were twenty-one meters in diameter and nearly thirteen meters in length. Due to the size of the drill itself, visibility was often heavily reduced, which required these machines to be crewed by a large number of sensor operators as well as navigational specialists, who would guide the drivers onto the correct path."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
