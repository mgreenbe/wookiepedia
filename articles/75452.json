Unlucky, Kerrian and the entire expedition went insane; with only the excavator Lefry not sharing their fate because he had undertaken a Voss ritual that protected him from the influence of the Nightmare Lands.\nLater arrived the Barsen'thor and the mystic-in training, Gaden-Ko. Upon Lefry's request, the Jedi tracked Kerrian to retrieve his holojournal for information of that region; however all the effort of the Barsen'thor to cure Kerrian from his insanity went futile, and the Jedi was forced to kill the scientist."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
