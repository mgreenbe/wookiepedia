After the troopers arrived, commander Wolf sent a team of two troopers along with astromech droid R2-D2 and a couple of Aleena, including this one, to repair and survey the local Republican communication station that was affected by an earthquake.

This Aleena then came back to the village to warm the remaining Aleena and the clones to come to their aide. Since the clones could not understand their language, king Manchucho returned with the rest of the villagers and started praying near the site where the two droids had fallen into the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the end, C-3PO and R2-D2 managed to return to the surface and this Aleena and the rest of the villagers celebrated when they sealed up the crack leading to the underworld and bid farewell to them once they departed after their mission was over."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
