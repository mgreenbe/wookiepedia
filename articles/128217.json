The wing panels of the TIE/ln space superiority starfighters used by the Galactic Empire had six solar arrays each, with energy accumulator lines running back and forth beneath the panels. The collected energy was then channeled through a reactor to fire emissions from a high-pressure radioactive gas stored in a ventral fuel tank. The TIE/fo space superiority fighter of the First Order used similar, yet improved, technology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE/mg Mining Guild starfighter had two panels removed on each side, giving them improved visibility at the expense of overall combat capability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
