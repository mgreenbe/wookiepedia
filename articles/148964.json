In 0 BBY, he held the rank of lieutenant and was stationed aboard the first Death Star. A gantry officer, he helmed the command office that overlooked Docking Bay 327. One day, he noticed that two stormtroopers were missing from their stations at the landing ramp of the captured starship Millennium Falcon. After an unsuccessful attempt to hail TK-421 via comlink, Treidum saw a stormtrooper coming down the ramp of the Falcon and waving to the control room window, tapping at the side of his helmet. Taking this to mean there was a faulty transmitter, the lieutenant asked his aide to take over while he went to check on the problem. But when the door slid open, Treidum was knocked back into the room by the fist of the Wookiee Chewbacca, who was part of a group trying to rescue Princess Leia Organa from the Death Star's cells. Almost at the same time, the lieutenant's aide was blasted by the Wookiee's colleague Han Solo, disguised as a stormtrooper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Peter Sumner played Treidum in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
