Armed with the best technology and after years of preparation, the First Order had refurbished ships and an overwhelming fleet. For its part, the Resistance, as the Rebellion had done before, found it necessary to squeeze the maximum of its resources and bring into battle ships that had not even been designed for that purpose. In fact, some, such as Tantive IV or Home One, even lived a second youth and, after being key in the Galactic Civil War, they returned to participate in another decisive moment in the course of history."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
