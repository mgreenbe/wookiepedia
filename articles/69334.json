Han soon discovered that was not true, but he liked the boy, and perhaps because of his skills, worshipful demeanor toward Han, or sympathy of his past, Han let Jarik tag along on his adventures. Soon Jarik became a talented gunner for both the Bria and the Millennium Falcon. Jarik worked as a mechanic for a short time on Nar Shaddaa and also played a small role during the Battle of Nar Shaddaa, by shooting down a few TIE/LN starfighters. Jarik went with Han to assist him, and the Rebels, in the Battle of Ylesia. He was severely wounded and just before dying, he admitted not being related to Han Solo and apologized. Han, however, allowed the boy to \"keep\" his name, saying that he had earned it long ago."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
