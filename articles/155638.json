He was considered to be one of his species' greatest minds. The ship was lost, but the philosopher survived aboard the ship in cyrofreeze until he was freed by agents of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. They told the philosopher of their struggle against the Galactic Empire, and he agreed to help them by returning to his people and enlisting them as allies. Arriving at his homeworld, the ship the philosopher was traveling on was ordered to be inspected by Imperial Customs. The Alliance agents hid the philosopher, but he was found by the leader of the Imperial boarding party, Lieutenant Brawk. The Alliance agents paid a 2,500 credit bribe to the officer to be allowed to continue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
