Sise and his assistant, Vlix Oncard, were distrustful of technology, preferring to rely on organic muscle, including numerous clone guards. However, Sise's younger son, Tig, felt that technology was the future of the gang. He persuaded his father to invest in a number of wild power gambles, most notably the development of the weapons satellite Trigon One, in order to overthrow the other gangs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trigon One was stolen by Thall Joben, Jord Dusat and Kea Moll acting on behalf of a resistance cell on Annoo. When Sise Fromm kidnapped Dusat and Kea's mother, Joben revealed where he had hidden Trigon One in exchange for their release. Tig Fromm went to retrieve Trigon One, but Joben and R2-D2 had sabotaged the guidance system, causing the ship to collide with and destroy Sise Fromm's stronghold on Annoo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The debacle had brought the Fromms' actions to the attention of the other gang leaders, and Jabba the Hutt placed a large bounty on the leaders of the gang. After one final attempt to get revenge on Joben and the others at the Boonta Speeder Race, Sise Fromm, Tig Fromm and Vlix Oncard were captured by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, who turned them over to Jabba for the reward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Fromm Gang eventually ended up released by Jabba via a bribe from the crime family. As part of the deal to spare their lives, the Fromms agreed to donate a large percentage of their business profits and commit their army of Annoo-dat clones to take out the Mandalorian Death Watch diaspora that had encroached on the Hutt's territory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point following their release, the Fromm Gang encountered the droids again, when the gangsters attempted to steal a nuclear-powered missile blueprint from Kea Moll. Later, the Fromms built an artificial cloud device and used it to ambush spacers. A ship carrying C-3PO and R2-D2 was captured, and the droids infiltrated the Fromm vessel, deactivating the device and escaping."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Leaders"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Troops"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Mercenaries"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Vehicles and vessels"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Support"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Annoo-dat members of the Fromm Gang were all depicted as identical in Star Wars Droids.
