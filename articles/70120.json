It showcased the members of the Jedi Order in their capacity as generals and commanders of the newly formed Grand Army of the Galactic Republic. The Jedi, however, were not comfortable with that new function. Citing sympathy toward their discomfort, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine recommended that images such as this poster not be used to bolster wartime support for the Republic. Consequently, Jedi Unite For Peace never saw distribution."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
