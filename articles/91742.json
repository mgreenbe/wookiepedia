After losing Naboo's capital, the Royal Security Forces were overwhelmed, and a group of resistance fighters, led by Captain Kael, began searching for allies in their struggle. Fighting their way through the countryside, two pilots saved a trading village in the Naboo swamps, and the surviving traders sent Kael and Gavyn Sykes on a mission to the mountains to find a smuggler who could help them fight the Trade Federation. Upon locating and rescuing the smuggler's transport, the officers escorted it through the canyon while under constant fire from Trade Federation forces. The smuggling crew and Naboo pilots fought through the canyon, and Borvo, the smuggler, gratefully offered his assistance. The Hutt led them toward his N-1 assembly site in the mountains, which came under attack by Federation forces. After they destroyed the attacking battle droids, Borvo gave the pilots new N-1 starfighters and aided in planning an offensive against the Droid Army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a disastrous defeat in the early stages of the Trade Federation's Invasion of Naboo in the year 32 BBY, the Royal Naboo Security Forces were forced into a desperate battle for survival. The Security Force officer Captain Kael and his wingmate Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes escaped the invasion and engaged Trade Federation forces attacking Naboo civilians. The two pilots subsequently joined up with police officer Vedd Deviss after rescuing his trading village. Acting on intelligence provided by Deviss, Kael and Sykes headed with him into the northern mountains to search for a smuggler, Borvo the Hutt, who could help them strike back at the Trade Federation Droid Army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the three pilots approached the mountains, they picked up a ship, which, according to Deviss, belonged to their \"smuggling friend.\" Kael advised his wingmates to stay alert just before a patrol of droid starfighters damaged Sykes' N-X Police Cruiser. Due to the damage, Sykes switched to a landspeeder acquired from a nearby hangar. Kael and Deviss went to search for the smuggler on the north trail while Sykes went east. Sykes came across a civilian homestead under attack by Single Trooper Aerial Platforms and destroyed the droids, saving the homestead's owner. The owner gratefully gave Sykes technology to upgrade his vehicle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sykes then continued his search for the smuggler. Kael ordered him to ignore several houses under attack by the Federation, as there were too many battle droid squads there. Traveling past the houses, Sykes found the smuggler's ship in a canyon pinned down by Armored Assault Tanks. He contacted the ship and offered his assistance. Scouting ahead, Sykes escorted the ship through the canyon, destroying many tanks firing at the freighter along the way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon reaching a safe distance from the tanks, Borvo thanked Sykes for the assistance and offered his support, and the Naboo pilots agreed to travel with him. Sykes found another police cruiser in a hangar and took to the skies while Deviss landed and supported the group from the ground. Though Sykes was worried they might be heading into a trap, Kael assured him it was worth the risk. When they reached the Hutt's base, the N-1 assembly site, they discovered that the Trade Federation was already there and planned to wipe out the base. Although the Federation had planted mines in the area, the pilots successfully escorted Borvo's ship to the base, destroying several laser turrets on the way. First, however, the ship had to stop at a staging area and allow Kol Kotha, one of Borvo's pilots, the chance to join the fight in his starfighter. Kotha then picked up a Federation transmission, letting them know that droid reinforcements were inbound. The pilots performed several strafing runs against the droids and destroyed the tanks before the base was wiped out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the factory saved and the pilots having acquired new ships, they went on to strike the first blow against the Trade Federation invasion. Borvo provided information and material to the Naboo resistance until the Hutt betrayed them. Borvo was in the employ of the Trade Federation, and later provided information about the resistance to the invaders. The incident was later mentioned in a report given to the Sith Lord Darth Maul by the leader of the invasion, Viceroy Nute Gunray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This mission is comprised of the events of the fourth and the fifth missions of the video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo. These missions introduce Borvo the Hutt and his crew, who went on to play an important role in later missions. In the first of these two missions, it is possible to defend a Naboo civilian, who in turn will lead the player to a bonus objective. In the second mission, the player has the option of staying in the speeder, in which case Vedd Deviss will remain in his NX-police cruiser. The mission was also mentioned in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia as well as the 2011 magazine Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 62. The event received a mention in the 2012 short story \"End Game,\" written by James Luceno. A storyboard of the fifth mission by artist James Zhang was also included in the 2008 behind-the-scenes book Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
