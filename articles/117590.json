A lush courtyard of colorful flora from across the planet, the gardens contained many flowers and trees such as the Rominaria flower. An artificial waterfall mimicked the natural ones that crested over the cliffs of Theed just outside the Palace walls; several fountains and benches dotted the expansive garden, as well as a gazebo. Like many other portions of the palace, the gardens were for the exclusive enjoyment of the monarch's court or guests of the crown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
