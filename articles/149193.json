The stations ran an automated operation that mined and processed clouzon gas from Navlaas, though the operation collapsed during the Galactic Civil War due to pressure from the Galactic Empire. The stations of the Triad became refueling outposts for smugglers, racing syndicates, and other criminal groups. In the time after the Battle of Endor, Lieutenant Relkin of the Empire led a garrison on Triad Station Daralto."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
