Posing as mercenaries, the two Jedi were able to gain the confidence of the Imperial Guard Yarri, but the Guardsman deceived them and led the two into a trap where the Emperor dominated their wills. Turned to the dark side of the Force and anointed as Darth Revan and Darth Malak, the two new Dark Lords of the Sith were sent back to wage war upon the Galactic Republic, though they broke free of the Emperor's control not long afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
