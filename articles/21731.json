The spacer agreed and Byxle gave him the location of the deliveries and told him he could keep any tips he got and not to forget the slogan, \"TDC is not fast food, it's food delivered fast\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the spacer got to the first location, Drixa Dreul's house, Drixa found out that Byxle hadn't given the spacer fungus dippers she'd ordered. After the first delivery, Byxle called the spacer and told him Drixa hadn't paid for the fungus dippers or the spacers tip, but he said it wasn't his fault, Drixa always had something to complain about. The next delivery was at the Trandoshan Nogri Hessen's house. When the spacer arrived it turned out the stuffed Chuba was still alive and eating the rest of the food. The Trandoshan didn't pay for the delivery, but Byxle called and said that Nogri told him about the food and believed him and said he'd still pay him for the delivery, and also told him to be careful about the next location, the delivery was at the dangerous swoop gang leader, Jano Bix."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Spacer arrived for the delivery, but he was surrounded by swoop riders. When the spacer got to Jano, everything was going all right until the four Chubas the spacer was supposed to deliver attacked Jano and the spacer. After killing the Chubas, Jano threatened the spacer, but the spacer said that Byxle just made a mistake. Jano replied. Once again Byxle calls and says Jano paid, and that he likes his Chubas fresh. When the spacer returned to the restaurant, Byxle said that Jano called back and that he had no idea the Chubas were alive. Byxle Pedette paid the spacer and the spacer left and stopped doing deliveries for him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
