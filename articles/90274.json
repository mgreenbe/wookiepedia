After the establishment of the Galactic Empire, Milvayne fell under its protection, under the terms it kept an invisible presence. Milvayne's law enforcement made it a good example for the Empire, and it was promoted through propaganda as an ideal world. After being linked with proximity bombs by Cornelius Evazan, Chelli Aphra and 0-0-0 traveled to Milvayne, where they were forced to evade the law as fugitives. After Evazan widened the broadcast from Triple Zero's eyes to reach the residents of Milvayne, the Empire's Coalition for Progress wished to intervene to prevent the live feed from inspiring mischievous ideas. They were eventually forced to fire on Milvayne City as the chase escalated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much of the planet Milvayne was covered in the expansive and crowded Milvayne City. The upper levels of the city were patrolled by the Galactic Empire-backed Milvayne Authority, and holographic viewscreens showing propaganda were displayed in midair. Milvayne's culture was highly order-oriented, and any individuals who had been reported to the Authority - even a bankrupt debtor and a droid who claimed to merely have a little bit of rust - were thrown down into the lower levels of the city, which had fallen into disarray and turned into a slum for the homeless. Those who survived were forced to live their life as scavengers among the millions of people in the undercity. As well as reported individuals, foul air was also dumped into the lower levels by the Empire's bloatbarges. Although the Empire protected Milvayne, it had an agreement with the planet that it would not intervene in the planets internal affairs, just as long as the Milvayne Authority enforced its reputation and kept order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, Milvayne accepted the rule and protection of the Galactic Empire. This was on the terms that it kept an invisible presence, leaving Milvaynes resident law enforcement agency, the Milvayne Authority, to keep order on the planet and enforce the reputation of the Empire in order to keep it from intervening. It became eventually a model planet under the larger faction, and inspired sixty-three other star systems to capitulate to the Empire as a direct result. On seven hundred imperial occupied worlds, the Empire's propaganda division, the Coalition for Progress, praised Milvayne as \"a model imperial planet.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Tam Posla investigated a pair of visiting spacers using the suspected aliases of \"Roofoo\" and \"Sawkee,\" who were attributed with a rash of crimes on Milvayne. Doctor Cornelius Evazan, who used the alias \"Roofoo,\" later became known as the \"Mutilator of Milvayne.\" Posla, however, was taken off the case by his superior officer, and after he tracked the pair to Jedha, they took his badge."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Evazan's entertainment"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Fugitives on the run"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, a frozen Evazan was handed over to Posla by Chelli Aphra. He intended to bring the doctor to Milvayne for a trial. When Evazan was unfrozen, however, he used a pluripleq to pretend he was a shapeshifter. Posla attempted to arrest Aphra under the jurisdiction of the Milvayne Authority, but was murdered by the assassin droid 0-0-0. Evazan later captured Aphra and Triple-Zero, taking them onto Posla's ship. He implanted proximity bombs inside them, forcing them to work together to survive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aphra and Triple-Zero discovered Rajam Nuss, Posla's personal cyberneticist, and traveled to Milvayne to find him. Upon arriving, Triple-Zero murdered the border officer in order to leave the spaceport. The Milvayne Authority caught wind of this and intercepted them, eventually pinning them behind a vehicle.

He attempted to remove the bombs, but set off their fail-safes, setting them to explode in ten hours.

With Nuss' death meaning they were unable to remove the bombs, Aphra set out to find the cyberneticist's mentor, Prexo, who lived on the other side of the city in South District Seven. When Aphra attempted to take a train there, Triple-Zero threatened the driver and was reported to Informahub, whose drones threw him into the undercity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Needing to stay near the droid, Aphra followed him, encountering a scavenger named Vulaada Klam and her qaberworm Gurtyl. Klam agreed to take them across the city on Gurtyl, but they were located by Tam Posla, whose corpse had been revived by Force energy from mutated gundravian hookspores. Posla shot at Gurtyl, throwing Aphra and Triple-Zero off the creature. He then ordered a rebuilt BT-1 to destroy them. As BT-1 and Posla attacked the pair, the hunters Winloss and Nokk, who had been hired to capture Triple-Zero and kill Aphra.

Nokk chased them on a jetpack while Winloss lured Triple-Zero onto his speeder using a disabled BT-1, with Aphra being forced to follow him into the trap. As they caged the pair on their ship, the viewers of the live feed were angered, and incidents of civilian disrespect began increasing. On the Enduring Pride, Okma was ordered to deal with the aggression, and fired the ships railgun at the city, targeting Aphra and Triple-Zero specifically.

At that moment, Aphra threw herself in front of the shot, leaving her wounded. This inspired the many viewers of Triple-Zero's live feed to riot and fight the Milvayne Authority.
