The two worlds sought to compete over control of the system due to its nature as a hyperspace waypoint. During the High Republic Era, Eiram was ruled by the queen regnant Dima and the queen consort Thandeka. Thandeka was kidnapped by the Directorate, along with Monarch Cassel of E'ronoh, leading to the Eiram\u2013E'ronoh crisis. As the Jedi's mission continued, Eiram along with E'ronoh, offered a ransom to the Directorate and started to investigate the kidnappings on their own. After the crisis came to an end, Eiram and E'ronoh's relationship rapidly improved, and they warmed to the Republic, allowing the Starlight Beacon to be built in their territory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
