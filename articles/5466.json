All other weapons and extraneous systems had to be discarded to focus on this system, but the tractor beam was usable as a weapon. It could pick up heavy items and throw them at enemies. They were often piloted by experienced pilots and gunners for maximum efficiency."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least one AT-CT was stationed on the TIE Fighter Construction Facility, and when Kota's Militia invaded, the AT-CT was used against the militia. The walker was destroyed by Galen Marek as he ventured through the facility to confront Jedi Master Rahm Kota. Many AT-CTs were used while creating the first Death Star for carrying parts of metal and supplies. Marek destroyed another AT-CT while onboard the Death Star, in search for the captive leaders of the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the PSP, PS2, and Wii versions of this game, the AT-CT was replaced by the AT-ST variant, and unlike the AT-CT battle, where it was controlled by the Empire, the AT-ST was taken over by an insurgent by jumping on top of the AT-ST, opening the hatch, blasting its original pilot, and throwing the pilot's dead body out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
