In 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi led Galactic Republic forces to the planet Muunilinst, where the InterGalactic Banking Clan was manufacturing substantial droid armies for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. CT-43/002 was among the troops dispatched to Muunilinst and was chosen as a member of The Muunilinst 10, a special task force of seven clone troopers and two Advanced Recon Commandos led by Captain ARC-77. Acting independently from the rest of the clone troopers, The Muunilinst 10 was supposed to aid the Republic in achieving a swift victory by capturing a Separatist artillery emplacement on the surface of the planet. Before the Republic fleet reached its destination, Kenobi personally reminded the task force of the utmost importance of its mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving at Muunilinst, Jedi Commander Anakin Skywalker and his pilots engaged the Banking Clan's Nantex-class starfighters above the planet, while Kenobi's ground troops utilized LAAT/i gunships to reach the planet's surface. As the Republic forces headed toward the city of Harnaidan, Kenobi ordered CT-43/002 and The Muunilinst 10 to break off and proceed with their mission. Once in Harnaidan, however, their gunship was shot down by a B1-Series battle droid with a rocket launcher and crashed in one of the city's streets. All members of The Muunilinst 10 survived the crash and, following ARC-77's order, disembarked from the downed ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, battle droid assassins who had been hiding in the nearby buildings opened fire on the clone troopers. The clones quickly started shooting back in retaliation, but CT-43/002 was soon killed by enemy fire. The other members of his unit survived the attack and managed to destroy the droids. ARC-77 and his surviving men then proceeded to destroy the Confederate artillery cannon, rendezvoused with Kenobi, and helped him to capture the Banking Clan leader, San Hill. By the end of the battle, CT-43/002 was the squad's only casualty. Later, ARC-77 was awarded the Chancellor's Service Medal for his actions at the Battle of Hypori, but transferred the award posthumously to CT-43/002."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all of Jango Fett's clones, CT-43/002 stood 1.83 meters tall.
