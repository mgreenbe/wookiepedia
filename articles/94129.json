Made from a dough, the bread was cooked by Southern Mustafarians directly on the world's hot, volcanic surface. The resulting buns were ball-shaped, red, and had a cracked black exterior. At some point, the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs visited the planet and found a group of Mustafarians baking the buns. Finding the bread's look impressive, he tasted it and found its flavor to be even more so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, Tuggs included a recipe for Mustafarian Lava Buns in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook.
