Retiring to the remote Outer Rim planet of Antipose, Raskar kept the gem until a worthy foe bested him in combat. Eventually, he was trounced by a cocky smuggler and his furry companion, and was forced to relinquish control of the last power gem, the item that they were sent to retrieve by the Rebel Alliance as a last resort against the Executor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After joining the Rebel Alliance, Han Solo and Chewbacca, upon retrieving the power gem, turned their acquisition over to General Jan Dodonna immediately following the Battle of Yavin. In a futile effort to destroy the Super Star Destroyer Executor, Jan's son, Vrad, took the gem and flew skyward. This action did little to disrupt the warship's shield\u2014hardly any power was left in the gem after all the years that had passed. While the general's son failed to destroy Executor, his brave attack did buy the Alliance time to successfully evacuate the Yavin 4 base. In addition, the little amount of shielding that was disrupted nonetheless allowed the Millennium Falcon to damage one of the Executor's sublight engines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides the power gem kept by Raskar, there were other power gems scattered across the galaxy, usually buried, which some spacers attempted to locate during the Galactic Civil War.

In addition, they also acted as a pink light source for various spacer houses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The power gem first appeared in the Star Wars comic strip story arc The Power Gem, where Han Solo was dispatched by Princess Leia and the Rebel Alliance to find one to mount a defense against the Executor.
