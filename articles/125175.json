Sightings of shyyyo birds were extremely rare, and the creatures were once thought to be legends. The former Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis encountered a shyyyo bird on Kashyyyk, healing it after it became injured. The shyyyo bird later assisted Kestis, allowing him to fly to the top of the Origin Tree. Looking out from on top of the bird Cal noticed how little of Kashyyyk had been touched by the Galactic Empire. The bird was then attacked by the Ninth Sister who proceeded to duel Kestis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shyyyo birds were capable of gliding significant distances while using little energy due to their body shape and feathers. This efficiency meant that the average adult Shyyyo only needed to leave its nest to hunt once per week. The birds ate Slyyygs and Wyyyschokks, which meant they were perceived as protector's of Kashyyyk's native Wookiees and Wroshyr trees. Sightings of the bird were known as being a guarantee of peace for the viewer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
