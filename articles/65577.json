Often navy commandos acted as elite guardsmen to provide extra punch to the navy trooper forces. At least some commandos were trained in piloting All Terrain Scout Transports, as one was seen during the Battle of the TIE Fighter Construction Facility. They were typically stationed at key Imperial facilities where they provided accurate covering fire for other units. Squads consisted of five to seven commandos and a sergeant, and sometimes an officer or a medic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though they were part of the Imperial Navy and not the Stormtrooper Corps, Naval commandos nevertheless wore a similar uniform as the stormtroopers, though elements of the design were similar to that of the scout troopers: their black body suit partially revealed and little leg armor shared the resemblance to the scout troopers' own outfit. The Navy commandos appeared to have temperature-controlled chestplates similar to that of snowtroopers on their backplates, making them among the Empire's environmentally-specialized divisions of troopers. The helmets had wider visors than those of the stormtrooper variant, similar to that of the Scout trooper, with comlink antennas attached to the right side of the helmets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Arsenal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Depending on their rank, mission, profile, and training protocol, an Imperial Navy commando primarily wielded the standard issue E-11 blaster rifle. However, some sergeants carried laser-guided sniper rifles that were deadlier than the average weapon. Other commandos did not wield their rifles for the majority of their assignments; instead, these select troops manned blaster turrets stationed around the battleground. As a sidearm, they were provided with an EC17 holdout blaster pistol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though they did not use them often in battle, Navy commandos also carried thermal detonators as part of their equipment."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Gear"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most Navy commando helmets were equipped with comlink antennae. Squad sergeants often wore orange shoulder pauldrons and multipurpose backpacks as well as their specialized helmets, which were equipped with rangefinders.
