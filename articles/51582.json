Dessel, a sergeant in the Gloom Walkers unit of the Brotherhood of Darkness, used a GSI-21D when he fought in the Battle of Phaseera. After Dessel was arrested by the Sith army for assaulting his superior officer, Lieutenant Ulabore, his GSI-21D was removed from him before he was sent to prison to await his court-martial."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The GSI-21D was first featured in the novel Darth Bane: Path of Destruction, written by Drew Karpyshyn and released on September 26, 2006.
