Later during the Clone Wars, Sidious acquired a massive kyber crystal from the planet Utapau which he wanted for the Death Star project. The crystal was, however, destroyed by the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, which necessitated the world's occupation so the hunt for similar crystals could continue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Lothal campaign, Krennic was able to convince the Emperor to divert more funds towards his project rather than Grand Admiral Thrawn's TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter program."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance stole the Death Star plans, with the efforts of Rogue One.
