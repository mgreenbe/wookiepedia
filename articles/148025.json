It involved a con artist, who appeared well-dressed and affluent, and a mark both spotting a valuable item at the same time. The con artist would then suggest that he and the mark split the money they would receive from selling the item to a fence. The con artist would insist that he couldn't be involved due to his standing in the community and potential embarrassment so the mark should take care of the transaction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The con artist would insist he couldn't trust the mark and would attempt to get his half of the payoff up-front. Once the transaction was completed, the mark would learn when he tried to sell the item that it was worthless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
