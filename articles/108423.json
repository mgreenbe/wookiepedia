In 3644 BBY, his daughter Prudy was on the planet Ord Mantell when she became engaged to a fellow doctor, a Human named Archiban Kimble. Prudy arranged for her mother and father to travel from Coruscant in order to attend her wedding with Kimble, but the pair's trip was ultimately for naught when Kimble broke off his engagement to Prudy on the day of their wedding.
