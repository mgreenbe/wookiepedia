In 3 ABY, the mimph was still an infant, and was cared for by an older female of the same species. In that year, a hunting team led by the mimph Masher captured the young Ewok Wicket Wystri Warrick and tied him behind a curtain in the village. The female mimph was carrying the infant when the curtain was drawn and Warrick, much larger than the mimphs, was revealed. The female mimph became frightened, and used her hand to cover the infant's eyes, which were white with black pupils."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The infant mimph appears briefly in \"Gone With the Mimphs,\" the ninth episode of the second season of the Ewoks television series. \"Gone With the Mimphs\" was written by Linda Woolverton and first aired on October 18, 1986."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
