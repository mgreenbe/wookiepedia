They had long, curved and very sharp tusks up to 0.6 meters long. They had a long, very thin tail which helped their balance while maneuvering in the trees. Their brown and green coloration camouflaged them in the forests."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Culture and Society"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gwerax-hai hunted in small groups and tried to surround their prey by quietly climbing through the trees of Veron's forest. Once they injured a creature, they would tenaciously track it through the forests until it had been killed. They lived in groups called \"skulks,\" with five to 15 members. The females cared for the young and the males hunted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
