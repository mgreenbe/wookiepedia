There were no new protocols explaining how to defeat the tenacious, versatile infidels who populated the galaxy. The shaper Onimi had seen this and had sought to fill the eighth cortex. His experiments failed, transforming him into a Shamed One. He manipulated his puppet Shimrra into allowing the heretic Nen Yim to design new protocols herself. The damutek of the eighth cortex was located on Yuuzhan'tar. As the war continued, heresy among the shapers spread, as the yammosk jammers, holocomm networks and Jedi proved problematic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The discovery that the eighth cortex was and had always been empty was one of the factors contributing to the Executor Nom Anor becoming the heretic prophet Yu'shaa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
