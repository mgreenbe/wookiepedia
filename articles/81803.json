An instrument commonly used by scientists and security personnel, the scanner could detect the presence of lifeforms. The Lifedetect could also pinpoint their location, as well as determine what species it was as long as the profile had been loaded into indicators. The Lifedetec was the size of a portable computer, and employed a shoulder strap for easy carrying.
