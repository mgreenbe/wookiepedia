Each of their hands and feet had five digits, one of which was opposable. They had long tails and wide, flat faces. Their fur and skin were blue, but their eyes were yellow. They could be found in the vicinity of Palsaang. Near the Clone Wars, one such primate took an interest in Luminara Unduli and Quinlan Vos, who hand-fed it berries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
