Kallig can choose to let the Republic destroy his flagship, fire the Silencer at him or tell him to withdraw. If Kallig tells Achelon to withdraw to a safe distance before firing the Silencer, the latter would agree not to attack Kallig on sight. Achelon is later seen on Corellia, commanded by Thanaton to kill the player. However, Achelon refused to turn on Kallig after being spared by his enemy. After Kallig manages to defeat Thanaton and assume his place on the Dark Council, Achelon would be among those who swear loyalty to the newly anointed Dark Lord.
