The Victory II-class was a more direct predecessor to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though outwardly similar to the Victory I-class Star Destroyer, the Victory II-class was designed for deep space combat.\nWith this in mind, the designers fitted the ships with Hoersch-Kessel Drive, Inc. engines in place of the Victory I's LF9 ion engines to overcome weaknesses of the earlier design. Where the LF9 ion engines could not produce sufficient acceleration to engage faster and newer vessels in ship-to-ship combat, the new drives were far more powerful and added significantly to the newer ship's sublight speed and maneuverability."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides its faster sublight speed, the most notable change was the addition of ion cannons, more turbolasers, tractor beam projectors, and the removal of the banks of concussion missile tubes. The Victory II-class, however, did retain its predecessor's ability to operate within planetary atmospheres."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Victory II-class Star Destroyers were used late in the Clone Wars but still produced early enough in the conflict to receive Republic livery.The class would still see production after the conclusion of the conflict, but was not built as extensively as the Victory I-class."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Victory II-class Star Destroyers were used as patrol and blockade starships, as well as having main duty serving as sector patrols. They were sent out in pairs or with other ships, regularly moving into areas of suspected Rebel or pirate activity to pacify the sector. Other Victory II's were used for deep space interdiction missions, using their ion cannons to capture enemy starships without damaging them. These vessels were often assigned to missions where the capture of the target was required for information gathering purposes. As they carried only two squadrons of starfighters, the Victory-II would often be deployed in the company of fleet carriers or escort ships that carried a large number of starfighters for quick deployment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mostly seen as inferior to the more powerful Imperial-class ships, some thought that the Victory-class would be decommissioned following the newer design's entry into service. The growth of the Rebellion eventually would lead the Galactic Empire to keep the ships in service as they needed every available capital ship for duty. At the beginning of the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance seized several of them, but they were all presumed to have been lost or recaptured. Some ships would eventually see service with the New Republic. Others would remain in use by the Imperial Remnant, with at least one, the Protector, seeing action during the Yuuzhan Vong War at the Battle of Borosk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
