In 4 ABY, the R2 unit participated in the climactic Battle of Endor, assigned to one of the Rebel X-wings. The R2 unit and his starfighter were originally dispatched to the forest moon of Endor where a strike team was attempting to destroy the shield generator protecting the Death Star II. Soon, the Force-sensitive clone X2, who was originally on the surface but was requested to assist the space battle, took the X-wing and joined the battle above. As the Alliance prepared their final attack on the Death Star, Admiral Gial Ackbar dispatched X2 to infiltrate the battlestation and use the R2 unit to download Imperial tactical plans held in its computer banks. X2 landed the X-wing inside the Death Star and escorted the droid to a data access terminal, allowing it download the data. He then escorted the droid back to the starfighter and they escaped from the Death Star right before its destruction by the Alliance forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
