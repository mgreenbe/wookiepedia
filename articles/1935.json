It participated in the defense against the Outer Rim Sieges, such as during the Battle of Felucia. These homing spider droids varied slightly than their original models, 81, because the Commerce Guild found it necessary to provide the spider droids during the war at a cheaper, faster, and steady rate, which therefore reduced the firepower of these still deadly droids. They were also designed like this so they could provide aerial cover for heavier ground units, such as the Trade Federation's AAT."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
