There was a winding ramp that led to the top of the trading post, and inside were many different supplies. The Ewoks of Bright Tree Village would usually visit Mooth's trading post following their harvest. The Ewoks would use their surplus to purchase goods that the Ewoks needed to help their home. The post also contained several specialty items, beyond simply food, weapons, and clothing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
