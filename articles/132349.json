He is assaulted by groups of Womp rats and battle droids and is informed in Mos Espa that something must be disturbing the Womp rats' nests. He travels through Xelric Draw to the Womp rat caves and kills the Anoobas that were apparently responsible for the disturbance.

However, assassins hired by the Hutts are looking for Anakin. After fighting his way through, Anakin finds Watto, who informs him that Ponchar is at a moisture farm north of town. On his way there, another moisture farmer tells Anakin that Tusken Raiders have kidnapped some other farmers, and Anakin agrees to free them, having \"no love for the Tusken Raiders.\" After this, one of the farmers leads him to Bellek's homestead, where Ponchar is, but they come across a destroyed homestead on the way. The man says that the droids are like none he has ever seen, led by a \"witch,\" had wrecked the place, and now the sand people are looking for salvageable materials. A few homesteads later, Anakin finds Bellek, who says that Ponchar was kidnapped by Jabba the Hutt. Bellek warns Anakin that he will have to travel through the Jundland Wastes, which are \"prime Tusken Raider territory.\" Anakin assures Bellek that he \"know[s] how to deal with Tusken Raiders\" and asks about the \"witch,\" but Bellek decides he should get back to work on his moisture farm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin arrives at Jabba's Palace and fights his way through guards and battle droids only to meet Aurra Sing at the front door of the palace, who claims she will enjoy watching Skywalker die.

The new arrival then tells Sing to store Anakin in the dungeons, and that she will inform her master \"that the Jedi is no longer a threat to our operation.\" Anakin awakes in the dungeons of Jabba's palace and there finds Raala Ponchar. He easily opens the door to their cell with the Force and the two escape together. Ponchar informs Anakin that Jabba is being paid by Wat Tambor to assist in smuggling construction materials and cortosis to Metalorn. The two free the other prisoners from the dungeon and Anakin escapes on a skiff, which is shot down in the desert by another skiff. The Dark Jedi who captured him previously, named Saato, confronts him near a Sarlacc pit, but she is defeated. Anakin contacts his master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and tells him what has happened.

There, he meets fellow Padawan Barriss Offee, whose troops have been overrun by C-B3 cortosis battle droids. Anakin says he'll take care of it and assists clone troopers in eliminating B1 and C-B3 battle droids as well as Rodian combatants, ASN-121 assassin droids, and droidekas.

The Chiss then leaves, claiming to have work to do. Anakin takes an airspeeder to the Jedi Temple, but instead he finds Count Dooku waiting for him. Dooku comments on Anakin's cybernetic arm, saying it suits him, and after an exchange of comebacks Dooku excuses himself, as he has to destroy the Jedi Archives. Anakin protests at the prospect of the loss of a millennia (sic) of knowledge, but Dooku maintains that without the knowledge contained in the Archives, his Separatist allies will be able to win the war.

Deeper in the factory complex, Anakin meets the Dark Jedi brothers Vinoc and Karoc and engages them in lightsaber combat. After defeating them, he finds some charges with which to destroy the factory's five reactors. However, Wat Tambor greets him before he can reach the fifth reactor.
