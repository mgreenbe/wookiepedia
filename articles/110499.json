The stun tank's design was an extension of the technology utilized in the SPHA-T, another Republic vehicle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The RX-200 measured at 28.6 meters in length, and its repulsorlift generator could reach speeds of 90 kilometers per hour. The stun tank was crewed by two pilots, and could accommodate at least two passengers. Located above the viewport and cabin were two entry hatches. The viewport and cabin were located in the rear of the tank, and was protected by a heavily armored hull while the rest of the craft was protected by light armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The RX-200's primary weapon was a Borstel Galactic Defense NNJ-40 \"Thunderbolt\" long-range ion cannon, which was typically found in capital ships. The ion cannon was mounted on a heavily armored turret powered by a dedicated high-output reactor and generated an extremely impressive ion blast that was able to disable deflector shields and fry electrical systems at incredible distances. The RX-200 was also equipped with two light auto-blasters for close-range protection. Because the ion cannon disabled aerial vehicles, there was the risk of the powerless aircraft crashing into the tanks themselves or other ground vehicles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The RX-200 Falchion-class assault tank served primarily as an anti-aircraft and artillery vehicle.

When the RX-200's long-range ion cannon was used in coordination with other air-defense systems, the RX-200 could deny a large area of the sky and can down entire squadrons of speeders or starfighters when it focused fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The RX-200 Falchion-class assault tank was introduced by Rothana Heavy Engineering at the start of the Clone Wars though was seldom utilized during the conflict. During the Battle of Malastare, the stun tank was utilized as against Hyena-class Droid Bombers and vulture droid starfighters. After a BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber dropped the Republic's new superweapon, the electro-proton bomb, on Separatist forces, the entirety of the droid army was disabled. In the direct aftermath, however, the ground sunk and awoke a hibernating Zillo Beast, and after determining that the creature should be saved to study it, stun tanks were deployed to induce it in a deep sleep. Although during the operation several stun tanks were destroyed, the Republic efforts were successful, as the ion cannons of the stun tanks tapped into the beast's nervous system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Zillo Beast was transported to Coruscant for scientific research, and managed to break free from the Republic Science and Technical Center, resulting in a rampage through Galactic City, stun tanks were once again deployed to subdue the beast.
