An established fixture of the Niima Outpost, CZ-1G5 stayed in service for hundreds of years, despite it being common for manufacturers of CZ-series droids to cut corners. CZ-1G5 worked various odd jobs around the outpost, including occasional clerical work for the Office of the Constable. During this time, CZ-1G5 developed a friendship with Constable Zuvio and earned the Kyuzo's trust. However, CZ-1G5 was at some point reprogrammed by the Kubaz banker Rikard Lovas and setup as a scapegoat for Lovas' planned robbery of his own banking ship. After CZ-1G5 stole the constable office weaponry and ran into the desert, he was confronted by a distraught Zuvio after a lengthy chase. Through CZ-1G5, Zuvio learned of Lovas' scheme and then shot the droid. After Lovas was arrested, CZ-1G5 was rebuilt and reprogrammed, having Lovas' modifications completely removed. Afterwards, CZ-1G5 was allowed to continue working for the Niima Outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
