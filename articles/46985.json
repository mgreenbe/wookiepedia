For centuries, the Farangs fought against a second species native to the planet, the Waroot. The conflict led to the development of unique ritualistic tribal customs and tactics over the many years of conflict. Eventually, the Galactic Empire intervened and dispatched forces to quell the violence on the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the officers accompanying the Imperial troops was military strategist Crat Dakerno. Impressed by the natives' tactics, Dakerno studied their customs, eventually creating the holo boardgame B'shingh from what he had learned. The game became popular in certain intellectual and military circles. The game involved moving Farangs and Waroot around the board in an attempt to capture the opponent's base. Since proficiency in the game required knowledge of the ancient customs of the Farangs and their opponents, the game had only limited popularity. A B'shingh hologame was manufactured by Dakerno Incorporated and retailed for 500."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Farangs were created by Charlene Newcomb for her short story A Certain Point of View, published in West End Games' Star Wars Adventure Journal 8 in 1995. Following a challenge from editor Peter M. Schweighofer, Newcomb wrote this story based on the cover image of the 1989 adventure Riders of the Maelstrom. This cover, illustrated by Daniel Horne, contained a holographic board game, which was incorporated by Newcomb in the form of the Waroot and Farangs. While several figures can be discerned in the cover image, there has been no canon determination as to which figure belongs to which species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A portion of the information from A Certain Point of View was later republished in the sourcebook Gundark's Fantastic Technology: Personal Gear in 1997; the story itself was republished in Tales from the Empire in 1997 and on Hyperspace in 2006.
