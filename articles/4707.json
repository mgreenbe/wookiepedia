After a dispute over the taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems, the droid armies of the Trade Federation invaded the planet Naboo. Hoping to receive help from the Republic's government, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo addressed the Senate and explained that the Federation had invaded her world. Lott Dod, the senator for the Trade Federation, strenuously objected to the claims and recommended that a commission to be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth of the queen's claims. Moe supported Dodd's recommendation to have a commission be sent. Having little faith in the bureaucracies of the Senate, Amidala instead called for a Vote of No Confidence against Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum. Senator Palpatine of Naboo was elected in his place, and Amidala led a battle against the Federation that liberated her world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Moe was assassinated; he was replaced by a fellow Gran senator, Ask Aak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aks Moe appeared briefly in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and was portrayed by Mark Coulier.
