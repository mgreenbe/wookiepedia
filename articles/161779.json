During the Galactic Civil War, an insurgency against the Galactic Empire took root and a group of spies affiliated with the Alliance to Restore the Republic used Vondrol as a base of operations. In response to the rebellion on Meastrinnar, the Empire undertook a pacification campaign and the Imperial Security Bureau eventually discovered the cell. A squad of stormtroopers led by Vin Northal was assigned to eliminate the cell, but the ISB transmission had been decoded incorrectly and they mistakenly attacked an orphanage in Vondrel instead, an action that resulted in the deaths of dozens of sleeping children."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
