The creatures were also known to dwell in vast, hollow trees and hunted dog-sized creatures that lived in the trees' crevices. Located near the end of the Corellian Run, Indoumodo was a destination for assassins and poisoners who would venture to capture the kouhuns for use as untraceable killers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, the bounty hunter Jango Fett tasked fellow hunter Zam Wesell with using a pair of starved kouhuns from Indoumodo to assassinate Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala on Coruscant.
