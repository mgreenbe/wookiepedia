After being discovered to be Force-sensitive as a youth, he was taken to the Draay Estate on Coruscant to be trained as a Jedi Consular, along with a group of other talented students. Together, this group's abilities were far greater than the sum of their parts, and their teacher, Krynda Draay, believed they were the group she had prophesied would vanquish the threat of the Sith. After completing their training, Xamar and the others were inducted into the secret, cabalistic Jedi Covenant, and formed the First WatchCircle, though he spent some time serving with both the Republic Fleet and the navy of his homeworld. Early in the Mandalorian Wars, the First WatchCircle took on a group of Padawans on Taris, with Xamar training a Nagai named Gharn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the WatchCircle had a vision of one of the Padawans turning to the dark side and slaying them all, and they decided to kill each of their Padawans to prevent it from happening. Xamar was far more cautious about the massacre than his peers, but ultimately slew Gharn with his lightsaber. One of the Padawans, Zayne Carrick, escaped, and the WatchCircle made him a scapegoat for the murders, but was unable to apprehend him. After Covenant members Raana Tey and Feln had been killed inadvertently by Marn Hierogryph, the WatchCircle's leader, Lucien Draay, assigned Xamar to Republic Admiral Saul Karath's flagship, Courageous, to try to prevent Carrick from reaching Coruscant and exposing the Covenant to the Jedi Order proper. In Xamar's earlier vision, he had been killed by friendly fire while aboard a Republic ship; rather than waiting to meet his fate, he decided to take the initiative and make his own luck. He fled the Republic ship, captured Carrick personally, and presented him to the Jedi Council. Xamar confessed to killing the Padawans and supplied the Council with information on the Covenant. Enacting a plan formulated by Xamar and the Council, the Khil took Carrick to the Draay Estate, pretending to have captured him by force, though things went awry, and his plot was foiled by Krynda's retainer, Haazen. A force of Jedi Knights supplied by the Council arrived, and Xamar clashed blades with a number of Covenant members before fleeing outside.

He was found to be Force-sensitive as a youngling and was taken to the Jedi Order on Coruscant for training, like many Khil before him. He had strong precognitive skills, often seeing vivid visions with glimpses of the future, and was ultimately taken in by famed Jedi Master Krynda Draay for training as a Consular at her estate on Coruscant around 3993 BBY. Draay had previously renounced the Jedi and refused to train any more apprentices after the death of her husband in the Great Sith War, though she agreed to take on a number of students, including Xamar, because of their exceptional talents. Alongside the young Khil, the group included Feln, a Feeorin; Raana Tey, a Togruta; and a number of Miraluka, among them Q'Anilia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krynda trained each of them in the arts of divination for a number of years, and Xamar in particular grew extremely loyal to her. Krynda's son, Lucien Draay, also frequented the estate during their training, though he had no precognitive abilities and only a basic command of the Force, so Krynda had little interest in him. Instead, Draay's aide Haazen trained Lucien, though he also gave the other students training in the more physical elements of being a Jedi. Xamar was taught to wield a lightsaber efficiently, and became a reasonably skilled combatant, though he and his fellow Consulars paled in comparison to Lucien Draay, who was a skilled warrior like his late father. Five years after first beginning their training, and with all the Miraluka except Q'Anilia no longer part of the group, Xamar and his peers engaged Lucien in a lightsaber sparring session, with Haazen looking on. Lucien made short work of them, incapacitating first Feln and then Raana Tey, before knocking Xamar's weapon from his hand and throwing the young Khil to the ground. Lady Krynda arrived in the hall immediately after her son defeated Q'Anilia; furious that her precious students were being attacked, she told Haazen, in front of Xamar and the others, that the group was the one she had foreseen and the one she was waiting for, who would \"do what must be done.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krynda believed that her four talented seers would be able to locate and prevent the re-emergence of the Sith; together, their Force seeing abilities were far more concentrated and effective than when they meditated alone, and Krynda hoped they would be able to foresee any Jedi turning to the dark side. After they were Knighted, Krynda inducted them into the Jedi Covenant, a secretive Jedi cabal founded by Krynda and Haazen, which was dedicated to using whatever means necessary to stop the Sith. The Covenant was unknown to the Jedi Council, and its members were not above breaking the Jedi Code and using illegal means to achieve their ends. Xamar, Feln, Q'Anilia, and Raana Tey formed the First WatchCircle, along with Lucien Draay, who would act as de facto leader and an intermediary between them and the Covenant. The First WatchCircle would be paired together on assignments, carrying out the normal day-to-day duties of Jedi, but they were constantly on the watch for potential future Sith. Haazen's contacts ensured that they were never split up by the Council. Xamar was somewhat wary of being in such a secretive group, and he often found himself wishing all their actions were done through the proper channels. He became close friends with Q'Anilia, though he often clashed with Lucien Draay. Xamar was a cautious individual, unlike the often brash Draay; however, Xamar was content to let Draay lead the group once Krynda kept him in check, knowing the Human Jedi was a better leader than he was."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Rogue Moon Prophecy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the Khil were a peace-loving species, they had their own navy, to which even Khil Jedi were called to serve.

He also had considerable experience working with the Republic fleet, and had a keen knowledge of capital ships. Eventually, Xamar, Feln, Q'Anilia, Raana Tey, and Draay were made Jedi Masters. Several years before 3964 BBY, the First WatchCircle was posted to the Outer Rim world of Taris. Inhabiting a satellite Jedi Tower, they each took a Padawan learner; Xamar's was Gharn, a talented Nagai Jedi. Around this time, Xamar began investigating rumors that the Muur Talisman, an ancient Sith artifact created by Sith Lord Karness Muur, was buried on Taris, and he began to search for it on behalf of the Jedi Covenant. His search yielded no results, but he hoped to continue until he found the talisman. Additionally, he spent much time researching the talisman; he learned that it could turn nearby sentients into subservient creatures, but that it had no effect on Force-sensitives. He compiled a report and sent it to the Covenant on Coruscant, suggesting that a Covenant Shadow should be sent on a mission to help him locate it and neutralize its threat once the Padawans' training was completed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xamar and his comrades continued training their Padawans for a number of years, until they were close to Knighthood.

As Draay and the others explained to their students, meteorites rained down on the planet constantly, making every step potentially their last. Xamar and the three other Consulars in the WatchCircle hoped to spend the time it took their students to return to the base camp meditating, as Q'Anilia believed the Force would flow freely on the rogue moon.

He perished in the vision, as did Q'Anilia; a mysterious figure in a red environmental suit was responsible for each of their deaths. Draay roused them from their collective trance before long, and they expressed to him their interpretation of the policy: that the Sith would return, and that one of their Padawans, who were each wearing a red environmental suit, would turn to the dark side and kill each of them. Raana Tey advocated killing each of the Padawans then and there in order to vanquish the threat, to which Feln agreed, believing it was a clear message from the Force. Xamar was far less certain, claiming that the Force's swirling, ever-changing nature may have clouded its meaning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each of the Consulars, Xamar included, knew what they saw, and Draay opined that they had to act, and quickly. Xamar clashed with him, wanting to return to Taris and contact Coruscant to get Krynda's approval before doing anything. The Khil refused to take part in any massacre of the Padawans, unless the four told the Covenant leadership what they had seen. Draay was swayed, and promised to make contact; in the meantime, they would return to Taris and act like usual.

However, not long after the Rogue Moon Prophecy, Q'Anilia fainted, informing the others that something had changed, and that something bad would happen soon. Assuming it was related to the Rogue Moon Prophecy, Draay informed the other WatchCircle members that they would shift their plans forward and carry out the murders as soon as possible after getting approval from the Covenant on Coruscant. Draay claimed to have contacted Krynda, though he had in fact told only Haazen of their vision and plan. Xamar was still unsure about the plan, though Draay refused to tell him exactly what Krynda had supposedly said, but merely that she had approved of the massacre. Xamar grudgingly relented and agreed to do his part in the killing. They decided to carry out their plan at the students' Knighting ceremony, and beforehand held a banquet for each of the Padawans and any of their friends or relatives on Taris. The Masters felt it was important to make their apprentices' last day pleasant.

Before they could make use of the lightsabers, though, they had to wait for Padawan Zayne Carrick, who was late as usual. While they waited, Shad Jelavan noticed that Draay, Carrick's master, was carrying his lightsaber also, leading the young Knight-to-be to believe that his good friend had also been selected to become a Knight\u2014something that was not expected, as Carrick was largely considered a buffoon by student and Master alike. Trying to buy time before Carrick's late arrival, Xamar, Draay, and Raana Tey attempted to persuade the Padawans that he was ready, though Jelavan and the others disagreed, and sensed that their masters were lying.

Xamar and the others jumped down in pursuit, following Carrick into a droid storage chamber, though he managed to escape them. They eventually reached him as he mounted an airspeeder, to which petty criminal Marn Hierogryph was chained. Xamar held back with Q'Anilia as Raana Tey, Feln, and Draay gave chase in airspeeders of their own. Raana Tey and the others were unsuccessful, and soon returned to the Jedi Tower. The bodies of the Padawans were taken to a morgue by droids, and the four Jedi Consulars attempted to use divination to discern where Carrick had fled to.

Sowrs believed the story and agreed to send all available personnel in search of Carrick and Hierogryph. In contacting her, however, Xamar alerted those on Coruscant to what had transpired, and he was soon prompted to provide details. Alarmed, he delayed them as best he could, stalling until he could contact Draay and receive further instruction. Constable Sowrs informed the Khil Master that her personnel had made a number of sightings of Carrick and his accomplice on their way toward the refugee camps near the Undercity. Xamar contacted Draay, asking him what he should report back to Coruscant, though Draay was uninterested\u2014he only wanted news of Carrick.

After a short time, he was captured by Twi'lek bounty hunter Valius Ying, who took him to the Jedi Tower. Xamar gathered with the other Masters to meet with Carrick; they hoped to discuss their actions with him and tell him about their motives before killing him. Ying and Carrick were scanned for weapons by a security droid before entering the Masters' meeting chamber, though Hierogryph was not with him, to Draay's anger. Ying claimed to have found Carrick alone and theorized that his comrades had perished on the rogue moon, though the Consulars were able to discern that Hierogryph still lived, and sensed some deceit in Ying. Disregarding the fact that Ying had only brought Carrick and not his accomplice, the Masters told him that they were part of a Jedi Covenant dedicated to rooting out the Sith, and recounted their actions on the day of the massacre to him.

Around the same time, the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders began encroaching on the Republic territory near Taris, but neither the Republic nor the Jedi sent reinforcements to protect the planet. The local populace, infuriated, began rioting and kidnapped Sector Constable Sowrs' children. For three weeks the Jedi Masters remained in their Jedi Tower, with Raana Tey wanting to do something to stop the riots. However, ultimately, it would not be their mandate, as the Council contacted Draay and Xamar to inform them that the five Masters were being recalled to Coruscant for an audience with the Jedi Council. The Councilors weren't happy with the results of their collaboration, and felt that their authority had been undermined. Xamar could not disagree with them, and was resentful towards Draay for what he saw as his poor handling of the entire Carrick situation. He expressed his frustration and anger in front of his colleagues through sarcasm when he and Draay announced the Council's intentions to Tey, Feln, and Q'Anilia. Moments later, a hologram transmission sent by a droid arrived, bearing Lucien Draay's name. The hologram was of Zayne Carrick, and he vowed to track down each of the Masters and kill them.

After Xamar reported the situation, Draay contacted Republic Security's administrator, berating him and informing him that Xamar would be sent to oversee their efforts.

Draay requested that the Council allow him and his peers to put these wrongs right and lead the search for Carrick, though Lamar vehemently denied them that right. He was suspicious about how the five of them continued to end up working together on assignments, and claimed that it would stop that day.

In the vision, Q'Anilia realized that the rakghouls\u2014which were supposed to be mindless creatures\u2014were using intelligent thought. Xamar attempted to guide the sightless Q'Anilia to safety, though Feln was unable to help him as he was himself occupied with organized rakghoul attacks\u2014orchestrated by a mysterious figure wearing what Xamar knew was the Muur talisman.

Draay was furious with them for their perceived disrespect of Tey, though Xamar dismissed his comments, telling Draay that knowledge could not be called upon whenever it suited them. Xamar and Q'Anilia informed Draay that they had seen the Muur talisman, which caught his attention. The talisman was an ancient Sith artifact that predated the reign of Naga Sadow, which, when worn, allowed the user to access ancient and mysterious powers. The rakghouls were known to be native only to the planet Taris, Zayne Carrick's last known whereabouts, and the Consulars believed that the rakghoul plague in their vision could be started by Carrick if they did not act. Feln volunteered to travel to Taris and find the talisman, but Draay knew that the Council would never allow it, so he opted to send one of his Covenant Shadows, Celeste Morne, to track down Carrick and bring the talisman to a storehouse on Odryn.

Xamar and Q'Anilia attempted to reach Draay, but were unable to contact him for many hours. They finally met with him in the Draay Estate, and informed him what they had seen, but he already knew. Draay berated Q'Anilia for losing control and displaying her anguish that the prophecy was coming true, informing them that things had become serious.

During the fighting, an overhead bridge exploded, and many Jedi suggested that a bomb had been set off; Xamar, however, knew it had come from above. The debris rained down upon the Khil Master, injuring him; he had just moments left, though, as he realized that Karath's fleet was firing upon the Jedi outside the Estate. Xamar perished in fiery explosion, caused by friendly fire just as the prophecy predicted. Haazen, who had in actualityy gone to the dark side himself, had always planned to turn the Republic fleet against the Jedi by installing the slave system in the first place in name of the Draay Trust; Xamar's previous concerns were not unjustified."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like most Khil, Xamar was very cautious, and he often clashed with Lucien Draay during his time in the First WatchCircle. Draay's modus operandi involved acting what Xamar saw as arbitrarily and often hastily, while the Khil Jedi preferred more patient methods, usually wanting to seek approval from the Covenant\u2014or, more specifically, Krynda\u2014before acting. In the aftermath of the Rogue Moon Prophecy, Xamar refused to take part in the killings unless Draay contacted his mother and sought her approval; ultimately, it took a lie from Draay to persuade Xamar. Xamar was fanatically loyal to Krynda, so such so that he was willing to risk\u2014or, if it came to it, give\u2014his life for hers. He recognized that she was extremely important, being one of the few Jedi seers still alive after the harrowing Great Sith War. Thus, he was happy to give up his freedom to the Jedi Council in exchange for Krynda's full immunity. He also insisted on playing a part in her kidnap from Draay Estate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xamar held all life in very high regard. While the other First WatchCircle members had little doubts about killing their Padawans after the vision, Xamar was unsure, and thought it would be a tragedy if they misinterpreted the prophecy and killed their learners needlessly. Lucien Draay saw the killings as merely part of their mission to stop the Sith, but to Xamar they were much more\u2014and still weighed heavily on his conscience months later. During Xamar, Feln, and Q'Anilia's vision at Raana Tey's memorial, when they were fighting the rakghouls, Xamar attempted to protect the vulnerable Q'Anilia, unlike Feln, whose only concern was with his own safety. Later, during the Jedi attack on the Draay Estate, Xamar told Vrook Lamar's Jedi strike team to do as little harm as they possibly could to the Covenant members guarding the Estate\u2014they were all Jedi and had the same overall goals, even if their methods of achieving these goals differed greatly, and, in Xamar's estimation, none deserved death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xamar stood apart from many of his peers on the WatchCircle in many ways. He was more honest than Feln and Raana Tey; he wanted to tell the Jedi Council of the prophecy and its implications during their audience on Coruscant, while the others wanted to keep it secret and deal with it themselves. Additionally, the fact that he and his peers were operating in the shadows, unsanctioned by the proper authorities, concerned him greatly, while others relished being free of any rules. He was less violent than Feln; more clearheaded than the passionate Raana Tey; and more defiant towards Lucien Draay than Q'Anilia, often questioning his orders and using sarcasm in his presence. He and Draay had many differences, and for a time Xamar acknowledged that Draay was a better leader than he, but ultimately he felt that Draay had gone corrupt with power and was incompetent. Xamar was not particularly ambitious and rarely had designs on leading any groups; he theorized that this came with the intricate knowledge he held of the future, and that those who could not see the future, such as Draay\u2014who he was often dismissive of\u2014were more likely to seek personal success."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xamar was a talented Jedi seer, and one of Lady Krynda Draay's most promising students as a youth. After the loss of her husband in the Great Sith War, Krynda refused to train any Jedi for over five years; it was a testament to the abilities of Xamar and his peers that she came out of retirement to train them. While Xamar's ability to see the future was great, when he worked with the other students his powers were enhanced. Sometimes visions came to Xamar and the other WatchCircle members when they least expected them, and nothing could be done to stop them coming; other times, he and his peers actively sought out the future, traveling to serene locations to attune their relationship with the Force. The Rogue Moon Prophecy came as a result of the WatchCircle traveling to one of Taris' moons to meditate; they hoped to search the future, but weren't trying to find anything in particular, unlike during the hunt for Zayne Carrick, when Xamar and his peers used their divinatory skills to find out where Carrick would flee to. At other times, such as Raana Tey's funeral, the visions would come unexpectedly, often leaving Xamar disoriented and unsure where he was after they had ended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xamar was also a competent military commander, serving with his species' navy for a time early in his life, as well as working with the Republic Fleet on numerous occasions. He had a keen knowledge of capital ships, and his knowledge garnered him much respect from the likes of Saul Karath, who were dismissive of most Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the less physical aspects of being a Jedi appealed to him most, Xamar was able to wield a lightsaber in some capacity. As a youth, he was given rudimentary training by Haazen, though whenever Xamar and the other Consulars-in-training sparred with Lucien Draay, they always came off worse. Later, during Zayne Carrick and Jarael's raid on the Jedi Tower, Xamar could do little to stop Jarael, who was wielding a lightsaber. Xamar was diminutive in size and was not a violent being; as such, Draay was able to throttle him with ease later in life. Xamar again had to use his lightsaber during the Jedi attack on the Draay Estate, in which he acquitted himself well, fending off many Covenanters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xamar, pronounced \"ZAY-mar,\" was created by John Jackson Miller for the Knights of the Old Republic comic series, debuting in Commencement, Part 1 in January 2006. Neither his name nor his species was revealed in that issue, but in response to a question from a fan on Miller's StarWars.com blog jokingly asking if the character was the same species as Doctor Zoidberg from Futurama, Miller revealed that he was in fact a member of the Khil race, introduced by West End Games' Wanted by Cracken over twelve years previously. Xamar's name was then revealed a month later in Knights of the Old Republic 2; John Jackson Miller purposely revealed his and Feln's names after the other Jedi Masters' were given so as not to overwhelm readers with too many new names in the inaugural issue. Xamar subsequently appeared in the prelude issue Crossroads, all the subsequent issues of the Commencement arc\u2014albeit through a hologram and in a number of flashbacks in two issues\u2014before much of his backstory was revealed in Knights of the Old Republic 9."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xamar did not reappear for a number of issues, though he was given a biography in the Knights of the Old Republic Handbook and was illustrated in Ryder Windham's Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force in late 2007.

Thus, some fans asked if Xamar's role in the episode was based upon that of \"Deep Throat,\" a secret source which provided information on the scandals to the media. Miller, however, commented on his blog that Xamar's role was more similar to that of John Dean, who acted as a court witness during the scandal's investigation, as Dean was \"further inside the conspiracy when he testified.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In The Essential Guide to the Force, Xamar and his colleagues are stated to have fought in the Great Sith War; however, this is impossible, as they only began training some years afterward, as established in Flashpoint Interlude: Homecoming. In Turnabout, Part 1, artist Alan Robinson depicted Xamar in his traditional Jedi outfit while aboard the Courageous, so as to make him more easily recognizable as he was in prior issues. However, author John Jackson Miller intended for Xamar to be wearing a naval uniform, and included a line of dialogue in which Xamar stated that his uniform was real. Miller has stated that readers should assume Xamar was wearing the uniform when he first boarded the ship but later changed into his Jedi robes. There is a possibility that Xamar's line about his uniform will be changed in the comic's trade paperback printing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When John Jackson Miller first created the character of Xamar, he wanted to depict the \"sibilant sing-song speech pattern\" given to the Khil by previous sources. He opted to triple occasional instances of the letter \"s\" appearing in Xamar's dialogue to show that this particular piece of continuity had not been overlooked. However, as Xamar became a more prominent character in KotOR\u2014and thus began to have more lines\u2014Miller found that the triple \"s\"es were occurring too regularly, so cut them entirely out of much of Xamar's dialogue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
