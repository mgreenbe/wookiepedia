They used their sweet scent to lure insects to alight upon them, before trapping them there as the tonqu flower's long petal rolled up. In 29 ABY, former Yuuzhan Vong Executor Nom Anor compared the sentient planet Zonama Sekot to a tonqu flower, as it attracted beings and did not let them go."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tonqu flower's only mention was in 2003's The Final Prophecy, written by Greg Keyes as part of The New Jedi Order series.
