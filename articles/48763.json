He defeated the gang before they could start a war on the planet, and planted a tracking device on a Jin'ha arms shipment, which the Jedi High Council tracked to the world Obredaan, the home of the warriors. The Jedi Order then sent two Jedi Masters, Plo Koon and Eeth Koth, to Obredaan to investigate the Jin'ha. The two Masters piloted a Consular-class cruiser for the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon their arrival at Obredaan, Koth's and Koon's Consular-class cruiser crashed into the Obredaan swamps, and the two Jedi Masters were captured by the Jin'ha.

The Jedi then sent Kenobi and Jinn to discover what had befallen Koth and Koon. They succeeded in their mission by rescuing the two Masters, and stole a sample of cortosis metal from a hidden Jin'ha mine. Additionally, the arrival of a Trade Federation gunship at the mine suggested a link between the Trade Federation and the Jin'ha. Further investigation by Kenobi revealed that the Jin'ha were mining cortosis for the Trade Federation, and a few weeks later the Federation betrayed the trust of the Jedi Council by blockading the planet Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mission to Obredaan was first mentioned in the preview for the 2001 video game Star Wars: Obi-Wan in the \"Gamescape\" article in Star Wars Insider 57, published in 2001.
