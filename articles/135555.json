It was a large, gray, multilevel structure, with many wings and halls extending from its main frame. The spaceport had three levels that contained docking bays, four levels featuring food courts that sold foodstuffs such as Stenness lizard pie, and nine hundred forty-seven levels with brothels. As the Stenness Hyperspace Terminal had a high number of travelers that passed through, there were many traders and merchants that wandered the halls, trying to sell wares such as Novanian grog liquor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3999 BBY, hyperspace beacons were vital to facilitate hyperspace travel. The beacons were constructed at jump points known to be safe and reliable, guiding the way for ships going into hyperspace. At many of the beacons complex spaceports were built, to house and service the ever-expanding trans-galactic traffic. One such beacon was located in the Stenness system in the Inner Rim, and it was at this site that the Stenness Hyperspace Terminal was created. The terminal was located on the mining frontier, and by 3999 BBY many criminals were known to pass through the station on their way to stealing mining rights from the natives of the Stenness Node region, the Nessies. In 3999 BBY, Jedi Knight Andur Sunrider and his family, while on their way to deliver a package of valuable Adegan crystals to the Tchuukthai Jedi Master Thon, docked at the Stenness Hyperspace Terminal in their ship, the Lightside Explorer. However, two of Stenness-based crime lord Bogga the Hutt's enforcers, Quanto and Gudb, discovered the package's existence through the use of on-station eavesdropping equipment. The two thugs brought the information to Bogga himself, piquing the Hutt's interest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bogga assembled a group of three enforcers, consisting of Gudb, Rek, and Quanto, and sent them to accost the Sunriders as they waited for their ship to clear customs. Rek and Quanto began to push around Andur Sunrider's protocol droid, A-3DO, drawing the Jedi's attention; when Sunrider turned his back, Gudb released his pet gorm-worm, Skritch, who killed Sunrider with its poisonous bite. As Sunrider's wife, Nomi knelt over her husband's corpse, Andur's Force ghost appeared and directed Nomi to take up his lightsaber and defend herself from the thugs. Nomi did as she was told, and struck down the thugs with her fallen husband's weapon. Soon afterward, Nomi departed the Stenness Hyperspace Terminal in the Lightside Explorer, committed to finishing the delivery of the Adegan crystals. Around the same time as the Sunrider incident, Satal and Aleema Keto, heirs to the throne of the Empress Teta system, visited the station on their ship, the Krath Enchanter. The Ketos were en route to the Galactic Republic capital of Coruscant, and stopped by to refuel. As the ship had no cargo, it was cleared to land at Docking Bay Four."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many travelers passed through the Stenness Hyperspace Terminal, a good amount of them being criminals on their way to stealing mining rights from the Nessies. As such, many traders and merchants were present on the spaceport, hoping to do business with passersby. Local crime lord Bogga the Hutt maintained a presence on the Stenness Hyperspace Terminal, along with several of his enforcers.Also, there were hundreds of levels of brothels located on the station, indicating that there was a high number of prostitutes working on the spaceport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Stenness Hyperspace Terminal had a thousand levels; three of them with docking bays, four had food troughs, and nine hundred forty-seven featured brothels. The space station's docking bays, such as Docking Bay Four, where Satal Keto landed in the Krath Enchanter, were all numbered. There was a room where Bogga the Hutt and his gang stayed while on the terminal, along with a room that contained monitoring equipment that Bogga's enforcers used to track incoming ships and to discern which ones they should hijack. However, the monitoring station was located on the other side of the station from some of the docking bays, such as Docking Bay Six, discouraging Bogga's thugs from hijacking vessels in that area. The station's food courts were bustling and full of sentient beings, and fountains could be found nearby."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Stenness Hyperspace Terminal first appeared in Tales of the Jedi: The Saga of Nomi Sunrider, the second arc of the Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Tom Veitch and released over late 1993-early 1994. The station only appeared in the arc's first issue, but was also mentioned at the beginning of the second issue. In these appearances, it was illustrated by Janine Johnston. The Stenness Hyperspace Terminal was also mentioned in an article of Star Wars Insider 26, George R. Strayton's 1996 reference book Tales of the Jedi Companion, and in 2008 it was referred to in several entries in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
