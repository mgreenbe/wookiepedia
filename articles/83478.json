The following year, Azadi's cell joined forces with the Spectres in obtaining intelligence about an updated version of the TIE Defender and a daring rebel attempt to take out the Imperial Armory Complex. After the Spectres managed to rescue Hera Syndulla and take out the Imperial Armory Complex, the Lothal resistance and the Spectres played an important role in expelling the Empire from Lothal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ryder Azadi's resistance cell consisted of himself, the former farmer Morad Sumar and his wife Marida Sumar, and the Ithorian bartender Jho.

Ryder picked up Ezra's team in Capital City. After escaping an Imperial patrol, the rebels met at Ryder's stone circle hideout.

Following fierce fighting, Pryce destroyed the Lothal rebels' ore crawler, which had served as their defensive position. At least two Lothal resistance fighters were killed during the fighting. Despite capturing the Lothal resistance, Pryce was ambushed by Hera's reinforcements including the former Clone troopers Gregor, Wolffe, the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka, the Ugnaught Melch, the bounty hunter Ketsu Onyo and Kallus and a pack of loth-wolves.
