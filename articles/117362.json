Rose was able to blow up twelve OreDiggers and stop the First Order's mining operations for three days. Her parents told her that she and Paige had to find the Resistance and join them in their fight against the First Order. Rose and Paige were welcomed into the Resistance by Admirals Gial Ackbar and Amilyn Holdo. The two of them joined the Resistance's Cobalt Squadron. Rose eventually received news that the First order shelled her people to test the results. Having lost everything they had to the First Order, Rose and her sister committed themselves to the Resistance to avenge their homeworld. The two of them were approached by General Leia Organa, who offered them her condolences for the First Order's genocide of Hays Minor. Organa told Rose and her sister that she would let them go after First Order on their own. However, the two sisters decided to stay, knowing, they could make a bigger impact on the First Order.

Paige then told her to go to sleep, but Rose continued, stating that she had to keep reading as some commands were even in Calamarian. When First Order ships appeared and Poe Dameron was trapped outside the ship with the hangar door being unable to open, Rose helped him by figuring out the problem and opening the door.

She pointed out that many of these rich people and gamblers had come into their fortunes by selling weapons and goods to the First Order, or otherwise had profited from war and the suffering of others.

DJ then bargained for his life, exchanging Resistance secrets he had gleaned from Finn and Rose in exchange for payment and freedom. Rose and Finn were both furious with the maneuver. Deeming death by firing squad to be \"too good for them,\" Phasma summoned a pair of executioner troopers instead. Before they could be executed, however, Holdo jumped the Raddus to hyperspace right through the First Order fleet, splitting the Supremacy. The blast briefly knocked Finn unconscious, whereupon Rose began dragging him towards a nearby shuttle before he regained consciousness. But their way was barred by Phasma and a squad of stormtroopers, who immediately opened fire on them. Suddenly, a rogue AT-ST began firing on Phasma and her stormtroopers.

Shortly after telling Rey some of his recent experiences, Dameron met Finn and asked him how Rose was, to which Finn stated that she was asleep, something he thought that was good, though he wasn't sure at all, as he wasn't a doctor, commenting on the first aid training received by the First Order stormtrooper and the realization that the stormtroopers who failed were left to die from their injuries, leading Dameron to tell his friend that he was sure that Tico would be alright even though he couldn't be sure she was, but that he was sure that he can choose to believe the former.

The Zixon were then enthralled by the Echo Horn taken by First Order Commander Branwayne Spiftz. Tico took an old power armor set to attack them, but they escaped, leaving the Resistance to come up with a new way to free the Zixon, assisted by the spy Glenna Kip.

She worked with the Resistance droid pool to construct biohexacrypt codes in the pursuit of bypassing First Order jamming or interception. The now-Commander Tico was present when a message from a First Order spy was decoded, confirming that Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine had survived his death aboard the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station. Tico was still unsure if they could believe it, but C-3PO revealed another part of the message; Supreme Leader Kylo Ren had allied with the phantom emperor and planned to deploy a fleet unlike anything the galaxy had known.

Rose's surname of Tico was revealed by Vanity Fair on May 23, 2017. Rose shares a name with Maz Kanata's placeholder name during the pre-production of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was a tribute to director J.J.

There wasn't conflict between them. So I realized I had to come up with something else.

This attracted coverage from several news media including Newsweek and HuffPost. In response to criticism likening Tico to Jar Jar Binks, the official Star Wars Facebook page defended the character's contribution to the story plot. Attorney Anthony Nguyen described Tran as the first \"woman of color\" to be cast in a leading role in the Star Wars franchise, while journalist Nicole Karlis commented that attacks on Tran reflected a fear of women who defied sexist stereotypes.

Co-writer Chris Terrio commented, \"One of the reasons that Rose has a few less scenes than we would like her to have has to do with the difficulty of using [the late] Carrie [Fisher]'s footage in the way we wanted to. We wanted Rose to be the anchor at the rebel base who was with Leia. We thought we couldn't leave Leia at the base without any of the principals who we love, so Leia and Rose were working together. As the process evolved, a few scenes we'd written with Rose and Leia turned out to not meet the standard of photorealism that we'd hoped for. Those scenes unfortunately fell out of the film. The last thing we were doing was deliberately trying to sideline Rose. We adore the character, and we adore Kelly \u2013 so much so that we anchored her with our favorite person in this galaxy, General Leia.\" Terrio later clarified, \"I was referring to a specific scene in which Leia's emotional state in Episode VII did not seem to match the scene we wrote for use in Episode IX, and so it was cut at the script stage before the VFX work was done. If we had chosen to use the scene, ILM would have made it look perfect.
