The damutek, a series of organic buildings making up a walled compound, was heavily guarded, as the shapers\u2014Yuuzhan Vong scientists and bioengineers\u2014who worked inside were carrying out work of the utmost secrecy, vital for the progress of the war, which was then being waged against the defenders of the galaxy that the Yuuzhan Vong had invaded three years previously. Bhasu Ruuq, by 29 ABY, had been performing his duties guarding the damutek and its occupants long enough to know, and to have developed an attraction for, Master Shaper Nen Yim, the leading scientist. That year, in the final months of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the damutek was attacked by a pair of Jedi Knights. Having infiltrated the compound with the help of rebellious Shamed Ones\u2014members of the oppressed Yuuzhan Vong underclass\u2014the two Jedi gained access to the laboratories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ruuq defended the damutek along with the other warriors stationed there, but he and seven of his fellows were soon forced back into one of the innermost chambers of the compounds by their attackers. Already present in the room, however, was Master Shaper Nen Yim. Concerned for the safety of his charge, Ruuq turned from the fight with the rapidly advancing Jedi to advise the shaper to flee. Yim did not flee, but instead apologized to Ruuq, before using a weapon concealed in her modified shaper hand to impale the warrior through the eye. Ruuq died instantly, and Yim went on to aid the two Jedi\u2014Tahiri Veila and Corran Horn\u2014in defeating the remaining five warriors. Unbeknownst to Ruuq, Yim had arranged for her own abduction, as she desired to escape Yuuzhan'tar in order to carry out investigations into the living planet Zonama Sekot. Ruuq's mortal wound was subsequently disguised as having been inflicted by a lightsaber blade, the end result being that the warrior appeared to have died at the hands of a Jedi, rather than a fellow Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quiet for a warrior, at least in the opinion of Nen Yim, and attracted to a member of another caste, even though liaisons between different castes were forbidden, Rhasu Ruuq was nevertheless capable, tasked with guarding one of the most significant locations in the Yuuzhan Vong empire.
