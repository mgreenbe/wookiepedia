Talloran was one of the first settlements the Separatists infiltrated when they arrived on the island of Avilatan, and the Separatist agents found spympathizers in many of the local working-class people, who were angry over the exploitation and abuse of them by corrupt members of the Ord Mantell Central Authority, and got them to agree to help secure the village. The takeover did not begin until after the Separatists had conquered the small island of Mannett Point, and the husbands of some local women died defending the village. In order to contain the Separatists, the Central Authority's backers in the Galactic Republic set up a Blockade of Talloran village, which resulted in food shortages inside the walls of the settlement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Separatist takeover of Talloran village was first mentioned in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, during the Prologue of the Smuggler class and in the Codex entry \"Talloran Village\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
