However, upon arrival, Sheelal found no mumuu, only a fierce Kaleesh woman wearing a mumuu mask and carrying twin Lig swords: Ronderu lij Kummar. She was the slayer whom Sheelal had dreamed of, not himself, and thus both he and Kummar were from then considered living manifestations of the cryptic parable Sheelal, or The Dreamer/The Dreamt One."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
