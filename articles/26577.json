It features Star Wars\u2013themed Christmas songs. The album was produced by Meco Monardo, the man who recorded the infamous disco version of A New Hope's main theme. Anthony Daniels voiced C-3PO, and Ben Burtt provided the sounds for R2-D2 and Chewbacca. Christmas in the Stars was recorded in 1980, two years after the much maligned Star Wars Holiday Special aired. Though they share similar themes, they have no connections to one another other than the fact that they were both marketed in conjunction with major holidays (the Holiday Special being tied to the American Thanksgiving holiday)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Production"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Album creator Meco wrote a nine-page letter to George Lucas asking if he could produce this type of album for the Star Wars saga. The album was one of the industry's first non-classical-or-jazz projects to be recorded and mixed digitally. The majority of this album's original songs were written by Maury Yeston, a Yale University music professor who later wrote several successful Broadway musicals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jon Bon Jovi (credited as John Bongiovi) made his recording debut on this album, singing lead vocals on \"R2-D2 We Wish You A Merry Christmas.\" Bon Jovi did it as a favor to his cousin Tony Bongiovi, one of the producers of the album."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The album cover utilized a Ralph McQuarrie painting which was also used for Lucasfilm's 1980 Christmas card."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Release"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Christmas in the Stars was released by RSO records on LP and cassette in November of 1980."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also in 1980, RSO released a 45 of \"What Can You Get a Wookiee for Christmas (When He Already Owns a Comb)\" (credited to The Star Wars Intergalactic Droid Choir and Chorale) b/w \"R2-D2 We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" with a picture sleeve.
