Circa 1 ABY, a ship carrying medical equipment from Coronet City to Sinis in Tyrena apparently crashed near the city. Sinis thus recruited a spacer to investigate the ship crash site and retrieve as much equipment as possible. The spacer spotted and fought several Deflarian scavengers around the wreck. Sinis then requested his friend Yorick to analyze the flight recorder recovered from the Deflarians. The slicer finally discovered that the flight recorder was modified by the Deflarians. Sinis later tasked the spacer to attack the Deflarian Communications Post in order to find information about the insolvent of the Deflarians in the crash. This led the spacer to another Deflarian camp were the spacer defeated a Deflarian lieutenant and his enforcers, and finally retrieved Sinis's medical equipment, stolen by the Deflarians. Sinis was glad to recover his missing cargo. He later transmitted all the information gathered about the Deflarians to Inspector Cora of the CorSec. This eventually led to the discovery that the Deflarians hijacked the ship to stole its cargo and then crashed a ship of the same model to cover the theft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sinis appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
