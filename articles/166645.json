In 3643 BBY, he was among those refugees and settlers who were selected by the Republic to resettle the planet Taris as part of their reclamation effort, and Yelzrin was chosen as the leader of a group of settlers. His group established a colony on the shores of Lake Brell, in an old bunker built into the hills. However, his colony was targeted by the Sith Empire in its efforts to sabotage the Republic's resettlement of Taris; the Sith assassin Rora Seake was sent to wipe out the colony."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fortunately for the colonists, an Imperial operative leaked Seake's mission to a young Jedi Knight, and the Jedi and a companion reached the settlement before Seake. Yelzrin greeted the Jedi Knight and offered his visitors whatever they wanted from their supplies, but he was confused when the Knight warned him of Seake's impending arrival. Shocked, Yelzrin started to gather the other colonists for evacuation, but it was too late\u2014Seake arrived with two massive creatures known as jurgorans, which she kept as pets. As Yelzrin fell to his knees in terror, the Jedi intercepted Seake and confronted the assassin, defeating Seake's pets and then the assassin herself. Immensely relieved, Yelzrin offered whatever reward he could provide to his saviors, but the Knight refused to accept it. With the Jedi's departure, Yelzrin and his colonists set about building up their settlement's defenses against further incursions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yelzrin was dark-skinned with short black hair and green eyes. He admired the Jedi, as he was told stories about them as a child, though he never truly believed them until he met a Jedi in person on Taris.

The mission is only received if the player has a positive light side alignment at the end of the previous mission; dark side players are instead sent to acquire stolen Jedi relics from pirates. Players can also refuse the mission to help the colonists, which rewards the player with dark side alignment points. As the Jedi Knight is a Republic class and is thus assumed to make decisions that reward in the maximum light side points, this article assumes the player saved Yelzrin and the colonists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
