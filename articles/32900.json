Stephens for the revised edition of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Roleplaying Game that was posted on Wizards.com on October 10, 2002. Due to the fact that the adventure was intended to be usable in any era, it is impossible to determine the time frame the pistol was used in. Upon finding that Erethen has been reached by the players, whether the Faunors use the DL-12 heavy blaster pistols or their LaserHone Duelist vibrorapiers is up to the gamemaster; a successful encounter involves either the Faunor brothers retreating or being killed by the player characters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"DL\" designation was present on a number of other blasters which were produced by BlasTech Industries, including the DL-18 Blaster Pistol and the DL-44 heavy blaster pistol.
