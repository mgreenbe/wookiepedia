It was located in the Jedi Temple of Coruscant, headquarters of the Jedi Order. A band led by an Ortolan nalargon player often performed there, and so did a Human dancer. A dimly lit room, the Officers' Club also featured arcade games and a bar. Various trophies were displayed on shelves, and a damaged Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor was left hanging from the ceiling as a decoration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
