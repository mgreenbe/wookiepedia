It was used by Skywalker for seven years before its destruction just prior to the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Specifications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rather than imitate his master's lightsaber design, as was customary, Anakin Skywalker instead created a solid, heavy-duty hilt that favored maximum strength. The dual-phase weapon featured a solid casing, ridged handgrip, forward mounted adjustment knobs and a beveled emitter shroud as well as a \"throttle-style\" activator. Along with the blue color crystal, it also utilized a high output diatium power cell and a dual-phase focusing crystal. The basic design of this weapon was also incorporated into his second lightsaber albeit with a modified shroud and mid-section."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Construction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 29 BBY, Anakin Skywalker constructed the pieces of his lightsaber prior to arriving on Ilum, where he chose three crystals that \"seemed to speak to him\" from the Crystal Caves. After banishing from his mind the horrifying specter of an eerily familiar yet indeterminate slaver pursuing his mother Shmi, but also after being startled by a second specter in the almost equally terrifying image of the emergent Sith Lord Darth Maul, whom he immediately attacked, he dropped the crystals. Ultimately defeating the ghosts, Skywalker awoke from his trance to find his lightsaber fully constructed. The weapon, he immediately found, was \"a perfect fit\" and \"perfectly balanced to his hand.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First blood"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the earliest uses of this lightsaber was when Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were intercepted by the slaver Krayn, whom Skywalker remembered from his childhood on Tatooine. The weapon's first \"kill\" was actually of a non-living entity\u2014a droid in the pirate ship's weapons-control tech center that Skywalker decapitated and impaled; the young Jedi \"felt a surge of satisfaction from the power of his new lightsaber. He wasn't in training mode anymore.\" Kenobi managed to escape the slaver's ship, while Skywalker and the undercover Jedi Siri Tachi went on to start a rebellion among Krayn's slaves. In the end, Skywalker faced the slaver in combat, besting him. Ignoring his master's command to spare Krayn, in favor of what Skywalker felt were promptings delivered by the Force itself, Skywalker impaled the crime lord."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early missions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The young Jedi's new weapon saw use on Radnor, where, in 28 BBY, Skywalker accompanied Kenobi and various other Jedi Knights and apprentices to aid in the evacuation of the planet following a dangerous toxic leak. While traveling to the world's Isolation Sector from its Clear Sector, they encountered a Radnoran family being terrorized by a number of Avoni raiders. Skywalker disobeyed orders and aided the Knights in fighting off the raiders rather than protecting the family, as he and his fellow students had been directed to do. Skywalker also came into conflict with Ferus Olin, Siri Tachi's Padawan. Though the mission was technically a success, with the leaked toxins neutralized and the raiders stopped, Skywalker felt that the planet was now even worse off than when they found it."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Separatist Crisis"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Mission to Ansion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ansion was to a casual observer an insignificant world, but upon closer inspection, it was connected to over forty other neighboring systems by a complex web of treaties and alliances. If Ansion seceded from the Republic, it would drag along every world that it maintained an alliance with. Kenobi and Skywalker were dispatched to the world to prevent that from happening. Arriving on Ansion two days early, Kenobi and Skywalker met with Luminara Unduli and Barriss Offee just in time to save them from a veritable army of contract killers. Leaping over a retaining wall into the dead-end alley the women were cornered in, Skywalker and Kenobi made short work of the assassins. Later, the four met with the political leaders of Ansion. While the meeting with the politicians itself went well, they still had the nomadic Alwari to placate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Jedi spent their spare time perusing the shops and vendors of the Ansion capital, Offee was kidnapped by two insane Alwari exiles hired by the local Hutt crime lord, Soergg the Hutt, who was on the Separatist payroll. However, Offee managed to convince the two exiles to aid them after healing the neurological deformities that had caused their insanity. Rejoining the other Jedi, the exiles, Bulgan and Kyakhta, took on the role of guides, leading them through the Ansion wilderness as they left the city to meet with the Alwari. Their travel through the plains almost ended in disaster, however, when they were beset by a school of Gairks while crossing the Torosogt River. Offee was yanked off her Suubatar steed by the creatures and dragged downriver to be eaten later. Skywalker swam after her, but only succeeded in getting himself caught by a quartet of Gairks. His attempts at resisting their suction unsuccessful, Skywalker instead went with the flow, allowing them to pull him within lightsaber range."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After this, they continued their journey across the plains, making contact with the Yiwa clan. Ingratiating themselves with the nomads, they were provided with directions to find the overclan, Borokii. However, along the way, they were captured by the merchant clan Qulun, which was being paid by Soergg the Hutt, after being drugged while dining with the clan leader. However, they were rescued by Tooqui, a Gwurran. While reclaiming their mounts from the Qulun guards, Skywalker began toying with one of them. However, when Kenobi began noticing, Skywalker quickly killed the guard with a cut to the neck, claiming that the fighter was faster than he thought. Later, as they rode north again, they were attacked by a pack of Shanhs. Ambushed by one of the creatures while serving as camp lookout, Skywalker was quickly disarmed. Forced to rely on the Force, he managed to telekinetically deflect the creatures killing leap, but was caught unawares by the Shanh's mate. Managing to blast it aside with a Force push, Skywalker reclaimed his lightsaber and killed the creature as it leapt at him again. He turned to find that the first Shanh had been killed by Unduli."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following day, they finally made contact with the Borokii. While quickly welcomed by the secure clan, they were forced to present an offering of white wool sheared from an albino Surepp. The tuft of fur was retrieved by Unduli. While the meeting itself went well, the Jedi were left with the condition that allegiance would only be granted if the Jedi helped settle the clan warfare between the Borokii and the rival Januul. Negotiations turned sour, and the Jedi's attempts to intervene left them ostracized from both groups. A massive three-way battle began. As per Kenobi's command, the Jedi simply disarmed attacking warriors rather than killing them. Skywalker advanced on his attackers, casually disarming them and noting the ease with which he could have finished them. In the end, both clans recognized the futility of attempting to continue the battle, backing down and reluctantly agreeing to make peace. The Jedi returned to the Ansion capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On their way to meet with the political leaders, they were attacked by snipers sent by Soergg the Hutt, who also cut off their communications. Deflecting the initial volley of sniper shots, they took refuge in one of the larger buildings. However, they were accosted within the building and were forced to retreat back to the streets to avoid collateral damage to bystanders. They were ultimately saved only by the intervention of Borokii and Januul warriors. Meeting with the delegation, they managed to convince the politicians against voting for secession."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Trailing the assassin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, assassination attempts were made on the life of Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo. As he and Kenobi quietly awaited the killer, they both suddenly sensed danger. Rushing into her bedroom, Skywalker used his lightsaber to bisect two poisonous kouhuns about to bite the sleeping Senator, while Kenobi leapt out the window, grabbing hold of the ASN courier droid that had delivered the insects. Skywalker rushed down to the speeder garage and commandeered a XJ-6 airspeeder, racing after his master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rescuing Kenobi, Skywalker piloted the speeder after the fleeing assassin. After a lengthy speeder chase through the Coruscant cityscape, Skywalker managed to board the assassin's vehicle. Clinging to the exterior, he stabbed his lightsaber into the cockpit, prompting the assassin to fire wildly with her blaster pistol. She accidentally destroyed the controls, and the vehicle's bucking caused Skywalker to drop his lightsaber. While the assassin's speeder crashed and Skywalker pursued the killer unarmed, his lightsaber spun through the air before being caught by Kenobi. Kenobi intercepted Skywalker at the entrance to the Outlander Club, returning his lightsaber and scolding him for losing it. The two managed to catch the killer, Kenobi slicing off her arm when she attempted to catch him unawares. However, when interrogating her in the alley behind the club, she was killed by an unknown assailant, learning only that she had been hired by a bounty hunter."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Bodyguard and killer"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Kenobi was dispatched to track down the bounty hunter in question, Skywalker was assigned to act as the Senator's bodyguard, accompanying her back to Naboo where they holed up in her remote family estate. While there, Skywalker was tormented with prophetic visions regarding his mother's death. Leaving for Tatooine with Amidala in tow, he briefly met with his former slave master, Watto, learning that he had sold her to a moisture farmer named Cliegg Lars, who had since married her. Meeting with Lars at his family home, they learned that Shmi had been abducted during a Tusken Raider attack. Charging out into the desert on a swoop bike, Skywalker eventually found the Tusken camp. Quietly approaching, he sliced his way into one of the tents with his lightsaber and found his mother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Shmi died in his arms, the enraged and distraught Padawan slaughtered the hapless Tuskens. Wielding his lightsaber against the warriors, Skywalker surrendered utterly to his rage, massacring the entire Tusken clan, not even sparing the women and children. His actions caused a massive disturbance in the Force, felt by Yoda on Coruscant, and left a dark side Force nexus in the area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to the Lars homestead, Skywalker spent much time consumed by grief and anger, confiding his actions to Senator Amidala. After his mother's funeral, they were contacted by Kenobi, who had discovered the identity of the bounty hunter and trailed him to Geonosis. While there, he discovered that the Neimoidian Viceroy, Nute Gunray, had hired the bounty hunter, looking to settle a score with Amidala after his defeat and capture by her during the Battle of Naboo. Gunray was also involved in the Separatist movement, helping contribute to their massive military buildup. Just as he completed his message, he was attacked and captured by a squad of droidekas. Forwarding Kenobi's message to Coruscant, Amidala and Skywalker resolved to go to Geonosis and rescue Kenobi."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Infiltrating one of the Geonosis droid foundries by way of the worker sleeper cells, they were attacked by the Geonosian workers managing the facility. Carving up numerous workers with his lightsaber, Skywalker retreated with Amidala to the assembly lines, where they were split up. Continuing to slice his way through the workers, Skywalker was eventually bested by the machines of the line itself. Initially cutting up most of the mechanical implements, Skywalker was soon knocked over and pinned beneath the machinery. While he managed to free himself, his lightsaber was cut in half by a descending mechanical blade. Skywalker remained oblivious about his ruined weapon until he attempted to activate it, causing it to emit only sparks. Ruefully remarking that Kenobi was going to kill him for allowing this to happen again, Skywalker was captured by droidekas and Jango Fett."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker created a lightsaber of similar design to replace it, his second lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After becoming Darth Vader, he built a third lightsaber based off of this one."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
