They were twice as tall and four times as massive as the suubatars, and traveled in herds. They had bristly brown fur, blocky skulls with six bony knobs protuding from them, six feet with six horned toes, but only small eyes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the diminutive but brave Gwurran Tooqui incited a lorqual stampede into a Qulun camp, in order to rescue his Jedi friends and their Alwari-outcast guides from the machinations of the fat trader-chief Baiuntu, a pawn of Soergg the Hutt and his majordomo Ogomoor. The stampede accomplished its aim, and the Jedi were able to successfully complete their mission of uniting the Alwari tribes in an accord with the planetary government, the Unity of Community, and thereby stave off Sith- and Commerce Guild-led plots for Ansion to secede from the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
