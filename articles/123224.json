It was described as a \"servo-enhanced exo-skeleton.\" Three meters tall, it had two arms, two legs, and two lifting forks. The suit could move at 90 kmh and lift up to 1.5 metric tons; it was commonly used to move heavy cargo in and out of freighters. It cost 10,000 credits new (7,000 credits used)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
