After helping his unit find a strategic ambush site on-world, Gus and his comrades prepared to ambush the Confederate battle droids. However, the Separatists thwarted their ambush, injuring Gus and forcing him and the others to retreat to their base, where a medical droid treated him.

He was born on the planet Kamino to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic. During the Clone Wars, Gus was assigned to Clone Sergeant Slick's platoon of troopers. In 22 BBY, in the seventh week of the war, Gus joined a contingent of the Republic Grand Army\u2014led by High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi General Anakin Skywalker\u2014to liberate the planet Christophsis from the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Slick's unit reconnoitered the planet and located a double-towered business center as a suitable site from which to ambush the Confederate battle droids. As they returned to the Republic base, the soldiers came across a group of B1-Series battle droids that were attempting to clear a major boulevard of Christophsian refugees. When the droids discovered a crippled Christophsian and discussed killing him, the clones intervened and eradicated the droids before returning to their base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sergeant Slick's platoon was stationed in the business center's south-facing tower with General Kenobi and Clone Commander CC-2224, while Skywalker and Clone Captain CT-7567 became based out of the parallel north tower with their troops. The Republic soldiers prepared to attack the Confederate droids as they passed through the plaza below, and Gus assisted several of his comrades in setting up a blaster cannon before monitoring the droids' progress with a pair of macrobinoculars. Gus noted that the droids had brought Armored Assault Tanks but then noticed that the approaching droid column had unexpectedly split in two. Immediately thereafter, battle droids arrived in the south tower and ambushed Gus and the others, and Gus sustained an injury in the ensuing battle. Skywalker and his men arrived in the south tower to reinforce Kenobi's detachment, and the group took a turbolift to the roof of the tower. Before escaping with the Republic forces in clone pilot Hawk's LAAT/i gunship, Gus stole the cranial unit of TJ-55, the T-series tactical droid commanding the enemy troops, so that more information about the droid ambush could be gathered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to the Republic base alongside his comrades, Gus visited the infirmary, where a medical droid treated his wound. During an investigation into the possibility of a Confederate spy within their ranks, CC-2224 and CT-7567\u2014nicknamed \"Cody\" and \"Rex,\" respectively\u2014tracked an irregular wavelength in external communications to Slick's barracks, leading them to suspect that one of Slick's men was the enemy agent. As a result, they called the platoon back to the barracks to individually question the troopers. During Rex and Cody's interrogation, Gus stated he had nothing to hide and did not hesitate to voice his alibi of being in the infirmary. When fellow trooper Chopper revealed that he had lied about his whereabouts and had been breaking war protocols by stringing together battle droid fingers in a necklace, Gus commented on his deficiency. However, Slick was thereafter revealed to be the spy, and he escaped before severely damaging the Republic's gunships, AT-TE walkers, and weapons depot. Gus spotted Slick running into the base's command center, and Rex and Cody ordered Slick's platoon to secure the perimeter while they apprehended the traitorous sergeant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Human male, Gus stood 1.83 meters tall. He had tan skin and brown eyes and kept his black hair shaved. While being questioned by Rex and Cody, he did not hesitate to state his alibi, believing that he had nothing to hide. When Chopper revealed he had been stringing droid fingers together in a necklace, Gus voiced his belief that his fellow trooper was deficient. In addition, he was visibly shocked when his own sergeant, Slick, was revealed to be the Confederate spy. Gus chose to sport a rakish goatee and kept it carefully tended.
