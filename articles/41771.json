The stretch consisted of a large flat area of land devoid of obstacles, thus acting as one of the easier bits of the track, minus the competition offered from other pilots. The Devlikk Podracer pilot Raido attempted to wreck the pod of another pilot near the end of the Dust Gaps. While he was successful in removing the competition, he destroyed his own pod in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
