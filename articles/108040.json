The scientists did not receive any information as to the origins of the life form, and at least one of them, Ogl'woxz, was amazed at the recovery rate of the specimen once they started piecing together its organs and limbs. They successfully revived \"Project Durge,\" but were unable to restore it to its original appearance. Instead, they equipped the being with a suit of heavy battle armor. \"Project Durge\" eventually escaped with the help of the Talus-based criminal organization The Claw, and started collecting bounties. After beating one of Boba Fett's associates to a bounty, Fett ordered his associate to track down \"Project Durge\" and destroy it. The associate complied, and defeated \"Durge\" near Dee'ja Peak on Naboo. Fett wasn't convinced that he had seen the last of \"Durge.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
