The meeting is revealed to be a trap, and Rhys and Essara are forced to defend the royal starship from mercenaries until it can escape.

She is hired to help test the Scarab-class droid starfighter, which serves as an informal tutorial for controlling her ship. After completing the task, her astromech droid, Mod-3, intercepts a transmission about the illegal invasion of Naboo. The Trade Federation subsequently terminates her contract and sends numerous \"Hunter-Killer\" droids and a squad of mercenaries to kill her. Vana manages to destroy all but one of the droids, which leads her to a droid production factory on the volcanic planet of Eos.

She manages to buy him off by telling him about the droid factory she discovered on Eos, which he repays by trapping her in a locker and meeting back up with his pirate group above Lok. Nym then had started a piracy operation which began the First Battle of Lok, disabling a freighter in orbit and managing to send it crashing to Lok's surface, Nym's pirates steal valuable supplies from the crashed freighter and attempt to return to their base by navigating through a river defending the small freighter to a cave.

The character played as varies throughout the second half of the game, as the small group destroys the droid factory on Eos, disables a Trade Federation freighter and steals supplies, delivers those supplies to Bravo Flight, rescues Trade Federation prisoners, and then defends the Naboo Royal Guard's outpost. Failure of this mission only occurs if either the outpost is badly damaged or 5/10 defense turrets are destroyed. The final mission takes place around the Droid Control Ship, as Bravo Flight destroys the receiver stations on the exterior of the ship. When they destroy all the droid starfighters currently deployed, the leader of the Trade Federation-hired mercenaries appears. The shield to one of the hangar bays opens; a landing craft leaves as the mercenary and Rhys enter. The lander can be destroyed but requires tremendous amounts of time and damage to destroy. The shield closes again, trapping Rhys inside and the rest of Bravo Flight outside of the ship. Inside the hangar bay, several landing craft surround the area. These can also be destroy except the landers. Destroying these makes the hangar safer to navigate. A fierce battle throughout the inner bays of the ship ensues, with Rhys eventually destroying the mercenary's ship. When Anakin Skywalker fires the shot that destroys the control ship, Dallows escapes the doomed vessel by destroying the shield generator blocking his escape route."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the battle, the three heroes meet and exchange farewells before Nym's departure to rejoin his fellow pirates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bonuses"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Missions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These missions are unlockable by completing campaign missions with gold medals."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Vehicles"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These vessels are unlocked for use in every mission by attaining certain gold medals or entering cheat codes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
