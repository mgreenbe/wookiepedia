It was one of five worlds closest to Raydonia, the others being Mustafar, Geonosis, Dermos, and Tatooine. The planet was once part of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, who created a large droid construction facility under the planet's surface. After the Clone Wars, the planet fell under the occupation of the Galactic Empire with the Satrapy of Myrra collaborating with its new rulers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after the Battle of Endor, the shattered forces of the Empire gathered for an emergency summit above Akiva, where they intended to regroup and launch an attack against the New Republic. The meeting failed, leading to the Rebellion on Akiva in space above the planet as the Imperial leaders on the planet fled to safety. After the battle of Akiva, during which the citizens of Akiva sought to overthrow the Satrapy of Myrra and the Empire, Akiva became the first Outer Rim planet to join the New Republic. Akiva later pledged allegiance to the growing First Order in 34 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Akiva was a hot, humid planet in the Outer Rim Territories, famous for its thunder and rain storms. The planet had a terrestrial atmosphere and experienced frequent rain, called the mausim during the wet season. In the city of Myrra \"storm ladders\" were common, made of chains bundled up at the top of the roofs, used during the bad storms so they can get people out of the ground quickly in case of a flash flood. Its surface was known to have jungles and canyons. Everyone in Myrra used the bala-bala speeder, a narrow vehicle meant to take the tight channels and sharp-angled turns of the streets of the city; they were used to go to work or move crates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Akiva's capital was Myrra, a sprawling city which was built over a maze of old catacombs. These catacombs were inhabited by the primitive Uugteen, a race of humanoids native to Akiva. According to various rumors, this maze hosted a Jedi training temple, a Sith trap, or some Hutt breeding ground. Few people who visited the catacombs survived due to the presence of the Uugteen. The Myrra catacombs also hosted a Separatist droid foundry dating back to the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Akiva was once home to the Ahia-Ko, an ancient species who built great temples in the planet's jungle wilderness. The Ahia-Ko people believed that the water in the planet's canyons was so pure that it could cleanse one of their sins and leave them a better person. The canyons' water was considered a luxurious commodity by members of the Satrapy of Myrra such as Satrap Isstra Dirus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Akiva was home to at least two indigenous species: the Uugteen, who inhabited the underground catacombs beneath Myrra; and the old Ahia-Ko, who built great jungles in the planet's wilderness.

Around the time the Empire was formed, the Satrapy of Myrra overthrew an earlier government, which had been based in the Myrra capitol building. Due to the planet's remoteness, the Empire did not establish a large presence on Akiva. Instead, they ruled indirectly through the Satrapy of Myrra, who imposed the Empire's laws and taxes on the Akivan population. The black market grew strong with corruption holding fast to the Satrapy and its aristocracy. One of these aristocrat families was the Karyvin clan, owners of the Karyvin house Plantation in Myrra, some islands in the Southern Archipelago and crystal mines in the Northern Jungles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Age of the Empire, Brentin Lore Wexley was responsible for relaying the Rebel Alliance's messages across the Outer Rim. As a result, he was arrested by the Empire and imprisoned at Ashmead's Lock on the planet Kashyyyk. His wife, Norra Wexley, subsequently joined the Rebel Alliance and left their son Temmin Wexley in the care of her older sister Esmelle and her wife, Shirene.

After the New Republic starfighter pilot Wedge Antilles was captured by Imperial forces, Norra, Temmin, his B1-series battle droid Mister Bones, the bounty hunter Jas Emari, and the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus joined forces to inspire a successful uprising on Akiva and to capture members of the abortive Imperial Future Council. New Republic Defense Fleet ships under Commodore Kyrsta Agate subsequently destroyed the Imperial ships above Akiva. As a result, the Satrapy switched sides, and Akiva became the first Outer Rim planet to officially have joined the contingent of worlds pledging themselves to the New Republic. And so they started working on routing out corruption and crime, some gang members escaped, others ended up in prison and some chose to do a last stand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 5 ABY, the human woman Pima Drolley was appointed as Akiva's senator to the New Republic.
