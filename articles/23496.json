Releasing a flash of supercooled carbonite upon detonation, the sudden decrease in temperature was capable of slowing down vehicles and infantry squads. Carbonite missiles were most devastating when used against infantry, as the blast of cold was very effective both at killing soldiers quickly and at making them less able to fend off other attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
