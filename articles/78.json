While the equipment itself did well to serve its purpose, many soldiers wielded it against battle droids that they encountered after discovering its usefulness as an electrical weapon. This improvisation prompted the creation of the \"DN bolt caster\" that was widely used by clone pilots during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
