Kal'Shebbol was located on the Trition Trade Route, the hyperlane that connected the major worlds of the sector to the nearby Minos Cluster. Settled around 392 BBY by escaped Twi'lek slaves from Ryloth, Kal'Shebbol grew from a small settlement into a major trading world only fifty years after its initial colonization as sizable Human and alien communities emigrated to the planet in search of a fresh start. Once the Kathol sector entered the Galactic Republic, Kal'Shebbol, being the closest planet to Republic space, was appointed as the sector capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kal'Shebbol fell under its auspices. Moff Kentor Sarne was appointed as governor of the Kathol sector in 2 BBY and made Kal'Shebbol his capital. His edicts were oppressive, and the people of Kal'Shebbol suffered under his rule as industry was nationalized and travel to and from the planet was severely restricted. With the death of Emperor Palpatine during the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY and the subsequent breakdown of Imperial authority, Sarne withdrew his sector from the Empire, setting up his own personal fiefdom with Kal'Shebbol as its capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 8 ABY, a New Republic task force was sent to liberate Kal'Shebbol from Sarne's control. Elements of Page's Commandos\u2014the New Republic's elite commando team\u2014infiltrated the planet with the intention of dropping Kal'Shebbol's defensive shield and capturing Sarne. While the commandos succeeded in lowering the shield, allowing New Republic forces to capture the planet, Sarne managed to escape into the Kathol sector with the majority of his military forces. The New Republic established a new administration to run the planet, appointing an Elomin named Monjai as governor to appease the large alien communities residing on the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kal'Shebbol was located in the Kal'Shebbol system of the Kathol sector in the Outer Rim Territories. It served as the sector capital and was situated on the Trition Trade Route, the primary hyperlane serving the sector. The Trition Trade Route was a continuation of the Rimma Trade Route, a major commercial hyperlane that connected the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim; despite being on the Trition, Kal'Shebbol was, on occasion, also considered to be a stopping point on the Rimma Trade Route."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kal'Shebbol was connected to the planets Brolsam and Torize via a single hyperlane that branched off in two directions, as well as Pergitor in the Minos Cluster.

Covered in wide, open plains and rolling hills, the planet was habitable with a breathable atmosphere. Wet weather patterns, coupled with arable land, made the continent suitable for farming, which the planet's original Twi'lek settlers took advantage of. The continent's terrain was also suitable for the grazing of herd animals, such as the native chollas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Settlement and joining the galactic community"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Kal'Shebbol was first settled around 392 BBY by Twi'lek slaves who had escaped from their own homeworld of Ryloth. Located on a trade route that led to Gandle Ott, the first world to be settled in the Kathol sector, Kal'Shebbol was also isolated enough from the galaxy to allow the Twi'lek clans to live in peace. Although they initially found the open plains and moist atmosphere to be discomforting\u2014as they were used to the arid conditions and caverns of Ryloth\u2014they adapted quickly, domesticating the native herds of chollas and establishing farms to support their growing society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next fifty years, many families traveled to Kal'Shebbol, intending to settle on the planet and start new lives. However, before they were allowed to take up residence on the world, they had to be formally adopted by one of the Twi'lek clans.

Gandle Ott, located in the Ott system at the end of the Trition Trade Route, had been settled 200 years before Kal'Shebbol and was recognized as the first official colony in the sector. However, Kal'Shebbol was selected as the capital simply because it was closer to Republic space than Gandle Ott. By this point, Kal'Shebbol was ruled by a combination of clan and city-state governments."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, at the end of the Clone Wars, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine reformed the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire. Imperial Prefects were assigned to run the planet, and they had little regard for the traditional way the planet had been run for centuries. The clan and city-state governments were made subservient to the will of those officials who had no desire to maintain the society's status quo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kentor Sarne was appointed Moff of the Kathol sector in 2 BBY. As the capital of the sector, Kal'Shebbol became his personal stronghold and suffered under Sarne's oppressive edicts as private industry was nationalized and free travel to and from the planet was prohibited. In 4 ABY, Emperor Palpatine was killed at the Battle of Endor. Following his death, the Imperial command structure fragmented, with many senior officials breaking away from the Empire and forming their own warlord empires. Sarne followed suit, quietly withdrawing the Kathol sector from Imperial authorities. By the time anyone realized what Sarne had done, it was too late to stop him, as they could not spare any forces to bring the rogue Moff back in line. Kal'Shebbol became the capital of Sarne's new empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the ten years that Sarne ruled the planet\u2014both as an official of the Empire and on his own\u2014he turned the planet's one continent into a virtual fortress, protected by an energy shield and armed with anti-orbital turbolasers and ion cannons, as well as anti-assault weapons on the shoreline. The Imperial Government Complex served as Sarne's military and governmental headquarters, and well as his private residence, which was known as \"Sarne's Palace.\" The building contained the controls for the energy shield and weapons, the main command center so that Sarne could direct the defense of the planet, the Moff's personal quarters, and a secret hangar containing a Carrack-class light cruiser, the Ambition, Sarne's emergency escape vehicle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Sarne's reign, at least one resistance group opposed him, operating out of hidden rooms beneath Kal'Shebbol starport. The members of the group were gradually killed off in a series of skirmishes with Sarne's forces, with the only survivor being Genna Seedar, who acted as the group's medic. In addition, Sarne ordered several terrorist acts to be carried out on Kal'Shebbol\u2014he would then blame the atrocities on Rebel insurgents as a way to turn public opinion against the Alliance to Restore the Republic and their successor state, the New Republic. One such attack claimed the lives of the family of Shella Inion, a minor actress who would eventually become the bounty hunter Mist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, a subscriber to Gundark's Gear Datalog named Staven commented on the entry for the DZ 17X Nemesis powersuit.

In an effort to oust him from power and deny him the opportunity to use the technology, the New Republic assembled a task force to liberate the planet. As the task force engaged Sarne's forces in orbit, elements of Page's Commandos\u2014who had been inserted on the planet posing as civilian traffic in a Ghtroc Industries Class 720 freighter\u2014infiltrated Sarne's headquarters and deactivated the shield generator protecting the sole continent. This allowed New Republic forces to successfully liberate Kal'Shebbol, although Sarne managed to escape in the Ambition before he could be apprehended by the Commandos. Sarne marshaled his forces in orbit and withdrew from the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the majority of Sarne's forces fleeing, the New Republic claimed victory at Kal'Shebbol. The inhabitants rejoiced at the overthrow of Moff Sarne and welcomed the New Republic, who established a provisional government headed by the Elomin Governor Monjai. Their main goal was to foster good will among the populace, and the selection of a non-Human governor was considered a good start due to the large communities of alien species that resided on the planet. While the New Republic expected to deploy a defense fleet to Kal'Shebbol, it was not due to arrive for two to three months after its liberation. Monjai was forced to cobble together a rudimentary defense force from ships that were not destroyed during the New Republic's assault on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sarne's escape was a worry to the New Republic, however, especially to Lieutenant Judder Page, commanding officer of Page's Commandos. He had seen Sarne's new weapons in action during the Moff's escape from the planet and knew that Sarne had to be hunted down before he had a chance to use them on a larger scale. Unfortunately for him, the admiral in charge of the task force did not believe the rumors and could not spare any ships to conduct a sweep of the Kathol sector. Page was forced to make use of the CR90 corvette Renegade, a vessel under Sarne's control that had been undergoing a refit at a secret shipyard located in the Sorbiss Valley. The location of the ship had been revealed to Page by Jessa Dajus, a former Imperial Intelligence officer in Sarne's regime who wanted to track the Moff down for her own reasons. Due to manpower limitations within the task force, Page was forced to cobble together a crew of New Republic personnel and civilians from Kal'Shebbol to man the vessel, under the command of Keleman Ciro, a sergeant in Page's Commandos who was given a field promotion to captain. The makeshift crew prepared the vessel, now renamed as the FarStar, and launched from Kal'Shebbol just after the New Republic task force had departed for the Bozhnee sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months after the liberation of Kal'Shebbol, the New Republic had deployed warships to assist in the defense of the planet.

Monjai immediately dispatched a force to the area, although it would take weeks to arrive. Several weeks later, the force returned to Kal'Shebbol with the crew of the FarStar, who had successfully stopped Sarne during a climatic battle at Kathol.

While Humans were abundant on the planet, Kal'Shebbol had sizable alien communities. They suffered under the Human High Culture rule of the Galactic Empire, until the planet's liberation by the New Republic in 8 ABY. At this point, the New Republic appointed Monjai, an Elomin, to run the planet as governor. Her appointment appeased the large alien communities that were distrustful of Humans in general. Individuals from Kal'Shebbol included Solla Deremot, a research assistant who assisted Imperial science team MS-133's archaeological expedition on Aaris III; Shella Inion, a minor actress who became the bounty hunter known as Mist; and Cal Alder, a scout who served in both the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Government Complex\u2014also known locally as \"Sarne's Palace\"\u2014was the center of Imperial authority on Kal'Shebbol.

The complex contained Sarne's private quarters, the command and control for the planetary defenses, research labs, detention cells, a gladiator arena, and a secret hangar containing the Carrack-class light cruiser Ambition.

Large enough to berth a single CR90 corvette, the shipyard was responsible for refitting the corvette Renegade from a standard vessel into one capable of extended operations away from a home port for an indefinite period of time. One of the major modifications was the addition of a hangar deck bolted onto the starboard side of the vessel. In 8 ABY, Sarne was forced to leave the Renegade behind during his flight from the capital, and its location was discovered by the New Republic, who took the vessel, rechristening it as the FarStar, and tasked it with trailing Sarne as he fled into the Kathol sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kal'Shebbol starport was the planet's primary transportation hub for individuals either arriving at or leaving Kal'Shebbol. By 8 ABY, Sarne had instituted high tariffs at the starport, meaning that many independent traders and visitors to the planet often found themselves stranded when they could not afford the high docking bay fees and had their ships impounded. Facilities at the starport included at least one cantina, a trading post run by Twi'lek merchant Loh'khar the Finder, and a repair yard maintained by Brophar Tofarain. Shortly before the New Republic's liberation of the planet, the Aqualish Unda Lagor went on a rampage through one of the starport's busiest quarters, killing forty-three civilians and twenty-one Imperial troops."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kal'Shebbol was created for The DarkStryder Campaign, a roleplaying game sourcebook published by West End Games in 1995.
