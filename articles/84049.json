On one such occasion he was approached by Meetra Surik, who had been asked by his Nikto crew to keep a watch out for their captain, as the air in the cantina was toxic for their species. Apparently the Lunar Shadow was due for departure and the crew was distressed that the captain would not return in time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The player can enter the Jekk'Jekk Tarr without a spacesuit before the meeting with Visquis is triggered, providing that the player character is equipped with a breath mask; this way the Lunar Shadow captain can be contacted before the cantina patrons become hostile.
