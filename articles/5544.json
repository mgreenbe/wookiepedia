He had downy, finger-long, brown and green feathers on his balding head that trailed down his back and underneath his clothing, as well as taloned-fingers and jade-green teeth that were pointed and jagged like the edge of a saw blade. He caught Jyn Erso when she made fake credits to pay the debt of the Imperial colonel Lucka Solange.
