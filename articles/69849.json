Rutan was a feudal society that valued hunting and culture while Senali was a Polynesian-esque culture that emphasized nature and harmony. However, after a stunning victory by Senali, a truce was agreed upon. The rulers of each planet temporarily exchanged children when they reached the age of seven and raised them in an effort to get the future leaders to appreciate each other. However, the plan backfired after hundreds of years of success when the heir of Rutan decided he wanted to remain on Senali, forsaking his royal title and home planet. This infuriated his father, King Frane, who believed his son had been brainwashed by the Senali. He threatened to declare war on Senali."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon arrived to mediate the dispute.
