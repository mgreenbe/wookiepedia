Nearly all of its surface was covered by a vast ocean, but there were many rugged islands spread across the planet. The original population struggled for years atop the planet's Island Spires to create an island paradise. As time passed, the planet was more widely known for its ship repair and construction industry, which eventually caught on with the Galactic Empire, who constructed large naval shipyards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early colonization attempts of Bestine were problematic, with a series of Kian'thar settlements being tried and abandoned from 278 to 211 BBY.

In the first year of the war, Jedi Master Kit Fisto and his former Padawan, Nahdar Vebb, led a mission on Vassek's third moon in an attempt to capture General Grievous. During the mission, Clone Commander Fil had clone troopers Niner and Bel contact the fleet for reinforcements in capturing Grievous. However, they were unable to when their shuttle was destroyed by a IG-100 MagnaGuard using a missile launcher."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial period"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet had become increasingly attractive due to Bestine's small but growing ship repair and construction industry, which can be credited to the planet's unique oceanic based shipyards that were designed primarily to quickly produce frigate-sized vessels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 BBY, its populace was displaced for the construction of an Imperial naval yard. This project was simply a massive expansion of the present naval shipyards, which were curiously located on the surface of the ocean, not in orbit. The displaced populace were promised a \"new and exciting home\", but, when the promise wasn't kept, most ended up scattering to other systems. Many joined with or aided Rebel agents on Bestine, although they were never able to successfully sabotage the Imperial shipyards which had been code-named Juggerhead. The shipyards gave the impression that they were constructing Acclamator-class assault ships, although in fact it was conducting research and development on a sleek, single-seat attack submersible, the TIE torpedo. Bestine was later the location of an important Rebel base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Alliance to Restore the Republic's investigation on the first Death Star, and while orbiting Bestine IV, the MC80 Star Cruiser Defiance was engaged by the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Immortal, which launched squadrons of TIE/sa bombers to destroy her.
