They wore special tunics bearing stripes as a sign of their unswerving loyalty to the Republic. Thanks to the particular crystals mined on Dahgee, they also built lightsabers, the blades of which had unique properties, resembling zigzagging rods with a dark silver/black core and a colored aura. By the time of the Clone Wars, the Dahgee Jedi were considered extinct because of Jedi Order not willing to send new Jedi to Daghee, but some of their robes and sabers could still be found."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
