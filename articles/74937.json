The warrior, who was suffering from intense pain due to being far from his Battlelord, tried to ask Bross for help. Their conversation was difficult because Master Bross was unfamiliar with some of the warrior's words. Master Bross used the Force to see the connection of the warrior with his Lord, and understood that any warrior separated from the Sith Battlelord would suffer pain. He did not notice that the remaining warriors would also suffer pain because of the deserter, and were so motivated to track him down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
