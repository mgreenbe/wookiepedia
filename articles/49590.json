They were portrayed by comedians Greg Proops and Scott Capurro respectively. During pre-production, attempts were made to have them appear in make-up with the rest of their bodies covered in blue suits for compositing later. Ultimately the marriage of their live-action performances with CGI was not realistic enough, and the character became fully computer generated. At that point, the color scheme used on Beed and Fode was reversed. The first Fode and Beed action figure represents the way Fode and Beed would have appeared if the original actors' faces in make-up had been used."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
