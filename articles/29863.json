They formed a loose coalition known as the Corellian bloc. At the same time, a group known as Aqualish Barralenal left their homeworld of Ando and founded colonies in the sector themselves. Both groups were very expansionistic and soon came into conflict."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the two sides engaged in several border skirmishes, Governor Bey tried to stop the growing conflict.

An exception was the planet of Goroth Prime: Situated at an advantageous position for both sides, the government under Rel'Kan J'Kek made great profits by selling concessions and mining rights. However as the war dragged on, the Gorothites got more greedy. Since neither side could afford an occupation nor losing it to the other side, one side decided to destroy the planet by hurling five asteroids into it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war, an unit of Aqualish soldiers was secretly positioned on the planet Talus, in the Corellian system.
