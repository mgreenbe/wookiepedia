Packing the destructive power of larger flechette launchers into the compact form of a pistol, a flechette pistol fired flechette filled miniature canisters or cartridges at impressive speeds. These would then airburst into a starlike pattern, releasing hundreds of tiny razor sharp blades into the air at lethal speeds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boba Fett chose the flechette pistol as his primary weapon in an attempt to assassinate Mace Windu. Due to the sheer number of projectiles released, he saw the flechette pistol as an ideal weapon for killing a Jedi; though the Jedi Master's speed and Force senses allowed him to avoid the worst of the flechette bursts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
