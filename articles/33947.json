During the course of the battle, Dao was contacted via hologram by the Nikto Jedi Master Ima-Gun Di\u2014the leader of the native Twi'lek freedom fighters, alongside self-proclaimed General Cham Syndulla\u2014, who asked him to request help from the Jedi Council due to the lack of supplies. The admiral complied and called the Council, arguing that aid to his fleet and the ground units was necessary, since the loss of Ryloth would result in the Republic bases in the Outer Rim being cut off. However, during the conversation, the Confederate warships managed to damage the main reactor of his flagship, leading to a system failure. After Dao reported that his fleet was no longer able to protect the troops on Ryloth, the shields failed and the craft was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
