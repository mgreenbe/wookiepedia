During a search for the insurgents in a town located on the planet Lothal, the walker was hijacked by the rebels in their attempt to find their captured leader, Kanan Jarrus. C1-10P, the mechanic member of the team accessed to the walker's computer to find information, only learning that the Empire had taken down their entire data network on Lothal.
