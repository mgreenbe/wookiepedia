Over a series of days, both the internal cargo holds and the external tanks would be loaded with industrial waste generated by shipyard construction or resource mining. When these vessels reached their full capacity, they would lift off en masse using both their repulsors and sublight engines to make their way to wherever their automated beacon marking was located."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Luke Skywalker aboard, Tanith Shire stole one of these barges and crashed it on Ophideraan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
