They fed off the bodily juices of victims and were particularly fond of adrenalin. Victims would be captured by the tentacles of the moss and exposed to a mind-altering toxin, which induced an extreme state of fear. Some gray fear moss could grow to large sizes on Prakith, due to their exposure to the dark side of the Force, which emanated from the Citadel Inquisitorius."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
