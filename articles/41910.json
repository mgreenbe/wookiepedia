In spite of its blisteringly hot climate and poisonous, highly pressurized atmosphere, it was home to living organisms, including the sentient Dybrinthe species. Using mobile refinery-cities, the Dybrinthe clans exploited the natural fuel that bubbled up from the moon's extensive subterranean oceans. Since most offworlders could not survive on Dybrin 12, visitors were usually confined to space stations orbiting the moon. The moon shared its name with Dybrin, a planet also situated in the Deep Core."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dybrin 12 was first mentioned, albeit indirectly, in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, a 2015 reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo.
