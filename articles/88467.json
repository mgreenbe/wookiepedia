Although they were not sentient, they were able to be trained, to some extent, as guardians. They could heed simple commands and recognize their name, but not too much more than that. Meduza appeared to be fairly large green jelly-like blobs. They could slither along fairly quickly to capture prey. They had the ability to produce electricity in their bodies and carry it in their various bulb-headed stalks that protruded from their bodies. When they touched a creature with the bulb, the electric shock was enough to kill a Human. They then engulfed the body whole, leaving behind nothing but a wet stain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Doctor Cornelius Evazan was known to have had a pet Meduza, Rover."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
