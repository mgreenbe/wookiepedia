He was one of four Braxant Sector Fleet officers whose Star Destroyers were chosen to serve Flim, a con-artist portraying a returned Grand Admiral Thrawn, and the plans of Moff Disra and Royal Guardsman Grodin Tierce to envelope the New Republic into a civil war over the crisis concerning the revealed Caamas Document. In order to convince Trazzen and his fellow officers\u2014captains Nalgol of the Tyrannic, Argona of the Ironhand, and Dorja of the Relentless\u2014that Flim was Thrawn, Disra had a meeting executed where the four captains personally met with the Thrawn-apparent. Of the four Star Destroyers, the Tyrannic, Obliterator, and Ironhand were chosen to lead a assault on the Bothan homeworld of Bothawui, in which the assault was foiled and the Star Destroyers were forced to withdraw.
