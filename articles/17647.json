Velery Station tried to impose its will on Gray Flight, which consisted of Wedge Antilles and Falynn Sandskimmer, by instructing it to land at Velery's spaceport. When Gray Flight refused, Blackwing Flight tailed Gray Flight in their Z-95 Headhunters and tried to force them to comply with Velery Station's orders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "What ensued was a tense mock dogfight, during which Gray flight outmaneuvered and got into firing position behind Blackwing One.
