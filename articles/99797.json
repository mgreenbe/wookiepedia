Tokmia boasted plentiful crystal and ore deposits, which once attracted the interest of the Figg Excavations mining company. Figg Excavations earned a fortune from Tokmia's mineral bounty, and Figg employees left handouts for the Oku natives with each operation. When the mines ran dry, however, Figg Excavations pulled out and abandoned the planet. The Oku developed a bizarre cargo cult in response, burning huge fires in patterns reminiscent of landing lights and prophesying that the magical starships of their benevolent offworld visitors would someday return."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2004 Wizards of the Coast online article \"Galactic Gazetteer: Hoth and the Greater Javin,\" a Star Wars Roleplaying Game supplement, first mentioned the Oku among its description of the planet Tokmia.

Melanesians, for example, benefited from the vast amounts of war mat\u00e9riel that both American and Japanese forces introduced to their culture. Once the war ended, some Melanesians lit signal fires, among other acts designed to mimic soldiers, believing they could compel the return of the foreigners' material goods."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
