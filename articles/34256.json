In this vision, Qui-Gon Jinn had survived the battle of Naboo and had taken nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker as his Padawan. He guided Skywalker into the cave to face his fears, telling him the same thing Yoda eventually told Anakin's son, Luke, many years later, including telling Anakin that all that was inside the cave was \"Only what you take with you.\" Later, near the end of the Clone Wars, Yoda himself entered the cave under the guidance of Qui-Gon who had learned how to speak from beyond. Here, Yoda had visions of the fall of the Jedi Order and of the rise of Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Great Jedi Purge, Yoda realized that proximity to the Dark Side Cave could help neutralize his strong light side Force signature\u2014thus preventing his detection by the Sith\u2014and took up residence near the cave, living there for the next two decades, through the reign of the Galactic Empire. Soon after the exile, an Imperial scout named Keog Boorn investigated a signal near the cave. A hidden Yoda saw how the scout left the place after remembering about the Bpfasshi Dark Jedi and hearing some terrifying sounds. Keog Boorn left the planet and reported that there was nothing on Dagobah, the signal just an atmospheric disturbance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the birth of the Rebellion, the clone of Starkiller spoke with Yoda briefly before entering the cave to look for the answers he sought. Inside, he was unable to use his Force powers, except for mind trick, which he utilized several times.

He made it deep into the caves, and received a vision of the assault on the Salvation. Starkiller exited the cave, and left the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY, the young Force-sensitive Zak Arranda accidentally led a group of cannibal younglings into the Cave.

It was there that he realized what would happen if he turned to the dark side of the Force. Behind the mask of Darth Vader, he saw his own face. It also presaged the revelation that Vader was, unknown to him at the time, actually his father, Anakin Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five years after Yoda's death, Luke Skywalker returned to the cave. This time, he had a vision of a possible past, one where Mara Jade accompanied Jabba the Hutt's retinue to the sarlacc. She was able to pull Luke's lightsaber away from him when his vision suddenly ended. While in the cave, he found a beacon left behind by Jorj Car'das. In 14 ABY, the dark side power of the cave was siphoned by the Disciples of Ragnos. This supposedly removed all of the dark energy, but it presumably returned to its source when the Scepter of Ragnos was destroyed or otherwise somehow regenerated itself. In 22 ABY, Anakin Solo, Tahiri Veila, and Uldir Lochett entered the cave after Anakin had a recurring nightmare of becoming the infamous Darth Vader. There, Tahiri encountered a vision of her parents and grandfather, and Anakin faced the manifestations of his own doubts. The two both emerged victorious. Uldir, who was not Force-sensitive however, encountered nothing in the cave but vast emptiness. Other Force-sensitive beings to enter the cave included Tash Arranda and Zak Arranda."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope, while under the Infinities label, establishes the tainting of the cave as happening some eight hundred years before the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vision of the Future describes how Jedi Master Yoda battled and defeated another powerful Bpfasshi Dark Jedi inside the Cave.
