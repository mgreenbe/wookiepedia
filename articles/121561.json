In 21 BBY, the Confederacy of Independent Systems defeated the Galactic Republic during the First Battle of Nyriaan and seized control of Nyriaan, and in 19 BBY, a combined Republic and Jedi strike force was sent to recapture the world. The Republic force arrived in the system and after a short battle, the Confederacy was defeated. However, soon after the fighting had ended, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine declared the enactment of the contingency order Order 66, and as a result, all Jedi that were known to be in the system were killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
