Rebaxan Columni, which was owned by members of the Chadra-Fan species, invented the MSE droid for use on Chad, the Chadra-Fan homeworld. The pleeky, a local pet of the world, formed the basis of the MSE's design, which Rebaxan Columni hoped the galactic market would find cute. Also known as mouse droids, MSEs' usage was only limited by their owners' imagination."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A fifth-degree droid, the MSE-4 was less than 0.3 meters in height and, similar to the MSE-6, had a black box-shaped body with four wheels underneath for mobility. Capable of jumping over gaps in floorings, the mouse droid made squealing noises and was deployed by operators of Mustafar's lava mines to scout for life-support leaks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Test runs of the MSE-4 and MSE-5 models were launched by Rebaxan Columni before the marketing efforts for and mass-production of the MSE-6, which resulted in the company's bankruptcy toward the end of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

As Vader walked through a hallway of the Separatist headquarters, five squealing MSE-4s scrambled from the approaching Sith Lord, with each mouse droid jumping over a break in the flooring and dispersing in a disorderly fashion into the facility's control room that housed Vader's quarry.

The scene featuring the MSE-4 was shot on August 25, 2003, at Stage 2 of Fox Studios, Sydney. For the scene, director George Lucas asked Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) on November 18, 2004 to render a model of the mouse droid seen in the 1977 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Lucas' intention was to use the quailing droid to imitate rats leaving a sinking ship. Later, Lucas requested ILM's Rob Coleman, Roger Guyett, and John Knoll make the single computer-generated mouse droid they had rendered a quarter of its size, resulting in the creation of the smaller MSE-4 droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
