In 19 BBY, the Jedi Padawan Joc Sah and his squad of clone troopers arrived on the planet in order to capture Gaan's village, where they confronted Gaan and the other outcasts. However, Sah's clone sergeant then received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, labeling the Jedi Knights as traitors to the Republic, and proceeded to attack Sah. Gaan and Sah combined their forces and eliminated the Padawan's former allies. As Sah attempted to contact his Jedi Master, Gaan informed the Jedi that he had been betrayed and offered him a place in his group. Sah accepted, and the two led the outcasts against the detachment of clones that were dispatched to ensure Sah's demise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gaan, a Human male, was born during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. During the Clone Wars, he became the leader of a group of outcasts on the Outer Rim world of Ragmar V. In 19 BBY, the Galactic Republic sought to establish an outpost on Ragmar V, which was considered an essential staging planet for their planned assault of a Separatist base. When a Republic Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship landed on a cliff near Gaan's settlement, the leader instructed two of his men to use a rocket launcher and destroy the ship. After the gunship was destroyed, Gaan told his men to prepare for the coming battle with approaching Republic forces and ordered his group to leave the Jedi for him to eliminate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gaan met the Jedi Padawan Joc Sah and his squad of clone troopers in the settlement, informing the Jedi that the Republic was not welcome on the planet. As Gaan prepared to do battle with Sah's forces, one of the clones, Sergeant Remy, received a command instructing him to execute Order 66, which labeled the Jedi as traitors to the Republic who needed to be killed immediately. The clone sergeant and the troopers opened fire on Sah, much to Gaan's surprise. The leader exclaimed that the Jedi was his to kill and shot one of the clones, causing the rest to return fire at him. Gaan took cover in the same building that Sah was in as his group attacked the clones. After Sah attempted to contact his Jedi Master, Sev, Gaan offered him the options of either fighting alongside him and his people, or staying in the building and getting killed. Sah agreed to temporarily ally with Gaan, and the two managed to eliminate Sah's former clone allies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Sah tried one last time to contact his Jedi Master, Gaan noted that the Padawan had been betrayed and was now in Gaan and his group's position of being a pariah, with a common enemy. The Padawan accepted a place in Gaan's group and warned him that the Republic would send an overwhelming number of troops to fight them. Shortly afterward, Gaan and Sah led their fellow pariahs against the troopers from Sev's Venator-class Star Destroyer, who were sent to make sure that Sah was eliminated. Both men managed to survive and orchestrated a number of hit-and-run attacks against the clones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gaan was not sympathetic to the Republic and its forces, and sought to fight their troops in retaliation for bringing the war to his and his group's homeworld.

Joc Sah's entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia states that Gaan, the Padawan, and the other criminals fled into the desert after fleeing Remy and his troops.
