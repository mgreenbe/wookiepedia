In Hyperspace navigation, a Gravity Well referred to any relative curvature of space, caused by gravity, that would interfere with Hyperspace travel.\nAny body having mass exerts a gravity field, though most are negligible. On the celestial scale, more massive bodies create more formidable gravity fields accounting for the orbits of planets and solar systems around massive stars. These naturally occurring gravity wells form obstacles to Hyperspace travel. A gravity well could be generated by a gravity well projector or a Gravity Well Station. These devices shaped a temporary gravity well for the purpose of interdicting Hyperspace travel, either for individual ships, or entire fleets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Examples"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Vagaari ship net"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vagaari possessed gravity well projectors known as ship nets on some of their ships which were used to prevent their victims fleeing to hyperspace.
