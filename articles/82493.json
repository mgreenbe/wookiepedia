Living Force adventures were usually retired about one and a half to two years after they premiered. Games played within 30 days of the premiere submitted an events summary to the campaign staff, with the results of the majority of the tables determining the results for the campaign (i.e. if a villain escaped for over half the tables submitting events summaries, that villain did escape and could recur later)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another type of adventure was called an interactive, which had all the available players playing together in a mostly live action roleplaying (LARP) situation.

Players could submit orders to metaorganizations, such as Joh's New and Used Droid Emporium and the Ma'Haffee Shipyard. Some interactives featured periods where the players would break up into groups of 4-6 and sit down for a short segment of tabletop roleplaying.

However, all the early adventures were required to occur within the Cularin system, and writers were not allowed to ulitize any plot elements or technologies from the movies. In order to keep pace with the movies, a plot device was included to move that action forward ten years to the setting of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones; achieved by removing the whole Cularin system from the galaxy through the use of a dark side artifact, and returning it to the galaxy at a later date."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the first external references to the Living Force campaign came in Abel G.
