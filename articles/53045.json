Specializing conductions of hunts on the moon Wasskah, Garnac's guild would kidnap other sentient beings and bring them to one of Wasskah's islands, where they would be released and mercilessly hunted by the Trandoshans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, one of the guild members, Lo-Taren, captured the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and brought her to Wasskah. Tano killed Dar during his first hunt, which enraged the Trandoshan leader, who swore vengeance on Tano. Garnac ended up successfully tracking the set of Jedi companions and killed the previously captured Jedi youngling Kalifa. Tano struck back a little later with the help of two other younglings and the Wookiee Chewbacca, where they attacked Garnac's floating fortress. Wookiee reinforcements arrived on the Zabrak bounty hunter Sugi's ship, the Halo, after receiving a transmission via a transmitter constructed by Chewbacca, and Garnac engaged Tano in combat amidst the ensuing chaos. The Trandoshan hunting leader was eventually thrown to his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
