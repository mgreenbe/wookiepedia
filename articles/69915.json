Following an investigation by Jedi Knight Bolook, Handon Guld and Rickard Lusoff were formally charged for the murder of Calder Nettic, and were subsequently escorted to the facility to await trial. The facilities were not located inside the Enclave itself, but were still considered a part of the Enclave. The Enclave was destroyed in 3956 BBY at the hands of Darth Malak's Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
