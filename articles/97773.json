It was a collective of directors and actors that had been blacklisted by the Galactic Empire, and early funding was almost entirely provided by Drun Cairnwick. They distributed holovids that the Galactic Empire had banned, especially holos about both the Rebellion and Jedi. Corinna A'Daasha met the group at her club, the Glow Dome on Adarlon and became a rebel sympathizer due to both the group and the holovid content. She allowed the group to continue distributing the vids through her nightclub. The Empire was aware of their existence and had sent the Ipharian-Da'Lor bounty hunter, Vallikor En-Vahdi, to find their members. He had tracked them down to the Glow Dome but had not gotten farther then that."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "'No-Holds-Barred' was created for Galaxy Guide 6: Tramp Freighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
