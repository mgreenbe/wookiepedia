With help from the 442nd Siege Battalion, Koon and Jag were victorious in their mission. After the battle, CT-55/11-9009 and Koon surveyed the planet's skies on a patrol flight, in the safety of their starships' cockpits. From within his ARC-170 starfighter, Jag received a transmission from a cloaked Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, who was actually the Sith Lord and Master Darth Sidious. Palpatine issued Order 66 to the clone captain, which triggered the secret behavioral modification biochip planted in Jag's brain, compelling him to kill his Jedi General. Jag complied with the order and opened fire on Koon's Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor, killing the Jedi and causing the remains of his ship to plummet into one of the planet's many bridge cities below. On the planet Kaller, young Padawan Caleb Dume witnessed Jag's betrayal through the Force, moments before his own clone troopers opened fire on him and his master. Jag's actions contributed to the galaxy-wide Great Jedi Purge, a genocide that left the Jedi Order almost completely destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jag was a human male clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, who stood at 1.83 meters tall.
