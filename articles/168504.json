The settlement contained a mining facility and ramshackle houses, which were towered over by a fortified compound that served as headquarters of the Black Sun syndicate during the Clone Wars. The town was named for Ziton Moj, a senior Black Sun Vigo who became leader of the organization during the conflict. The Last Resort was the only bar in Zitontown. A landing platform was located at the edge of the settlement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
