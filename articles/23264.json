The city was a sprawling affair, comprised of gigantic halls and skyscrapers. Although home to 60 million Gree, much of the city appeared uninhabited. The city had no starport, and visiting starships were required to land on a black metal slab in the heart of the settlement. No repair facilities were present, although the Gree did provide fuel and supplies upon request."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The city was home to both the planet's grand council, and the Grandmaster council. Visitors to the city reported that the oddities of Gree technology were extremely visible; devices that were more advanced than standard Imperial technology were present, but they were used alongside devices that were anachronistic by comparison."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
