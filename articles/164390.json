The basic purpose of a wingmate was to keep his element leader safe from attacks from enemy starfighters while the leader prosecuted targets, usually enemy craft. Within a flight element, wingmate and leader often switched roles as the situation within the engagement dictated; sometimes the leader would be out-of-position to deal with incoming enemies while the wingmate had a better chance of doing damage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
