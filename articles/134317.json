An all-new scene in which a Mon Calamari capital ship is battered by a Star Destroyer's laser emplacements was added to the manga. This scene leads directly into the scene where Grizz Frix crashes his fighter into a Star Destroyer, which was in the movie but which is expanded here."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many of the other differences between the manga and its film counterpart stem from the manga style itself. For instance, Han Solo stomping an unarmed scout trooper repeatedly, or scenes being reversed in order for American readers to easily comprehend the book (the most noticeable difference being the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon's placement)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Certain scenes of the movie are skipped or compressed though those that are skipped are few and far between.
