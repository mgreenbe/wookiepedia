Imperial battlegroups were usually deployed in full strength in situations where a sizeable enemy force had to be destroyed in the field: they were capable of stand-alone operations where a well-organized military resistance controlled an area of a planet, and they also served as the primary tactical subdivisions of a Corps deployed for a full-scale planetary conquest campaign. Of course, not all battlegroup deployments were for offensive operations, and not every operation required a full battlegroup. For instance, the 1st Tapani Assault Battlegroup at Tallaan were the primary Imperial Army presence in Tapani sector, representing a largely defensive deployment that due to political considerations nevertheless warranted a Major General in command. And in all Battlegroups, individual Regiments or Battalions could be detached to deal with low-level insurgency or a specific focused target, or to support a Navy operation\u2014although Imperial tactical thinking did restrict the use of Armor Regiments to full-scale Battlegroup offensives."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Republic"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Confederacy of Independent Systems"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Remnant"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rebel Alliance/New Republic/Galactic Alliance"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yuuzhan Vong"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Imperial Army battlegroup symbols"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
