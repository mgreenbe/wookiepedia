During the Battle of Exegol, the Fortitude carried several troops and Orbaks to attack Exegol's navigation tower, though it would be redirected and covered to attack the Steadfast instead when the tower signal was transferred to the First Order ship. The hauler landed on the hull of the Steadfast and deployed Resistance troops, piloted by Dreanna Conunda and Gandris Dyun. The Fortitude would ultimately survive the battle and return to the Resistance base on Ajan Kloss to celebrate the victory against the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
