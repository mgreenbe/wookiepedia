Cartroll attained the rank of lieutenant and acted as the second-in-command of a Separatist CR90 corvette. Around 20 BBY, Cartroll accompanied the corvette on a posting to the Ando system in the Lambda sector, where the vessel hosted a Confederate diplomatic meeting involving the Human scoundrel Gura Tran and the Tarasin Sheel, representatives of the Thaereian military armed force and the Wyrd witch coven respectively. Cartroll knew little of the purpose of the envoys' visit however and he was unfamiliar with with Sheel's species, noting her appearance to be lizard-like."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the arrival of a Republic task force in the Ando system, Cartroll's corvette was bombarded by Republic warships and severely crippled. Cartroll was wounded in the attack and was one of only three sentient beings aboard the ship to survive the Republic assault. Cartroll took shelter aboard the bridge of the stricken vessel, where he sealed the bridge doors and brought online an emergency battery power supply."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A group of freelance agents accompanying the Republic task force boarded the floundering CR90 corvette  on an intelligence-gathering mission and headed to the bridge. Cartroll initially refused to allow the operatives entry onto the bridge and kept the door barred shut. After the agents promised that Cartroll would be treated well as a prisoner of Republic, he relented and opened the bridge door to surrender himself. Shortly thereafter, the corvette came under fire from a Thaereian military Z-95 Headhunter starfighter under orders to destroy evidence of the Thaereian envoy Gura Tran's meeting with the Confederates. Cartroll assisted the freelance agents in opposing the assault and he operated a turbolaser to fire on the starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cartroll supported the ideals of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and believed the Galactic Senate, the governing body of the Republic, to be corrupt. His experiences during the Clone Wars left him weary and disillusioned, while also toughening his resolve. After the corvette that he served aboard was crippled in the Ando system, Cartroll was unhappy with the prospect of surrendering to the Republic but was uncertain about what to do to survive and was keen to survive his predicament. He was familiar with the operation of capital ship turbolasers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rame Cartroll was created by Ronald A. Heintz and appeared in Decision: Almas, a 2004 Star Wars Legends roleplaying module that formed part of the Decisions trilogy of RPGA's Living Force roleplaying campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Decision: Almas, the player characters roleplay as the freelance agents that Cartroll encounters aboard the damaged Confederate vessel and the players can interact with him in a number of ways. The players can persuade Cartroll to open the bridge door and hand himself into their custody with assurances that he will receive good treatment as a prisoner of war. The players can alternatively bypass the door lock to access the bridge, in which case Cartroll stands behind a console with a blaster in hand, ready to fire on them. It is the possible for a firefight to break out between Cartroll and the freelance operatives in which the Confederate officer can loose his life, though the adventure encourages that the players should stun rather than kill him. If Cartroll is captured, it is possible for him to be questioned and that he discloses to the players the presence of the Thaereian and Wyrd envoys aboard the vessel, specifically comparing the appearance of Sheel to any Tarasin player characters. If Cartroll is taken as a willing prisoner, it is also possible that he fires the ships' turbolasers after the corvette falls under attack from a Thaereian military starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
