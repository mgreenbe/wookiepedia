However, the craft ended up ambushed by the bounty hunter Boba Fett in the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Slave I, with the bounty hunter having been hired by Vader to track and retrieve the StarSpeeder after the latter's escape from the aforementioned raid. After evading the bounty hunter, the StarSpeeder inadvertently traveled in close proximity to the Death Star construction area, resulting in several Imperial starfighters that were led by Darth Vader attacking the craft. Narrowly evading the Imperial pursuers, the spacecraft eventually made its way through the interior of the incomplete battle station, eventually ending up inside one of its hangars and speeding out of the hangar. However, Fett ambushed them yet again just after their escape, and then fired a seismic charge at the StarSpeeder. However, it was deflected back by the StarSpeeder's weapons systems, sending the Slave I out of control from the blast, and the transport then used the opportunity to escape into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterwards, the StarSpeeder successfully rendezvoused with the Rebel Fleet, and landed aboard Home One, delivering the agent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mission is based on a scenario from the ride Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, which featured the use of the StarSpeeder 1000 ST-1401 .
