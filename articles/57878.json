Master Mace Windu of the Jedi Order searched for the Padawans but was captured by Quia and the Kyuzo Kyossk.

Guattako then fought Windu, but was shot dead by one of his child soldiers who wished to return home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guattako was a ruthless warlord who didn't see any problem in sending children to fight to death for a cause whose motives he considered pure in spite of being funded by the Hutts. According to Guattako himself, every great cause required sacrifices, even if that meant accepting Hutt resources for sowing chaos in the right places or recruiting raw soldiers. He considered himself a good enough leader as he was able to scare the esteemed Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, believing that his teachings would be greater for his abducted soldiers than Windu's."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
