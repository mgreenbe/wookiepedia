These disciplines included Center of Being, Shii Cho, Niman, Makashi, Soresu, and Shien. This meditative form of combat training made defense and evasion a much less complicated ordeal. A master of this could draw out a battle for hours until they found a position to overwhelm the enemy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
