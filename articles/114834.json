The project itself was overseen by a herd of Ithorians, led by Chodo Habat, in the years following the Jedi Civil War. Under their careful management the zones prospered at first. However, once Czerka Corporation began to take over the operating of various zones, utilizing a combination of legal maneuvering and outright thuggery, they began to fall under mismanagement and disrepair. Eventually, due to the intervention of the Jedi Exile and her companions, the project got back on its feet. In the years that followed, the restoration efforts ultimately succeeded, the zones were dismantled, and the once-beautiful surface of Telos was restored."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each Restoration Zone was surrounded by giant, translucent shield walls that honeycombed the surface of Telos within the areas being restored. These walls formed self-contained sections that were seeded with a wide variety of terrain as well as assorted species of flora and fauna that had been imported from across known space. The system was governed by a single computer network that spanned each zone, which was interconnected through the latticework of the shield walls."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Terrain"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The terrain of the various zones reflected what the surface of Telos had looked like before that world was devastated by a massive orbital bombardment. Features of the restored lands included grassy plains, natural cliff formations, terraces, narrow passes, grassy hills, and sandy beaches that surrounded restored lakes and other bodies of water. Another, secret zone that was centered on one of the planet's polar regions, however, was a landscape of snow-covered mountain vistas. The most prominent feature of this area was a large circular mesa that was surrounded by four very tall spires. Beyond the translucent green walls of the outer zones, the ruins were still visible in the form of scorched and charred earth that was surrounded by acrid smoke clouds."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Flora and fauna"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the various zones had been cleansed of toxins, the Ithorians filled them with many species of plant and animal life. Grasses and wildflowers of all kinds were planted as well as small, scraggly trees. Several species of herbivores were then imported and released into the wild zones, with predatory animals also introduced to keep their populations in check, including cannoks from Onderon. However, within the zones that had fallen under control of Czerka Corporation, the monitoring of the ecosystem that the Ithorians so carefully maintained was cut off. As a result, the cannoks devoured the herbivores en masse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the bombardment of Telos by the former Republic Admiral Saul Karath in 3959 BBY, the surface of the world was devastated, its land scarred, and the atmosphere turned into an inhospitable morass of acidic vapor clouds that produced a toxic chemical rain. After the defeat of the Sith Empire under Darth Malak three years later, the Galactic Republic, in an effort to inspire a general sense of recovery and to help spur the galactic economy, began funding the efforts of an Ithorian herd who wished to restore Telos to something approaching that world's former glory. As a result, networks of Restoration Zones were created, overseen by workers on Citadel Station, a titanic orbital structure that covered nearly a quarter of Telos's surface."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Construction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of this network, massive intersecting lines of shield walls were erected, which divided much of the surface of Telos in the shadow of Citadel Station up into interconnected zones that were managed by a single computer network. These zones would then be detoxified, cultivated and monitored on an individual basis by Ithorian and droid technicians working from land-based science stations. The process involved many steps and stages, from first isolating and containing the chemical pollutants, to introducing hearty specimens of plants and later animals into each zone. Examples of flora and fauna were taken from multiple worlds across the galaxy, including Onderon. The remains of abandoned or partially destroyed Republic military bases could be found in a number of these zones, though they were largely left untouched by the Ithorians."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mismanagement"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time the Jedi Exile arrived on Telos in 3951 BBY, the Telosian Restoration Project was in considerable jeopardy. In addition to the cutoff of fuel supplies to the station in orbit as a result of the destruction of the Peragus Mining Facility, many of the formerly Ithorian-run Restoration Zones were steadily being taken over by the local branch of Czerka Corporation. The company used loopholes written into Telosian law, lobbying before the Telosian Council and using a variety of underhanded and strong-arm tactics to wrest control of these zones. Led by Jana Lorso, this branch of Czerka sought to maximize profits at the expense of the project itself, by focusing on the salvaging of the old defense installations that had been damaged or destroyed during the initial Sith bombardment instead of general recovery. Czerka would defend these installations from prying eyes by hiring a large force of mercenaries, some of which were stationed on Citadel Station itself; however, their salvage teams would run into trouble, as some of the installations' defenses were still active."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Intervention"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once she had done all that she could on the orbital complex itself to aid the Ithorians and thwart the machinations of Czerka, including stopping an attack on the Ithorian compound by Czerka's mercenaries, the Exile and her companions Atton Rand and Kreia secured transport from Chodo Habat, the leader of the Ithorian herd responsible for the project, to the surface of Telos to continue their search for the stolen Ebon Hawk. Unfortunately for them, Czerka executive Corrun Falt learned of this, taking measures to prepare Restoration Zone RZ-0031, which was the site of one such seemingly abandoned military base, for the Exile's arrival. These measures included reinforcing the mercenary group already stationed there. On their way to the surface, the Exile's shuttle was shot down by an air defense tower; after the resulting crash that nearly killed them, the Zabrak engineer Bao-Dur arrived to pull her, Atton, and Kreia from the wreckage. The tech specialist, who had known the Exile from their mutual service in the Republic fleet during the Mandalorian Wars, agreed to aid the group in finding their starship so that they could finally leave the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After hacking their way through a herd of cannoks and several bands of mercenaries and battle droids, the group found where the Ebon Hawk had been taken to. This proved to be the least of their problems, however, because the ship had actually been taken to a previously hidden zone that had been constructed along the polar regions of the planet. While slicing into the shield network in order to locate the Ebon Hawk, Bao-Dur found that a much older shuttle was still to be found inside the nearby underground installation. The Exile and her companions then entered the not-so-inactive base, fighting even more droids all the while. However, in order to escape the zone they had to secure the shuttle, restore power to the facility to open the massive hangar bay doors, and get the activation codes in order to actually use the small vessel. Even then, a huge automated tank droid attempted to stop them. Once this was accomplished and the facility cleared out, the Exile left RZ-0031 behind for good."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their respite was short-lived, however, as they were shot down again while approaching the polar irrigation system, having been tracked there by a band of HK-50 assassin droids. After extracting herself, Kreia, Atton and the unconscious Bao-Dur from the wreckage, she confronted and defeated the HK-50s. Following this short skirmish, she discovered what was hidden within the colossal plateau: Atris's hidden Academy. The Exile spoke with the Jedi Master; during the conversation the two women discussed the events of the years that had passed since their last meeting, ending with Atris admitting to having had the Ebon Hawk brought to the facility. The Exile offered her services in fighting the Sith Triumvirate; as a result Atris asked her to seek out a number of other missing members of the Jedi Council, and that they should assemble at the destroyed Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. After the meeting, the Exile gathered her companions and reclaimed her ship, leaving the planet on her new mission."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Future"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After her defeat at the hands of the Exile, Kreia used her abilities, in conjunction with the Force-nexus at the Trayus Core on Malachor V, to predict the future. She told the Exile that the Restoration Project would ultimately succeed, due in no small part to her and her companions' actions while on Telos; this would lead to the eventual deconstruction of the many restoration zones. She went on to elaborate that the world would eventually forget that the bombardment had even occurred."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was little actual habitation within the Restoration Zones by sentient beings. Though a number of Ithorian and Human technicians worked within the areas alongside their droid assistants, they were typically shuttled between the station and the surface via orbital shuttles. These small ships did not have hyperdrives and were suited for little more than back-and-forth and in-system ferry flights, taking the living workers back to residential modules when not engaged in their tasks. On the other hand, many of the Czerka-controlled territories held a semi- or permanent garrison of the corporation's mercenary guards. These were posted primarily to guard salvage sites, keeping them from prying eyes by any means necessary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "RZ-0031"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the many Restoration Zones that had been handed over to Czerka Corporation from the Ithorians by the Telosian Council, RZ-0031 featured many different examples of the terrain that had once graced the surface of Telos, including grassy areas, a beach at the edge of a large body of water, and several small canyons that had been carved out of the landscape as well as a narrow pass through a hilly area. Under Czerka's control, the formerly Ithorian-run science station had been converted into a barracks for salvage operations; to defend the post, the mercenaries had erected an air defense tower, as well as setting several spotter droids and squads of guards to patrol the area. Due to their focus on salvage, however, the ecosystem of the zone degraded, and the cannoks living there soon devoured all the other non-sentient creatures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within RZ-0031, the Czerka salvage teams had unearthed the entrance to a military base that had, before the bombardment, been a part of the Republic's planetary defenses. Much of the underground bunker, which was quite large, had been damaged, with cave-ins blocking off some of the hallways. Much to their dismay, the Czerka salvagers discovered that many of the seemingly deserted base's defenses were still active. These included automated defense turrets, poison gas traps, and still-active war droids. Several of these teams were wiped out entirely, leaving the facility strewn with their bodies, to go along with the skeletons of those Republic troops who had died in the original attack."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Polar Irrigation System"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located at the upper polar region on Telos IV, this zone, while not officially part of the network of shield walls that divided up the other Restoration Zones, played host to a secret facility embedded within a plateau flanked by giant monoliths that jutted out of the cold, snow-covered terrain. While the Telosian Restoration Project was being constructed, the Jedi Master Atris furtively set up her new Jedi Academy within the hub of the irrigation system within this plateau. Described by Bao-Dur as being similar to the planet-wide system found on Coruscant, it served as a near-perfect hiding place for Atris's academy. The Zabrak engineer only found it due to the fact that this secret zone had been subtly drawing power from the rest of the network; using his skills as a slicer and technician, he traced this \"random flux\" back to its source. It was here that the Ebon Hawk had been taken by Brianna, one of the servants of Atris and the last of the Handmaiden Sisters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Restoration Zone was featured in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords and was created by the developers at Obsidian Entertainment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the player chooses the dark path throughout the game, then the Exile will side with Czerka Corporation, doing their work both on Citadel Station and within the Restoration Zone in regards to the Telosian Restoration Project. This includes carrying out various dark-side missions, including the theft of a droid intelligence meant for the Ithorians, finding and murdering an informant, and saving the Czerka station from its own mercenaries. If this occurs, at the end of the game Kreia will predict a different future for Telos. She states that, under the care of Czerka Corporation, it will become a cold world of \"machines and sciences\" and will never again be caught defenseless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chodo Habat, leader of the Ithorians on Telos, emphatically claims that Czerka will kill the Restoration Project and leave the Restoration Zones to fall into decay.
