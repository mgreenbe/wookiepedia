An Imperial cargo transfer area was located here until it was attacked in 3 ABY by the Nami, led by Ali Tarrak who sent a full force of TIE/D Defenders to destroy the facility. Having built their own TIE Defenders from a prototype stolen from the Empire, the Nami used the attack as a demonstration for their allies in the Rebel Alliance, with the eventual intention of selling the starfighter to them. The cargo site was completely destroyed, though its personnel were saved on the freighter Ulzepdi through a reactionary strike led by Tan Maarek Stele."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
