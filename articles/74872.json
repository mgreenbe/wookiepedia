There was also an extensive network of underground caves connected to the Keeper's Temple. Because the planet was being restored by the Keeper, its environment was subject to sudden radical change. At the Keeper's will the planet could erupt with groundquakes and geysers of lava. These seemingly catastrophic events could be temporary, ending with little sign they had ever transpired."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Save for the Keeper and her creations, Earth, Fire, Rain, and Wind, there was no sentient life on the planet. However, there were monstrous creatures roaming the surface.

The inhabitants of Keeper's World were non-violent, and found they could not withstand the war. As their homeworld was ravaged by the violence, they fled their planet. They left the Keeper behind, a powerful computer with control over the entire planet, down to its very core. She was tasked with restoring the planet for its original inhabitants in preparation for their return. Realizing that interference from alien species would disrupt her work, the Keeper deliberately made the planet appear to be hostile and populated it with fearsome creatures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 ABY a group of Rebels led by Princess Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker crashed on the planet, pursued by an Imperial commander and a contingent of Stormtroopers. The Rebels discovered the Keeper in the depths of her temple, and learned of her history. To protect her work, the Keeper caused the planet to erupt in a cataclysm, leading the Imperials to believe that the Rebels had perished, and that the planet was too dangerously unstable to approach in the future. Once the Imperials had fled the Keeper ended the cataclysm, and released the Rebels whom she had sheltered for their own safety. She then repaired their ship and sent them on their way, so she could continue her work of restoring the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original inhabitants of the Keeper's World were non-violent and technologically advanced, and fled the planet long ago.
