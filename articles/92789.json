The ring was led by Tee Va, and was once given the job of infusing slabin into tea on the planet Mandalore's capital city Sundari. The job had an unintended sideeffect that caused the death of many children in Sundari, and eventually the ring was fragmented and sent to prison on Mandalore. The ring was eventually recreated on Mandalore during the Shadow Collective's control of Mandalore, still led by Tee Va."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
