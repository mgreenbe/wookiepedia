She told him she understood, and that Zharia Vos had contacted her and requested that she reactivate her general's commission within the Kiffu Guardians as a precaution against possible actions by Krayt's forces for not allowing an Imperial base to be build on either of the Kiffar homeworlds. When her husband asked about Annah, Droo told him she was off with her unit. Bantha lamented, stating that their daughter was too young for War. Droo, however, stated that she was always fated to become a Guardian, and there was no running from her destiny, just like Bantha.
