The surface consisted of a large desert with some smaller mountains. The surrounding space were full of ship-debris and other things that were pulled between the central worlds in the system. Even huge orbiting fabrics were commonly found circling the planet. A Imperial renegade faction was found on the planet. They were Eiattu pirates that had gone into hiding, after the defeat at Endor in 4 ABY. Lando Calrissian went on a Mission to Radix on the behalf of the New Republic. Since the pirates had assaulted republic ships trespassing the system, they wanted to put an end to unnecessary civilian losses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
