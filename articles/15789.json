After passing up escaped Wookiee slaves and high-ranking Imperial defectors, he settles for a dead-or-alive bounty placed on a Devaronian named Bendu Fry. Fett goes into a cantina, where Fry is telling a joke to two women, and as Fry says the punch line, Fett approaches. Fry tries to run, but Fett easily catches the fat Devaronian. To save his life, Bendu tells Fett of a Twi'lek Jedi Knight who is living on the planet. Fett leaves to track the Jedi down, and seems to locate his target. It turns out, however, that the Twi'lek is not the Jedi after all, but the Jedi's son. His father had in fact been killed at the Battle of Geonosis, and when the son grew up, he had a son of his own. Fett, remembering how his own father had perished in the Battle of Geonosis, allows the Jedi to live not wanting the boy to be left fatherless like he was. He returns to the cantina, disintegrates Bendu and collects his bounty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Spanning twelve pages, Being Boba Fett was featured in Star Wars Tales 18, published by Dark Horse Comics on December 24, 2003.

The story was written by Jason Hall; the penciller was Stewart McKenny, with colors done by John Wycough and David Nestelle providing the inking. Hall's inspiration for the story involved the idea that Boba Fett would \"have to wake up every morning and be reminded that his father was dead (which would really mess you up after a while, and certainly rile up any feelings of hatred toward the Jedi).\" Being Boba Fett appeared in an issue that was specifically dedicated to stories about Boba Fett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Owing to the fact that Being Boba Fett was published in an issue of Star Wars Tales before Issue 21, the canonicity of this story was originally ambiguous. The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, published in 2008, included details from the story in the entry for Bendu Fry, though, making Being Boba Fett fully canonical. The story itself, part of an issue dedicated to tales about Boba Fett, does not define a specific in-universe time period or out-of-universe publishing era, like many other Tales stories, and is thus difficult to place in the Star Wars timeline."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
