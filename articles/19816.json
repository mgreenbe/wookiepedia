These creatures could shoot down prey from overhanging branches with well-placed jets of water. The bowlump was able to unhook its stalk from the muddy shallows and move slowly through the water by using its water jet for propulsion. Bowlumps were eaten by blarths."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
