After his being saddled with a reputation for ineffectual leadership and getting voted out of office in 32 BBY, Valorum spent several years and a sizable portion of his wealth working on the book, which was ultimately released by TriPlanetary Press on the same date as another biography, Gunray On Top. During the first two months of Holding Back the Tide's release, it was met with resounding disinterest, and failed to break the threshold of the top 100 sellers. Meanwhile, Gunray on Top, the unauthorized biography of Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, rocketed to the top of the bestsellers list, remaining one of the top ten for at least 14 weeks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When TriPlanetary questioned a self-described \"avid reader\" on their decision not to purchase Holding Back the Tide, they stated that they simply weren't interested in the former Chancellor, but that they may be motivated to buy the product after Valorum's death. The sales differences between Holding Back the Tide and Gunray on Top were later reported on by HoloNet News."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Holding Back the Tide was first mentioned in \"Valorum & Gunray Bracket Ends of Book Sales,\" an article posted in the \"Life\" section of HoloNet News Vol. 531 47.
