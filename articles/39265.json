Two stormtroopers patrol a docking bay containing three E-Web blaster cannons and Darth Vader's TIE Advanced. Luke opens fire on the bay, and the stormtroopers return fire with their rifles. Darth Vader enters the bay, and grabs one of the blaster cannons. Luke whoops as he dodges Vader's blasts, so the Sith Lord uses the Force to attach the cannon to his TIE and takes off in pursuit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two fighters enter the Death Star's trench, and Vader targets the X-wing. Luke suddenly pulls his fighter up and around, ending up upside down above Vader's TIE. Vader jolts his ship upward, spinning Luke back upright, and the X-wing speeds ahead again. Vader opens fire, and Artoo screams as one of the X-wing's engines is hit and explodes. Luke concentrates, using the Force to focus on the station's thermal exhaust port. Realizing what is happening, Vader hits a button in his cockpit to charge up a powerful blast, but as it fires, Luke pulls up and out of the trench, then fires a proton torpedo directly into the exhaust port. The battle station explodes, sending Vader flying into a field of debris. Luke shrugs at Artoo, and wipes his brow with relief."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
