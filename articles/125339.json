It was created during the Reborn Emperor's offensive to supply his new forces with war machines, by then-Director of Santhe/Sienar Technologies, Lady Valles Santhe. Sienar Army Systems never achieved the prestige or renown of the Sienar Fleet Systems, and would go down in history as a failure, despite its production of the TIE Crawler used in the Empire's reconquest of Coruscant. Their goal was to act as the land counterpart of the SFS, and create ground vehicles for the Imperial Army while the SFS provided starships to the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
