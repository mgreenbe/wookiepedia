It was a high-output repeating blaster and was SoroSuub's attempt to loosen BlasTech Industries' and Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc.'s strangleholds on the heavy repeater market. Its design integrated an adjustable tripod that allowed for comfortable standing, seating, lying, and trench operation. Lauded for its high rate of fire, effective range, and maintenance and repair ease, the HOB was popular with planetary defense forces and private security firms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The HOB required two soldiers to operate. Together, they could deploy the blaster's tripod and attach the separate power generator quickly. During operation, one operated the weapon while the other monitored the generator output, often while defending the mobile emplacement against return fire. The HOB could be operated solely by exceptionally stronger individuals, but it still required a power source."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
