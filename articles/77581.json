It was near the Academy and the Valley of the Dark Lords and was mostly used for Sith shuttles to drop potential acolytes who were then taken to the Academy. There, their respective training overseers would meet and brief them on the basics of Sith training. Both the second Emperor's Wrath and Darth Nox were dropped off here when they were still potential acolytes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
