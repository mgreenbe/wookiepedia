Most of the library's records were in files contained within that master computer, although others were handwritten on manuscripts or printed in books. The Grand Computer was thought to be exhaustive, collecting the knowledge of all civilizations and the history of all planets and moons inhabited by sentient species. Millennia after its creation, the computer was updated by the droid caretakers of the Lost City of the Jedi, who regularly visited the surface to collect new information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
