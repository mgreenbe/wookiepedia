The company wanted to highlight the introduction of the TranLang III communications module center into their droid line by including the letters TC in the serial numbers of all droids produced in this series. Of these, the early ones (including TC-14) were often referred to by a TC prefix. Like TC-14 herself, nearly all of them were programmed with a feminine personality, and like her, they were excellent at operating calmly under pressure. This can largely be attributed to the frequent number of memory wipes she received."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TC-14 was purchased by the Trade Federation and ended up on the Lucrehulk-class battleship Profiteer (Saak'ak) during the Federation's occupation of Naboo.

While she served the Jedi drinks, poisonous gas filled the room and took them by surprise. As this occurred, TC-14 offered an apology to the ambassadors.
