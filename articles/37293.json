Approaching a group of elders and pups, the clone troopers were met with an unpleasant surprise as Tarfful and Chewbacca swooped down with a team of warriors. Engaging in ferocious combat, the Wookiee team soon dropped down into the Shadowlands of Kashyyyk, leaving Triton Squad to follow. Setting a maze of traps involving local flora and fauna, the Wookiees soon narrowed the squad down to a few troopers, quickly dispatched by an ambush. After the carnage, Chewbacca and Tarfful remarked on how there would be many more battles to come."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
