The individual emptied their minds and allowed the Force to flow through them, entering a deep meditation. The individual was oblivious to their surroundings, and they hungered and dehydrated as normal. Individuals in states of Emptiness were difficult to detect in the Force, and Force powers directed at them had little or not effect. Entering a state of Emptiness cleared and strengthened the individual's connection to the Force, allowing them greater control for a limited period of time after exiting Emptiness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
