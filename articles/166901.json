He was known for his legendary wisdom, mastery of the Force and skills in lightsaber combat. Yoda served as a member of the Jedi High Council in the last centuries of the Galactic Republic and as Grand Master oversaw the Jedi Order before, during, and after the devastating Clone Wars. Following the First Battle of Geonosis, Yoda held the title of Master of the Order in addition to that of Grand Master. In his centuries of service to the galaxy and the Force, Grand Master Yoda had a hand in the training of nearly all the Jedi in the Order, including such luminaries as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ki-Adi-Mundi and Oppo Rancisis, all of whom would come to serve on the Jedi Council along with him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Standing about 66 cm tall, Yoda was a male member of a mysterious species, details of which he did not reveal. Yoda served as a member of the Jedi Order for centuries, eventually gaining a seat on the Jedi High Council, before reigning as the Grand Master of the Jedi. He had exceptional skills in lightsaber combat, having mastered all forms and stances of lightsaber combat, except the Vaapad subset of Form VII (he had mastered the original Form VII variant known as Juyo), but known for being particularly accomplished in Form IV, often employing the acrobatic techniques of the form. Many considered him a swordmaster and the greatest duelist in the Jedi Order, even surpassing Mace Windu and Count Dooku."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though arguably the Order's greatest master of the Force and most skilled warrior, Yoda believed most firmly in the importance of instructing younger generations and never missed an opportunity to ensure his students learn from their experiences. At heart, the diminutive Jedi Master was a teacher; indeed, he instructed nearly all the Jedi in the order, to some extent, during his reign as Grand Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Yoda was, arguably, the most highly Force-attuned member of the Order, he was not flawless. It was partially due to his failure to recognize that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was actually responsible for the outbreak of the Clone Wars, and was in fact the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, that the Republic was overthrown and the Jedi Order decimated. The Grand Master was among the few Jedi to survive Emperor Palpatine's Great Jedi Purge, after the beginning of which, he went into exile on the swamp planet of Dagobah."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, before dying and becoming one with the Force in 4 ABY, the exiled Jedi Master was responsible for the instruction of Luke Skywalker who would use Yoda's training as a basis for the creation of a New Jedi Order, after defeating the Sith.

He was from a remote planet, but which one remains a mystery. According to one legend, Yoda originally did not know that he was Force-sensitive at all. His path towards the Jedi began when he left his home planet with a Human friend, who also did not know he was Force-sensitive, on an old, barely space-worthy ship en route to the Core Worlds to seek employment. However, long before they could reach their destination, the ship was struck by a large asteroid, causing it to become severely disabled beyond their abilities to repair. They spent several days drifting dead in space during which time both their life support systems and rations came close to being exhausted, and there was still no response to their distress signal. It seemed like they would soon meet their deaths until their sensors picked up a star system not too far away. They had just enough power to make it there, and did so before crash landing on a strange swampy planet covered with a dense fog."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They spent a few days there before being found by a strange being: Hysalrian Jedi Master N'Kata Del Gormo, who revealed to them both that they were very much Force-sensitive. The Jedi Master invited Yoda to become his apprentice, also known as a Padawan. Master Gormo took them to his home, where he trained them in the ways of the Force and, not long after their training was complete, a Galactic Republic starship picked up their distress signal and rescued the two friends, who were now Jedi themselves. Departing the world, Yoda went to Coruscant, where he continued his training at the Jedi Temple as a Jedi Initiate. As time passed, he proved to be a skilled Jedi. Eventually, Yoda passed The Gathering and was assisted by the architect droid Huyang in the construction of his first lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi Master"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Yoda had completed his Padawan training, he became a Jedi Knight, meaning he could go on important missions. By the age of 96, he had become a Jedi Master. Later, he was elected to join the Jedi High Council. By 800 BBY, Yoda had begun the training of his first student, who would be one of the many Padawans Yoda would train over the long centuries of his life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Yoda became one of the Jedi Masters who led the mobile academy aboard the starship Chu'unthor, which was constructed circa 500 BBY. After crash-landing on the planet of Dathomir at around 230 BBY, Yoda and the other Jedi fought with the famed Witches of Dathomir. Coming to a stalemate, he agreed to leave the ship's data tapes. Although he left no means of reading the tapes, they were bestowed to Rell of the Singing Mountain Clan for safekeeping until such a time, Yoda foresaw, when a Jedi would come to save the planet from darkness and the information could safely be shared with the Witches. This did not happen until around 8 ABY, when Yoda's final student, Luke Skywalker, found his way to Dathomir, fulfilling his Master's prophecy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoda once traveled to Kushibah in search of a new Padawan. There among the diminutive Kushiban, the Jedi Master discovered young Ikrit, who proved strong in the Force, and took him to be trained as a Jedi.

As a result, Ikrit forsook the use of lightsabers for years afterward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By around 400 BBY, when Beldorion left the Jedi Order, Yoda could be considered one of the greatest Masters in Jedi history, comparable with Nomi Sunrider or Thon, both of whom had lived more than 3,500 years earlier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 200 BBY, Yoda, along with other Jedi Masters of that time, discovered that the shape of the Force had begun to flux, becoming murky and uncertain. Studying the perplexing mystery in silent meditation, the Jedi High Council, of which Yoda was now a senior member, was unanimous: the power of the dark side was growing. While the Council and the other Jedi believed this indicated the growing power of the Sith or other dark-siders, Yoda put forth the possibility that the darkening of the Force might suggest the imminent approach of the Chosen One, which prophecy said would bring balance to the Force. In opposition to this theory, several of the younger Jedi disputed Yoda's findings, and formed a breakaway sect\u2014the Potentium. Their heresy was not welcomed by the Council, and Yoda led the campaign to expel them from the order in 130 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around one hundred and fifty years before the Clone Wars, Yoda traveled to Ord Cestus and saved the native X'Ting from disaster. They honored Yoda by building a giant statue of him, at least 70 meters tall, inside the X'Ting Hall of Heroes. At some point between 133 BBY and 69 BBY, Master Yoda attempted to see the future of Byrch Dyshkava, a Padawan who had mysteriously gone missing after a mission. Yoda failed to provide the Order with any useful information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 102 BBY an infant by the name of Dooku, heir to the title of Count on the planet of Serenno, was discovered by the Jedi and willingly given to the Order by his parents. When Dooku reached the appropriate age, he was taken as a Padawan by Council member Thame Cerulian. However, even though he studied under Cerulian, Yoda took a particular interest in the young Dooku and was frequently his adviser and confidant. The Jedi Master, however, was equally quick to point out Dooku's flaws when necessary. Yoda assisted quite closely in Dooku's lightsaber training as a Padawan, and building from this foundation, Dooku became an accomplished duelist with the weapon. In Dooku's later years, only Yoda and senior Council member Mace Windu were considered equal to his skill with a lightsaber.

However, the aggressive Yinchorri murdered the two Jedi sent to negotiate and sent their mutilated bodies to Valorum's Coruscant doorstep as a warning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following this, the Council created a Jedi strike team of twelve, including senior Councilor Mace Windu, to the Yinchorri system. Reports of the Jedi's engagement with Yinchorri forces that reached Yoda and the Council proved confusing and contradictory, while the diminutive Jedi Master sensed danger coming toward him in the Force.

The soldier responded to the Jedi Master by telling him that he did not know since he was only an ordinary soldier.

Yoda believed that the boy was clearly affected by his years as a slave and that he still clung too tightly to the memory of his mother to be trained safely.

Unbeknownst to them, the chaotic planet was a trap set for the Jedi by Striker, whose true identity was Granta Omega, son of Xanatos. After kidnapping Anakin, he released a deadly chemical weapon that Yaddle intercepted, killing her when she absorbed it through the Force. However, through her sacrifice, she saved the city of Naatan. The weapon was intended by its vengeful maker to kill thousands if he was betrayed by any opposition, and as his insurance to escape offworld, but it failed because of what Yaddle had done. Anakin and Obi-Wan managed to bring peace to Mawan, but Anakin still felt responsible for the death of the Jedi High Council member.
