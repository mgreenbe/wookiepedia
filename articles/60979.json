They were 45 centimeters tall and stood on their rear stubby legs. Their long bodies allowed them to move through the trees and their obesity allowed them to float in the waters of Kasiol 3. Their diet consisted of a variety of fish, small amphibians, leaves and algae. Though they were quite fearsome in appearance they were considered harmless to anything larger than themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
