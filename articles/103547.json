The Solos had gone in with their escort to rescue the nest and younglings of Barabel Jedi Knights Tesar Sebatyne, Dordi, Wilyem, and Zal. Although several Hapans and some of the younglings were killed as they fought the Sith forces that had occupied the Temple, the extraction was successful. On the mission, the Parting Gift also transported Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne and former Jedi Tahiri Veila, along with Void Jumper Master Sergeant Gef Olazon and a unit of his Void Jumper marines to the Temple.
