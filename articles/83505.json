During the Clone Wars, he would use his position to assert that the organization's equipment had been legitimately bought by the Confederacy of Independent Systems on the open market. Nonetheless, Dod would conspire and conduct business with the Separatists on numerous occasions, but kept his post through frequent bribes and the corruption that plagued the Galactic Republic in its last decades."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Invasion of Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lott Dod represented the Trade Federation in the Galactic Senate during the twilight years of the Galactic Republic. He came to be a senator after the incident on Eriadu. However, when the Senate tried to hold the Federation accountable for its condemnable actions, Dod would used his political influence to delay and disrupt the government's attempts. During the Federation's invasion of the planet Naboo, an event Dod secretly helped organize, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, along with her entourage and two Jedi ambassadors, came to Coruscant after escaping her homeworld in order to plead for help from the Senate. Using his position, Dod objected to the Queen's accusations and delayed any action by suggesting that the Senate appoint a commission to ascertain the truth. When Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum gave into Dod's suggestion and seemed to be incapable of leadership, Amidala moved for a Vote of No Confidence. Ultimately, this led to the election of Sheev Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even before the creation of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Trade Federation allied itself with Count Dooku of Serenno and became one of the Confederacy's founding corporations. While the Confederacy and Republic fought each other in the Clone Wars, Dod remained in the Senate through the Federation's tenuously plausible neutrality, despite numerous legal challenges."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dod defended his organization by denying its involvement with the Separatist Alliance, though he did publicly defend that the Federation did business with the Separatists. The Republic came to reluctantly ignore the actions undertaken by extremists within the ranks  of entities such as the Trade Federation, as they were vital to its economy. Dod's true allegiance was to the Confederacy, but he kept his dealings and conspiracies far from the prying eyes of the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Aiding the Confederacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the Confederacy of Independent Systems spearheaded an invasion of Ryloth, forcing the Jedi High Council to send Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and representative Jar Jar Binks of Naboo to begin negotiations with the Toydarians. This transmission was uncovered by TX-20, who reported his findings to Count Dooku. After he learned of this, the Sith Lord dispatched Senator Lott Dod to intervene. When Organa accused the Trade Federation of being \"too chummy with the Separatists\", the Neimoidian politician was outraged and denounced Nute Gunray as an \"extremist\" who had nothing to do with the organization, before reinforcing this by claiming he had come to ensure that nothing jeopardized the treaty between Toydaria and the Federation. After Bail spoke of establishing Toydaria as a humanitarian base, Dod claimed that the Alderaanian senator was deceiving the king. He revealed that there was a blockade over Ryloth, before arguing that the planet would be a military base and thus violate Toydaria's neutrality in the eyes of the Separatist Senate, forcing the Trade Federation to cease commerce with the system. While officially King Katuunko remained neutral, he agreed to secretly help the Twi'leks and even voiced an interest in joining the Galactic Republic. Dod furiously confronted Organa, Binks and Katuunko the following day, after he learned that several blockade runners had breached the blockade above Ryloth, but left after he understood he could do nothing about it, but not before threatening Bail of the danger he was in."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Blockade of Pantora"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the base of Pantora being indebted to the Neimoidian merchants, the Trade Federation set up a blockade above the moon, isolating it from the rest of the Galactic Republic. At the same time, Count Dooku offered his aid to the Pantorans if they joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Chairman Papanoida sent Senator Riyo Chuchi to plead before the Galactic Senate before Lott Dod could legalize the blockade. The Neimoidian politician informed the Senate that the Pantoran government was in debt to the Federation, warranting a blockade until the matter could be settled. Chuchi, like others before her, accused the corporation of being allied with the Separatists. Dod admitted to the fact that the Federation was doing business with the Confederacy, but stated that that did not mean that the shipping and trade conglomerate was aligned with the secessionist movement, before invoking the Commerce Treaty of 1647, which stated that the Federation was neutral in times of war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Riyo Chuchi, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and the Papanoida family uncovered a plot orchestrated by the commanders of the Trade Federation's blockade, administrator Sib Canay and an envoy, to kidnap the daughters of Chairman Papanoida in order to force him to pledge his support to the Confederacy and pay his debts to the megacorporation. Chuchi used this to blackmail the Neimoidians into ending the blockade. Before the Galactic Senate, Lott Dod revealed Canay's sympathies to the Separatists, but stated that the captain had acted on his own accord, and announced the end of the Federation's blockade and the release of Papanoida's daughters as a gesture of goodwill to the Pantorans."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Wartime investments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In late 22 BBY, Lott Dod conspired with fellow senator Rush Clovis and Archduke Poggle the Lesser to build a new foundry on Geonosis so as to strengthen the Separatist Droid Army. However, the Jedi High Council came to believe that Clovis had ties to the Confederacy of Independent Systems and thus asked senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala to spy on him and learn of his true loyalties. Thus, she accompanied him to the purse world of Cato Neimoidia, where he was to collect on a business transaction with the Trade Federation. In reality, Clovis was hiding the fact that he was there to finalize the deal with Dod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon their arrival at Lott Dod's palace, the two were greeted by the Trade Federation senator, who expressed surprise at Amidala's presence, but nonetheless welcomed her after an exchange of their mutual beliefs in second chances. While the Naboo representative was shown to her chambers by a pair of BD-3000 luxury droids, Dod and Clovis ventured to a lower level of the palace to discuss their deal. Once there, the Neimoidian politician expressed his concerns of Amidala having been sent to uncover their plot. Faced with this increasing risk, Dod and Poggle the Lesser - who had emerged from the shadows - asked to be given a greater share of profits. Clovis however declined and reminded them that the Trade Federation had become too indebted to the InterGalactic Banking Clan, so much that it had given over much of it's assets on Cato Neimoidia over to the banking company. The negotiations were cut short by Amidala's sudden appearance. As Clovis and Amidala left, Dod silently observed the closeness between the two and suggested that he poison the Naboo representative to make Clovis more susceptible to agreeing to his demands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dod caught up with his fellow senators before dinner and offered a toast to their friendship. The Neimoidian senator discreetly applied manax-root poison, a slow-acting and hard-to-detect toxin that brought about unconsciousness and death, to the brim of Amidala's glass. In taking a sip, Amidala unknowingly swallowed the poison. The trio proceeded to dinner, after which Dod departed. Amidala used this opportunity to accompany Clovis on a tour of the palace and secure the hologram containing the coordinates to the new droid foundry. Before she could depart Cato Neimoidia, however, she began suffering from the poison. Clovis recognized her symptoms and confronted Dod with his knowledge. The Neimoidian told him of Amidala's true reasons for accompanying him to the world; Clovis confirmed this by finding that the data on the droid factory had been stolen. After confronting Amidala, Clovis decided to retrieve the antidote from Dod in exchange for the stolen data. Holding Dod and his aides at blasterpoint, Clovis obtained the antidote but failed to retrieve the data before Amidala fled the planet with the antidote. Dod, accompanied by a squad of B1 battle droids, approached the stranded Banking Clan senator and calmly requested that they \"have a word\" with each other as the droids trained their blasters on Clovis."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Deregulation of the Banking Clan"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, as a result of high clone trooper casualty rates, a bill calling for an increase in military production was introduced into the Senate by Senator Gume Saam of the Techno Union. Several other delegates were opposed to the legislation; among them, Senator Bail Organa argued that the bill would force the Republic into bankruptcy. Dod insisted that if the legislation were to pass, the Republic could open new lines of credit with the InterGalactic Banking Clan to provide for the increase in trooper production\u2014although such a move would result in the deregulation of the banks. Senator Amidala suggested that the Senate open negotiations with the Confederacy as an alternative to the increase in military spending, but not all were satisfied with her proposal. The session erupted into argument between the pro- and anti-war senators, with Tarnab Senator Mot-Not Rab initiating the call for a vote. Organa suggested that the Senate take time to weigh the benefits and detriments of banking deregulation, a move supported by Vice Chair Mas Amedda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the session, Dod and Saam met with the Muun Nix Card of the Banking Clan, who was upset that the bill had been unable to pass immediately. Dod cast the blame on Amidala, whose interference he did not expect; although Saam suggested that someone be hired to assassinate her, the Neimoidian dismissed the idea as too difficult to accomplish. The Muun suggested that they bring the war directly to Coruscant to spur the Senate to pass their legislation\u2014he argued that a thousand years without a direct attack on the capital had given its residents a false sense of safety. Card contacted Count Dooku for assistance in carrying out the plot; Dooku tasked his enforcer, General Grievous, with overseeing the transfer of disguised demolition droids to Coruscant to wreak havoc and force the Senate to act."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the infiltration units could succeed in their mission, Senator Amidala traveled to the Separatist capital world of Raxus Secundus and convinced Separatist Senator Mina Bonteri to initiate a call for negotiations between the warring government within the Separatist Parliament, a motion supported by a majority of its senators. With the resolution passed, Dooku contacted the three conspirators on Coruscant, who were troubled by the development and wanted to know what had happened to the demolition droids' mission. The Count did not share their concern; he knew that once the droids carried out their programming, the move for peace would be halted and the war would continue. When the time came for the Republic Senate to vote on the peace initiative, the demolition units succeeded in destroying a Coruscanti power generator, knocking out power to the Senate District and setting off a series of explosions that injured many of the planet's citizens. Senator Gume Saam used the situation to his advantage, prompting several members of the Senate\u2014including Chancellor Palpatine\u2014to call for the deregulation of the banks to secure the money necessary to finance the increase in troop production."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 20 BBY, Dod was present in the Senate during a vote to confirm Baron Rush Clovis as the new head of the InterGalactic Banking Clan. Despite his earlier dealings with the Separatists, Clovis had brought word to the Republic that the Muun leaders of the Banking Clan were embezzling credits, an act that threatened the Republic's financial system. Though many remained suspicious of him, Clovis was nominated to assume control of the Banking Clan following the arrest of the Muun leadership, and he pledged before the Senate that he would be neutral in all financial matters. When it was noted that Clovis had the support of both the Separatist government and the Muun people, Dod demanded to hear the Chancellor's views on the matter, and Palpatine obliged him by stating that Clovis was the best candidate, given the circumstances. In the subsequent vote, the Senate confirmed Clovis as the new leader of the Banking Clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clovis ultimately died during the Confederacy's temporary occupation of Scipio, but his treachery was enough to convince the Muuns and the Senate to hand over control of the banks to the Office of the Supreme Chancellor.

Originally, for his appearance, Dod and the Neimoidians were designed as organic versions of the Federation's B1-series battle droids to suggest that the Neimoidians had modeled the battle droids after their own image. For this to work, the Neimoidians would have had to been produced by computer-generated imagery. During production, Lucasfilm Ltd.'s Art Department opted to use animatronic masks to bring the Neimoidians to life. Consequently, the Neimoidians' appearances changed dramatically and Dod's senatorial miter, which first appeared in rough sketches of the Neimoidian, later took the shape of fellow Separatist Rune Haako."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, a Neimoidian wearing clothing similar to that of Dod appears alongside Nute Gunray on Geonosis, spawning a debate as to who the Neimoidian was.
