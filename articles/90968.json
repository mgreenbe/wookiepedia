Hopelessly outnumbered, the disabled ship must survive until its systems are back online, and then must flee the battlefield in order to notify Rebel high command!"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Mission Setup"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebel: Luke Skywalker with Determination"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial: Night Beast, Mauler Mithel with Marksmanship"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial player places his ships within Range 1 of either player's edge of the play area.
