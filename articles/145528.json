This sinkhole was inhabited by several varactyls whose eggs resembled golden orbs. Varactyl eggs were prized on the black market. During the Galactic Civil War, the gangster Hondo Ohnaka sent the Freemakers and their B1-series battle droid Roger to steal three golden orbs. Following a skirmish, Rowan Freemaker managed to used the Force to communicate with the varactyls and apologize for trying to steal their eggs. After repairing Roger, the Freemakers returned to Maz Kanata's castle to confront Hondo and his gang."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The third moon of Takodana first appeared in the non-Canon LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures episode \"The Test\", which premiered on July 25, 2016.
