She was amongst the members of the Resistance who survived the First Order's attack on the Resistance fleet following its evacuation from the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar and reached the planet Crait in a U-55 orbital loadlifter. There the remaining Resistance members held out against the First Order in an abandoned Rebel Alliance outpost and bore witness to the appearance of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, with Millham watching as he strode out to confront the First Order. While the Jedi distracted their foes, those that survived the onslaught eventually escaped on the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon. She wore a light brown duty uniform with a dark brown scarf and belt. Millham had fair skin and brown eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Koo Millham was portrayed by Chelsea Hamill, daughter of Mark Hamill, in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017.
