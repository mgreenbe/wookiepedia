Although this served as his secondary weapon after his lightsabers, Grievous was known to use other blasters as well, such as an E-5 blaster rifle, which he briefly wielded onboard the Malevolence in his first fight against General Obi-Wan Kenobi, and a DC-17 hand blaster, which he used to kill Jedi Knight Nahdar Vebb in his lair on the third moon of Vassek. Like any blaster he used, it could be holstered to the back of his belt or in a holder on his personal Tsmeu-6 personal wheel bike. On Utapau, Grievous engaged Obi-Wan Kenobi in combat again, and with the loss of his lightsabers, attempted to kill the Jedi with his blaster. However, Obi-Wan disarmed Grievous, and used the General's own blaster against him. Five shots to Grievous's organ sack ignited the oils preserving the remaining organic components of his body, killing him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The blaster was recovered along with Grievous's body by stormtroopers following Order 66, and held in the Emperor's secret storehouse on Utapau. It was later given greater accuracy with the loss of some of its firing range (going from 50 meters to only 35 meters), and was used by N-K Necrosis on Kashyyyk. A group of spacers later encountered and defeated the droid, looting its possessions, including the DT-57. Additionally, when it was being fired, the firing sounds sounded similar to the Death Watch blaster carbine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
