Two weapons could be mounted on either side of the droid's body, and each fired up to ten explosive projectiles in a shotgun-like pattern. The combined shots were powerful enough to waste infantry at relatively close range, and were also effective against small repulsorcraft such as speeder bikes, but lacked the punch to blast away the heavy armor of much larger vehicles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
