The system remained in operation after the Separatists abandoned Iego, resulting in its residents being trapped there as any starship that attempted to leave would be destroyed by the lasers. The inhabitants of Cliffhold attributed the destruction to the \"Ghost of Drol,\" the so-called phantom ruler of the planet. The laser system was discovered by Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi when they ventured to Iego in search of reeksa root, and the two were able to destroy the LaserWeb generator on Millius Prime, allowing the Iegoans the freedom to leave whenever they chose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
