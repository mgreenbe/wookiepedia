In 22 BBY, the combined forces of the Lok Revenants and the Mere Resistance attacked with the goal to destroy the factory and prevent the Federation from using the illegal Hex weapon to devastate their system. The allied force was able to take out the Defense Cannons but couldn't get past the shields of the Defense Platforms until a dying Captain Orsai rammed a platform with the damaged cruiser Kethor. The destruction of a platform caused the shields on the other Defense Platforms to fail, allowing the attackers to destroy two more platforms and thus create a hole in the defense network to reach the surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
