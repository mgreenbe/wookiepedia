Padawan Ahsoka Tano was brought to this room after she was framed for bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar, where she was expelled from the Order after Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin demanded she be tried at a military tribunal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano was arrested on charges of masterminding the bombing of the Jedi Temple hanger, eliminating a co-conspirator, and murdering several clone troopers, the Jedi High Council were prepared to give her a traditional Jedi trial, which Grand Master Yoda stated would be fair. However, Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin and the Galactic Senate believed that an internal Jedi trial would appear biased, and therefore requested that Tano be expelled from the Jedi Order and turned over to them for a military tribunal. The Council was divided over whether or not to follow these demands, but ultimately concluded that there was sufficient evidence to convict Tano. Mace Windu also noted that protecting Tano could be regarded as an act of opposition to the Senate, and therefore felt that the Council had little choice. Yoda then stated that Skywalker and Tano were to be summoned to the Chamber of Judgement for a hearing, and the Council would allow the Force to guide them in their decision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Masters Yoda, Windu, Ki-Adi-Mundi, Plo Koon, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Shaak Ti were present during the hearing. Tano stood on a risen platform in the centre of the chamber, with the Council perched on the balconies above her and her master, Anakin Skywalker watching from below. Yoda began the trial, relaying the charges against Tano and asking for her plea. Tano pleaded innocent, insisting that she would never take innocent lives as the values of the Jedi were sacred to her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unconvinced, Mundi replied that there was evidence to the contrary, pointing out that Tano was alone with Letta Tyrmond when she died. He asked for an explanation and Tano replied that someone had used the Force against Turmond."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plo Koon then brought up the subject of Tano's association with Asajj Ventress while on the run, asking if she could explain it. Tano stated that she and Ventress had come to a \"mutual understanding\" and that she had thought the former Separatist was helping her. When Mace Windu asked her if Ventress had helped her acquire the nano-droid weaponry used in the Temple bombing, Tano denied this, stating that she had been deceived just as the Council were being deceived. When questioned further by Windu, she again insisted that she was innocent and assumed that Ventress was to blame, but couldn't be sure as her senses were clouded. Yoda then stated to Tano that such things were dangerously clouded by the Dark side, but asserted that it was not just surrounding Tano, but many things."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Below, Skywalker suddenly became very angry, knowing that a decision had already been made and the trial was nothing more than a formality, to which Yoda confirmed that the Council had already reached a decision. With that, Tano was found guilty of sedition against the Republic, stripped of all military ranks and privileges and expelled from the Jedi Order. Her Padawan braid was taken from her and she was turned over to the Republic court for trial."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
