Hundreds of species vacationed on Sesid, and multi-armed droid merchants were a common sight on the boardwalks. Wooden repulsorlift boats could be rented for large sums. Because of the threat of volcanic activity, hundreds of escape pods were maintained at the beach resorts, capable of blasting beings into space to avoid natural disaster. These tall, black cylinders were kept in clusters, and the government fined their use in non-emergencies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Age of the Empire brought an end to freedom and hope on Sesid, and sparked a war with the Draedans.
