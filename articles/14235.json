The prototype tried to respond by firing its superlaser at them, but only succeeded in destroying one of the smuggler's ships; the remainder were small and fast enough to avoid the blast. The battle quickly turned into a stalemate, as the prototype's superlaser was too inaccurate and charged too slowly to take out the freighters, but the freighters themselves lacked the firepower to cause any serious damage to the prototype."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Realising that their best chance was to wait for help from the New Republic to arrive, the Smugglers' Alliance forces pulled back to regroup, and Sivron used this as an opportunity to return to the Maw. Just before it was able to leave, the Falcon secretly secured itself onto the prototype, using its landing claw, and accompanied it on its journey back. Its crew subsequently attempted to detonate the prototype's main reactor, but only succeeded in causing minor damage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Smugglers' Alliance had been planning to use the Garrison Moon as a base for their mining operations, so the destruction of it was a major setback for them.
