There were two fields acting in concert; one controlling ascent, and the other governing the descent. Individuals entered the shaft without the aid of a car or platform, and were either pushed upward or floated down gently. Each floor attached to the shaft included miniature repulsorlift generators that created an invisible walkway and landing. Drop shafts were used throughout the Corporate Sector in corporate headquarters, Authority Data Centers, and shopping concourses to add a touch of glamour."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
