At some point after the Battle of Endor, Isis put a bounty of 50,000 credits on the pirate Feldrall Okor, who had been interfering with Imperial shipping within the sector the governor was based in. The bounty hunter Boba Fett captured the pirate and brought him to Isis's office. Fett demanded double the price, and when Isis refused, the bounty hunter activated a thermal detonator and increased the price to 120,000, and later to 150,000. Isis attempted to reason with Fett, and threatened him with arrest, but the bounty hunter refused to back down. After considering her situation, Isis conceded to paying Fett 150,000 credits, and the bounty hunter disengaged the device, leaving Okor to her and taking the money."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
