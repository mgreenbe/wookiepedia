An Imperial Nebulon-B frigate, Terminator, arrived and launched TIE Bombers to destroy the vulnerable Rebel ships. Two X-wings and two A-wings from Red Squadron held off the Imperial fighters while Cathleen recovered the other Rebel ships and escaped. This mission was later recreated as a simulation for training new pilots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after the Battle of Yavin, the Cathleen drove away the Imperial Nebulon-B frigate Sentinel during an assault in Hollan D1 sector. Later, she received captured Alpha-class assault gunboats during Operation Ram's Head. Later, the Cathleen was the last ship to depart to Hoth and the Imperial Nebulon-B frigate Dragon attempted to stop it. When combined fleet attacks by the Cathleen and assistance by Red Squadron B-wing starfighters destroyed the frigate, it was attacked by CR90 corvettes Fang, a squadron of stormtrooper transports and finally the Star Destroyer Maximum. However, the Cathleen was able to escape to hyperspace without witness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
