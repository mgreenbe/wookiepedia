Kambrea then took them on a propaganda tour of a large city on Ryloth. However, after the tour, Luke Skywalker - the leader of the inspection team - insisted on visiting the ryll mine where it had been alleged that the Diversity Alliance was keeping Human slaves. Unfortunately, the Humans had been replaced by zealous Twi'lek workers from the surrounding cities. Despite this, the other members of the inspection team Lusa, Sirrakuk and Cilghal insisted on visiting the loading dock."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There, Kambrea claimed that the crates there were food and medicinal supplies for alien colonies which she claimed that the New Republic had abandoned. Knowing they were actually storing weapons, and in frustration, Sirrakuk smashed open a crate marked \"medical supplies\", exposing the weapons inside. In response, Kambrea ordered her troops to open fire and a gunbattle ensued. During the battle, Kambrea was crushed by a wall of crates, thus killing her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
