The main chamber received a steady flow of information from several sources that was displayed on several screens. Off the main chamber were several rooms called \"cells\". The Coruscant Security Force, Coruscant Fire and Rescue, and the medcenter managers each had their own cell from which they could coordinate their resources with the operations in the main chamber. Along with the CSF, Fire and Rescue, and the medcenter managers, Galactic City Air Traffic Control and the Galactic City Authority maintained a presence to allow for smooth coordination between the city's emergency agencies. In 40 ABY, CSF Captain Lon Shevu was in command of the Strategic Center. Shevu coordinated the efforts to respond to a bombing at The Elite hotel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
