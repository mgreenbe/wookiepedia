The freighter was at the far end of the convoy and docked with a Trade Federation Freighter when a band of resistance fighters arrived and decided to attack the convoy. Vana Sage disabled the freighter at the behest of Reti, who boarded the freighter to steal munitions. The Toydarian pilot then decided to reprogram the complement of Scarabs to assist the raiders. After finishing loading, Reti departed and the freighter became another casualty to the raiders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trade Federation Superfreighter appears in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Starfighter.
