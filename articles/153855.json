From its peak, an extensive landscape could be seen, with the Great Temple, the Temple of the Blueleaf Cluster, and the Palace of the Woolamander in the distance. During the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic established its quarters on Yavin 4. Because of the mists and wildlife of the moon, the Alliance could not rely on automated sensors, which prompted them to build several recon-towers. One of them, recon-tower 4, was built atop the unidentified monument. Shortly before the battle between the Alliance and the Galactic Empire's new Death Star superweapon, Corporal Osleo Prennert manned recon-tower 4 from the monument's roof."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
