SoroSuub bought several Headhunters and reverse-engineered them. It wasn't as easy as they first thought it would be based on the ship's simplicity, because the software of the Headhunter would automatically wipe large sections of the ship's memory when tampered with. They went through eight Headhunters before they were satisfied, and even then there were a number of engineering difficulties they had to sort out in the production of the Cannibalizer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the first unit finished production, Director of Formal Activities Miim Te'Suub gave the workers the rest of the day as free time. The workers got carried away and partied for four days at Tolea Biqua.
