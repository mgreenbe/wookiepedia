Shortly after her arrival, Imperial forces arrived on the moon in order to grow a crop used in military nutritional supplements. Imperial bureaucrat Jenneth Pilar chose Raada for this because, due to its remoteness and small population, viewing the moon as essentially expendable. The new crop leeched nutrients out of the soil, leaving it useless for further farming without fertilizer, which the Empire did not provide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This, coupled with the oppressive conditions the Imperials enforced, led to a growing resistance on the moon. Ahsoka did what she could to encourage the population to not allow the Empire to subjugate them but was opposed to some of the radical methods proposed by various farmers. Her struggle was made harder by the fact that she could not offer them her advanced military knowledge from years of service in the Clone Wars, wanting to keep her identity secret for her safety as well as theirs. After a disastrous attack on the Imperial base, Ahsoka was forced to leave when she used the Force to save her friends, revealing herself as a Force-sensitive. She returned many weeks later, having organized the evacuation of the moon's population with the help of Bail Organa's forces. During the ensuing battle, rebel A-wing pilots destroyed the Imperial crops and Ahsoka's plan succeeded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Raadan evacuees were initially housed in a refugee camp on Alderaan.
