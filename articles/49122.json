This weapon fired canisters containing hundreds of razor-sharp flechettes \u2014 durasteel darts that spread out over the large area. The projectiles would explode, releasing flechettes at high velocity in a wide spread."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A single antipersonnel canister could eliminate an entire squad of soldiers, while anti-vehicle rounds, consisting of eleven-centimeter-long missiles, could affect a concentrated area of five meters in diameter. The flechettes contained within were strong enough to rip through ten centimeters of durasteel, and were effective countermeasures against airspeeders and other light repulsorcraft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flechette launchers could also be wrist-mounted.
