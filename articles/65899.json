This insignia appears identical to that of Major General Maximilian Veers in The Empire Strikes Back, but in canon representations of Imperial rank insignia, the only difference between the insignia of a General and the rank badge of a lower-ranking Major is the width of the badge, with the Major's insignia being packed on a narrower plaque. Some Admirals, perhaps specifically Rear Admirals, may also use the same insignia as Generals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
