He led his clone troopers into combat on Lianna, to protect a Sienar Fleet Systems starfighter facility from invading Separatist forces. With Raith Sienar's designers working on new starfighters for the Republic Navy, it was not a planet the Republic could afford to lose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle raged across Lianna, with losses on both sides. Leading the campaign, Master Vookto used his powers of elemental summoning to cleanse the planet with twin pillars of water and fire.

He was cremated in a funeral temple on Lianna, with Yoda, Mace Windu, Tholme, Quinlan Vos, Ki-Adi-Mundi, his former padawan, Dama Montalvo, and several clone troopers in attendance. With his death, the remnants of his forces were handed over to Ki-Adi-Mundi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the funeral, Yoda and Mace Windu received a report from Tholme and Quinlan Vos regarding dissident Jedi who had refused to participate in the Clone Wars. The leaders of the dissidents had been united by Sora Bulq and had gathered on Ruul at Bulq's deteriorating family estate. They agreed to a meeting, but requested the presence of one of the Council members who could speak for the entire body, specifically Mace Windu. Windu decided to go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the presentation of the report, Windu and Quinlan Vos engaged in a sparring match. However, towards the end of the mock duel, Windu advised Vos not to hold back. This spurred Vos to unleash a vicious maneuver that Windu recognized as a Vaapad technique, prompting him to bring a quick end to the sparring session. When questioned about it, Vos claimed it was a maneuver taught to him by Sora Bulq during his retraining, although Bulq said nothing about Vaapad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Windu left for Ruul, Yoda advised him to look at Bulq with a 'child's eye', free from preconception.
