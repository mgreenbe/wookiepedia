The ranch is located on Lucas Valley Road, although Lucas is not related to the road's namesake, a turn-of-the-century landowner in the area. The Ranch is not open to the public and keeps a low profile from the road."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Assembled parcel by parcel since September 1978, Skywalker Ranch has cost Lucas up to US$100 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. After neighboring ranchers complained that Skywalker Ranch was polluting the environment, Lucasfilm acquired 3,000 acres (12 km\u00b2) of adjoining land for a total of over 4,700 acres (19 km\u00b2). Only 15 acres (60,000 m\u00b2) have been developed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ranch contains a barn with animals, vineyards, a garden with fruits and vegetables used in the on-site restaurant, an outdoor swimming pool and fitness center with racquetball courts, the man-made \"Lake Ewok\", a hilltop observatory, a 300-seat theater called \"The Stag\" as well as multiple theater screening rooms, and parking that is mostly concealed underground to preserve the natural landscape. Skywalker Sound was moved onto the ranch in 1987, now occupying the Technical Building. The Main House has a company research library under a stained-glass dome. Skywalker Ranch has its own fire station, which is part of the Marin County Mutual Aid system, and is often called on to assist firefighters in nearby Marinwood. Lucas also created a fictional backstory for the ranch, in which it \"was once owned by an old sea captain\". In 2007, Marin County gave Lucas permission to add two more screening rooms and a bridge across Bull Tail Creek"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucas, who based his Star Wars films on the scholarship of Joseph Campbell, was involved in the creation of the 1988 documentary which explored Campbell's works of The Power of Myth. The series of six, one-hour interviews between Campbell and journalist Bill Moyers was filmed at Skywalker Ranch. In the first episode, Moyers discusses Campbell's friendship with Lucas and the impact of his scholarship on Lucas' Star Wars films (Episodes IV, V, and VI)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker Ranch is intended to be more of a \"filmmaker's retreat\" than a headquarters for Lucas's business operations.

Before the Presidio move in 2005, Big Rock Ranch housed the marketing, licensing, distribution and online divisions of Lucasfilm.
