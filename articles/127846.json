Circa 0 ABY, Snake-Eyes betrayed Bloodhawk and kidnapped her. The Ky'lessan kept her prisoner in her own rooms and became the de facto commander of the port. During Snake-Eyes's term of office, the maintenance of the port was neglected. Snake-Eyes also kept the crew of the port, including Bloodhawk's personal domodroid H2-1B4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon afterwards, the port was visited by an old friend of Bloodhawk's whose ship needed repairs. Snake-Eyes received these visitors, who were members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, pretending that Bloodhawk was on a leave and obsequiously offered to repair the ship. Snake-Eyes secretly notified the Empire, offering the Rebels up in return for a reward. He also sabotaged the ship's engines to stop them from leaving the port."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, H2-1B4 told the Rebels about Snake-Eyes's treachery and recruited them to rescue Bloodhawk.
