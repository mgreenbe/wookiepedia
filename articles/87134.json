She was, however, a devout Phirmist, and trusted the Resistance enough to let them take Banz. She also did not tolerate troublemakers; those who did cause trouble at the farm and were old enough risked being sent to Lund Berlo, which was a dangerous prospect even for Durkteel's native Saurins. She would wake up ahead of the children to prepare their morning stew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
