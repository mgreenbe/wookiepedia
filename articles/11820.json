Due to a shortage of handlers, Baesoon's rotation kept the handler from having time to both get enough sleep and attend the mess hall. As a result, handlers like Baesoon relied on food runs from other personnel. One day, in 3 ABY, a runner named Chase Wilsorr brought food and caf to Baesoon and two other handlers named Murell and Jordan Smythe at the tauntaun pens. Baesoon gratefully accepted a share of the delivery. After Smythe was distracted with Wilsorr, Baesoon told off the other handler and ordered him to equip Commander Luke Skywalker and his tauntaun for a patrol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Baesoon appeared in the short story \"A Good Kiss,\" written by C.B.
