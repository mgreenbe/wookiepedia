During the recruitment, an Imperial spy who had pretended to be a recruit shot Captain Micha Evon, the commanding officer of the company. Evon survived the shot and was unconscious for two days, eventually recovering. As a result of the incident, Lieutenant Sairgon, Evon's second-in-command, cut the recruitment drive short. The incident on Demiloch was later brought up during Evon's funeral in 3 ABY by the rebel soldier and former bounty hunter Brand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Demiloch was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
