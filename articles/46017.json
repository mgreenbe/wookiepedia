The X.O. was typically responsible for the management of day-to-day activities within the unit in order to free the commander to concentrate on either planning the unit's next move or issuing general orders as circumstances dictated. The X.O. would also take charge of the unit in the absence of the commander (either due to being on leave, incapacitated in some fashion, or killed in the line of duty, among other possibilities).
