Hoping to obtain access to the deposits of the valuable agrocite mineral on the ice planet of Khorm for the Republic, the Galactic Senate dispatched a force under the command of three Jedi Generals\u2014Plo Koon, Kit Fisto, and Tauht\u2014to Khorm. However, by the time the Republic arrived there, the Confederacy had formed an alliance with the native Khormai Warlord Unger Gout, occupied the planet, and enslaved the local population to mine agrocite for them. The Confederacy additionally constructed a weather-control station that created a storm in Khorm's atmosphere, preventing the Republic from using air support but still enabling the fleet to land ground troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, the Republic captured an agrocite processing facility and established an outpost there, forcing Gout to request reinforcements from the Confederate leader, Count Dooku. Asajj Ventress, Dooku's Dark Acolyte, was dispatched to assist Gout and arrived at Khorm. However, the Jedi realized that the storm was being created by the weather-control station, prompting Fisto, Koon, and a detachment of clone troopers to set off to destroy it. After the Jedi had left, Ventress and Gout initiated a counterattack at the processing facility and recaptured it. Ventress personally slew General Tauht\u2014who had been left in charge of the base\u2014and the Confederacy captured Major Kendal Ozzel, Clone Commander CC-3636, and several clone troopers.

However, after Koon and Fisto finally managed to destroy the weather-control station, Republic reinforcements arrived, and Ventress was forced to retreat to an agrocite mine, where the enslaved Khormai were being held. The Dark Acolyte then had the mine rigged with explosives with the intention of killing the Khormai if the Republic conquered the mine. Discovering this, the Jedi decided to free the hostages before initiating a full-scale attack and tried to signal Ozzel\u2014who was tasked with leading the assault on the mine\u2014to delay his advance. The Jedi were not able to contact the Major, as the Separatists were jamming all signals, and Ozzel began his attack while the hostages were still in Ventress's custody. During the ensuing fight, Gout revealed the powerful agrocite cannons that he had constructed. Fisto and Clone Captain Sharp were able to destroy them, however, and Koon prevented Ventress from demolishing the mine.

One such resource was agrocite, a valuable mineral that could be used to exceptionally increase power to starfighters. Agrocite, however, was found only on three planets in the entire galaxy, one of them being the ice world of Khorm. In 22 BBY, the Galactic Senate dispatched a Republic force under the command of Jedi Generals Plo Koon, Kit Fisto, and Tauht to secure the agrocite deposits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time the Jedi arrived at the planet, the Confederacy\u2014allied with the native Khormai Warlord Unger Gout\u2014had already occupied Khorm, enslaved the Khormai, and forced them to mine agrocite for the Separatists. On the Kafiri Mountain, the Confederacy built a weather-control station, which created a storm in Khorm's atmosphere and prevented the enemy from utilizing air support. Additionally, Gout secretly began construction of agrocite-powered cannons inside the mine, intent on using them against the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the storm, the Republic was able to land its ground troops, leaving a fleet of Venator-class Star Destroyers commanded by Admiral Wieler in orbit of Khorm. After landing, the Republic left some troops at a staging area, while the rest of the force, commanded by Major Kendal Ozzel, moved toward a Separatist-controlled agrocite processing facility. Before attacking the facility, Koon arranged a meeting with several Khormai in order to better understand the current situation. One of the Khormai, Adaroo, told the Jedi about Gout's dealings with the Separatists. Informed of the enslaved natives, the Jedi decided that their main priority was to liberate them and assured Adaroo of it.

As the Republic's AT-TE walkers fell under laser fire, Ozzel ordered the clone troopers to disembark. The move, however, only exposed the clones to the enemy fire. Realizing that the troopers could not survive the barrage, the Jedi drew fire upon themselves and used their lightsabers to deflect blaster shots aimed at the clones. Koon, Fisto, and Adaroo then charged Gout's BX-series droid commandos and B2 super battle droids in the trenches that surrounded the plant, while Tauht proceeded to destroy the cannons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Ozzel's AT-TE walkers reached the attack position, and the Major ordered them to open fire on the Jedi's positions\u2014thus endangering their lives but greatly reducing the Separatist defenses. Seeing this, Gout fled the facility on a rail jet. The Republic soon captured the facility and established a base there, while Gout retreated to the main Separatist base in an agrocite mine to await reinforcements from the Confederate leader, Count Dooku. At the newly established Republic base, the Jedi started contemplating an attack on the mine, where the Khormai slaves were being held. Ozzel proposed a direct assault, but the Jedi declined, as such a tactic would result in too many clone casualties. Meanwhile, Separatist Commander and Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress arrived in her starship, the Trident, to assist Gout. Wieler tried to prevent her from reaching the planet and dispatched two V-19 Torrent starfighters to intercept Ventress's vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic fighters pursued Ventress to the edge of the storm and witnessed it opening for her. When they tried to pursue the Trident further, however, the storm closed again, and both Republic fighters were destroyed. Wieler immediately contacted the Jedi and informed them of what had just transpired, and the Jedi realized that the Confederacy possessed a weather-control station, recalling previous intelligence reports of Separatist attempts to acquire such technology. If the station was to be destroyed, the storm above Khorm would dissipate, allowing the Republic to utilize air support during the assault on the mine and lessen the amount of casualties. Realizing that the station was located somewhere in the mountains near the Separatist mine, Koon, Fisto, Clone Captain Sharp, and Adaroo took Ozzel's Devil Dogs clone unit and departed on CK-6 swoop bikes to destroy the station with explosives, leaving Tauht in charge of the Republic base. In order to approach the weather-control station undetected, Koon decided against taking a direct route to their objective and instead asked Adaroo to show them another way."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Counterattack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after Koon and Fisto had departed, Ventress and Gout initiated a counterattack on the processing facility. Before proceeding with the assault, Ventress had a unit of DSD1 dwarf spider droids hidden beneath a layer of snow near the facility. Separatist Armored Assault Tanks then besieged the plant, and Tauht rushed inside the structure to contact Koon and Fisto. On his way there, Tauht ordered a frightened Ozzel to reinforce the lines and hold the facility. Ventress, however, was able to infiltrate the Republic base and, by detonating some explosives, made Tauht fall to the ground, where she confronted him. After a brief lightsaber duel, Ventress killed Tauht by manipulating one of her lightsabers behind his back with the Force and stabbing him with it. The Dark Acolyte then made her way back to the Separatist positions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Informed of Tauht's death via his comlink, Ozzel assumed command of the remaining Republic forces, but instead of staying put and holding the facility as Tauht had ordered him to do before he had been killed, the Major ordered all troops to charge the enemy. Ozzel himself\u2014alongside Clone Commander CC-3636, nicknamed \"Wolffe\"\u2014boarded one of the AT-TEs and participated in the attack. At first, the Republic seemingly gained the upper hand, and the Confederacy appeared to retreat. However, Ventress ordered Sergeant 126 to reveal the hidden spider droids, and the sudden appearance of the Confederate reinforcements caught Ozzel by surprise. The spider droids decimated the majority of the Republic force, including heavy armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the few remaining Republic troops became surrounded by the droids, Ozzel panicked and ordered the Republic forces to surrender. With the engagement won, the Confederacy regained control of the processing plant, while Ozzel, Wolffe, and four other clone troopers were taken prisoner by Ventress and interrogated by her regarding Koon's and Fisto's location. Citing the Convention of Civilized Systems, Ozzel initially refused to cooperate, but after Ventress killed two clone troopers and promised to do the same to him, the Major revealed the Jedi's plan. Receiving the information she needed, the Dark Acolyte desired to kill Ozzel, Wolffe, and the remaining troopers\u2014Spitter and Comet\u2014but Gout instead had them imprisoned.

After making a stop there and burying the bodies of the dead Khormai in graves cut in the ice with the Jedi's lightsabers, the Republic strike team continued with its mission. Climbing higher in the mountains, the group was forced to abandon the swoops and travel the rest of the journey on foot. Meanwhile, Gout contacted the commander of the weather-control station, the Aqualish Villpu Nagg, and ordered him to create a storm large enough to destroy the Jedi, despite its additional potentiality of killing Ventress, who was pursuing them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nagg executed Gout's orders, but Ventress herself was able to pass the Republic troops' advance. She reached a mountain located at a half-rotation's hike from the station and prepared a trap for the Jedi by hiding most of her droids beneath the snow. She then took position at an upper level of the mountain with the remaining droids and an Armored Assault Tank. When the Republic troops reached the area, the Dark Acolyte ambushed them, jumping from above and attacking Koon with her lightsabers. At the same time, the droid commandos emerged from the snow and opened fire on the clone troopers. A firefight ensued, and Fisto ordered Sharp and his men to hold off the droids while he rushed to assist Koon. The two Jedi Masters engaged in a duel against Ventress. During the fight, Ventress was offered a chance to surrender, but she declined. Instead, the Dark Acolyte used the Force to bring down an avalanche, burying both the Republic forces and Ventress's droids underneath a crust of snow and ice. In order to avoid being crushed to death by the avalanche, the two Jedi created a Force pocket that offered them and the rest of the Republic strike team protection from the imposing wall of snow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Accompanied by her droid commandos, Ventress initiated a search for any survivors of the avalanche and killed those whom she found. In the meantime, Ozzel, Wolffe, Spitter, and Comet attempted to escape from the agrocite processing facility in which they had been imprisoned. Eventually, the three troopers were able to hot-wire a control panel that operated the doors to their cell and freed themselves from their captivity. Ozzel and the clones then stole an AAT and used it to make their way out of the facility, destroying all droid forces that stood in their way. Attacked by the escaped prisoners, the droids contacted Ventress and called her to assist them. Ventress responded to the call and set off to the processing facility in her own AAT, leaving her droids to kill any surviving Republic troops they could find. As soon as the Dark Acolyte left the scene, however, the Jedi and the clones emerged from the snow and attacked the droids, destroying them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The encounter with Ventress cost the Republic the lives of four troopers: Sten, Deadeye, Blunt, and Jark. Also, the explosives with which they had planned to destroy the weather-control station were gone, and Koon had broken his left arm. Nevertheless, the Jedi decided to continue their mission. Adaroo used a whistle to call several ice worms, Aelids, which the Khormai commonly used as transportation by riding in them. The Jedi, the remaining clones, and Adaroo took their positions inside the worms and set off for the enemy station.

At the same time, the strike team led by Koon and Fisto had almost reached the weather-control station in the Aelids. Because they had lost the explosives, the Jedi were forced to devise another method to demolish the enemy structure. Koon decided to destroy the station by redirecting the atmospheric storm at it. This plan, however, posed a danger to the Republic team, as the group could also be caught in the storm. As Koon, Fisto, and the Devil Dogs moved toward the station to execute their strategy, Ozzel and the rest of the escapees reached the staging point in the AAT and rendezvoused with the Republic troops stationed there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Wolffe offered to contact the Jedi immediately, Ozzel declined this request out of his belief that they were already dead.

However, due to Khorm's harsh natural conditions\u2014further intensified by the storm\u2014all Republic vehicles, including the few remaining AT-TEs, had been frozen in ice and had been rendered non-operational. After Ozzel was informed of this, Ventress's forces\u2014with the Dark Jedi herself at the front line\u2014arrived and launched an attack, immediately destroying the commandeered AAT.

The Jedi scouted out the agrocite mine, which Ozzel was to assault afterward. However, Gout and the Confederate troops who were stationed at the processing plant had also retreated to the mine, albeit with heavy losses. Gout moved the enslaved Khormai deep inside the mine for use as hostages. Observing the thin droid force guarding the mine, Fisto and Sharp expressed a notion to attack immediately, but Koon declined, stating that he sensed that the Confederacy was not showing everything it had. Koon's senses were backed by Adaroo, who mentioned that there had been rumors of heavy weapon construction inside the mine. Soon, Ventress arrived at the mine and confronted the enraged Gout, who blamed her for his losses. Ventress dismissed his concerns and ordered a BX droid commando to rig the mines with thermal charges and key them to her remote detonator. Witnessing the Confederacy's transfer of explosives inside the mine, the Jedi realized that Ventress was going to destroy the mine and kill the slaves if the facility fell into Republic hands.

Republic LAAT/i gunships, V-19 starfighters, Acclamator-class assault ships, and BTL-B Y-wing starfighters all assaulted the mine, and Ozzel prepared for a ground assault. However, Gout revealed his agrocite cannons, which attacked the Republic forces. The artillery shot down half of the attacking Republic force, including one of the Acclamators.

In the meantime, Koon's squad was attacked by Ventress inside the mine. Ordering Adaroo and the clones to continue the mission, Koon engaged the Dark Acolyte in a duel. The rest of Koon's task force soon reached a cave housing the prisoners\u2014who were being guarded by a number of BX droids and B2 super battle droids\u2014and began to develop a strategy to free them.

Despite his broken arm, Koon put up a fierce resistance and even managed to knock one of Ventress's lightsabers out of her hands. The Dark Jedi reached for her remote in order to destroy the mine, but Koon Force-pushed it away from her. The remote fell on the ground beneath the walkway. Ventress jumped down to reclaim it, but the remote was destroyed by a blaster shot fired by Wolffe, who, along with Fisto and several clones, had arrived to assist Koon.
