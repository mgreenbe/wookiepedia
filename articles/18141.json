He killed four of them and gathered up their bikes. He then formed the gang from other violent non-Humans who lived in the Undercity and gave them use of the bikes. The gang initially focused on attacking any Humans who entered the Undercity. However, over time, they grew in strength and Hozard had them bring terror to the Upper City region of Taris. There, they hijacked airspeeders and stole parts from workshops. This resulted in them becoming the most feared gang on Taris."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
