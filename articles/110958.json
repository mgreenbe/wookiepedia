Rogue Squadron battled TIE Interceptors, turbolasers, missile turrets, and AT-STs in the fight. The installation was protected by an elaborate shield transmitter system which projected a shield that enveloped the Capacitor entirely, forcing Rogue Squadron to destroy the transmitter network first. It was a victory for the Alliance, but it was all a trick: while they were fighting here, Moff Kohl Seerdon attacked bacta supplies on Thyferra."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Imperial Moff Kohl Seerdon blockaded the Rebel Alliance-affiliated world Chandrila, the Rebel flight group was sent to Sullust to attack the Capacitor at a hidden Imperial base.
