The temple had two towers that borrowed the architectural styles of Coruscant's Jedi Temple. A hub of Jedi training in the Devaron system, the facility was built around a vergence in the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was used as the Republic base for Devaron Space during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Erected by the Jedi Order to serve as a base for training in Devaron Space, due to the region's dense population of Force-sensitives, the Temple was small compared to others across the galaxy. Constructed near the city of Tikaroo over top of a vergence in the Force, the Temple was surrounded on all sides by dense jungle that thrived off of the Force nexus' power. The vergence itself assisted in the learning of new healing skills and promoted self-renewal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Temple was used as a military base and surveillance post for the Grand Army's operations in the region. Construction of the Republic outpost was initially overseen by Jedi Master Bolla Ropal until a Separatist assault on the base drove him offworld. Later, around 21 BBY, Separatist forces invaded Devaron to destroy the temple. Though the Temple's caretaker Jedi Master Halsey and his Padawan, Knox, alongside Clone Commander Trauma and his troops, defended the temple from the Separatist Droid Army, Count Dooku's new apprentice Savage Opress suddenly appeared in the midst of the battle and took out all Republic forces, including the two Jedi. At the end of battle, no clones, droids, or Jedi survived, only Opress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone commando unit Delta Squad investigated the outpost and brought back the bodies of Halsey and Knox to the Jedi Temple. After the assault, the Temple fell out of use and the locals began avoiding the site. Following the rise of the Empire at the end of the Clone Wars, the Imperial Navy bombed the Temple and destroyed anything with Jedi symbolism, toppling statues and burning records. The top of the main tower was targeted, and rubble from its collapse blocked the main entrance. The Imperials left a crater in the main hall, evidence of a targeted demolition on something that once sat at its center. The jungle began to advance on the courtyard, held back by the power of the vergence, which attracted pikhrons to the circular area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Consisting of two dissimilar gray towers connected at their base, the central tower's upper sections were adorned by three decorative fins similar to the Coruscant Jedi Temple. The base of the tower was dominated by the main hall. The upper floors contained the caretaker's offices, dining halls, classrooms. The towers were surrounded by low-lying residences and greenhouses, and fronted by a circular courtyard used for group meditation and training exercises. During the Clone Wars, communications arrays and dishes were installed to serve as a Republic listening post. In the wake of the Imperial bombing, an underground security tunnel was left exposed and the main entrance collapsed. Many of the statues that dotted the campus were defaced and the pinnacle chambers of the main tower were caved in."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
