They dwelt in small flocks near oases. They had wings, black scales, and short patches of fur. They shed their skin annually, and their age could be determined by the number of knobs on their tail rattles. Sociable beings, they were popular pets among spacers, as they voraciously preyed upon mynocks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In \"Dining at Dex's,\" an ingredient in the Socorro slider is called tailring bacon though, aside from the nominal connection, the work by Gregory Walker does not establish a canonical connection to tailrings.
