Grigor, suspecting Trommer was sent to spy on him, intended to eliminate Trommer as a rebel operative in a raid on Mora's shop. However, real rebels, including Leia Organa, whom Mora (unaware that she's Padm\u00e9's daughter) recognized her from her wanted posters, had already approached Mora for her technical skills in order to have her modify a number of Asteroid-3 swoops. When stormtroopers swept in to arrest Trommer, Mora fought back, with the nearby rebels joining in. Afterward, Trommer and Mora fled her shop with the rebels, and together they sabotaged Grigor's dragite crystal mine and left to join the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
