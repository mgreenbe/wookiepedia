It played host to mildly-respectable passengers and acted as a base of operations for multiple traders, pilots, smugglers, mercenaries and bounty hunters. It was the location of the majority of the ship's docking areas. Blue Level was also home to Trader's Alley, a cash-only bazaar, and three-deck central courtyard that linked it to Diamond Level. The courtyard contained high holodiorama depicting the Battle of Thyferra, with Booster's role enhanced and his son-in-law Corran's role nearly eliminated. Despite the questionable historical accuracy, it was considered one of the greatest pieces of wartime art in the galaxy following the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
