The Sith Lord Darth Scabrous unleashed a number of unakki eye spiders on his Sith academy on Odacer-Faustin around 3645 BBY. The spiders killed two students and attacked at least eleven others, including Hartwig and Soid Einray. Although Hartwig survived the incident, he would continue to wake up on a number of mornings with blood in his eyes. Soid Einray hanged himself as a result of the damage caused by the spiders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
