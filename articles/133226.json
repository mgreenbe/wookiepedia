However, when plans changed to set it around the same time as the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Dameron was replaced by Han Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cavan Scott's original intent for the issue was a story featuring the Nightsisters, but given that the story's placement on the timeline made that impossible, he opted to use Han Solo and Chewbacca as protagonists.
