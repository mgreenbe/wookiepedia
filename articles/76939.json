They approach the mobile factories only to discover that they are actually disguised kinetic corruptors. They activate and trigger the underground baradium shales, creating a series of large explosions that trigger a massive magma eruption that devastates the planet's surface. The Sith Lord Daiman gloats over his success in luring his hated brother Odion to a trap on Chelloa. In reality, Daiman was not expanding baradium operations but rather planned to deny the planet to his Sith rivals. Daiman then orders his shuttle and \"decoy transports\" at Arboth spaceport to evacuate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Kerra, Gorlan and the refugees seize control of the decoy transports, creating a makeshift fleet known as the Freedom Fleet.

Odion's entire invasion force with the exception of himself are killed in the ensuing magma eruption. Daiman and his entourage flee Chelloa on a shuttle. Meanwhile, Odion takes on Kerra in a climactic lightsaber duel, which leads to a pursuit over the Freedom Fleet which is exiting Chelloa's atmosphere. In the end, Odion is attacked by the Jedi Knight Gorlan, who pushes him into the thrusters. Both men suffer severe burns and Gorlan dies from his wounds.
