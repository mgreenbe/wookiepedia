It was equipped with a neuro-repulsor field generator which delivered a neuro-shock to any organic being it touched. The hand functioned similarly to a standard prosthetic, and had full sensory response, meaning the user could feel sensations and pain through the hand. The hand was activated when jabbed sharply, although the use was not voluntary, meaning a cyborg using a neuro-shock hand could injure anything they touched."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable users"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
