The Humans then blinded the Duros and levitated them to their homeworld of Urthha, where they would stay four over four solar periods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving on the planet, the Duros couple adjusted their aural synchronizers, a simultaneous translation device, since neither one of them spoke Galactic Basic Standard, in order to readily comprehend Human speech. They were then taken to a dinner party, where the couple were forced to sit and consume food. To the Edthatts, Human cuisine resembled food from the Vretha system\u2014a location within the Mid Rim's Hollan sector\u2014, which prompted Etro to start stamping it, angering the hostess in the process. He ate a potato, but it made him feel sick and break out in collard lesions, scaring away the all Humans.

She struggled with many cultural concepts and objects common to Humans such as \"party,\" \"table\" or pieces of technology like matter catalysts. She additionally did not speak Galactic Standard Basic, a language that, at first, reminded her of Mocking Trees. Edthatt required aural synchronizers to communicate with some off-worlders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially frightened with the kidnapping and the cultural shock, Edthatt over time developed a positive view of the whole affair, enjoying her time on Urthha.

In the story, two Duros newlyweds named Etro and Droza Edthatt are \"abducted by Human beings\" from the planet \"Urthha\". After more than four solar periods of unusual experiences, they use a \"matter catalyst\", which the humans call a \"blender\", to leave the planet. A picture of the Edthatts, originally a production photo from Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, is included in the segment, although it is not made clear who is who in the image. The Duros in the original picture were canonically identified as Chachi De Maal and Ohwun De Maal. Lucasfilm employee Leland Chee, who maintains the Holocron continuity database, has indicated that information contained in the book is non-canonical."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
