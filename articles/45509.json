Esstee-Ninety-Three was a hulking bipedal droid with a pair of powerful piston arms that featured pincers. The droid had a singular red sensor and gray plating with yellow stripes. Esstee-Ninety-Three was a close friend to Gorko, another of Nodo's employees.

Esstee-Ninety-Three was shot and destroyed by Solo, who was subsequently caught by Nodo.

In one path, Esstee-Ninety-Three confronts Solo, and Solo throws the exchanger to the droid, ordering it to catch the component. Surprised, the droid does so, and is subsequently shot by Solo. Gorko, angered by his friend's destruction, catches Solo, who remarks on the droid's lack of intelligence after being taken to Nodo. The other path has Esstee-Ninety-Three restrain Meecha Odon, a slave of Nodo's who previously encountered Solo while trying to escape. Odon attempts to inform the droid of the presence of Solo and the Millennium Falcon, but Esstee-Ninety-Three does not believe her claims. Solo sneaks up behind Esstee-Ninety-Three, shooting the droid in the back. As both paths lead to the same point in the story and result in Esstee-Ninety-Three's destruction, this article does not assume which set of events is the canon story, only that the droid is destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
