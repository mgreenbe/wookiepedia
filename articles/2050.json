Capable of most sensor functions, the scanner was capable of detecting life forms, comm signals, movement, density, mass, volume, and energy type and intensity. Due to the small size of the scanner, it had a limited range of three hundred meters; additionally, its interface did not offer any sophisticated interpretation options - forcing the user to rely on skill and expertise to make sense of readings and data."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
