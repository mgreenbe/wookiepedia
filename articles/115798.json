They were married in secret, because neither her family nor his approved of them being together. Early in the Second Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances and the Confederation, which took place between 40 ABY and 41 ABY, she was arrested during a security sweep on the planet Coruscant, capital of the Galactic Alliance, and died. Her death drove Rikel to hate all Coruscanti, and the Galactic Alliance to which they belonged. He would go as far as to attempt to destroy their planet with Centerpoint Station in revenge, but doing so caused his own death, and the destruction of the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rikel's wife was first mentioned in the 2007 novel Legacy of the Force: Fury, written by Aaron Allston."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
