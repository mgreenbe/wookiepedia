As the war ended, the Galactic Republic was left in ruins and in need of reorganization, a restructuring carried out via the Ruusan Reformation, a collection of reforms enacted by Supreme Chancellor Tarsus Valorum. The reform codified the Jedi Order, the winning faction of the war, as a branch of the Republic's Judicial Department. Yoda, a green-skinned Force-sensitive non-Human, was born in 896 BBY.
