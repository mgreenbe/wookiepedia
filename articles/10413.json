He sired two pups, a female named Kallabow and a male named Chewbacca, the latter of whom became a fabled hero of the Rebel Alliance that fought the authoritarian Galactic Empire. A supportive father, Attichitcuk had allowed his only son to leave the household to travel all over the galaxy in search of adventure around the year 150 BBY. In his prime, Attichitcuk played a leading role on his homeworld of Kashyyyk, a planet covered in immense forests. It was he who represented his Wookiee brethren in the Galactic Republic negotiations for colonization rights to Alaris Prime, a moon of the gas giant Alaris. With the help of both his son and the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, the chieftain drove out invasion forces of the Trade Federation that occupied Alaris Prime illegally."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars broke out in 22 BBY, Attichitcuk was already an old, retired warrior, but he still joined in at least one fight. When the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded Kashyyyk toward the end of the three-year conflict, Attichitcuk engaged in combat along his fellow warriors and the Republic forces led by the Jedi Master Yoda. That event, known to future generations as the Battle of Kashyyyk, was one of the last conflicts fought during the Clone Wars. The Republic fell apart shortly afterwards and was replaced by the Galactic Empire, an autocratic regime led with an iron fist by Emperor Palpatine. Following the new government's xenocentrist policies, the Wookiees were enslaved. Attichitcuk, however, was left behind on Kashyyyk while his son Chewbacca was still traveling offworld.

Three years afterwards, the gray Wookiee was captured by Nagai slaver Ozrei N'takkilomandrife, but was subsequently freed by Chewbacca and his Human partner Han Solo. A few months later that same year, Kashyyyk was taken over once again when the Imperial Moff Darcc combined forces with the Trandoshan slaver Pekt. Attichitcuk shouldered the responsibility of calling Chewbacca and his Rebel allies for help, but he was kidnapped by the Trandoshan, who planned on having him skinned. One more time, Chewbacca and Solo saved Attichitcuk from certain death. In his late years, Attichitcuk had become an elder statesman retired to his family treehouse in the city of Rwookrrorro, enjoying his wood carving and the company of his kin.

Attichitcuk's family originated from Rwookrrorro, the capital of Kashyyyk, and his name was made of three words that meant \"father,\" \"hero\" and \"husband\" in Shyriiwook, the main Wookiee language. Attichitcuk's father had once killed another Wookiee in a duel, which had caused a lasting enmity between his clan and that of the deceased opponent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his youth, Attichitcuk became noticed for the audacious hunting raids he made at the very bottom of the dangerous wroshyr tree forests. On Kashyyyk, warriors were expected to take part in such expeditions to protect the civilians from the predators roaming below the treehouses. As a consequence, skilled hunters like Attichitcuk were held in high regard in the Wookiee culture. Once, he slaughtered a pack of twenty ferocious katarns with only a ryyk blade, collecting their claws after killing them. However, despite his outstanding abilities, Attichitcuk was no braggart, and he long kept that particular exploit a secret.

By telling him tales of adventure and mysterious places, Attichitcuk passed his curiosity and ambition to his offspring. When his son was deemed ready, Attichitcuk took him to the Well of the Dead in the Shadowlands so he could perform his hrrtayyk ceremony, the Wookiee coming-of-age ritual. Unbeknownst to Attichitcuk, his son had already ventured at least twice in the Shadowlands before his hrrtayyk, one with his friend Salporin and another with the recently initiated Tarfful of Kachirho.

In 150 BBY, Attichitcuk allowed his only son to leave for adventures in the vast universe, as he had succumbed to the wanderlust of Wookiee adolescence.

However, in spite of his many years of experience, Attichitcuk had never been confronted with new, potentially hostile environment. To help the chieftain carry out his new mission, he was offered the help of the renowned Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. The chieftain set foot on the moon, establishing a primary settlement with only a few carbon prefab shelters and a command center. The chieftain stayed on guard duty at the camp, waiting for the first settlers to arrive, while Chewbacca and his cousin Shoran were tasked with exploring the surrounding area. To ensure the two youngsters would find their way to the camp, the older Wookiee left markers on the way. When Chewbacca and Shoran reached the camp, it appeared that a damaged power core had been found on the surface of the moon, indicating illegal presence on Alaris Prime. Immediately afterwards, the camp was attacked by a group of four gundarks, a species of red, four-armed predators.

While Chewbacca and Master Jinn were working on improving the camp's technology level, Chieftain Attichitcuk conducted a handful of troops on a reconnaissance mission in hopes of locating the Trade Federation's landing area without being detected. However, on their way back to the village, the scouting patrol faced a Federation unit led by DRN-38, and Attitchitcuk fell into an ambush at the very doors of his camp. His soldiers were shot, and when the chieftain himself fell under enemy fire, Chewbacca, who had been close enough to witness the ambush but too far to intervene in time, released a cry of grievance. Qui-Gon Jinn, who felt that a spark of life remained in the recumbent body of Attichitcuk, suggested immediate action. Taking a squad of bowcaster troopers and a newly built medical droid, Chewbacca marched toward his father's attackers, destroying the battle droids on his way.

The resulting Clone Wars, which started on the planet Geonosis, soon turned into a galaxy-wide conflict involving thousands of other worlds. For most of the war, the leaders of Kashyyyk chose to remain non-aligned. In fact, the Wookiees criticized the Republic for toying with the idea of giving senatorial representation to the Trandoshans, their longtime enemies, and for stationing military assets in Wookiee space. In 21 BBY, in an attempt to pour oil on troubled waters, the Jedi Order sent the Human Kai Justiss to Kashyyyk, appointing him as the new Jedi Watchman of the forest planet.

In spite of his advanced age, Attichitcuk joined in the defense of his homeworld. Deemed too old to fight alongside the younger Wookiee warriors on the ground, the former chieftain served as a gunner aboard an Oevvaor jet catamaran during the battle that raged near the city of Kachirho. Seated at the back of the catamaran, Attichitcuk's role was to throw thermal detonators at the enemy tank droids in hopes of melting sizeable holes in them.

With the rise of the Empire and its xenophobic policies, Kashyyyk would once again be blockaded and the Wookiees enslaved. Almost immediately, the Empire tasked the commando Triton Squad with killing fugitive Wookiees throughout the forest. The squad notably intended to burn a certain Wookiee village to the ground and execute its inhabitants. Attichitcuk was present when the commando arrived, and the elderly Wookiee interposed himself between the attackers and a group of scared pups, only armed with an Elder's staff. However, a group of Wookiee warriors led by Chewbacca and Tarfful swooped down on the enemy, keeping Attichitcuk and the pups out of harm's way. After a brief skirmish, the Wookiee warriors pushed the Imperial troopers into the Shadowlands, where the entire squad was hunted and killed.

The creator of Star Wars named all three new Wookiees himself, christening the grandfather \"Itchy.\" The original draft of the Holiday Special was a collaborative effort between writers Leonard Ripps and Pat Proft and George Lucas. The final script, however, was written without Lucas's involvement and was entrusted to producers Ken and Mitzie Welch of Smith-Hemion Productions. They made significant changes to the script, adding several musical numbers and comedy skits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the fourth draft script of the Holiday Special, dated October 13, 1978, Chewbacca's father was called \"Old Attchituck\" and described as a \"gray-haired, cranky, 400-year-old cuss.\" This version of the script differs only slightly from the final cut of the TV special and features Wookiee dialogue translated in all caps. In early story treatments, Attichitcuk's role was much less developed, with him being mentioned only three times in a five-page rough draft. In this early story treatment, Itchy's \"big scene\" with the mind evaporator was attributed to Chewbacca instead, although it did not feature the erotic entertainer Mermeia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The old Wookiee's appearance was designed by Joe Johnston, who had worked as head storyboard artist on Star Wars. In his conceptual drawings, Johnston described Attichitcuk as a \"350-375 years old\" Wookiee. The 350 figure was finally retained and confirmed many years later in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds. Many of Itchy's characteristics can also be attributed to Ralph McQuarrie, who recalled drawing \"an old Wookiee getting up out of his chair and several females and children.\" At some point after the airing of the Holiday Special, the American toy company Kenner Products envisioned an action figure line of Chewbacca's family. Prototypes were constructed of Chewbacca, Malla, Itchy, and Lumpy, but the idea was ultimately dropped. The Attichitcuk prototype was in fact a modified Chewbacca figure with the bandolier strap removed and gray paint sprayed around the head and beard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Attichitcuk as we know him dates from the 1978 Holiday Special, there are traces of a proto-Itchy as far back as the May 1973 rough draft of Star Wars. This early incarnation, known as \"Auzituck,\" appeared in scene 135, which was set in the \"Wookee [sic] camp\" on Yavin\u2014\"Yavin\" being an early version of Kashyyyk. The script says: \"Chewbacca enters the largest of the lodges. He is greeted by his father, AUZITUCK, Chief of the KAAPAUKU tribe; an old and feeble Wookee [sic] dressed in royal skins and headdress.\" The old Chief only appeared in this scene, and was mentioned in passing later in the script, when a proto\u2013Han Solo introduced \"Chewbacca, son of Auzituck, Prince of the Sawas, a very powerful tribe.\" This name was later used for a gunship model in Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Portrayal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In The Star Wars Holiday Special, Attichitcuk was portrayed by actor Paul Gale. His co-star Patty Maloney, who played Lumpy in the show, recalled Gale \"as fun to work with\" and \"just like being with family.\" Like the other actors who played Wookiees in the Holiday Special, Paul Gale was given no lines, and all his performance was based on mime. Along with Malloney and Mickey Morton, who played Malla, Gale attended a Shyriiwook class in order to get accustomed to the language and better react on cues during shooting. The Wookiee characters' voices were added during post-production by sound designer Ben Burtt. In his 2011 reference book Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide, Burtt recalled spending two days at the Olympic Games Farm in Sequim, Washington, collecting enough bear sounds to give each Wookiee a distinguishable voice. Out of the dozen captive bears of various species that were kept at the Farm, Burtt chose grizzlies to provide a basis for Attichitcuk's voice. In 2005, sound clips of Itchy's voice from The Star Wars Holiday Special were reused for a few of Chieftain Tarfful's growls in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Specifically, they were used during Yoda's \"goodbye\" scene to Chewbacca and Tarfful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although makeup supervisor Stuart Freeborn had designed the original Chewbacca costume, he had no hand in creating additional Wookiee suits seen in the TV special. Attichitcuk's hairy bodysuit was produced by special effects artists Stan Winston and Thomas R. Burman. Burman and his brother Ellis provided Winston with a a large amount of \"Wookiee fur\" mined from dozens of human-hair wigs, while Chewie's suit was made out of knitted mohair and straight yak hair. Winston also designed very articulated face prothestics for the special. Attichitcuk's mask was made of overlaying vacuum forms and springs so it would would fit up tight against the actor's eyes. According to creature effects artist Don Bies, Attichitcuk's costume and mask were still housed in the Lucasfilm Archives as of 2005. The two wooden X-wings allegedly carved by Itchy in the show\u2014actually painted models\u2014were also preserved. In 2008, they were exhumed by StarWars.com editor Pete Vilmur on the occasion of the Holiday Special's thirtieth anniversary."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Character development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following its only diffusion in 1978, The Star Wars Holiday Special was heavily criticized. Part of the criticism focused on the opening scenes of the special, which featured Attichitcuk and his kin addressing each other in unsubtitled Wookiee-speak for fifteen minutes. However, as Star Wars Insider magazine contributor Jon Bradley Snyder put it, the Holiday Special had a silly, stuck-in-the-seventies feel that gave it charm, and the show acquired cult status in popular culture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One year after the airing of the Holiday Special, Random House released The Wookiee Storybook, a tie-in children book that had been written by Eleanor Ehrhardt during the production of the show. Patricia Wynne illustrated the book without having seen the actual Wookiee costumes. Because of the short deadline, George Lucas allowed Wynne a large amount of creative freedom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next appearance of Itchy was a single-panel cameo in Star Wars 91, the ninety-first issue of Marvel Comics' Star Wars series. Despite the overall failure of the Holiday Special, Attichitcuk was reused in other Star Wars Expanded Universe stories, although not as often as Lumpawarrump or Mallatobuck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2001, Attichitcuk was given an important role in the video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds as the main character in the Wookiee training campaign, which revolved around the colonization of Alaris Prime. An older Attichitcuk also appeared in the Princess Leia and Chewbacca campaigns later in the game. In the third mission of the Princess Leia campaign, Attichitcuk took part in the Battle of Geddes. When brought back towards the ship with Leia Organa and Echuu Shen-Jon at the end of the mission, the Wookiee literally disappears from the screen. It should also be noted that if Attichitcuk dies in any of the campaigns he appears in, the player loses the level. The name of Attichitcuk was pronounced two different ways in the game. Qui-Gon Jinn (voiced by James Warwick) pronounced \"Atty-chitchik,\" while Princess Leia Organa (voiced by Lisa Fuson) pronounced \"ATT-uh-CHIT-tik.\" While the old chieftain was already gray and stooped by the time of the Clone Wars, the later Rebellion/New Republic missions featured the same youthful, brown-furred ingame model with matching icon as the earlier Attichitcuk campaign. The present article treats that inconsistency as a result of game mechanics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around October 2002, Attichitcuk was to be reinvented during production of Revenge of the Sith. According to Sang Jun Lee, who worked as concept artist at Skywalker Ranch, \"Chewbacca's father\" was to be killed during the course of the movie, which would have prompted him to run away and meet Han Solo. This concept, however, did not make it into the final film; had it been implemented, it would have directly contradicted Attichitcuk's later appearances in continuity. However, in January 2003, Lucas told the creation team that a young Han Solo was being raised on Kashyyyk by Chewbacca. Eventually, both ideas of featuring Chewbacca's father and Han Solo in the movie were abandoned. While Attichitcuk did not appear in Revenge of the Sith, he was stated to have taken part in the Battle of Kashyyyk in the reference book Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections. In a technical drawing by Hans Jenssen, Attichitcuk was pictured at the back of a Wookiee catamaran, throwing grenades. Additionally, the movie character of Merumeru bore a strong resemblance to one of the conceptual drawings, sporting the same staff and a similar headgear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
