The facility was overcrowded and out-of-date, built long ago to sustain the pilgrim and tourist traffic to the planet. When the Galactic Empire took control of the city, they found the local spaceport inadequate to their needs and promptly set about clearing four separate locations within the city to use as landing zones and staging areas for their operations. However, Jedha City was built on a built on a mesa, so there simply was no room to expand the spaceport, and in order to create the landing zones, the Imperials leveled the buildings that stood in their way, with no regard to the residents or businesses they displaced. These landing zones were known as LZ-Aurek, LZ-Besh, LZ-Cresh and LZ-Dorn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
