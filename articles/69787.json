Faced with a pan-galactic civil war between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Jedi adopted the mantle of generals and soldiers in the Grand Army of the Republic. After three years of conflict, the Jedi discovered that the war had been a ploy designed to restore the Sith to power. However, the Jedi were betrayed by one of their own\u2014the Chosen One Anakin Skywalker, who had been seduced to the dark side and anointed Darth Vader by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious.

Skywalker, the son of Vader, was also taught the ways of the Jedi by Grand Master Yoda and fought for the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. On his death bed, Yoda gave his final apprentice the mandate of passing on his lessons to a new generation of Jedi.

As the First Order rose to power, Ren and Snoke sought to destroy Skywalker, who, in self-exile, briefly trained Rey in the ways of the Jedi until he sacrificed himself to save the Resistance, after which time Skywalker's sister, Leia Organa, continued her training.

Having killed Plagueis in his sleep, Sidious sought to accomplish the Sith plan to bring the galaxy under his control as its Galactic Emperor. Sidious also had his own Sith apprentice, Darth Maul. Due to his desire to kill Jedi, Maul killed Padawan Eldra Kaitis on the moon of Drazkel, but her death did not satisfy his bloodlust. Thus, establishing a fake cartel under Kaitis's name, Maul continued his hunt and killed the Force-sensitive thief Zek Peiro. Not wanting the Jedi to learn of his plans, Sidious brought Maul to the ancient Sith world of Malachor to teach him about patience.

During the ensuing Battle of Naboo, Jinn and Kenobi engaged Maul in yet another duel, while Skywalker, joined by astromech droid R2-D2, joined the space battle against the Lucrehulk-class Battleship Vuutun Palaa in a N-1 starfighter.

They were rescued by the arrival of a Jedi assault team led by Windu and then a force of clone troopers, an army of cloned soldiers recently discovered by Kenobi on the planet Kamino, led by Yoda. In the subsequent actions of the Battle of Geonosis, the Jedi led the clones into battle against the Separatist Droid Army, but Dooku managed to escape from Kenobi, Skywalker, and Yoda.

During the war, Jedi Knights and Masters became the Jedi Generals in the Grand Army of the Republic, while their Padawans became lower ranking Jedi Commanders.

Thinking her Order had fallen from the light to be an army that only benefitted the dark side, Offee arranged for a bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar and framed her friend, fellow Padawan Ahsoka Tano, to take the fall. One of the few people to stand with Tano was Skywalker, who was Tano's master and friend. He uncovered and exposed Offee as the true culprit during Tano's trial. Nevertheless, with her faith in the Order shaken, Tano left the Jedi to go on her own path, but she remained on the light side and acted, according to Rafa Martez, in the way the Jedi should have been.

After Skywalker informed Windu of the truth, the Jedi Master led Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin to arrest the Supreme Chancellor. The mission ended in failure, with Sidious cutting down all but Windu, and Skywalker himself arriving.

Jedi across the galaxy were therefore gunned down by their own soldiers. Additionally, Vader led his elite 501st Legion into the Jedi Temple itself, murdering everyone, even the younglings, they found inside. Though Order 66 only explicitly targeted the Jedi, other Force-sensitives would find themselves in its crosshairs; Maul and Tano were both targeted aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal by the 332nd Division, though Maul escaped aboard a Nu-class transport, while Tano and Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex,\" whose control chip had been removed by the former Padawan, fled aboard a BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber as the Tribunal crashed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Vader cut down the Separatist Council on the volcanic world of Mustafar, Sidious used Windu's strike against him as an excuse to brand the Jedi as traitors before vowing to hunt down the surviving members of the Order and transforming the Republic into his Galactic Empire.
