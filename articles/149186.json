Ubrikkian delivered a yacht indeed, with a modified Ubrikkian BBK Repulsorsub to be used as a escape pod and proton hydrotorpedoes as weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In an attempt to increase his popularity, Bartyn named the ship Tria Blue.

Worried about the security of the Tria Blue, Bartyn docked it in a private berth near the Center Sphere District of Bartyn's Landing and, in an unpopular move, staffed it with security agents from the spaceport. The dockmaster, Howe Walwahd, felt little sympathy for Bartyn and would care little should his boat had been destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two Menahuun scouts sneaked in the Tria Blue, killed all the guards and placed their mutilated bodies in the entrance as a warning.
