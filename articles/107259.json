The weapon had a power supply that added an electrical jolt to successful attacks. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, the Human smuggler Han Solo wielded a power mace in the Big Game, a gladiatorial competition on the Wheel space station. The mace proved of little use against Solo's four-armed opponent, but the smuggler bested his adversary regardless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The power mace was a melee weapon that consisted of a thin handle and a large, spherical striking end, roughly the size of a Human head, covered in long spikes. The mace had an electrical charge that gave the weapon a yellow glow and added extra damage to a successful attack; the wielder held the mace in one hand and attempted to hit opponents with its spiky head. At least one model was gray in color."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On a visit to the Wheel space station during the Galactic Civil War, Human smuggler Han Solo entered a gladiatorial competition called the Big Game to win a cash prize that would enable him to pay off his debts to the station's administration. When Solo refused to give one of the game officials the name of his preferred melee weapon, in protest over what he suspected to be tampering in the game's rankings, he was assigned a power mace and power shield for his first bout. Solo faced a lumbering member of the Ultaarian Greenback species who wielded poisonous dagger thorns. Although Solo's power mace appeared unable to harm the large opponent, the Human tripped the four-armed combatant with the energy shield, causing the hulking gladiator to fall upon a dagger thorn and die."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A power mace appears in a February 1979 issue of Marvel Comics' Star Wars comic book, Star Wars 20.
