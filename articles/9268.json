She even blamed Obi-Wan Kenobi for her failure and made it an obsession to hunt and kill him. Soon after her first encounter on the moon Ohma-D'un, she hunted him on missions on Christophsis, Teth, and Ord Cestus, but never gained the chance to defeat him. In addition, during her struggles with Kenobi, she was also confronted with Kenobi's apprentice Anakin Skywalker, who also defeated her several times, being seriously injured in a duel on Yavin IV.

However, further attempts to kill Dooku failed and Ventress was forced to retreat back to her homeworld to recover and join the Nightsisters.

In order to ensure her clan's safety, Mother Talzin arranged for Asajj's mother to give her up to Hal'Sted, who took her away from Dathomir to be raised as a slave on the planet Rattatak.

As she grieved over her loss, Asajj would have most likely died if it weren't for the arrival of a Jedi Knight named Ky Narec, who had been stranded on Rattatak after his starship crashed. Just when he was ambushed by a Weequay raider, Asajj used the Force to throw the raider into the air.

He traveled to Rattatak, where he was met by a waiting humanoid co-conspirator. As he sat beside the Count in a nearby observation chamber, this robed individual was silently and swiftly dispatched by a dark, cloaked figure who then took his seat. Dooku noted the presence of the killer, but initially voiced doubt about her combat abilities\u2014until Ventress threw herself into a gladiatorial pit fight in the Cauldron and easily annihilated such foes as Blorga, Grunda Dolma, Nilo, L8-L9, Flalios, Jasper McKnives, Krutch, Anchor Blue, Swyy'm-Ee, and finally Giant Flog."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku applauded Ventress's talents, but she then went too far by declaring herself a Sith, and claimed that Dooku knew nothing of the dark side.

Ventress woke up and found Fay laying beaten to the ground nearby, calling out to Kenobi. Fay, a Jedi Master, possibly had made the gravest mistake in her life by not carrying a lightsaber with her. She realized this too late; Ventress seized her chance and stabbed Fay in the back with both of her lightsabers, mortally wounding her. As Fay lay dying, Ventress saw Kenobi hanging on a cliff face. She offered for him to join the Separatists, but he refused. Disappointed, she vowed to kill him at their next meeting, even though Dooku had forbidden her from doing so, and left him to die.

She found the Jedi Master hiding behind his wrecked fighter, approached it, and placed her lightsabers in the position that would have been the killing blow. However, Jeht had heard the lightsabers' activation and dodged the blades as they cut through the starfighter's metal plating. Ventress smiled and mockingly asked if Jeht was too exhausted to flee; Jeht took out his violet lightsaber and responded in kind that he wasn't. He used the Force to envelop Ventress in the swamp, giving him time to run. The Dathomirian was clearly angry, but hardly impressed by Jett's feat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Escaping from the muck, Ventress chased the tired Jeht and cut a tree, sending it down at him. Jeht managed to avoid being crushed in time. Ventress leaped onto the tree to face Jeht and taunted him on how the Jedi were falling because of their dwindling skill. Jett was already verging on the dark side, but that cutting remark had pushed him over the edge. He Force Gripped the tree Ventress was standing on and hurled it away, causing her to jump free.

Igniting one of her lightsabers, Ventress feigned a decapitation stroke for Jeht to dodge, then lit her other weapon to stab him in the chest and side, penetrating the Jedi's ribs and lungs. In response, an angered Jeht used the Force to push Ventress away and send more mud onto her, before pulling his enemy's lightsaber from his chest. The Jedi levitated and brought a Force storm to bear on Ventress before she could escape. The Dathomirian was pinned to a tree and could only writhe in agony as she was shocked by the lightning.

She demonstrated her skills to Count Dooku during his visit to Rattatak, viciously killing off the competitors in the Cauldron in a furious display of bladework and raw power in the Force. During her subsequent duel with the Count, she fell on him in a blind fury, but was nonetheless defeated. However, she did impress the Count and his Sith Master, Darth Sidious, with her skills.

Eventually, her prowess as a duelist allowed her to hold her own against up to three adversaries with little difficulty, as she demonstrated during her mission to Ruul.

However, she eventually developed the physical strength necessary to compensate for these weaknesses, demonstrating the ability to hold up simultaneous bladelocks with multiple duelists at a time. Even so, her technique still was not without its flaws; notably her usage of Makashi was criticized by Luminara Unduli as being \"unrefined,\" \"amateurish,\" and \"sloppy.\" Ventress had also used to be heavily reliant on her second blade, and was left at a disadvantage if deprived of it.

She was able to easily command a Rancor in her and Tol Skorr's hunt for Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos, which would have been natural for a Nightsister.
