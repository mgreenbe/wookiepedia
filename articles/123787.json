When the Roshu Sune, a militant splinter branch of the Gotal Assembly for Separation, hijacked a commuter hopper in the Atzerri spaceport of Skreeka, Loset and the Commune hoped to resolve the crisis independently of foreign aid and asked the peace-keeping Jedi Order not to interfere in the matter. A Jedi task force was dispatched to Atzerri by the Jedi Council anyway, and their ensuing confrontation with the Roshu Sune saw two Jedi, twelve hostages, and all of the guerrillas lose their lives. Loset later spoke to reporters from HoloNet News and criticized the Jedi Order for interfering in Gotal affairs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Loset was confident in the ability of the Gotal Foreign Affairs Commune to resolve the hostage standoff with minimal bloodshed, and believed that the crisis was an issue that should have been left to Gotals to handle.
