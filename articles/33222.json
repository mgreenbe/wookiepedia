During the Battle of Kelrodo-Ai in the Western Reaches Operation of the Reconquest of the Rim, Dagger Flight was led by Starks, and co-winged by Dibs and Rocket by the time of the initial attempt at infiltrating the shaft leading to the Citadel of Axes' shields' hypermatter reactor. After the initial failed first attempt at infiltrating the shaft, resulting in the deaths of Scimitar Flight, the second attempt had Dibs and Rocket continuing to operate under Dagger Flight while Starks worked with Blade Flight in the infiltration attempt, with Dagger Flight also being tasked to hold off Separatist forces above until the reactor is destroyed by Blade Flight. All members survived the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
