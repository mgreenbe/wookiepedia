The capital of the heavily-industrialized Humbarine sector, the planet Humbarine was a promising hub of commerce as early as 25,000 BBY, when it became a founding member of the Galactic Republic. Prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, the world was largely unaffected by galactic conflicts but nonetheless possessed a sector fleet of large warships for defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When war broke out between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Humbarine was left vulnerable to Separatist attack, its defenses having been co-opted for use by the Republic Navy. The world was targeted by the Confederacy multiple times during the conflict, but it was the last of these attacks that proved most disastrous for Humbarine. As part of a campaign that targeted twenty-six Republic worlds in 20 BBY, Separatist General Grievous's attack on Humbarine culminated in an hour-long orbital bombardment that reduced the city-planet to slag and left the world\u2014now abandoned as a lost cause by the Republic\u2014uninhabitable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the depopulation and destruction, Humbarine was eventually resettled by the Galactic Empire at some point following the end of the Clone Wars. In the aftermath of the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the planet became one of numerous Imperial fortress worlds spread across the Empire's shrinking territory. By 25 ABY, Humbarine possessed a population of ten to 100 million sentient beings, and largely managed to stay out of further galactic affairs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Humbarine, its surface covered by a world-spanning city, was a Core World that served as the capital of the heavily industrialized Humbarine sector, a sterile region of manufacturing worlds dubbed the Humbarine Rule. The sector capital, located in the eponymous Humbarine system, was situated on the Trellen Trade Route in the area of galactic space known as the Arrowhead. The Trellen Trade Route linked Humbarine to the planet Trellen in the galactic east, and to Commenor, a onetime colony of Humbarine, in the galactic west."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 26,000 BBY, Humbarine had been discovered and colonized by the crew of a Human sleeper ship originating from the Core World Kuat. Over time, Humbarine, capital of the manufacturing worlds collectively known as the Humbarine Rule, established itself as a promising commerce hub. The planet became a founding member of the Galactic Republic in 25,000 BBY and, along with many other prominent Core Worlds, eventually sent colony ships of its own into the region known as the Slice. Among the worlds colonized by Humbarine natives were Balmorra and Commenor; as a result of exceedingly slow travel and communications speeds, these planets later declared their independence from Humbarine. During the Tionese War, Humbarine shipyards manufactured warships for use in the Republic's counterattack against the Honorable Union of Desevro & Tion. Several millennia before the Battle of Yavin, the Humbarine Housekeepers HoloBook was published, and many of its recipes were pre-programmed into the COO cook droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3996 BBY, during the Great Sith War, the Republic Swift Fleet was launched near Humbarine and went through the system before dealing blows to the Brotherhood of the Sith at Onderon, and to the Krath at Ko Vari. However, Humbarine was largely unaffected by this conflict and many subsequent galactic wars. Regardless, in the centuries leading up to the Clone Wars, the world and its surrounding sector were protected by large warships possessing limited hyperdrive ranges."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the Clone Wars broke out between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Humbarine sector's local defense forces soon fell under the jurisdiction of the Republic's war council, and the sector's fleet was organized to work in conjunction with the Republic military. As the war progressed, the Humbarine sector was repeatedly targeted by the Confederacy; while many worlds sided with the Separatists, others were simply conquered. Several attacks were made on Humbarine itself. As a result of the Separatists' advance in the sector, many beings in the Republic considered the planet to be a lost cause, and the sector's representative in the Galactic Senate, Humbarine native Bana Breemu, began to lose her political influence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the war progressed, Humbarine lacked the necessary resources to defend itself against further Separatist attacks and, in 20 BBY, became one of twenty-six Republic worlds targeted by the Separatist General Grievous. Leading the attack from his flagship, the Invisible Hand, the cyborg general oversaw an hour-long orbital bombardment of Humbarine that culminated in the planet's devastation. Its crust reduced to slag, Humbarine was rendered uninhabitable, a large portion of its population killed in the attack. The planet was subsequently abandoned by the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the devastation, Humbarine was eventually resettled by the Republic's successor, the Galactic Empire. Following the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Humbarine became an Imperial fortress world, remaining as such until at least 7 ABY. By 25 ABY, the world had recovered and boasted a population of 10 to 100 million sentients. Some years later, several New Republic fleets passed by Humbarine during the Yuuzhan Vong War, although the planet was never involved in the fighting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Humbarine's inhabitants were known as Humbariners. Senator Bana Breemu, a native of Humbarine, represented the sector in the Galactic Senate during the Clone Wars. When the Separatists succeeded in capturing many worlds in the sector, Breemu lost her political influence. Lieutenant Barrow Oicunn, also from the planet, served in the Humbarine sector defense forces during the Clone Wars but was later transferred to the Coruscant Home Fleet following the devastation of his homeworld and the death of his family. Declared a \"hero of Humbarine\" by Senator Breemu, Oicunn later served as an admiral in the Imperial Navy. Jonmor Tinto worked as an accountant at a Humbarine bank before being imprisoned by the Republic for embezzlement; though Tinto was released from prison, he became the target of bounty hunters hired by a Humbarine industrialist, to whom Tinto was in debt. The Trandoshan hunter Cradossk eventually captured Tinto on the moon Nar Shaddaa and claimed the bounty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Grievous's bombardment of the world, Humbarine was left uninhabited.
