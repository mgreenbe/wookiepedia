Prior to the Clone Wars, the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus hired Fett to serve as the genetic foundation of an army secretly bred on the extragalactic world of Kamino. His DNA spawned millions of clone troopers who shared his face, voice, and were trained to become soldiers. As part of his payment, Fett was given an unaltered clone whom he raised as his son, Boba Fett. In the last days of the Separatist Crisis, Fett was involved in the failed plot to assassinate Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala on Coruscant.

His legacy survived not only through the millions of clone troopers that formed the backbone of the Republic Military, but also Boba, who became a bounty hunter like his father before him.

Though he told others he came from this Mandalorian world, his exact history remained unknown, much to Fett's enjoyment. At some point, he was taught by a mentor and became a Mandalorian foundling, participating in the Mandalorian Civil Wars. Given his own set of Mandalorian armor, Fett served as a Mandalorian commando but eventually pursued a career as a bounty hunter. Although he retained his Mandalorian armor, Prime Minister Almec of the New Mandalorians disavowed any connection to Fett, claiming that he was simply a bounty hunter who had somehow stolen an artifact from Mandalore's troubled past."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fett rose to the top of the bounty hunting trade, where he used his advanced armor and twin blaster pistols to hunt down fugitives.

Cad Bane, a Duros who was a major bounty hunter by the time of the Clone Wars, came to owe Fett several favors that he never payed off.

Fett agreed and, in addition to his fee of twenty million credits, also requested an unaltered clone for himself, one who was not subjected to the typical growth acceleration and behavioral modifications given to the clone troopers. Fett raised this clone as his son, whom he named Boba Fett, and remained on Kamino to supervise the flash-training of the clone troopers. The only other known clone who was effectively an unaltered copy of Fett was an enhanced female clone named Omega. The Kaminoans did not question Tyranus' decision for the clone template, given that Fett was known as the best bounty hunter in the galaxy at the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All of the training programs that his clones went through were designed with input from Fett. Despite providing the genetic template for and overseeing the training of the clones, Fett felt no particular pride in them and viewed them as the Kaminoans' achievement. By tampering with Fett's genetic samples, the Kaminoans ensured that his clones aged twice as fast while possessing less independence than their donor. Aside from these modifications to their genetic structure, the clones were otherwise physically identical to Fett. The first battalions consisted of two-hundred thousand units; in time Fett's clones numbered in the millions. Notwithstanding Fett's view of his clones as cannon fodder, Taun We and Prime Minister Lama Su considered them magnificent, calling them one of the finest armies ever grown on Kamino."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Training Boba Fett"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fett continued to take jobs as a bounty hunter, which spread confusion throughout the bounty hunting community, as rumors had spread that Fett had a job with a mysterious client.

Tiver pinned Boba, commanding Fett to give them the Twi'lek girl and forfeit his share of the bounty or she would kill his son.

Boba, having hidden a small blaster on himself before the mission, killed both Tiver and Rinn before turning his blaster on Neelda. Boba asked Fett for guidance, and Fett told him that what happened to Neelda was his choice. Because Neelda had not aided Tiver and Rinn but also had not opposed them, Boba allowed Neelda to leave alive but without his share of the bounty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Fett and his son left Ord Mantell to collect their bounty, the two discussed how Boba had done on the mission.

Fett had subcontracted the Clawdite bounty hunter Zam Wesell to carry out these attempts. After Wesell failed to kill Amidala upon the Senator's arrival to Coruscant, Fett provided her with a pair of deadly kouhuns and tasked her to kill Amidala in her sleep. The plan was foiled by two Jedi that had been assigned to protect the Senator, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker. Wesell fled, but was apprehended by the Jedi after a lengthy pursuit throughout Coruscant.

There, the two met under civil circumstances at Fett's apartment in Tipoca City. Fett was questioned by Kenobi, who wished to know the details surrounding the creation of the clone army and Fett's knowledge of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. After speaking to Boba in Fett Code, the bounty hunter only told Kenobi that he had never heard of anyone named Sifo-Dyas, and that he was recruited by someone called Tyranus. After Kenobi left, Fett told Boba they were leaving. However, on the landing platform where Fett's ship, Slave I, was docked, they were ambushed by Kenobi. The two battled for a short time before Kenobi went over the edge of the landing platform, giving Fett an opportunity to escape. Fett was followed to the planet Geonosis by Kenobi, who had placed a homing beacon on Slave I's hull.

Fett protected Dooku during the skirmish, killing Jedi Master Coleman Trebor before joining the melee in the arena and attacking Windu. Fett tried to take Windu's lightsaber, but was run over by a stampeding reek. The reek charged at Fett a second time, who dispatched it with one shot. Fett was then rushed by Windu and began firing at the Jedi, who deflected the bounty hunter's shots. Fett attempted to use his jetpack to get away, but was unaware of the malfunction caused by the reek, and was subsequently killed by Windu, who first cut his blaster in half and then decapitated him, with his headless corpse falling to the ground seconds later.

He teamed up with Sing, the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk, and the Klatooinian bounty hunter Castas in order to avenge his father's death. Boba infiltrated Windu's Star Destroyer, the Endurance, above the world of Vanqor and sabotaged it, causing it to crash on the planet's surface. He then attached a bomb to Jango's helmet and placed it in the bridge of the Endurance for Windu, hoping that when Windu came looking for survivors he would be killed by the bomb.

Following the success of Order 66 and the Republic's transformation into the Galactic Empire, the remaining Fett clones became the first generation of Imperial stormtroopers. Subservient to the will of the new Galactic Emperor, they enforced the laws of the New Order and suppressed Sidious' enemies during the early days of the Imperial Era.

Boba used his father's name when he posed as a pit fighter on Nar Shaddaa, remembering holding Jango's empty helmet on Geonosis after his death before entering the pit. Shortly afterward, seeking to collect a bounty placed on Boba by crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, bounty hunters Zuckuss and 4-LOM placed a charge on the Slave I, creating a trap that slightly damaged the vessel.

Boba used Slave I to go to Tython in order to reclaim the armor from Djarin.

By the time of the Separatist Crisis, his face had several scars that he chose to conceal with a Mandalorian helmet. In combat, Fett favored the advantage of speed and height that his jetpack provided him with against his opponents.
