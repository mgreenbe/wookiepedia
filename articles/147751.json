Having a natural talent for starship engine maintenance, but not for people, Torque worked as a chief engineer on a Galactic Republic cruiser until he was convicted for battering his colleagues. After serving time, Torque left Republic space and eventually settled on Rishi, where he joined the Ravagers pirate gang. Becoming a chief engineer of the Soaring Duros, he preferred to work only with droids, such as BO-55, an Astromech droid that he retrofitted and reprogrammed into a killing machine. In 3637 BBY the Soaring Duros was docked in Coratanni Town when it was boarded by a group hired by the former Ravagers Captain Ruugar. Torque defended his engine room, but was eventually overwhelmed and killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chief Engineer Torque appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan expansion, released on December 2, 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
