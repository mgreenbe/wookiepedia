During the Clone Wars, the droid was obtained by Trandoshan scavenger Gha Nachkt, who was constantly scouring abandoned space battle zones for any material, from scraps to droids he could salvage and sell. Nachkt stored the droid with another sentinel droid he had found to a cargo hold of his GS-100 salvage ship, the Vulture's Claw. As the IG-86 sentinel droids were known to be higly unpredictable, the pair could have posed a threat to the Trandoshan's life. As such, Nachkt kept the assassin droids deactivated, although they were linked to the freighter's computer by electronic wires, so they could be manually activated at any time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, Nachkt was searching debris with his ship inside Golm's asteroid belt, where a battle between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems had took place, when the Vulture's Claw was boarded by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, his Padawan Ahsoka Tano and their astromech droid R3-S6. The Jedi were looking for R2-D2, Skywalker's original astromech droid who was lost during the battle. However, as R2-D2's memory banks contained secret Republic information, Nachkt, who had indeed found the droid, was planning to sell him to the Confederacy. To prevent the Jedi from finding R2-D2, the Trandoshan guided them away from the hiding place of the stolen droid, leading them to the cargo hold where his \"unique\" collector's items, the sentinel droids were kept."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Activated"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While exploring the hold, Skywalker ordered R3-S6 to access the freighter's computer and find the ship's inventory manifest. However, R3-S6, who was secretly a Confederate spy whose mission was to eliminate Skywalker, activated the two sentinel droids instead. Rising quietly, the assassin droid sneaked up on Tano, and grappled her from behind. Yelling in surprise, she alarmed Skywalker, who quickly ignited his lightsaber and sliced the droid's right hand off, after which he Force-pushed the droid against the other sentinel droid, and the pair violently collided with several crates. Tano ordered R3-S6 to deactivate the droids, but the pair recovered fast and pulled off the wires keeping them attached to the ship's controls. Now able to move freely, the assassins armed themselves with E-5 blaster rifles and opened fire on the Jedi, who deflected the shots with their lightsabers. The pair pressed the attack, jumping up onto shelves of the gargo hold, shooting relentlessly while moving around perpetually. However, Tano managed to deflect one of the shots back at the one-armed droid, who temporarily lost balance and fell down. Landing on their feet, the droid shoved a crate at the young Togruta, causing her to fall backward, and turned to execute Skywalker behind his back. Before the sentinel droid could pull the trigger, Tano stood up and slashed the droid in half, after which Skywalker destroyed the other assassin droid. After the fight, the Jedi left the ship without compensating Nachkt for the destroyed droids, much to the chagrin of the scavenger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Produced by Holowan Mechanicals, the IG-86 sentinel droid was part of the IG-series of combat droids, belonging to the droid model considered \"one of the most dangerous machine\" in the galaxy. While Tano doubted the droid's effectiveness, Skywalker knew that in battle, the droid was deadly; Nachkt believed that even a Jedi could not beat the droid pair without lightsaber. Strategic, logical and possessing an intelligent, independent mind, the droid was superior compared to the more common B1-Series battle droid of the B-series. When faced with risk of being deactivated, the droid responded by severing connection with the controls of the freighter. Cold and very unpredictable, the droid was hostile to every living being aboard the Vulture's Claw, and attacked Tano immediately upon activation. Even loss of an arm did not stop the relentless sentinel droid from attacking. The assassin was extremely agile, as evidenced when the droid jumped to the shelves and moved between them with great agility; even when the droid did lost balance, it fell in a controlled manner on their feet. While nearly invulnerable to the laser shots of an E-5 blaster rifle, the assassin was unprotected against a lightsaber, by which the droid was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
