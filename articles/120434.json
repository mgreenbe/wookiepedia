For over forty generations before him, his family had dutifully served the Royal House of Alderaan, and he was no exception to that tradition. He became both a senatorial aide and a bodyguard to Prince Consort Bail Prestor Organa, who represented the Alderaan sector in the Galactic Senate of the Republic. In order to become a crack shot with a hold-out blaster, Vestswe trained under Giles Durane, a good-hearted idealist who was known as the \"Weapons Master.\" Vestswe followed Senator Organa on the galactic capital of Coruscant during the Clone Wars, a three-year conflict that raged on from 22 to 19 BBY, under the rule of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the end of the Clone Wars, Palpatine let his true colors show.

Vestswe and the rest of Organa's aides accompanied the senator and his Jedi friends. After landing on Coruscant, the group encountered a Senate Guard who tried to take custody of the Jedi, which Master Kenobi prevented by using a mind trick on the weak-minded guard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vestswe was a fair-skinned man with blue eyes and brown hair.
