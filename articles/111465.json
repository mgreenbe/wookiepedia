Around 5 ABY, Chorda and eleven took part in a training exercise, led by Major Soran Keize in preparation for an attack on New Republic forces, with eleven other TIE pilots. Keize led the other twelve TIE fighters through the icy ring system of a moon and over to the Edict, the 204th's Imperial II-class Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the TIEs flew on an attack run across the Edict's hull and simulated strikes on the Star Destroyer's critical areas, each of the pilots then received from the major false sensor readings on their scanners to test their reactions. Chorda aligned perfectly with her flight leader, which admired Keize, who intended to pass on his observations to the pilot's squadron commander. The major then announced a new exercise, where the goal for Chorda and the other pilots was to eliminate him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ran Chorda appeared in a fighter in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
