It was crafted from the parts and components of a variety of scrapped fliers and was used in the acquisition and delivery of commodities on the planet of Saheelindeel. During a festival airshow, Han Solo was able to fly Skybarge through the same display as an X-222, flown by the stunt flier Grigmin. With Han's expert flying and a few near disasters, Skybarge went on to win the festival's first prize trophy for best exhibit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
