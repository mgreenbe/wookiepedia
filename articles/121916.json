The exact legal restrictions governing the operation of Sector Permits varied from region to region and while in some localities a Sector Permit by itself was all that was required in order to legally pursue bounties, in most areas a corresponding Target Permit was also required to be held by the bearer. Sector Permits cost between 1,000 and 10,000 a month, with the cost set by the sector government that issued the permit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
