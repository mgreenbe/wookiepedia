It was designed to be used alongside a restraint harness and crash balloons in order to prevent the pilot from being injured by hitting a hard surface during the sudden deceleration of a crash. Luke Skywalker once survived a crash on Myrkr without injury thanks to an emergency acceleration compensator in a Skipray owned by Talon Karrde."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is the Star Wars analogue to an inertia dampener, a common device in science fiction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
