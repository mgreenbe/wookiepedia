Dimel-class assault ship that was modified by the slavers Zlarb and Magg. Magg used his position as a Detached Duty agent in the Corporate Sector Authority to enable the theft of the Eye of Shiblizar before it could be destroyed in a Picket Fleet target practice session. Although Magg and Zlarb used the Eye of Shiblizar to carry slaves, they did not use it to make any direct deliveries, fearing that if the Authority identified it, their slaving operation would be severely compromised. They instead used the Eye of Shiblizar to hijack a vessel, transfer the slaves to it, and then use the hijacked vessel to deliver the slaves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
