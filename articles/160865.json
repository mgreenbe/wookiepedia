Later in the war, he was promoted to the rank of admiral and placed in command of the Conqueror, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer equipped with a superlaser. He encountered the Rebel Alliance's Renegade Squadron led by Col Serra when they infiltrated the Conqueror in the Mustafar system in 1 ABY. Strang and his storm commandos were defeated by the Renegades, who proceeded to place thermal detonators on ship's reactor core. The detonators were triggered and the ship was destroyed, but before the explosion an X4 Gunship was able to escape from the Conqueror.
