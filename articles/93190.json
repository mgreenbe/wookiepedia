Whilst on Hutta, he lived in the planet's swamps along with many other Evocii, but was selected by a Hutt crime lord named Suudaa Nem'ro to work for him in an administrative role at an Evocii work camp in the village of Voam, giving him the name Morsel. The Evocii at the work camp were kept in line by several non-Evocii enforcers working for Nem'ro. These men mocked Morsel and refused to follow his orders, making his job particularly difficult. Morsel then began seeking aid to help him intimidate the men so that they would listen to him. He found an Imperial-aligned individual in Nem'ro's Palace who was willing to help him and offered them a large amount of credits to scare the camp's chief enforcer. The individual obliged and warned the enforcer he would face Nem'ro's wrath if he continued to ignore Morsel. The enforcer, successfully intimidated, promised to obey Morsel. Happy with the individual's work, the Evocii paid them the agreed amount of credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morsel was a male Evocii who was alive during the Cold War. Morsel lived on the planet Nal Hutta, which had originally been controlled by his species, but had been adopted by the Hutt species as their homeworld after the destruction of the planet Varl. Morsel lived in the swamps on Nal Hutta, near an industrial town named Jiguuna, as did many of his species. The self-declared ruler of the town, a Hutt crime lord named Suudaa Nem'ro, made him an administrator of an Evocii work camp in the swamps, and giving him the name Morsel, complete with ceremony. Once Morsel began attempting to perform his duties, however, he discovered that the human enforcers who kept the Evocii workers in line mocked him, making fun of his name and ignoring his orders.

Morsel had no moral objections to intimidation, but he did not feel himself capable of intimidating the enforcers himself.

In the game, he appears on the planet Nal Hutta, where he is involved in the mission \"A Slight Lean\", in which he asks the player to intimidate an enforcer for him. Players may choose to threaten to kill the enforcer as a \"dark side\" option or be more diplomatic with the enforcer as a \"light side\" option. Both result in the enforcer agreeing to cease his taunting. This article assumes the player threatened to kill the enforcer, as only players of the Bounty Hunter or Imperial Agent classes, both assumed to always choose \"dark side\" options, can take on the missions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
