As a young man, he attended Prefsbelt Fleet Camp with dreams of becoming an Imperial pilot. At the academy, he made friends with Biggs Darklighter, who persuaded him to oppose the Galactic Empire as tyrannical. When he graduated from Prefsbelt, Klivian was commissioned as executive officer aboard the Rand Ecliptic. There, he led a cell of mutineers that took over the ship, and he defected to the burgeoning Alliance to Restore the Republic with Darklighter. Klivian was ill when his best friend died in the Battle of Yavin, but afterward was recruited by Darklighter's childhood friend Luke Skywalker to join Rogue Squadron. Klivian served with distinction, fighting in the battles of Hoth and Endor, and earned a reputation as a skilled, if crash-prone, pilot and a notorious skeptic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Rebel Alliance became the New Republic, Derek Klivian continued serving until Rogue Squadron was disbanded. He then served with his close friend Wes Janson as a training officer for some time before rejoining the recommissioned Rogue Squadron under his longtime comrade Wedge Antilles after temporarily serving as Rogue Leader himself during the period when Antilles resigned. There he served for a dozen more years, battling various warlords and threats to the New Republic and serving as a vital part of the four-pilot delegation that brought Adumar into the New Republic. In 19 ABY, once peace with the Imperial Remnant had been reached, Klivian retired after approximately twenty years of service to the New Republic and Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial days"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Derek Klivian was born on the prosperous Core World of Ralltiir and grew up under the rule of the Galactic Empire. Early in life, he acquired the nickname \"Hobbie\" and used it almost exclusively in place of his given name, Derek. An eager young man, Klivian applied to and was accepted by Prefsbelt Fleet Camp, an Imperial naval academy, seeking a glamorous and exciting life as a starfighter pilot. He was not a political supporter or opponent of the Galactic Empire; he merely wanted a career as a pilot. At Prefsbelt, he was instructed by Captain Soontir Fel, a highly skilled pilot. Klivian was comfortable with the highly-automated process of flying the TIE fighters, for which many maneuvers were preprogrammed. Despite this, neither he nor any of his classmates were ever able to beat Fel in the simulator, developing a healthy respect for their instructor in them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was classmates with Tycho Celchu and Biggs Darklighter, and befriended Darklighter. The pair joined a broader circle of friends who questioned the Empire, and Klivian began to boast idly with them of overthrowing the Empire, planning an idealistic campaign against an Empire he came to see as an oppressor. The group was far more talk than action, but an informant sold it out to the academy commander. All its members were rounded up, except for Darklighter and Klivian, who had missed the single meeting the informant had attended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Neither Klivian nor Darklighter were told what had happened, and initially assumed that some minor punishment had occurred or, as the group's absence grew longer, that they had been transferred elsewhere. As time wore on and the cadets were never seen again, Klivian slowly came to realize that the Empire had seized and possibly killed them for conspiracy against the government. Klivian's distaste for the Empire grew into hatred, and he began to seriously plan to defect to the Rebel Alliance that had begun to form and wage war against the Empire. With Darklighter and Klivian each having survived the roundup, and neither having attended the only meeting with the informant, Darklighter began to suspect Klivian of having sold out the circle of conspirators, and their friendship dissolved as Darklighter grew to despise Klivian as an Imperial spy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Klivian's class, graduating in 0 BBY, was known for exceptional performance. At their graduation ceremony, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin gave a speech praising the Empire and hinting vaguely at coming deployment of the nearly-completed Death Star. Through his own sources, Klivian knew some details of the project. When he passed his former friend's dormitory, he overheard Darklighter and his friends speculating on Tarkin's words, and confirmed that a planet-destroying space station named the Death Star was in the works. Subsequently Klivian was posted to the Class II Frigate Rand Ecliptic as the executive officer and second officer. Darklighter was the first officer, with Captain Heliesk commanding the ship. The pair served both as bridge officers and as leaders of the ship's TIE complement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Klivian arrived early aboard the Rand Ecliptic and met the gruff Heliesk. After Darklighter reported in and Heliesk dismissed the pair, Darklighter rounded on Klivian, accusing him of seeking Darklighter's position before storming off. The pair settled into the ship's patrol routine, and Klivian built up a cell of Rebel sympathizers aboard, planning to defect to the Rebel Alliance. Klivian had an old friend, Lindy, who had informed Klivian that he had joined the Rebellion and was stationed on Bestine IV. As the Rand Ecliptic had a stop scheduled at Bestine, Klivian planned to jump ship there and join the Rebel Alliance through Lindy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mutiny on the Rand Ecliptic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon putting in at Bestine, Heliesk ordered Klivian to go ashore and arrange for the delivery of the shipment of rubindum ore the Rand Ecliptic was carrying. Anxious over his plan, he was relieved that he had an excuse to leave the ship safely and quickly began searching for Lindy. They met up quickly, and Klivian was taken to Lindy's Rebel cell. There, he was told that they awaited only Lindy's contact, a man code-named \"Starfire\" who would help Klivian defect. To his horror, the meeting was interrupted by the arrival of Heliesk with a stormtrooper escort. Klivian suddenly understood his situation when Heliesk congratulated Klivian on having captured the Rebels and dropped the word \"starfire\" in his conversation. Klivian returned to the ship, where he met privately with Heliesk. The captain explained that he was a Rebel spy, and he could not risk his cover. He wanted the ore and the defectors to reach the Rebellion, however, and planned to have Klivian mutiny, taking control of the ship and providing him cover."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly thereafter, they challenged a ship which did not respond appropriately. Darklighter took the TIE pilots, including Klivian, to check out the ship, which replied that it was the Lark, transporting young students. However, as it lacked the proper authorization codes, its passengers were to be taken in for questioning. Klivian and the other pilots targeted its exhaust flanges, keeping it from running, but another pilot shot directly up the thruster nacelle, destroying the transport. Darklighter, furious at having his orders to disable disobeyed, ordered an immediate debriefing, but records were inconclusive; the perpetrator could not be found, and Heliesk dismissed the incident as irrelevant. Klivian had seen that Tars Nandy, one of his Prefsbelt classmates, had fired the shot, but with Heliesk unconcerned and no desire to be suspected of Rebel sympathies, he felt it wise to remain silent on the matter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterward, Klivian passed by Darklighter in a corridor and noticed him reaching for the bulkhead. He continued on, but waited and returned, listening outside as Darklighter planned a defection with a group of Rebel comrades inside a hidden compartment. They noticed Klivian outside the concealed entrance and took him by surprise. Darklighter planned to kill Klivian before he could inform, and would not listen to Klivian's attempts to explain his own Rebel agenda. Klivian was forced to detonate a concussion grenade, allowing him to flee. Darklighter and his comrades put their escape plan into action swiftly, fleeing the Rand Ecliptic in their TIEs after disrupting several of the ship's systems to cover their escape. Klivian felt that his own hand had been forced, and mobilized his Rebel cell. Klivian led the mutiny, during which two additional Rebel cells surfaced to supplement Klivian's and Lindy's Rebels. They aided him in capturing Heliesk, whose identity as a spy was not given away, and the Rand Ecliptic's bridge. With control of the bridge, Klivian threatened to arm the ship's self-destruct, forcing the Imperial loyalists aboard to flee. He let them go with the exception of Nandy, avenging the destruction of the Lark. During the battle to take control of the ship, Klivian lost his left arm just above the elbow and suffered facial wounds, but received medical treatment for both injuries. Later statements by Darklighter implied that Klivian sustained damage to his genitalia as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Darklighter and his companions returned to the ship, running low on supplies. They had planned to fight their way to the storage lockers, but Klivian warmly welcomed them and reconciled with Darklighter. Darklighter declined to use his higher Imperial rank to take command, telling Klivian he had earned the right to serve as the Rand Ecliptic's captain. The ship had only a skeleton crew of Rebels, and on being pursued by a complement of TIEs from Bestine, Darklighter had the idea to dump half the ore load in the fighters' path rather than attempting to battle, destroying enough of them to buy time to escape into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rebel pilot"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They joined the Alliance Starfighter Corps, and Klivian had his arm replaced with a prosthetic. Klivian, Darklighter, and several of their fellow defectors, dubbed the Ecliptic Evaders, were stationed on Yavin 4 as part of Red Squadron. While Darklighter had earlier deferred to Klivian, he outranked Klivian within the Alliance. They were soon involved in General Jan Dodonna's plan to capture several T-65 X-wing starfighters. The Rand Ecliptic pilots, in their TIEs\u2014which had been modified to carry hyperdrives\u2014would enter the system, draw off the defending forces, and sacrifice their TIEs in a move that would allow the Rebellion to fly away a large supply of X-wings from Incom's factory. Klivian arrived over the world, strafed the Incom facility, and fled as they were chased off by the defensive complement of TIE fighters. Once they had drawn the enemy far enough, they ejected and turned control of their ships over to droid pilots. Klivian ejected safely but was clipped by a pursuing TIE and had his lower right leg sheared off. His flight suit sealed the wound, and the TIEs failed to detect the black-suited pilots hanging in space. They were recovered by an Alliance shuttle, and Klivian accepted a quick bandaging before insisting on being allowed to fly one of the X-wings out, pilots being in short supply."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On his return to Yavin 4, he was taken in for medical care, but a serious infection developed at the site of the wound, causing raised, ropy growths on his skin. A creeping malady of suspected native origin, it could not be treated by the base's medics, and Klivian was disqualified from flight duty and kept in the infirmary. Darklighter visited him frequently, keeping him informed of the squadron's doings. The infection progressed, however, eventually consuming Klivian's entire body in the growths. The medics despaired of his life, but Doctor Shae Polikex, recalling that a plant extract had saved an earlier survey team that fell victim to the same illness, took Darklighter and the Rebel-allied smuggler Nera Dantels into the jungle to try to identify the proper plant. They were successful, and Polikex administered the antidote. As it took effect, Klivian lay unconscious through the Battle of Yavin. The Death Star had tracked the Rebellion to Yavin 4, and the rest of Red Squadron flew against it. New addition Luke Skywalker took Klivian's spot in Red Squadron\u2014only Wedge Antilles and Skywalker survived, with Skywalker destroying the superweapon in a massive Rebel victory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Klivian awoke after the battle, seeking Darklighter, and was crushed to be informed that the man to whom he owed his life had given his own life to allow Skywalker to make the killing shot. The man who told him was Skywalker, who had been Darklighter's lifelong friend. The two shared reminiscences of the pilot and bonded over their affection for their departed mutual friend. Once Klivian was able to move from his sickbed, he visited Darklighter's memorial with Dantels, who had developed feelings for Darklighter. With the infection beaten, Klivian had his leg replaced."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rogue"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon his recovery, Klivian was assigned to the Sullust system, smuggling weapons for the Rebellion. His gunrunning days did not last long, as he was chosen for Rogue Squadron by Skywalker and Antilles, who were reviving the Red Squadron spirit in their new fighter group and wanted Klivian involved. Antilles had seen great promise in Klivian during his time in Red Squadron and quickly recruited him. Klivian quickly developed a joking reputation for enjoying bacta due to his numerous crashes and injuries, but his flying and tactical skills won him his fellow pilots' respect. Klivian also became known as the group's skeptic due to his dour personality, but that did not keep him from making fast friends with Skywalker, Antilles, his former classmate Celchu, and Wes Janson."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seven months after the Battle of Yavin, Klivian and Antilles were assigned to escort Skywalker, Leia Organa, Dantels, and a diplomatic party to Jabiim to attempt to enlist the Loyalist faction. Klivian and Antilles remained in orbit while the others landed, but Klivian was dissatisfied with the arrangement; he would have preferred a stronger force and was worried for the delegation's safety. Shortly after arriving, however, the Jabiimi ordered them to leave orbit. As they had no orbital weaponry to bring against the pilots, however, Klivian ignored them and attempted to think of ways to rescue the diplomats, who he suspected were in trouble. Their planning was halted when they came under attack by TIE fighters fielded by the Nationalist faction, and Klivian and Antilles were forced to flee through the debris field surrounding the planet. Upon detecting Star Destroyers and slave ships in orbit, they decided they had to descend to the surface and rescue Skywalker and Organa. They arrived just in time to help cover the escape of Dantels's Starduster from Imperial forces, then retrieved Skywalker. They fled as the Star Destroyers began bombarding the planet, with Klivian and Antilles drawing fire to allow the group to escape to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Imperial ace Kasan Moor defected to Rogue Squadron at Gerrard V, she brought with her knowledge of Imperial bases. The Rogues struck at the Imperial Enclave on Kile II, flying Y-wings rather than their customary X-wings for the mission. Klivian watched in horror as Antilles was shot down, but confirmed that he had landed safely. The Rogues could not recover the downed pilot before they had to retreat, and Antilles was captured. Klivian participated in the rescue of Antilles from a prison hovertrain on Kessel, using scanning equipment to confirm his friend's presence before halting the train. They then went on to free several more Rebel prisoners from incarceration on Kessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That mission was followed by a campaign against ambitious Moff Kohl Seerdon, who sought to seize control of Thyferra. The Rogues executed several hit-and-run strikes against Seerdon's assets before blunting the Moff's attack on Chandrila and striking at a Sullust base in retaliation. When Seerdon took over Thyferra, Klivian and the Rogues drove off his forces while Skywalker shot down the Moff's shuttle, killing him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Battle of Hoth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Klivian also proved vital during several evacuations of the constantly-shifting Rebel secret base, frequently covering the Rebels' escape. By 3 ABY, the Rebel base was located on the inhospitable ice world of Hoth. There, Klivian was stationed with the rest of the Rogues, flying as Rogue Four. Not long after it was established, the base was discovered by an Imperial probe droid, and the Alliance began an evacuation. Before it could be carried out, however, Darth Vader's Death Squadron arrived in the system and began landing forces to bring down the theater shield that protected Echo Base on Hoth. Klivian was among the pilots who attended a briefing by Leia Organa explaining the new evacuation plan, which would see two fighters escort each transport away from the base. Klivian was dubious of the effectiveness of such a weak guard against the Imperial armada, but Organa assured him that the base's v-150 Planet Defender ion cannon would provide enough cover for the escape, leaving Klivian slightly less skeptical."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Rogue Squadron first had to deal with the approaching Imperial All Terrain Armored Transports targeting the shield generator. Klivian flew as Skywalker's wingman in one of the cold-adapted T-47 airspeeders, making a handful of passes against the massive walkers before Skywalker determined the combat airspeeders' blasters were not strong enough to bring down the AT-ATs. Instead, he turned to the tactic of using the airspeeders' tow cables to entangle the walkers' legs and trip them. Klivian accompanied Skywalker on the first attack run, in which Skywalker's gunner, Dak Ralter, was killed, and was on Skywalker's wing when Rogue Two, Zev Senesca, was killed and Skywalker shot down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Klivian was subsequently injured by fire from one of the walkers, as was his gunner, Kesin Ommis. Deciding that his damaged craft and his damaged body could not make it back to the evacuation point, he resolved to ram the lead walker. He flew his speeder directly into the command cabin of General Maximilian Veers's Blizzard 1, bringing down the walker immediately after it had destroyed the shield generator. Klivian and Ommis ejected in time to survive the crash, and were able, despite Klivian's earlier predictions, to make it back to the evacuation staging point."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From there, Klivian piloted a Y-wing with Wes Janson as his gunner and Antilles as his wingman, escorting one of the last transports from the base. An Imperial Star Destroyer blocked their escape route, and with the ion cannon destroyed, they lacked cover fire. Klivian was surprised when Antilles ordered the transport to hang back and pulled in uncomfortably close behind Klivian's fighter. Klivian was briefly confused before realizing Antilles intended to pull off a Tallon split, a chancy maneuver rarely used in combat. Klivian's craft masked Antilles's sensor signature, allowing the other pilot to dart out from behind and disable the Star Destroyer's targeting sensors with a lucky shot. The two fighters and the transport escaped, making their way to the Rebel fleet's rendezvous point. There, Klivian received bacta treatment for his injuries and fully recovered; Ommis survived the battle as well."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Victory at Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance later learned that prisoners from Hoth were being held on an orbital platform over Bakura. Klivian was one of the pilots who flew to rescue them. Shot down, he landed on the planet and had to be rescued by Antilles. When an unidentified Imperial ship made off with some of the Rebels, however, the rescue force pursued it to Geonosis and effected a recovery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Han Solo had been captured by the Empire, frozen in carbonite, and turned over to bounty hunter Boba Fett. Skywalker departed the squadron to track down and free his friend. When he had traced Fett to Gall, he called in the Rogues to help him in the extraction. They set up a temporary base on nearby Kile and reconnoitered the area before Skywalker and his allies arrived and decided that Skywalker and the Rogues would draw off the Gall's defenses, allowing Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca to find Fett's docked Slave I. While the Rogues made their distraction, Fett evaded the Millennium Falcon, leaving the mission a failure. When Prince Xizor of Black Sun captured Princess Leia Organa not long thereafter, Skywalker went to Coruscant to rescue her with Dash Rendar and Calrissian. During their escape, Rendar sent a distress signal to the Rogues that summoned them to a dogfight with Xizor's private navy over the Empire's capital. With the cover of the Rogues and the opportune intervention of Darth Vader's forces against his longtime rival Xizor, the Rebels were able to flee."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, when the Alliance learned that the Empire had built a second Death Star, Rogue Squadron was among the units tasked with destroying the battle station. At the briefing, Klivian provided his usual skepticism, suggesting that the narrow channels through the under-construction Death Star appeared too tight to allow the fighters reasonable passage. Flying as Red Four, Klivian did his part in the Battle of Endor, which saw the Alliance Fleet break the trap sprung on it by the Empire and destroy the Star Dreadnought Executor. Klivian's fears proved unfounded as Antilles and Calrissian made their way through the Death Star to its main reactor and destroyed it, with Darth Vader and Galactic Emperor Palpatine aboard. Klivian later had a Death Star II kill silhouette painted on his fighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the battle, the Rebel forces received a message intended for Palpatine informing him that the planet Bakura was under attack by invading aliens. Rogue Squadron, Klivian among them, was sent to Bakura to aid the Imperial world and possibly recruit it as part of a task force under Skywalker and Solo. When they arrived, they found the aliens engaged in a fierce battle with the Bakuran Imperial forces. Klivian and the Rogues pressed the attack, driving the invaders off. Skywalker, Solo, and Leia Organa were able to negotiate a truce with the Imperials and learned that the attackers were Ssi-ruuk from the Unknown Regions. Eventually, the Ssi-ruuk attacked once more and Klivian flew against them, but during the battle the Imperial forces turned on the Rebels, destroying their flagship carrier Flurry. An uprising on Bakura removed Imperial governor Wilek Nereus from power, however, allowing Commander Pter Thanas to surrender the Imperial forces to the Rebels once the Ssi-ruuk were defeated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterward, the Rogues captured Grand Moff Nivers at Tandankin after disabling the forces with which he intended to subjugate the planet. Leadership of the squadron then passed permanently from Skywalker to Antilles. Klivian, a lieutenant, was left one of the unit's most senior pilots; along with Antilles, Celchu, and Janson, he was one of only four Rogues who had served with the unit before Endor. Klivian's reputation for frequent crashes had spread widely, with yet more accidents costing him his left leg, and his friends joked about his supposed affection for bacta treatments. In fact, his crash-prone reputation was so widespread that Bulior Repulsor Systems contacted him seeking his endorsement of the crash-repulsor cribs the company manufactured for New Republic fighters, and by 13 ABY, bacta manufacturers had offered him advertising deals. Building on his reputed tendency to be shot down, various accounts of his death circulated through the ranks, quickly becoming service legends."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Mrlsst"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Approximately one month after Endor, the Rogues were assigned to protect a food convoy from Cilpar to Mrlsst. On arriving at Cilpar, however, they failed to meet up with their contact, found no convoy, and came under Imperial attack. They fought through the ambush and put down in a cave base, but were quickly seized by the local resistance movement led by Elscol Loro, which opposed both the Empire and the forces of the Rebellion. They were taken into the town, where the group was ambushed by the local Moff, Boren Tascl. The Rogues retreated with Loro's group into the jungle, where they took shelter in an old temple. They were followed and surrounded, however, but Antilles, had Klivian and new pilot Plourr Ilo fire on a heap of rubbish, igniting the built-up methane and eliminating an enemy walker. Antilles was able to call in the X-wings via their astromechs, driving off the Imperial forces. They returned to the Rogue base, where Antilles was able to convince Loro to work with them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Loro took the group to a Rebel supply depot, but they again came under attack by the Imperials and again escaped to the hidden Rogue base. Antilles prepared a strike on the Imperial base, while Loro led a commando mission to rescue Leia Organa after one of Loro's fighters, Vance Rego, reported that Organa was on-planet and had been captured by the Empire. The attack was successful, and the woman was freed\u2014but she proved to be Winter, Organa's aide and double, who had been their intended contact on Cilpar. With Cilpar's Imperial presence decimated, Loro was convinced to trust the pilots of the fledgling New Republic, joining Rogue Squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rogues collected the convoy they had originally arrived to escort and moved on to Mrlsst, over which they again faced an attack by Imperial forces, including an Interdictor Star Destroyer. Klivian helped cover Antilles as the squadron leader and Loro bombarded the Interdictor with proton torpedoes, driving it off and allowing the convoy to land in safety. Antilles then engaged in the second purpose of the squadron's visit, negotiating for the secrets of the Mrlsst Academy's Phantom Project, an advanced cloaking device. After being introduced to Antilles's old friend, Mirax Terrik, who was on-world, Klivian, Celchu, Ilo, and Dllr Nep looked for entertainment on the campus while Antilles spent time with her. Those two met the others at The Soundmound, a musical venue, where Celchu caught up with the group after having departed to confront the Ante-Endor Association's membership, an Imperialist group that gave public speeches denying the truth of the Battle of Endor. Celchu had been beaten by them, but was rescued by a mysterious Jedi ghost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next day, Terrik and all the squadron members but Antilles went to see Janson, who had broken his leg on Cilpar and was in a Mrlssti hospital. While there, they received warning from Koyi Komad, a student who had befriended the Rogues the previous night, that they were to be arrested, as a doctored hologram had implicated Celchu in the theft of the Phantom Project plans; Antilles had already been imprisoned. Stormtroopers were hot on Komad's heels, and the Rogues had to fight their way out of the hospital. After exiting, Klivian ascended with the others to the top levels of the hospital's greenstalk forests, where the fugitives found refuge with the fringe communities existing in the vegetation. A slicer among them was able to show that the recording was faked, and found evidence that Professor Rorax Falken's students had stolen the datacards away from the original thieves, the members of the Ante-Endor Association."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Celchu, the squadron's second in command, sent several others to recover the datacards from Falken while he, Klivian, Janson, and Ilo attempted to free their leader. That proved unnecessary when they found Antilles walking out of the detention center, freed by the ghost Jedi. Antilles explained, on their way to the spaceport, that the Phantom Project had been a fake, designed to draw money from the Empire. On reaching the spaceport, they found Loro knocked out on the orders of the Ghost Jedi and received word that Falken's asteroid laboratory had been destroyed. They were kept too busy to deal with that, however, by the arrival of Imperial bombers. Klivian scrambled to his X-wing with the other Rogues, shooting down TIEs over Mrlsst.

At a cantina, Ilo was picked on by a pair of patrons and began a brawl; on leaving it, they were approached by a Devaronian who tried to hire them to replace the henchmen they had just beaten.

His dreams of an ideal life faded away after he met Biggs Darklighter, who convinced him that the Empire was worth overthrowing. The loss of his friends to the Imperial crackdown during his academy days turned him seriously against the Empire and hardened his attitude. No longer was he idealistic, instead becoming hardened and skeptical. He eagerly joined the Rebel Alliance and became driven to fight against the Empire. Darklighter's death, however, made him even more cynical and cautious. Though he let no one know, Klivian was privately extremely worried for the safety of his fellow pilots during missions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the Rogues, Klivian was known as the skeptic of the squadron, a pessimist with a dour outlook and a mastery of all manner of profanity, obscenity, and vulgarity. He was not quick to embrace new ideas, but obeyed orders faithfully nevertheless. He focused on defense and caution, traits that arose from his reaction to his friends' betrayal at Prefsbelt. Klivian considered himself merely a realist, avoiding being carried away with optimism; his life experiences left prone to believing that his luck was of the rotten sort. Klivian was extremely humble and quiet, only speaking when he felt he had something of importance to impart. Klivian could be highly sarcastic, but maintained a good sense of humor; he was a frequent partner in Janson's jokes and eagerly poked fun at his squadron-mates and himself. Janson's sense of humor could wear on him at times, however."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a young man, Klivian was highly interested in impressing women. While he became more dour, he remained highly interested in women, maintaining an attraction to actress Wynssa Starflare, frequently flirting with women he came across, and, while under the influence of Malrev IV's Sith magic, sleeping with a Bothan female. However, even under normal circumstances, Klivian did not object to the idea of relations with a Bothan. Klivian was not known to have a long-term girlfriend and, as of 13 ABY, considered himself to have had no successful relationships with women; by 19 ABY he appeared committed to what he called \"the solitary path.\" Outside the bounds of romantic relationships, Klivian was willing to engage prostitutes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Derek Klivian was portrayed by Richard Oldfield in The Empire Strikes Back, in which the character originated, though he first appeared in the novelization of the film, which was published before the film's release.

This scene was based on one present in the original script, but absent in the final cut of the movie, in which Veers survives at least long enough to destroy the shield generator. Despite the scene's use in the novel, it was disregarded by Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back, which established both Klivian and Veers as surviving and made no mention of the crash. Later sources, however, have reconciled both accounts by having Klivian crash his snowspeeder into the walker after Veers fires, but survive after copious bacta treatment. Veers survives but receives crippling injuries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars: Empire: Darklighter offers a depiction of the Rand Ecliptic mutiny that conflicts with the story previously given in Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back, though no details about Klivian come into outright opposition.
