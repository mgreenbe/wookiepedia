After locating a second derelict vessel, Thrawn located the vessels' origin in the Rapacc system. With the assistance of Admiral Ar'alani and the Vigilant, Thrawn managed to discreetly maneuver the heavy cruiser Springhawk into the system, boarding an abandoned mining station with the caregiver Mitth'ali'astov. The Nikardun, having noticed the Vigilant's intrusion, sent a group of subjugated Paccosh to board the station. Thrawn spoke with the Paccosh, learning the identity of the Nikardun and their leader, General Yiv. The Paccosh let Thrawn leave without reporting him to the Nikardun, allowing Thrawn to pursue further investigation into Nikardun activities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While aboard the asteroid mining station, Thrawn and Thalias met the Paccosh leader Uingali foar Marocsaa.
