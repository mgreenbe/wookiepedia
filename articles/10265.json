The battle took place some time between the years 26 ABY and 27 ABY and the Vong reached the system by traveling down the Gamor Run hyperlane from a previous battle in the Rorak system. After the attack, the Vong advanced down the Hollastin Run Hyperlane and attacked the Hollastin system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on the Circumtore system was first shown in The Essential Atlas, a reference book released in 2009 and written by Jason Fry and Daniel Wallace.
