After the Battle of Yavin, he was based on the Core Worlds planet Corellia and primary operated out of Tyrena's cantina."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 1 ABY, the smuggler Cal Handro, was shot down above Naboo\u2019s moon of Rori. The pilot was transporting a new kind of spice for the Rebel Alliance when he was attacked and crash-landed on the moon. The Alliance was very concerned about Handro's cargo and Veega Madish was ordered to lead an investigation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Veega Madish assembled a group of spacers on Corellia and sent them readily on Rori to search for Cal Handro. It appeared that the man had survived the crash but he had vanished in the wilderness. The spacers successfully localized the crash site of Cal Handro's ship, in the Madyn Plains of Rori, but did not find any trace of the smuggler, only Black Sun henchmen also looking for the missing pilot. The spacers managed to collect Handro's datapad and a sample of spice and brought it back to Veega Madish. The officer then requested the spacers to bring the spice to a medic, Doctor Edvar Vang, for analyze. In fact, Vang already knew the existence of that spice but he was too afraid to provide any information. He suggested the spacers to meet his friend Moxxar Krieg on Tatooine but the latter was found murdered at his place. In the meantime, spacers working for Tyla Jinn, one of Handro's friend, and for Imperial officer Jevan Monsul also searched for the missing pilot on Rori."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, a woman by the name Kaila Min, a regular at the Gambling Hall in Narmle, contacted Veega Madish and pretended she saw Cal Handro in the wilderness of Rori. The spacers rushed to the pilot's last known location, only to be attacked by Black Sun minions. From their attackers, they obtained the location of the Black Sun base on Rori. The spacers then raided the base but did not find Handro there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Veega Madish later learnt that Cal Handro had met the Bothan information broker Wire on Talus. The Bothan informed the spacers that the smuggler was wanted dead by Trussk, a slavemaster of the Blackscale Clan who considered that Handro was interfering in their business by shipping slaves for a rival Trandoshan clan. The spacers then assaulted Trussk's fortress on Naboo but, again, they did not find Handro."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, Cal Handro was localized at the Martano estate, on Rori. Veega Madish thus tasked the spacers to encounter the wealthy gambler Tierce Martano in order to convince him to hand over the pilot to the Alliance. Since Martano was a powerful man, the Rebel officer preferred to avoid any conflict with him. However, when they arrived at the estate, the place was besieged by Black Sun enforcers. While the spacers attacked the criminals, Martano sent a distress alert to both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance because he knew that both factions were looking for the smuggler. The adventurers finally managed to kill all Black Sun forces and met Tierce Martano. As the gambler wished to get rid of Handro as soon as possible, he eagerly accepted to give the location of Handro to the spacers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the hunt for Handro was coming to an end, Veega Madish was suddenly reassigned. In fact, Cal Handro was now considered as a traitor for having smuggled slaves and the Alliance wanted to capture him. Rebel Officer Wolff Kalos was designated to investigate the case and Madish advised the spacers to report to him as soon as possible. Cal Handro was eventually killed in his starship during a space battle between Imperial and Rebel forces in the Naboo system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Veega Madish was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
