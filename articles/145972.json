Viewable within the Pool of Knowledge on a planet in the Maw, it granted a vision of the future in the form of a being or beings on or around the Throne. Both Luke Skywalker and Jacen Solo viewed the Throne of Balance. The first time Solo viewed it, he saw a dark, armored figure ruling the galaxy and surrounded by dark acolytes, and became determined to prevent that future's fulfillment. Shortly before he died, Solo saw the Throne of Balance again, except this time with his own daughter, Allana, on the Throne, ruling justly in a time of peace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two years later, Leia Organa Solo had a similar vision of Allana Solo standing in front of a mix of species, looking to her for guidance and peace. In Organa Solo's vision, Allana was beside a large white throne, but no one was standing beside her to help her or comfort her, and none of the Skywalkers or Solos were there either."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker later looked upon the Throne of Balance while he was beyond shadows, and he too saw Allana ruling in a time of peace. Later, Sith High Lord Sarasu Taalon saw a Jedi queen\u2014unbeknownst to him, Allana Solo\u2014on the Throne, causing the Sith's alliance with the Jedi to dissolve. He feared that she could prevent the Sith from retaking the galaxy, and thus desired to learn everything about her, so that he could ensure such circumstances did not come about."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Duel at the Lake of Apparitions, Luke finally met the Dark Man. After the two worked together to defeat Abeloth, Jacen confided in Luke that the reason he turned to the dark side and became a Sith was in order to change the future because he had seen Allana next to the Dark Man on the Throne of Balance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
