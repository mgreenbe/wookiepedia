Originating from the time of the High Republic, the vessel was left abandoned on the planet Dianth, where it remained into the Imperial Era. After Aphra's starship, the Ark Angel III, was destroyed by the fleet of the Tagge family scion Ronen Tagge on Dianth, Aphra's associate, the bounty hunter Black Krrsantan, discovered the High Republic vessel. Aphra's crew boarded the starship, determining that it was still functional. Piloting the vessel to Cantonica, where Tagge resided, Aphra attracted the attention of Tagge's fleet, which proceeded to pursue her. Tagge's forces damaged the vessel's main thruster, and Aphra allowed them to board her ship. The damaged High Republic vessel was set down on Cantonica alongside one of Tagge's ships, and Aphra's crew was taken prisoner by Tagge. While Aphra and her crew were taken to Tagge's Canto Bight penthouse, the starship was left on a landing pad outside. After defeating Tagge, Aphra and her allies made their escape in the starship, which was given the name Ark Angel IV."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
