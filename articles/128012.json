He looks around and prods his guardian, the Mandalorian Din Djarin. Seeing that Djarin is asleep, he sneaks to the back of the Razor Crest and uses the Force to open the back door. When he gets outside, he is amazed by the falling of the snow, and he frolics around in it, attempting to catch a snowflake, which he successfully does. He then uses the Force to gather a large amount of the snow, and he cobbles it together to form a snowball. However, he mistakenly drops the snowball on himself, leaving only his ears protruding through the snow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At this point, Djarin awakes back in the Razor Crest, and realizes with alarm that Grogu is no longer in the gunship. He glances around, and he realizes that the back door is open. He races outside and lifts Grogu from the snow, who smiles with delight. Djarin gives a small snowball to Grogu, and carries him back into the Razor Crest. Unbeknownst to Djarin, Grogu uses the Force to lift the large snowball he had created earlier back into the ship. The two then take off from the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Disney.com listing of \"Snowflake Snack\" misspells Razor Crest as \"Razorcrest.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Reception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mia Johnson of the FanSided website Dork Side of the Force called the short \"cute,\" and her favorite of the holiday-themed LEGO shorts.
