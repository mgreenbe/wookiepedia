The Empire wanted to turn the ship on worlds with a Rebel Alliance presence; their first target was the world of Rion. The Ionic Ring turned the once-tropical planet into an icy world, freezing the planet's food supply and driving its people into desperation, amongst them this duck-like being, who was at Tana's Resort, a resort facility on the world operated by Tana.
