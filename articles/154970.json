He led a squad of stormtroopers to investigate the Mining Guild's Crawler 413-24 due to an alert triggered by Seevor, the ore crawler's captain. The crawler had been hijacked by members of the Spectres so they could use its long-range transmitter. When the Imperial forces arrived, the rebels pretended that everything was business as usual aboard the transport. Not knowing what the actual crew of the crawler looked like, the Stormtrooper Commander believed Cikatro Vizago's impersonation of the crawler captain. He and his troops left after not finding anything they deemed suspicious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Stormtrooper Commander was voiced by Steve Blum, who also voices Garazeb Orrelios, in the Star Wars Rebels fourth season episode \"Crawler Commandeers\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
