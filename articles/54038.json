He told Surik that he did not know how he became sick, but that he had felt just fine the day before. Surik could almost immediately tell that his condition was not serious and used her medical knowledge to cure his sickness.

Additionally, the player can tell Saquesh, the Exchange crime organization's overseer of the Refugee Sector, that Geriel's illness is contagious, which Saquesh will answer by having him killed. This also results in dark side points.
