They were covered in horns, on their head and shoulders, as well as their feet and tail. On the head of the War Dragons in particular, there were six large horns\u2014four facing backward and two facing forward, just under the eyes. An additional two horns were found on their hips. The War Dragons could be used as mounts, with a prospective rider sitting just behind the front legs of the beast.

The arbiter of that effort was an individual known as Nomad-Damon, a traveler. Members of the Jedi Order attempted to tame the violent beasts, but their efforts were largely in vain. At the conclusion of the Clone Wars, the Republic gave way to Emperor Palpatine's Galactic Empire, and under the new rule the War Dragons were destroyed by agents of the government. Any survivors of the Imperial purges disappeared, or were sold off to wealthy civilians. At some point, an individual, wielding a modified lightsaber, used a War Dragon as a mount and chose to sling a blaster rifle on his beast's neck."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 3 (1995), the \"Design An Alien\" competition was announced, inviting readers to design Star Wars aliens inspired and influenced by the original trilogy of films. 29 year old Mark Rehkopf designed the Ubese Thorn-Back War Dragon, submitting his artwork to the magazine for the competition. Rehkopf's entry won first place \"16 years and up\" division, and his blurb for the creature, as well as his original artwork, was published in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 7 (1996). Leland Chee, the Lucasfilm Ltd. continuity editor, later stated the \"Design an Alien\" material is canon.
