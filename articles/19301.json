The planet had a cloudy atmosphere, which hosted a Kaminoan facility that was abandoned by the time of the Galactic Empire. The Kaminoans utilized the facility on Bora Vio as a rendezvous for the bounty hunter Cad Bane to deliver the clone Omega to Taun We. However, fellow bounty hunter Fennec Shand was sent by the Kaminoan Nala Se to rescue Omega and prevent her from being handed over to Taun We. Omega was able to escape captivity, and as Shand fought Bane, she transmitted a signal from the facility and escaped on a flight pod. The former clone commando unit known as the Bad Batch, with whom Omega had been traveling, picked up the signal and rescued her from Bora Vio in their starship, Havoc Marauder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
