Though not as effective as a full immersion in a bacta tank, bacta patches were much easier to transport and sufficed as a quick and convenient medical healer. They were useful when trying to keep a patient with more serious injuries stable until they could reach a bacta tank, but if there were no bacta tanks, then they were to have rested for a couple of days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bacta patches could have appeared and acted similar to a bandage but slightly larger and with a faster healing process.
