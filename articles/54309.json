Senator Organa tasks them with recovering Saw's team and any data they had collected. When Hera asks what they are looking for, Rex tells them that they are looking for Saw Gerrera.

Sabine realizes that they have found a deflector shield generator, and informs a surprised Hera that the shield generator is military grade. Hera thinks that Chopper Base could make use of the shield generator and tells the rebels to take it. She tries to contact Kanan, but can't reach him.

Zeb suggests blasting the \"tin cans,\" but Sabine warns him that that would only activate more droids. When Sabine inquires about using the Ghost's cannons, Hera replies that the sandstorm has clogged up the barrels.
