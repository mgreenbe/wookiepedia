Several months prior to the Battle of Yavin, the Red Shadows became the scene of a violent fire-fight between two bounty hunters named Zardra and Jodo Kast and the sibling smugglers known as the Thig Brothers. A Hutt named Mageye passed through the district on his way to cut a deal with another Hutt named BolBol. His entourage made the mistake of bringing him too close to the bounty hunter/smuggler shootout and the Hutt fell from the top of his litter and slid onto Zardra. In order to get out from under the massive weight, Zardra was forced to shove a gauge six thermal detonator into Mageye's mouth, destroying him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
