The man who became Rey's father, whose name was lost in time, was created by the Sith Eternal on Exegol, a distant world where Sidious' cultists experimented with his genetic template in order to create a stable host for his essence. This man was the byproduct from years of genetic research, created from cloned tissue and donated blood cells of the Sith Lord, and was called the Emperor's son. However, Rey's father lacked his progenitor's connection to the Force and was deemed a failed experiment. Nevertheless, Sidious permitted the strandcast to live as a means for continuing the Palpatine bloodline."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He escaped into hiding along with his child, who was born in 15 ABY and her mother. They eventually settled on Jakku where they struggled to survive in the desert as junk traders during the New Republic Era. Unlike the clone, Rey inherited Sidious' power and was, therefore, able to serve as a host for her grandfather's spirit. Determined to claim his granddaughter, Sidious ordered one of his followers, Ochi, to find and bring her to Exegol. Rey's father and mother chose to leave her on Jakku, selling her to Unkar Plutt in order to hide her from Sidious. Their plan succeeded, although Ochi captured and killed them after they refused to reveal their daughter's location."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rey had all but forgotten her past while growing up as a scavenger on Jakku.

However, he revived himself by transferring his essence to a new host\u2014a clone of his original body\u2014hidden away in the galaxy's Unknown Regions, on the Sith planet Exegol. This body was incapable of sustaining his spirit and consequently suffered from rapid decay due to Sidious' connection to the dark side of the Force. His followers, the cult known as the Sith Eternal, labored to create a new vessel for their master while he fought to survive in his temporary form."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Son of the Emperor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The biological father of Rey was an offshoot from the genetic research of Darth Sidious. Following Sidious' rebirth, the Sith cultists conducted various experiments using his DNA, splicing genes and bolstering together tissue, hoping to create a cradle for his spirit, but only ended up creating a litany of artificial abominations. However, a single genetic strand-cast, a clone offshoot, not quite identical in appearance to the Dark Lord of the Sith, survived. Thriving, the clone boy was healthy and was regarded to be the Emperor's son. The young man's name, as well as the reason he survived, by neglect or purpose, were lost to history."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Being created from his father's cloned tissue, the young man possessed the Emperor's blood, but did not inherit his Force-sensitivity, leading the Sith Lord to be disgusted with someone who did not share the Force powers he relished. Sidious considered the strandcast unexceptional and could not bear to look upon what he deemed an example of \"disappointing ordinariness.\" However, his son's health still afforded the Emperor the means to continue his bloodline.

While Sidious had not anticipated his son's relationship with the woman who gave birth to his daughter in 15 ABY, he nonetheless saw it as an opportunity because his granddaughter, unlike his clone, inherited his connection to the Force. Rey was therefore deemed the perfect vessel for her grandfather's essence. He eventually settled with his family on Jakku, a backwater world where Rey's parents struggled to survive as junk traders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his efforts to stay hidden from his father's agents, one of them\u2014the Sith relic hunter Ochi\u2014eventually tracked the clone and his family to Jakku.

During this time in her life, she had all but forgotten the parents who left her when she was a child, having subconsciously suppressed the memories of her childhood. Despite this, she was hopeful that her father and mother would eventually return to her, giving her a reason to stay on her homeworld instead of exploring the wider galaxy. Yet a lifetime of isolation also left Rey struggling with feelings of solitude and abandonment, an experience which contributed to the emotional bond she would form with Ren during the First Order/Resistance War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ren, having seen who Rey's parents were and how they lived through the Force-bond that he shared with their daughter, urged Rey to admit the truth about her parents. When Rey confessed that her father and mother were no one significant, Ren elaborated, revealing that they were junk traders who bartered their daughter away in exchange for money. Ren had learned the identities of Rey's parents through a Force vision, and told Rey that her father was an insignificant junk trader who sought money to feed his alcoholism. Though she later believed that Ren had only divulged this information as a means to turn her to the dark side, Rey sensed that he had not tried to deceive her, yet was still reluctant to admit that she was born to parents of no background."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Ren had not lied to Rey about her parents, he later realized that the vision he saw of them was incomplete. He eventually learned the full truth from Sidious while confronting the Dark Lord of the Sith on Exegol. Sidious revealed that Rey's father was his son, making Rey his biological granddaughter. The revelation of the scavenger's origins reignited Ren's desire to rule the galaxy with Rey at his side. In addition, he discovered that together they formed a rare and powerful dyad in the Force, which only further convinced him of their shared destiny."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rey, who began training as a Jedi apprentice, was astonished to discover her biological connection to the fallen Emperor. As a Jedi, she struggled to control her anger, but the knowledge that Sidious gave the order to kill her parents fueled her desire for revenge. Yet her devotion to the Jedi Order and the light side of the Force helped to restrain her from giving into the impulse to kill in anger. It was also the memory of her father and mother that prevented Rey from turning to the dark side; whereas Sidious believed this made her as weak as her parents, she considered them to be strong for protecting her.

The son of the Emperor had red hair, blue eyes, and light skin. However, his physical appearance was not identical to that of his genetic donor, a byproduct of the modifications to his genome. He was young when he became a father, and had a scruffy red beard by the time he lived on Jakku."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though he was cloned from the Sith Lord who masterminded the fall of the Galactic Republic and ruled the Galactic Empire through fear, the strandcast sought to live as an ordinary man with his family; desiring a life apart from darkness and away from his father. Having inherited neither his progenitor's power nor his character, he was regarded by Sidious as a powerless and useless disappointment. Despite the harsh conditions of Jakku, he took on the difficult life of surviving in a desert environment in order to keep Rey hidden from her grandfather.
