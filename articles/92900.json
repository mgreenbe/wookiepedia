Engatoo was fully designed prior to being cut from the episode due to time constraints. In the early drafts of the episode, Ezra Bridger was supposed to go to Tatooine along with his master Kanan Jarrus and follow a path of clues left by Maul, including a visit to a remote outpost where Engatoo would give Bridger some information that would lead to Maul. The idea of Jarrus' involvement was ultimately abandoned and Bridger was guided by the holocron fragments instead of clues."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
