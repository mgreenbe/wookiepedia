It was located thirty kilometers southwest of the town of Ogden's Hope, an hour's speeder ride in good weather, in a region where air travel was rendered impossible by Elphrona's unique magnetism. The homestead had been built on two neighbouring mining claims, both owned by the Blythes. During the High Republic Era, the homestead was attacked by Nihil raiders who sought to take the Blythes hostage and ransom them to their wealthy relatives in the Core Worlds. After the raid, the surviving Blythes chose to move in with their relatives on Alderaan rather than return to the homestead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
