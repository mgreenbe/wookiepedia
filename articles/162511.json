However, they were then visited by Jedi Knight Aayla Secura, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and Commander Bly after they crash-landed. At first, his father, Tee Watt Kaa, refused to aid the Jedi until Tano told them that her master, Anakin Skywalker, was close to dying. Wag Too then went with Tano and Bly while Secura stayed with his father. When they arrived at the crash site, Wag Too assisted Tano, Bly, and Captain Rex in subduing a mastiff phalone.
