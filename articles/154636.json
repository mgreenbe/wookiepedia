Whilst waiting for Amidala, the barely clad Rodian gave Tonra not-so-subtle invitations, which resulted in him giving Tonra a narcotic and a suggestion that the captain should follow him into one of the club's darkest corners. Tonra, however, rejected the suggestion, much to the Rodian's disappointment. Sab\u00e9 informed Tonra that he should get rid of the narcotic, though Tonra admitted he didn't want to stand up as he was reluctant to show anything that could be interpreted as interest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
