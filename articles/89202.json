At some point, Merish has prolonged the death of an Imperial Stormtrooper out of anger and rage. He was one of the last members of his squadron to remain alive when the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing chased the frigate Hellion's Dare through the Oridol Cluster. When Kreskian, the captain of the Hellion's Dare, ordered the remaining pilots to carry out an attack on the enemy Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier, Merish flew his A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter and scored a direct hit on the cruiser-carrier. However, when he returned to the Hellion's Dare, the pilots saw their ship in flames with its engines heavily damaged. Merish was eventually killed during the squadron's last stand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
