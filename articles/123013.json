The new craft proved popular with RSF members in the capital city of Theed, and other cities, such as Keren, soon made use of the Seraph."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seraph-class urban landspeeders saw little combat prior to the Invasion of Naboo, their actions mainly limited to criminal pursuit and officer dispatch.

When Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala joined forces with the Gungans to ignite the Second Battle of Theed, Seraph landspeeders were used to transport her, Captain Quarsh Panaka, and a strike force to Theed's secret tunnels, allowing them to invade the palace and capture Nute Gunray."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Civilians used an unarmed, unshielded model during the invasion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Naboo, heavily armored variants of the Seraph were commissioned and added to the RSF motor pool."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 21 BBY, the Separatist terrorist Perrive possessed a Flash Speeder which was finally stolen by Kal Skirata and Walon Vau after his death during the Mission to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early days of the Galactic Civil War, several RSF Seraph landspeeders mysteriously disappeared only to resurface later in the hands of the fledgling Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seraph-class urban landspeeders first appeared in 1999 with the release of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The speeder was also in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Flash speeder deed was a special pre-order reward from GameStop when pre-ordering the Jump to Lightspeed expansion for Star Wars Galaxies.
