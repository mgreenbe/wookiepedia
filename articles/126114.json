Sidious planted the seeds for what would become the Confederacy of Independent Systems by forming an alliance with the Trade Federation, a corporation led by Viceroy Nute Gunray and Settlement Officer Rune Haako.

A number of other Sith were also active during the war, such as Sidious' former apprentice Maul, Tyranus' first apprentice Asajj Ventress, and Tyranus' second apprentice and Maul's brother Savage Opress. Due to Sidious being both Chancellor of the Republic and Tyranus' master, he was able to manipulate both sides of the war, leading to Order 66, the defeat of the Confederacy, and the establishment of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not too long after Tyranus was sacrificed and betrayed by Sidious, Anakin Skywalker was turned to the dark side and became the Sith Lord Darth Vader, while Sidious ruled the galaxy as Emperor.

However, the Rebel Alliance destroyed it along with Tarkin during the Battle of Yavin. The Rebels then continued to defy Imperial rule for a further five years, leading to the Battle of Endor with the destruction of the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station and the end of the thousand-year lineage stretching from Darth Bane to the last Sith Lord, Darth Vader, who renounced the dark side and died killing his master Sidious, but ended up dying as a redeemed Anakin Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The last Sith Lord"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Sidious was resurrected and led the Sith Eternal cult.
