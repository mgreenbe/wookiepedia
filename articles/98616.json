In about 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars, Jakkak journeyed to Timira City on the planet Kamino aboard his freighter. En-route, Jakkak stopped over on the moon Korasa to perform maintenance to the vessel and unknown to him, the bounty hunters Boba Fett, Bossk and C-21 Highsinger boarded the roof of his vessel. When Jakkak docked his ship in Timira City, the bounty hunter jumped down and attacked Jakkak and some of the facility's clone trooper guards. Bossk picked Jakkak up and tossed him away, causing Jakkak to collide with the clone trooper Seeker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
