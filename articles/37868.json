It was home to the Turlossus, a massive six-legged reptilian species. Because the creatures were so massive that any structures built on the ground were at risk of being crushed under their feet, inhabitants of the moon built their cities on top of the Turlossus' flat shells. Different parts of the cities were connected by bridges and catwalks that could be raised and lowered. The moon was also home to the sentient Dhanduese, a flightless, feathered avian species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sporting grassy terrain, Dhandu 3 was known for its very low gravity, and visitors to the moon were required to wear gravity weights in order to walk safely. After being hired by Mahjo Reeloo to help steal Novian rubies from Jayyar Lu-wehs' safety deposit box in the Undervaults of Gwongdeen, Han Solo and Chewbacca visited Dhandu 3 in the Millennium Falcon. Also accompanied by Hondo Ohnaka, the group came to the moon to steal the key to Lu-wehs' vault."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
