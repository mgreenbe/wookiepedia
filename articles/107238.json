It was designed to push power to certain systems on the ship past their limit. The original design would blow the system when it was activated. The Verpine Garginoolaara managed to fix the design, allowing it to increase power to either the shields or individual weapons of the Cutter's Way. However, using the power flux surger drained the power of the other two systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
