Like all R2 astromech droids, R2-M5 was manufactured by Industrial Automaton and stood ninety-six centimeters tall. The droid served Royal Security Forces of the planet Naboo during the reign of Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala. After the Trade Federation invaded Naboo and captured its capital Theed, R2-M5 was in the Theed Hangar under guard by B1-series battle droids when Amidala and her allies attacked the battle droids in order to retake the hangar. Amidala's forces successfully managed to destroy the Trade Federation droids, allowing the pilots of Bravo Flight and their astromechs to board their N-1 starfighter and launch for battle against the Trade Federation forces blockading their planet. The Trade Federation were ultimately defeated and driven off Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R2-M5 first appeared in the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
