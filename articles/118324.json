The delegation consisted of a senator and their aides, although sometimes it was led by two co-senators. In 0 BBY, the Senate was shut down by order of the Galactic Emperor Palpatine, and the Rylothean delegation was disbanded along with all the others."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ryloth Senatorial Delegation sat in the Galactic Senate, the legislative and executive branch of the Galactic Republic. Its members represented the planet of Ryloth and the other worlds contained within the Gaulus sector, in the Outer Rim region of the galaxy. It occupied a repulsorpod in the rotunda of the Galactic Senate, and was led by one or up to three senators, with the help of their aides and protocol droids. In the last decades of the Republic, all members of the delegation were Twi'leks, the native inhabitants of Ryloth. The heads of the delegation were chiefly corpulent males who often used their attractive females assistants as badges of prestige, as was customary within their male-dominated culture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 33 BBY, the Ryloth delegation had three Twi'lek co-senators: Orn Free Taa, Connus Trell, and Chom Frey Kaa. That year, the whole group opposed the Yinchorri embargo act proposed by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum. At the time, Senator Taa had three consorts: a blue-skinned female named Pampy, a pallid male assistant and a red-skinned a female aide. He also had a protocol droid in his possession."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One year later, the Ryloth group endorsed the candidacy of Palpatine, head of the Naboo Senatorial Delegation, during the chancery election to replace Valorum.

However, nineteen years later, that new assembly was officially disbanded, and the Ryloth group disappeared along with all the other delegations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
