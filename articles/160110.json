The planet, which was located in the northeastern portion of the Outer Rim Territories and part of the Kwymar sector, included many rainforests and swamps. Therein dwelt the skeeg, a predatory mollusk known for its use in the manufacture of natural perfumes. The Vendaran culture contained legends of a time when giant sea-dwelling skeegs were hunted for meat and the creation of poisons; however, by the time of the New Republic, the modern skeeg was much smaller. The Vendarans had contact with the wider galaxy, including poachers that traveled to Vendara to capture skeegs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chuck Truett created the Vendarans for the West End Games sourcebook Creatures of the Galaxy, a 1994 supplement to Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
