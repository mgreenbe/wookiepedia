They were bipedal, and had eyes with black pupils and irises that were mottled with black and grey. Their eyes also included a light green band around the irises, and sclera which was mottled with two shades of purple. They had deep voices, no hair, and a small, indented nose."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many members of the species were senators in the Separatist Senate at the time of the Clone Wars. One such individual was Punn Rimbaud, a female member of the species. When the senator for Onderon, Mina Bonteri, attempted to convince the senate to begin peace negotiations with the Republic, Rimbaud was opposed to starting any such negotiations. The matter was cast to a vote by the Separatist leader Count Dooku, and despite Rimbaud voting \"nay\" the overall vote was in favor of starting the peace talks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The species was first seen in Heroes on Both Sides, the tenth episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series' third season which aired on November 19, 2010.
