Shortly after the invasion commenced, the Trade Federation Droid Army entered the swamps and demanded the village's surrender. The villagers refused, and the droid forces opened fire. Following their leader, Rohan Wayside, the villagers took their houseboats and fled deeper into the swamps. At the time, the Security Force officers Captain Kael and Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes were searching for the village to recruit pilots. The officers engaged the Federation gunboats and rescued the villagers. In gratitude, Wayside sent his best pilot, Vedd Deviss, to lead the officers on a mission to find a smuggler who could help fight the Federation army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The village appears in a mission from the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo.
