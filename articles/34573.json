Sometime after Malak betrayed his Master, Revan, during an ambush by the Jedi and Republic forces attempting to capture them, Bandon became the new Dark Lord's first Shadow Hand, elevating him to second-in-command of the Sith Empire. When the Sith attacked the Republic warship Endar Spire above the planet Taris, Bandon boarded the ship along with the Sith troopers and Dark Jedi under his command and tried to capture the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan. He killed the Republic ensign Trask Ulgo, who sacrificed himself to save the former Sith Lord Revan, who had been mentally reprogrammed to be loyal to the Republic and to serve as a common soldier by the Jedi Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the destruction of Taris, the bounty hunter Calo Nord was hired by Malak to follow in pursuit of Shan, who escaped the bombardment with the help of Revan and his companions.

Bandon located Revan in Manaan's underwater kolto harvesting base known as Hrakert Station, on the Selkath homeworld Manaan. The Sith apprentice confronted Revan and his allies after they found a fourth Star Map that would give them the location of the Star Forge\u2014the ancient Rakatan space station under Malak's control. Bandon underestimated the former Dark Lord and his companions, assuming that they would be no match for him. This proved to be his downfall, as Revan and his team vanquished Malak's Shadow Hand, along with the two Dark Jedi accompanying him.

Bandon eventually won Malak's admiration. Two years into the Jedi Civil War, the Jedi and Republic forces set a trap for Revan and Malak in an attempt to capture both Sith Lords.

Malak took the promising Bandon as his Shadow Hand, which made him second only to his Master in the Sith Empire. The Dark Lord taught much of his knowledge of the Sith to Bandon. Malak was not disappointed with his choice of taking Bandon as his apprentice, because Bandon killed many Jedi during the war. In a short time, rumors began to surface that Bandon would challenge Malak for the right to rule the Sith; Bandon eventually began to set his sights on his Sith Master's throne."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Raiding the Endar Spire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 3956 BBY, Darth Malak was searching for a Jedi Knight named Bastila Shan, fearing her strength in Battle meditation, a Force power that boosted the Republic forces' morale during battle while sapping the Sith's will to fight.

Above the planet Taris, Bandon led the boarding party that stormed the Endar Spire, in an attempt to capture or kill Shan. An amnesiac Revan\u2014who had been rescued by Shan after Malak betrayed him and later mind-wiped by the Jedi Council\u2014was placed under Shan's command as a common Republic soldier.

Malak hired the bounty hunter to find and capture Shan, however, Nord was killed by Revan during the Jedi's search for the Star Forge. The Sith Admiral Saul Karath informed Malak of Nord's failure on Malak's flagship Leviathan, and asked if he should hire another bounty hunter to send after Shan. The Dark Lord determined, however, that no mere bounty hunter could stand against a Jedi. Bandon was summoned to the ship's bridge immediately; when Bandon arrived on the bridge, he killed a Sith trooper that walked in his way. Malak sent Bandon after Revan, Shan, and their companions, and Malak ordered his apprentice to bring Shan to him alive, if possible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bandon located Revan at the Republic's kolto harvesting base known as Hrakert Station, which was named for the Hrakert Rift in which the base was located, on the Selkath homeworld Manaan. The Shadow Hand confronted Revan and his allies in the station after Revan located a fourth Rakatan Star Map, which was necessary to learn the location the Star Forge. Accompanied by two Dark Jedi, he presumed that Revan and his team would be no match for him. He expressed his fear that someone else had killed Revan, thereby depriving him the \"pleasure\" of slaying Revan. When Bandon was asked by Revan how he managed to make it to Hrakert Station, the Sith Lord replied he acquired an underwater vessel and used the same route that Darth Revan and Darth Malak used underwater, leading him to the station. Bandon also told Revan that he was no match for the Sith apprentice, although Revan had defeated Calo Nord, whom Bandon thought was pathetic. Revan recognized Bandon, stating that he would pay for killing Trask Ulgo. The Sith Lord told Revan that his words meant nothing to him, unless he wished to beg for his life, and added that he would try to make Revan's death both quick and painful.

The acolytes eventually embarked on a misguided attempt to reattach the head to a new body, attracting the attention of the Jedi, who put an end to this cult. However, no trace of the head was found."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Somehow the head ended up in the possession of Risha Drayen during the Cold War, and she used it during her quest to locate the treasure of her father, Nok Drayen. Peema Ahuff, curator of the House Alde Royal Museum, wished to acquire the head and place it on display to honor Alderaanian hero Trask Ulgo, who died in combat against the Sith Lord. Ahuff was willing to trade a hyperdrive engine for it, which Risha and her smuggler cohort needed, so the smuggler went to make the trade and learned that the gangster Skavak had traded a fake head and absconded with the hyperdrive. The smuggler pursued Skavak's agents and retrieved the hyperdrive, then gave the real head to the museum, where it was put on display.

In 40 ABY, the investigatory agent Gannod Chant, who worked for the Council on Security and Intelligence, translated a manuscript written by suspected Sith sympathizer Ingo Wavlud.

He could use the Force to push his opponents to the ground and could use it to alter the air currents around his opponent, turning it into a maelstrom. This swirling vortex of Force energy would lift an opponent into the air, spin them around, and completely immobilize them. Bandon was also able to use the Force to render himself virtually invulnerable to most offensive Force powers for a limited time, demonstrating this against Revan. Bandon's strength with the dark side of the Force enabled him to use dark-sided powers such as Force lightning, and he also used the dark side to tap into his rage and direct it against his opponents. He could use the Force to instill fear in his opponents, driving them temporarily insane. Bandon was capable of using the dark side to drain his enemies' life-forces, and to strangle his opponents. He could also use it to debilitate his victims, having it work as a fast-acting toxin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Bandon joined the Sith ranks, he constructed a saberstaff containing a red crystal.
