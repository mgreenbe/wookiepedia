These tough creatures were acclimated to their homeworld's endless deserts, and as a result were domesticated by the planet's inhabitants. They often worked as transports or beast of burden, though they were often bad-tempered and stubborn, and could break wind if their load was too heavy. Eopies were observed to exhibit flatulence. As such, when riding a caravan of eopies, it was recommended to always ride on the foremost animal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eopies were also found on the planet Saleucami, and the desert moon Zardossa Stix, as well as in the forests and jungles near the Black Spire Ruins of Batuu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On some planets, eopie was served as a delicacy. Power Sliders, a small diner located in a small settlement on the remote world of Abafar, had eopie stew on its menu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally, the role of the eopie was to be filled by the kaadu of Naboo. However, due to the evolving story of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, which called for the Gungans to be beast-riding soldiers, the kaadu was transported to Naboo, leading to the creation of the eopie. An early production painting by Doug Chiang of the kaadu hauling a Podracer engine on Tatooine was retouched in Adobe Photoshop to create the eopie."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
