From there Kenobi left to switch off the tractor beam controls, leaving the others to wait in the control room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, it was not long before R2 discovered that Princess Organa was being held prisoner on-board. With some coaxing, as well as the offer of a generous reward, Skywalker managed to convince Solo to participate in a rescue attempt.

However, Solo expressed his doubts about the plan working."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving the droids in the control room (with Skywalker and Solo telling them that if the Imperials get suspicious, they lock the door and hope they don't have blasters), Skywalker and Solo made their way to Detention Block AA-23.

Eventually, they arrived at their destination, where Skywalker tried to bluff the guards by saying there was a prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

The advantage was not to last, and soon the duo was overwhelmed by sheer numbers and forced to fall back to the Princess's cell. The group blasted several stormtroopers, Imperial Navy troopers, and IT-O Interrogator droids. Neither of the two men, though, had thought of an escape plan, and over the comlink were informed by C-3PO\u2014who, with R2, had posed as Imperial droids in order to relocate back to the hangar bay\u2014that there was no way out, save the main entrance. As troopers started pouring into the hallway and pinning them down with blaster fire, Princess Organa took charge and, grabbing Skywalker's blaster, blasted through a ventilation shaft to garbage compactor 3263827."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once inside, Skywalker tried to blast open the door with his rifle, only to find it was magnetically sealed. Solo, the last to arrive, tried the same approach, unaware of Skywalker's previous attempt, only to make the same discovery. Skywalker was then pulled into the water by a dianoga that was living inside the compactor and feeding off garbage; Solo managed to shoot it to save him, though not before Skywalker lost the comlink. In addition, the dianoga, sensing that the compression cycle was about to start, abandoned its prey and disappeared deep underwater. No sooner had Skywalker been rescued than the compression cycle began and the walls started to close in on them, a last attempt by the stormtroopers to prevent the prisoners' escape. Skywalker desperately searched for the missing comlink as the others tried to climb out or halt the cycle. Finding the missing comlink, Skywalker called for 3PO's help. However, the two droids were delayed in responding as they were hiding from various Imperial patrols, only learning about it when the doors were close to crushing them. Just before they were crushed, however, R2 managed to stop the cycle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After escaping the trash compactor, Skywalker and Solo shed their stormtrooper armor, though not before appropriating the utility belts, and they set off for the Millennium Falcon. Before long the group encountered a stormtrooper patrol that had been searching for them.

Overwhelmed by the sheer numbers, they were forced to retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Skywalker escorted Organa on an alternate route to the hangar bay. Before long they encountered another patrol and were forced to take cover behind a blast door. Seeing no lock, Skywalker blasted the controls, only to discover that these were also the bridge controls, and that, much to their dismay, they were stranded on a ledge above a deep chasm. With it only being a matter of time before the stormtrooper patrol breached the door, and with other troopers firing from nearby ledges, Organa provided covering fire while Skywalker prepared a grappling hook to swing across the chasm, though not before receiving a good luck kiss from Organa. Skywalker, just beforehand, also shot one of the stormtroopers, TK-119, causing the latter to fall down the shaft. The groups eventually rendezvoused in a corridor above the hangar and began discussing how to proceed to the Falcon without being seen by the small group of stormtroopers stationed there."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Duel with the Dark Lord"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, after shutting down the tractor beam, Kenobi had made his way back to the hanger where the Falcon was being kept, musing suspiciously about how easy it had been to accomplish his objective. Just before reaching the hangar, he came face to face with his former apprentice, Darth Vader. Realizing that Vader had obviously sensed his presence long before their encounter, Kenobi began to entertain the notion that he had been allowed to deactivate the station's tractor beam as part of a trap. Drawing his weapon, he strode toward his destiny."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader stood at the end of the hall leading to Docking Bay 327, lightsaber already ablaze and awaiting Kenobi. When Kenobi ignited his own weapon, Vader advanced on him, raising his weapon to attack.

Vader took the blow and riposted, Kenobi barely blocked the attack, then Vader attacked again, sending Obi-Wan retreating. Then Vader attacked more two times, but Kenobi blocked each blow even with his old age. Kenobi twirled and parried the a third stab, then he blocked and countered Vader's next attack. Then Obi-Wan attacked, but the Sith Lord blocked and countered the attack, surprising Kenobi with his more advanced skills since their last confrontation. Kenobi charged with again, but Vader blocked the strike and pushed his former master in the wall and went to deliver the finishing strike, but Kenobi somehow dodged and used the opportunity to run around the Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader taunted Kenobi by saying that his former master's power were getting weak, but the Jedi Master retorted saying that if he was cut down he would become more powerful than Vader would be able to imagine. Kenobi charged him again, but Vader anticipated the strike and locked both blades, and shoving hard, he broke the lock and sent Kenobi back. Vader angled his blade and told Kenobi that he shouldn't have come back. Kenobi realized that the Vader he was confronting was a far different one than in Mustafar, and defeating him would be an entirely different story. Seizing the offense, Vader attacked Obi-Wan starting a exchange of blows, each one blocked everything against him and they even countered a few of each other's blows; but Kenobi was soon tiring, so after a brief blade-lock, he started backing away, but the Sith Lord followed him with his controlled but ruthless offense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader drove Obi-Wan back to an open doorway of the hangar, where the Sith Lord tried to chivvy Kenobi in the way, but Kenobi countered an attack and forced Vader to pull back to the opposite wall. There Kenobi would truly feel that he would never be able to defeat Vader, since the Sith Lord has become a far superior fighter than himself. At that same moment, he took a glimpse of the hangar, and saw some stormtroopers guarding the Millennium Falcon and Luke and the others (including Leia Organa) hiding nearby, waiting for a distraction to get in the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just then Vader all by sudden unleashed a flurry of attacks faster than the human eye against Kenobi, who somehow blocked and parried each one of them. The two rapidly circled and matched each other's blows for a while as the stormtroopers ran closer to the doorway. Kenobi realized that with that distraction, the others received a chance to run to the Millennium Falcon, he only needed to distract Vader and his Stormtroopers just for a little more time. Seizing the offense, Kenobi unleashed several blows that put Vader on the defensive, but Vader soon regained the upper hand and locked blades with his former master. As the stormtroopers approached the duel even closely, Kenobi would really begin to feel his age, realizing that at any moment he would be struck down by Vader or shot by the Stormtroopers, he concluded that his defeat was inevitable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He took one last glimpse at the hangar and saw that Luke have stopped following his companions to their ship and was watching the duel, shocked with seeing his mentor so out of breath. Kenobi knew that the best way to give Luke and others a chance to escape was if he sacrificed himself. So he looked at Vader again and smiled, confusing the Sith Lord, then he lifted his blade in front of his face and closing his eyes, he took a long breath. Hesitating, Vader tried to find out the reason of Obi-Wan's suicidal tactic, but at the same time, he viciously sent his lightsaber through Obi-Wan's neck, but Kenobi used the force to extinguish his physical body and became one with the force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker, shocked and distraught by the death of his mentor, cried out in grief.

Seeing this, he was quick to lock out Vader by shooting the blast door's controls at Solo's urging. Though Skywalker, in his anger, was eager to finish off the remaining stormtroopers in the hanger, the disembodied voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi urged Skywalker to board the Falcon and escape. Kenobi's deactivation of the station's tractor beam systems allowed the Millennium Falcon to leave the Death Star unhindered.

However, the rescuers did not know that the Empire had secretly stored a homing droid aboard their ship, which gave the Empire information on the destination of the Falcon.
