Rodia was one of the countless worlds that fell to the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders. After destroying the cities of Rodia, the Yuuzhan Vong turned their attention to the violent Rodians. The alien invaders planned to forge their Rodian captives into deadly warbeasts. The Master Shaper Taug Molou was placed in charge of this project."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He took his Rodian experimental subjects apart on a cellular level, reassembling their genetic code with bits from other creatures. This experiment resulted in the creation of the Vagh Rodiek. These mindless warbeasts scuttled forth on four crab-like legs and had sharp half-meter long scythes of bone in place of arms. Their natural head-spines had also been mutated into razor-sharp quills. These drones retained enough sentience to receive commands from their Yuuzhan Vong masters, but nearly all sense of their former species was erased. The armored beasts devastated many battlefields; particularly those in Hutt Space. While the method of creation violated the protocols of the Shaper caste, the effectiveness of the Vagh Rodiek was so impressive it was overlooked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
