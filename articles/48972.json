They were centered on Umate, the highest peak of the Manarai Mountains and the only outcropping of natural stone on the planet's surface. Their monks meditated while touching the rock in an effort to contact Coruscant's 'inner spirit'. They also patrolled the peak, preventing tourists from chipping off souvenirs from the stone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
