He maintained a base of operations in a stronghold in the Labor Valley of Coronet City that allowed him to escape through a labyrinth of secret passages. Darth Vowrawn planned to take him out and delivered pulse disruptors to the Emperor's Wrath in order to lock Senks' secret passages so that he could be cornered. Upon being confronted by Sith, Senks admitted to being Baras' spy. Assuming the Wrath to be one of the rogue Sith he was to keep in check, Senks pleaded to be spared, explaining that he sent resistance forces into battles and that, without him, they could not win and the Empire would lose the upper hand. However, the Wrath refused to listen to his pleas for mercy and killed Senks before destroying his database."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
