Boba Fett arrived on Coruscant after arranging to give information vital to the survival of the Republic to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Fett was escorted to the Jedi Temple to await his appointment but not before agreeing to leave his weapons on his ship. Once he was left alone, Fett left the Temple and traveled to the lower levels of Coruscant. In his excursion, Fett received weapons from Hat Lo and a saberdart from Elan Sleazebaggano before returning to the Temple. After finding that Windu had already left for his own meeting with the Chancellor, Fett used his jetpack to fly to the Senate Building."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The duel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boba Fett entered Palpatine's level of the Senate Building through a window after disabling its alarm. Fett proceeded directly to Palpatine's antechamber where he found Mace Windu. Fett fired almost immediately with his flechette pistol. After Windu dodged the first rounds Fett rushed him and shot Windu's shoulders. The Jedi then jumped over Fett while igniting his lightsaber. Windu swung the lightsaber twice, grazing Fett's armor and knocking the pistol from his hands. Fett then drew a dagger and rushed Windu again. The dagger only went through the Jedi's robes but Fett did manage to punch Windu's ribs. Windu countered by hitting his lightsaber against the hunter's shoulder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At this point, the Jedi Master gave Fett a chance to surrender. Fett returned the dagger to his belt, but he was taking the opportunity to release his CryoBan grenade. Fett attempted to shoot Windu while he suffered the effects of the blast, and was hit on his arm and helmet when failed. After Fett refused to surrender again, Windu knocked the dagger away. Running out of options, Fett fired the saberdart which Windu merely caught between his fingers. Knowing he had been beaten and wanting to go down fighting, Fett refused the last offer of surrender and raised his flechette pistol to force Windu to kill him. Just before the last blow could be dealt, Chancellor Palpatine entered the room with his Red Guards who ended the fight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mace Windu gave an explanation to Palpatine before leaving.
