It rested in a particularly wide, deep crevasse, and was laid out similar to Mos Eisley. The docking bays consisted of flattened depressions surrounded by protective blast walls which were scattered among the many shops and residences. To the spacers visiting the spaceport, Kig Dannen was Gellefon and everything beyond was insignificant. Kig Dannen contained Governor Schennt's domicile in the center of town as well as the Ravaging Wardog Cantina where a group of Rebels met with Watcher and Borsk Fey'lya."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
