Included in the book is a foreword by Director Gareth Edwards, a map of the galaxy, coverage on the characters such as Darth Vader, Mon Mothma, the Rebel Alliance, and the stormtroopers, plus some focus on the Death Star, as well as coverage on the new creatures, droids, and coverage on some old favorites, plus production photos for the film, interviews with the cast and crew, presentation of upcoming toy figures to promote the film, as well as a timeline for the Star Wars series thus far."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Contents"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The map provided in the magazine contains several errors. On the map, after leaving its origin world of Geonosis, the Death Star is shown to have visited Scarif and Alderaan before meeting its destruction at Yavin 4, without ever visiting Jedha, as seen in the feature film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Iego is misspelled as \"Lego.\" Kessel is put within Hutt Space instead of being located right outside its borders. The map also lists Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide as a source, although the book had not yet been released at the time of the magazine's publishing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
