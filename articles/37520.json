This offensive would leave Zaarin with a technological advantage over the loyal Imperial forces, as he could still produce his own TIE Advanced starfighters. He intended to achieve this by destroying platform ZA-13, the one remaining Imperial TIE Advanced facility in the Omar System that had been recently upgraded and retrofitted in a last ditch effort to continue production of the TIE Advanced."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "ZA-13 was defended by a pair of EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates and several squadrons of TIE/IN interceptors and TIE/fc starfighters. These forces had been deployed to safeguard the facility following the defense of ZA-13 by Vice Admiral Thrawn. Thrawn was elsewhere leading an attack on the Rebel Alliance RS-32 in an attempt to seize the Rebels' new magnetic pulse warheads. Zaarin caught on to Thrawn's plans and seized the opportunity to destroy the poorly-defended platform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zaarin assaulted the space station with a full force of TIE Bombers, TIE/IN interceptors, and Gamma-class ATR-6 assault transports. Despite the presence of the two frigates, they were immediately overwhelmed by Zaarin's superior forces. One frigate was quickly destroyed, with the other barely escaping intact.
