It looked similar to the MTT which was also made by Baktoid. It was about half the size of the MTT and had its twin blaster cannons located on the same spot as the MTT. The repulsortank also had one turret-mounted twin laser cannon located on the outside in the middle of the craft on either side. Concealed under a retractable section of its armor plating were the vehicle's main weapons: a set of twin warhead launchers capable of easily obliterating an AT-TE walker. It was equipped with ray shielded armor and could easily deflect shots from an AT-TE walker and an AV-7 Antivehicle Cannon. The tank had the logo of the CIS painted on both sides."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This tank was first used in the Second Battle of Geonosis by the Separatists. TX-21 advised Archduke Poggle the Lesser to use the tanks against the advancing Republic army. Poggle agreed and 20 tanks were deployed onto the battlefield. The Republic's AV-7 Cannons opened fire on the advancing Tanks, but even after many direct hits, the tanks kept advancing, and then launched a barrage of Mortar rounds, destroying the cannons, and the AT-TE reinforcements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tanks were only destroyed when the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Luminara Unduli placed explosives underneath the bridge the tanks were crossing and detonated them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another super tank was used inside of the factory as well.
