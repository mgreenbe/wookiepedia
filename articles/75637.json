The family claimed to be the descendants of Empress Teta, a figure only depicted in the mythical Qel-Droma Epics. By the time of the Clone Wars, the Keto family, like the planet's other noble houses, was under the control of the Mining Guild. The family was based out of the Royal District in the city of Cinnagar. During the Imperial Era, Alor Keto was the Emperor of Empress Teta, but was an ineffectual puppet of the Mining Guild, and had declining health. The rightful heir of the planet was Eara Lota, Keto's niece."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
