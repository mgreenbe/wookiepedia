A Human male native of the planet Alderaan, Ulic and his brother Cay were born to Jedi Master Lien-Tsai Qel-Droma, but trained alongside the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta under Master Arca Jeth on Arkania. In 4000 BBY, Ulic was sent with Cay and Doneeta to resolve the centuries-long Beast Wars of the planet Onderon. Although they initially sided with the monarchy of the capital city Iziz, Qel-Droma and his fellow Jedi eventually allied with the Beast Riders of Onderon after they learned that the Royal Family worshiped the dark side of the Force under the leadership of Queen Amanoa. A great battle subsequently broke out between the Queen's forces and those of the Beast Riders, and ended when Ulic's Master Jeth arrived to assist in the defeat of Amanoa, which brought temporary peace to Onderon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amanoa's husband, King Ommin, emerged from hiding in 3998 BBY to disrupt Onderon's peace by waging war in the name of the ancient Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd. Qel-Droma and the Jedi once again fought to defend Onderon, but when Master Jeth was captured by Ommin and Freedon Nadd's spirit, Qel-Droma requested aid from the Galactic Senate. Qel-Droma's help arrived in the form of the Republic Navy and a team of five additional Jedi Knights, led by novice Jedi Nomi Sunrider\u2014with whom Qel-Droma would later fall in love. Bolstered by the strength of the Navy and Sunrider's innate talent with Jedi battle meditation, Qel-Droma and his comrades rescued Jeth, defeated King Ommin and his army, and banished Freedon Nadd's ghost from the planet forever. When the Jedi learned of a political uprising in the Empress Teta system by the newly formed Krath cult, Qel-Droma acted as a liaison for the Order and joined the Republic for an assault in Tetan space. However, Qel-Droma was overcome by the Krath's Force powers and suffered near-fatal wounds as the Republic was forced into retreat by the Sith usurpers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi had become increasingly concerned with the threat posed to the galaxy by the Krath, and gathered en masse on the planet Deneba to discuss a course of action. It was there that Qel-Droma outlined a controversial plan to infiltrate the dark side cult and destroy them from within, a proposal that was rejected by nearly all those present. The Krath soon ambushed the convocation with a bombardment of war droids. Qel-Droma fought alongside his fellow Jedi, but was devastated when Jeth was unexpectedly killed. He then swore to avenge his Master through infiltration of the Krath, against the pleas of his peers. Qel-Droma traveled to Empress Teta and joined them, initially pretending to be a fallen Jedi. Soon, however, he was injected with a rage-inducing poison by Krath warlord Satal Keto and began over time to fall to the dark side himself. The Jedi soon came to retrieve him and witnessed the death of Satal Keto at Qel-Droma's hands, before the enraged Dark Jedi lashed out at his friends and refused their rescue attempt. Later, when the Jedi tried and failed to extract Qel-Droma\u2014now the Krath leader, having taken Keto's cousin Aleema Keto as his lover\u2014another of Freedon Nadd's students, Exar Kun, arrived to eliminate the Krath.

Together, they resolved to wage war on the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The new Sith Lord Qel-Droma began to consolidate his own power, first with his subjugation of the Mandalorian warrior clans and his hijacking of Republic military resources. Qel-Droma eventually led an attack on the galactic capital of Coruscant, where he was betrayed and abandoned by Aleema Keto and then captured by Jedi Knights under the leadership of Master Vodo-Siosk Baas. Scheduled to stand trial as a war criminal before the Senatorial Inquisition, Qel-Droma was ultimately rescued by Kun and Mandalore the Indomitable, with whom Qel-Droma resumed his campaign of terror against the Republic. After eliminating the treacherous Aleema Keto, Qel-Droma next joined Kun in an assault on the Jedi fortress-world of Ossus, where he slew his brother Cay in the presence of his former comrades. The act of fratricide infuriated the Jedi, and Nomi Sunrider exercised her power to sever Qel-Droma's connection to the Force. Utterly defeated and mortified by his own actions, Qel-Droma renounced his allegiance to the Sith. He then led the Jedi to Kun's stronghold on Yavin 4, where the combined forces of the Jedi and the Republic Navy defeated the fugitive Dark Lord in a final battle. After the war, a broken Qel-Droma exiled himself to Rhen Var, and hoped to live out his days in solitude. However, he was found by an aspiring Jedi\u2014Nomi Sunrider's daughter Vima, whom he agreed to train as a Jedi.

Qel-Droma had a younger brother named Cay with whom he shared a deep bond, and both were Force-sensitives with great potential. They additionally had a cousin named Duron, who was also Force-sensitive and would eventually become a Jedi Knight. Although their mother taught the Qel-Droma brothers well in many subjects, she did not instruct them in the ways of the Force, as she believed that she could not keep the necessary distance between student and Master with her children. As she did not want to begin their training too early, Lien-Tsai Qel-Droma waited until she believed Ulic and Cay had reached the proper age to send them to learn under the skilled Arkanian Jedi Master Arca Jeth. In the meantime, Qel-Droma became well known by the Alderaanian nobility, who largely disapproved of whatever he did and looked upon him with disdain. Qel-Droma felt the need to prove his worth, and threw himself entirely into his studies and extracurricular activities. Qel-Droma eventually drew the respect of his superiors as he turned his attention from challenge to challenge. However, Qel-Droma neglected his study of the Force in favor of his other pursuits, and only focused on it when all his other options were exhausted.

The Qel-Droma brothers met a fellow apprentice, Twi'lek Tott Doneeta, with whom they quickly became friends. Partly through the practice of his lightsaber skills on combat-trainer droids\u2014which he considered to be old, slow, and unchallenging\u2014Qel-Droma quickly mastered the techniques taught to him by Master Jeth. Over the course of his training, however, Qel-Droma drew concern from Jeth due to his relentless efforts and often-reckless attempts to prove himself. Qel-Droma was instructed not to act before thinking, and the apprentice vowed to rein in his natural urgings and make sure he was always in control. During his tutelage under Jeth, Qel-Droma also constructed his own lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First encounters"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Trouble on Onderon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4000 BBY, after a particularly eventful lightsaber training session which ended in a stun bolt to the midsection, Qel-Droma and his two fellow apprentices gathered before Master Jeth.

At the conclusion of his tale, Jeth informed his three apprentices that he had accepted the post of Jedi Watchman/Legends to the Onderon system. Stunned, Qel-Droma was worried that Jeth was leaving them, only to learn that the three Padawans would travel there in the Jedi Master's stead. After years of training, the brothers and Doneeta were finally assigned their first mission.

The Jedi met the Onderonian Minister of State, Novar, whose men seized Doneeta in accordance with Iziz's prohibition of non-Human visitors to the Royal Citadel. After the Qel-Droma brothers ignited their lightsabers, however, Novar unhanded Doneeta and led them to meet Queen Amanoa and the young Princess Galia. Amanoa, a Force-sensitive herself, was hesitant to work with such young Jedi, as she had expected the venerable Arca Jeth to come to Onderon\u2014Qel-Droma quickly dismissed her concerns, promising that the whole of the Jedi Order would be at her service if she embraced the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Royal Palace was soon attacked by a Beast Rider strike force, the same group that had attacked the Nebulon Ranger earlier. The Jedi quickly moved to defend the palace as Amanoa and Galia fled deeper into the building.

Despite the Jedi's best efforts, two Beast Warrior Commandos slipped past them and made their way toward the Queen and Princess's hiding place. Cay and Doneeta broke off to chase the commandos, while Qel-Droma fended off the remaining attackers, who suddenly retreated without warning. Qel-Droma went to the royal quarters to check on his brother and Doneeta, only to find that the Beast Rider commandos had kidnapped Princess Galia. Against his partners' advice, Qel-Droma promised to find the Queen's daughter, and the three left Iziz in the Nebulon Ranger. During their search above the Onderonian wilderness, the Jedi caught sight of a fortress carved into a mountain, with several Beast Riders around it.

The now-friendly bomas revealed that the Princess had been taken to a nearby stronghold, where she was to marry Oron Kira, son of Beast-Lord Modon Kira. Qel-Droma and his companions rode the bomas into the citadel and interrupted the ceremony. Qel-Droma was able to grab hold of Galia, but she surprisingly protested, as she actually wanted to marry Oron Kira. Qel-Droma unhanded the Princess, and soon afterward accepted an invitation from Modon Kira to speak during the wedding banquet. There, Oron Kira and Galia revealed to Qel-Droma that the Onderon Royal Family were dark side users, Sith cultists who worshiped the dead Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd, who had subjugated the planet centuries before. Qel-Droma was shocked, as he had previously thought Onderon too primitive a world to have been touched by the dark side. Modon Kira then came forward with a proposition\u2014he had gathered all the armies of the Beast Riders together for one final assault and wanted Qel-Droma and the Jedi to battle the dark side with them. Qel-Droma responded with a different idea\u2014he, the other Jedi, and the newlywed Kira and Galia would go to Iziz first and try to bring a peaceful end to the Beast Wars.

Accompanied by a Beast Rider escort, the Nebulon Ranger was initially fired upon by the Iziz defense guns. Although a last-second plea by Cay got them admission to the Royal Palace, Queen Amanoa quickly rebuffed Qel-Droma's offers of peace and called the power of the dark side down upon the would-be peacebringers. Qel-Droma immediately felt its effects, as his thoughts became clouded and confused and he was filled with fear. Under heavy fire from the Palace security forces\u2014who were also adept in the dark side\u2014Qel-Droma followed Galia to a secure hiding place in her father's old workshop. There, Qel-Droma told Oron Kira to signal his father to send in the Beast Rider troops and begin the battle outright. Qel-Droma soon realized that he had left his brother Cay behind in the throne room and went to retrieve him, and found his brother alive but with a severed arm. After treating Cay's wounds, Ulic brought him to their hiding place, where he watched as Cay removed the arm of a nearby droid to use as a replacement for the one cut off during the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once Cay was done, the Qel-Droma brothers made their way out of the Palace to the city ramparts, where Doneeta, Galia, and Oron Kira were watching the battle.

Suddenly, Qel-Droma spotted Master Jeth's ship, the SunGem, in the planet's atmosphere. Jeth landed on the ramparts and voiced his disappointment, especially that Qel-Droma had failed the test he had been given. Jeth revealed that he had won the battle for the Beast Riders with the exotic Force power known as battle meditation and told Qel-Droma that he should have sensed the work of the dark side the minute that he had arrived on Onderon. After their conversation, Jeth led the group down into the tomb of Freedon Nadd, below the planet's surface, where Queen Amanoa had sequestered herself. There, Qel-Droma watched as Amanoa's dark power fled her, and she died. Soon afterward, Qel-Droma attended the ceremony where Oron Kira and Galia consecrated their marriage under the laws of the Republic, merged the warring tribes of Onderon into one people, became the new King and Queen of Onderon, and finally ended the Beast Wars."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Naddist rebellion"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Attack of the cultists"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Beast Wars were over, peace still did not come easily to Onderon\u2014within two years, the planet was once again at war.

In response, Qel-Droma and his fellow Jedi Watchmen were tasked with defending Onderon. By then, Qel-Droma had moved past his training period, and had assumed the title of Jedi Knight. Master Jeth ordered that the stone sarcophagi containing the remains of Freedon Nadd and Amanoa be removed from Onderon, with the hopes that it would reduce the dark side pall still hanging over Iziz. This took on the form of a grand funeral procession through the Iziz city streets, led by Galia and Oron Kira. Qel-Droma, his brother, and Jeth marched directly behind them, and met with the monarchs, Tott Doneeta, and newly arrived Vultan Jedi Oss Wilum after the ceremony was concluded. To the Jedi group's surprise, as the sarcophagi were being loaded onto their transport, a colossal groundborer machine suddenly emerged through the planet's surface, containing hundreds of dissident members of the Royal Armed Forces now on the Naddist side. Led by the cyborg Dark Jedi Warb Null, the Naddist force attacked. While most of the Jedi immediately battled back, Qel-Droma initially stayed behind to tend to Jeth, who had been struck and injured by a dark side assault. Qel-Droma soon joined the fight himself and clashed lightsabers with Null, but the Naddists successfully gained control of the sarcophagi, their real target. Once they had achieved their goal, the darksiders immediately fled the battlefield, while Qel-Droma was nearly dragged down with them as the groundborer retreated underground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the skirmish, Qel-Droma returned to tend to the fallen Jeth, who was sure that something terrible was at work. It was then that the newly crowned Queen Galia spoke up and informed Qel-Droma and Jeth that her father, King Ommin, a dark side master himself, was still alive in a secret subterranean facility and could help them explain the dark side pall over the city. Qel-Droma, Jeth, and Galia immediately set out to meet with Ommin, who had been confined to the facility after he was stricken with a supposed wasting disease that had softened his bones and required a metal apparatus to keep him alive. Their journey led them through pitch-black tunnels, which forced Qel-Droma to use the Force to see where his eyes could not. Qel-Droma's group arrived at the subterranean fortress and met with the infirm Ommin, who spoke cryptic words about the continuing presence of Freedon Nadd in Iziz. Suddenly, the Force ghost of Nadd took shape and revealed himself to the Jedi. Jeth realized that Ommin had practiced Sith magic that he had learned from Nadd's spirit for years, the cause of the dark side that still continued to plague the city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ommin then rose, still attached to his armature, and smothered Jeth in dark side energy before Qel-Droma had a chance to help the Arkanian. At the same time, Warb Null and a squad of Naddist warriors entered the room, as Qel-Droma ignited his lightsaber and prepared to defend the Queen. As Qel-Droma battled both Null and the Naddist soldiers, he witnessed the incapacitated Jeth being carried off by Ommin. Although Null's dark power sapped some of Qel-Droma's strength, the Jedi Knight was still able to kill him and defeat the cultists. Qel-Droma suffered from a form of vertigo after his trying battle, but he still was able to escape the fortress with the Queen. However, when Qel-Droma and Galia emerged from the underground facility, they found that the Iziz Royal Palace had fallen to the Naddists, and encountered Oron Kira, Cay, and Oss Wilum among the rubble.

The rocket-jumpers arrived at a fortuitous time for Qel-Droma and his allies, as they were under siege in the Kira Fortress. As the dark side ate away at his life force, Qel-Droma and the other Jedi were unable to fight\u2014however, the Republic forces were able to track Qel-Droma's radio beacon to the forest stronghold. Led by Knight Nomi Sunrider, the relief forces cut a swath through the Naddist ranks and blew the Kira Fortress gates open. Suddenly invigorated by Sunrider's use of battle meditation, Qel-Droma and the other trapped Jedi emerged raring to fight, and the combined forces went on to win the battle. As he surveyed the battlefield after the clash, Qel-Droma came across a prone Sunrider, who had been felled by a mental Force attack. Sunrider awoke from her stupor when Qel-Droma arrived, and she described to him a vision of an emaciated man on a metal armature that she saw during the attack, which Qel-Droma recognized as King Ommin. In the meantime, preparations began for a final assault to retake Iziz and end the Freedon Nadd Uprising. Qel-Droma personally gave words of encouragement to the still-dazed Sunrider, and told her that all the Jedi had to combine to strike back at the dark side and save the kidnapped Master Jeth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once they were ready, Qel-Droma and seven other Jedi\u2014Cay, Wilum, Doneeta, Sunrider, Dace Diath, Nazzar Prince Qrrrl Toq, and Miraluka Shoaneb Culu, the latter three also part of the Republic strike team\u2014joined the battle for Iziz. Although they had to take on hundreds of dark side adepts and war droids, the Jedi force slowly but surely pushed toward Ommin's lair, as they relied on their Force sense of Jeth's anguish to guide them. In the midst of the conflict, Qel-Droma witnessed his brother Cay's mechanical arm get chopped off and tried to help him, although his brother assured him he was fine and continued to press on. After their defeat of their Naddist attackers, Qel-Droma and the Jedi pushed deeper into Ommin's fortress and eventually reached the decrepit former King himself. When Qel-Droma questioned Ommin on the whereabouts of Jeth, the darksider responded with an attack on the Jedi force with the dark side. Qel-Droma was able to fight through the darkness with the help of the light side of the Force, and he found the strength to cut through Ommin's armature with his lightsaber. Without his exoskeleton to support his softened bones, Ommin collapsed in convulsions. Still, even as he writhed on the floor, Ommin refused to give any information on Jeth's location. Suddenly, the spirit of Freedon Nadd appeared at Ommin's side and ended the old darksider's life. Freed by Ommin's death, Jeth emerged and claimed victory for the Jedi; indeed, the Naddists had been defeated in Iziz. However, Nadd, as he disappeared from sight, replied that the Jedi had actually lost, a statement which confused Qel-Droma. With the Freedon Nadd Uprising ended, Qel-Droma and Jeth's other apprentices began a campaign to fully clear Onderon of dark side influence.

However, their happiness did not last, as Arca Jeth soon sent them on another mission. There had been a coup in the Empress Teta system, located in the Deep Core, where nobles Satal and Aleema Keto seized control of the system through use of Sith magic taught to them by the late King Ommin. Assigned to deal with this problem\u2014Qel-Droma had been named Watchman of the Empress Teta system\u2014Qel-Droma and his fellow Jedi were given their objectives. Specifically, Qel-Droma was paired up with Sunrider to fly to the Empress Teta system and directly lead the joint Jedi\u2013Republic forces as they tried to save the Tetan worlds that were still resisting the coup. Qel-Droma was told to wait until Sunrider had completed a lesson in battle meditation with Jeth, so he stayed with his brother and Tott Doneeta as they watched some of the other Jedi depart for the planet Ossus. As they suspected that Freedon Nadd was at the heart of this uprising, the two Qel-Droma brothers decided to check out the Sith artifacts recovered from Ommin's possessions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After they made their way into the Jedi outpost nearby, the Qel-Droma brothers commenced their examination of the artifacts, assisted by a droid called T-12. As Ulic looked around the storeroom, T-12 handed him an unusual Sith amulet. As Qel-Droma put his hands on the object, the spirit of Freedon Nadd suddenly appeared. Nadd warned Qel-Droma that the Sith would rise again and told him not to interfere with the work of the dark side. When Qel-Droma challenged Nadd on his assertions, the former Dark Lord told the Jedi that he would be one of the \"great ones.\" Qel-Droma was confused by Nadd's prediction, and when he questioned the spirit on what he meant, Nadd did not clarify. With that, the dead Dark Lord disappeared and left Qel-Droma to ponder his words. After the incident, Qel-Droma and Sunrider traveled to the Empress Teta system to fight the Ketos and their dark side organization, the Krath. By one month later, they were aboard the Republic command ship Reliance I, where they worked with Republic Captain Orley Vanicus.

Although Qel-Droma feared that the creatures would destroy the fleet, Sunrider discerned through the Force that the grazers were mere dark side illusions. Undaunted, Qel-Droma commanded the Republic forces to move in and attack the Krath command station. As a counter, a large group of Chaos starfighters emerged from the command station and began a run on the fleet. Although Sunrider believed that these were illusory, some of the starfighters were actually real and carried out suicide runs into the Republic vessels. One of the Chaos fighters breached the Reliance's canopy, and Qel-Droma was hit and injured by a piece of debris.

Despite being heavily bandaged due to the injuries sustained in the battle at Koros Major, Qel-Droma made the trip as well. While his wounds made it difficult to walk, Qel-Droma repeatedly refused offers of help and climbed up the mountain himself. As he walked with Sunrider, Qel-Droma soon met his brother Cay and Master Jeth during the trek up the mountain, and the group finished the trip together. During the convocation, venerable spokesman Odan-Urr called Qel-Droma and Sunrider up to the stage to speak about their first-hand experiences with the Krath. Although many of the Jedi in the audience wanted to respond to the Krath threat with overwhelming military force, Qel-Droma decided to present a different plan. The Jedi Knight postulated that thousands would die in an all-out war with the Krath, and while order could be restored in the Empress Teta system, the Krath would likely survive and the dark side would continue to spread throughout the galaxy. Qel-Droma proposed that one of the Jedi should join the Krath, learn their secrets, and then destroy the conspiracy before it could extend its reach any further.

A Krath fleet arrived in the system and launched a barrage of life-pods which contained war droids, who attacked the gathered Jedi. At the same time, servant droids among the assembly unveiled hidden weapons and began their own assault on the Jedi. Qel-Droma quickly sprang to action, as he drew his lightsaber and battled the droid army. Although Qel-Droma was briefly threatened by a knife-wielding droid which slipped behind him and placed him in a chokehold, Jeth advised him on a way to escape, and the droid was destroyed.

There, he met with Neti Jedi Master Ood Bnar, who provided him with a complete history on the Empress Teta system. Qel-Droma expressed his belief that he would be a coward if he passed up an opportunity to battle the dark side, which piqued Bnar's interest. Bnar subsequently brought Qel-Droma to Odan-Urr, who was the Library's Keeper of Antiquities. Odan-Urr produced a rare Sith holocron, and used it to show Qel-Droma the story of a Jedi Knight who similarly tried to conquer the dark side from within, only to be seduced to the dark path and strike down his own master. Stunned by the images he saw, Qel-Droma lashed out at Bnar and Odan-Urr, and proclaimed that they would rather do nothing than try to defeat the dark side.

By the time of the Sith War, Qel-Droma had begun to use the dark side with great skill, including such powers as Control Mind. By drawing upon the dark side, he became even more quick and agile, able to dodge dozens of blaster bolts at the same time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the death of his brother on Ossus, Qel-Droma was completely stripped of his connection to the Force by way of a wall of light from Nomi Sunrider. Although he valiantly searched for a way to repair the loss of his Jedi powers, there was none to be found. However, his skill with a lightsaber remained, even without the Force to guide him\u2014although he could not feel the Force, he could still feel the blade. Still a talented duelist, he was able to hold his own with Sylvar, an active Jedi, even without use of the Force. He also retained a great amount of strength, both inner and physical. It was during these days, with Vima Sunrider under his tutelage, that he proved to be an able, albeit reluctant, teacher. With Sunrider's help, Qel-Droma himself learned how to use his natural talent to accomplish feats like creating sculptures, without relying on the Force like he once had. Although he lacked a connection to the Force, upon his death, his body disappeared like those of the Jedi Masters. He also gained the ability, after his death, to return to the mortal world as a Force ghost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qel-Droma wielded two lightsabers over the course of his life.  The first was a single-bladed lightsaber with a green blade and a unique emitter made up of four spikes (similar to his brother Cay's). The second light saber was also a single-bladed lightsaber, however with a yellow blade, which stayed fully operational years after he lost his Jedi powers. In battle, he often wore a mesh suit, which he later cast aside after the end of the Great Sith War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Ulic Qel-Droma first appeared in Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon, the first story arc of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Tom Veitch and released in 1993. Although Beast Wars was Qel-Droma's first actual appearance, he was first mentioned in Veitch's endnotes for the Star Wars: Dark Empire series released earlier. Qel-Droma was the protagonist of much of the Tales of the Jedi comics. He was heavily featured in the subsequent arcs The Freedon Nadd Uprising, Dark Lords of the Sith, The Sith War, and Redemption, where his story was concluded and the character killed. Qel-Droma was also portrayed in the audio dramas of the earlier Tales of the Jedi arcs, and of Dark Lords of the Sith. During his appearances in the comics, he was illustrated by several different artists: Christian Gossett, Tony Akins, Art Wetherell, and Dario Carrasco, Jr."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Tales of the Jedi audio drama, Qel-Droma was voiced by David Scott Gordon, while he was portrayed by John Cygan in the Dark Lords of the Sith adaptation. Qel-Droma later appeared as a Force ghost in The Clone Wars video game in 2002, where he was voiced by Charles Dennis. Further information on Qel-Droma was given in many different sources, ranging from roleplaying game supplements such as the Tales of the Jedi Companion and the Jedi Academy Training Manual to reference books like The New Essential Guide to Characters and Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force. He was also given entries in such works as the third edition of A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, the Star Wars Encyclopedia, and The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia. An action figure of Ulic Qel-Droma, complete with a green-colored lightsaber, is included in Star Wars: The Legacy Collection, made by Hasbro. A miniature statue of Qel-Droma is also part of the Champions of the Force set of Star Wars Miniatures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In various interviews, the people who helped make Tales of the Jedi have revealed information about the origins and development of Ulic Qel-Droma. Tom Veitch has indicated that the Tales of the Jedi characters, including Qel-Droma, were created by him and his collaborators, before being approved by Lucasfilm. Veitch originally wrote a different conclusion to Qel-Droma's story than what ended up appearing in Tales of the Jedi: Redemption, preferring his ending to what appeared in the comics. Veitch, who wrote the Dark Empire endnotes in which the character was first mentioned, told interviewer Ilene Rosenberg in 1994 that the writers of Tales of the Jedi made Qel-Droma as a sort of mirror image of Star Wars movie hero Luke Skywalker. Christian Gossett, the penciller for several Tales of the Jedi arcs, revealed in a correspondence with the Star Wars fan site Wookieepedia that he was the one who originally designed Qel-Droma, along with many other characters and objects from the comic arcs\u2014in fact, Qel-Droma was the first character that Gossett ever designed professionally. Kevin J. Anderson, a writer who worked alongside Veitch during the creation of Tales of the Jedi, divulged that Qel-Droma's ultimate fate was already decided before the Redemption arc was written and that his death was their decision."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There have been several continuity issues regarding the events of Ulic Qel-Droma's life. Many of these\u2014mostly small changes in dialogue or in the sequence of events in the Beast Wars\u2014come from differences between the story of the Tales of the Jedi comics and those of their various audio adaptations. In all cases where these two sources conflict, the comics are treated with superior canonicity in this article. More continuity differences arise from the comics and the earlier Dark Empire endnotes. For example, the endnotes state that Qel-Droma reached the rank of Jedi Master, although during the comic retelling of his life, he never became a Master. Once again, the comics are treated with superior canonicity in these particular situations. In The Clone Wars video game, a representation of Ulic Qel-Droma appears to Anakin Skywalker; there are several sources that differ on whether the form that appeared to Skywalker was Qel-Droma's Force ghost, or a simple hologram. While the Dark Reaper entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia treats the apparition as a hologram, the Encyclopedia's Force Harvester entry and The New Essential Chronology say that it was indeed Qel-Droma's spirit. For the purposes of this article, the latter option is treated as correct."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another major continuity issue is centered around the color of Ulic Qel-Droma's lightsaber. In various illustrations, Qel-Droma's lightsaber appears with no fewer than four different hues. Yellow and blue are the most common, alternately appearing in different Tales of the Jedi arcs and comics. However, the lightsaber has also been shown with a red blade and with a green blade on Tales of the Jedi covers. Additionally, the color of the weapon differs in several reference books, such as The New Essential Chronology and The New Essential Guide to Characters. For the purposes of this article, the color of Qel-Droma's blade was yellow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
