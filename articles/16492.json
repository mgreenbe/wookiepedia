At some point in his life, Besh was captured by several Balawai prospectors, who attempted to make him divulge the location of a supposed treasure grove of lammas trees, prized for their valuable wood. Such a grove did not actually exist, but the prospectors nonetheless tortured Besh, cutting off three of his left hand's fingers and ripping out his tongue. The Korun survived, but nursed a deep hatred for the offworld Balawai and, along with Lesh, joined the Summertime War, an annual battle between the Korunnai and the offworlders for cultural survival and access to Haruun Kal's bankable resources respectively."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Escorting a Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, during the onset of the Clone Wars and at the height of the Summertime War, Jedi Master Depa Billaba was dispatched to Haruun Kal to recruit Korun fighters for Republic actions against the Balawai government, who had allied themselves with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. When she stopped reporting in, her former Master, Mace Windu, was fearful of her possibly turning to the dark side. He traveled to Haruun Kal in a bid to make contact with her.

Several days later Lesh died from exposure to fever wasps due to having chewed raw thyssel bark.

Despite Vastor's success in expelling the fever wasps from Besh and Chalk, and tissue binders being applied to their wounds, Besh fell victim to a severe fungal infection.
