The Empire deployed a Harrower-class dreadnought and a complement of several Gage-class transports, three Fury-class Imperial interceptors, and scores of Mark VI Supremacy-class starfighters to attack the Republic's prototype bomber, the Gilded Meteor, on its maiden voyage in the Ferra sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response, the Republic fleet requested reinforcements over Hypori to escort the bomber to safety and provide support for its handful of Thranta-class corvettes there to repel the assailant Imperial forces. The Republic's Coruscant Aegis covert operations squadron responded to the call for help, and backup arrived over Hypori in the form of a lone ship operated by a Republic-aligned hero. Nevertheless, it successfully escorted the Gilded Meteor and destroyed much of the Sith Empire's forces, crippling the Sith dreadnought with proton torpedoes before leaving Hypori along with the Republic corvettes through hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Training ground"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the last decades of the Republic, Hypori belonged to the Techno Union.

Sidious returned to fight against Maul, easily besting his exhausted, injured apprentice and depriving him of his lightsaber. Enraged, Maul continued to attack Sidious with his fists and teeth. Pleased, Sidious appraised him for passing the final test, and Maul was given the title of Sith Lord, secretly against Darth Plagueis' wishes."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Invasion of Naboo, Hypori and the nearby planet Geonosis were transformed into secret foundry worlds for the Trade Federation, in order to bypass the Republic's new laws strictly regulating the manufacture and distribution of battle droids. The Baktoid Armor Workshop, a subsidiary of the Trade Federation, took ownership of Hypori, with the intention of constructing and maintaining the new droid factories for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet appealed to Baktoid due to its abundance of natural minerals and ore, which they planned to use as a source of raw materials for its factories. In addition, Hypori's lack of sentient inhabitants made it much easier for Baktoid to take ownership of the world. As part of their colonization efforts, Baktoid relocated an entire hive of Geonosian workers to Hypori. The Geonosians found that the planet's tough bedrock and soil proved difficult to assimilate into a proper hive-mound, but their workers eventually converted much of the planet into a series of huge underground foundries. The existence of these droid factories was kept secret from the Republic during the lead-up to the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the onset of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Daakman Barrek and his Padawan, Sha'a Gi, uncovered the Separatist operations on Hypori during an intelligence-gathering mission in the sector.

With much of the Republic forces destroyed before reaching the surface of Hypori, surviving Jedi\u2014among them Ki-Adi-Mundi, Shaak Ti, K'Kruhk, Tarr Seirr, Sha'a Gi, and Aayla Secura\u2014were ambushed by legions of B2 super battle droids and OG-9 homing spider droids led by the Kaleesh cyborg General Grievous, marking his debut as commander of the Separatist Droid Army to the Jedi in what became known as the Battle of Hypori. The ruined hulk of an Acclamator-class assault ship that had crashed into Hypori's surface became the site of an epic battle between the cyborg and the Jedi. During the battle, Tarr Seirr and Sha'a Gi were killed, and two others were severely wounded. The four surviving Jedi managed to escape with the help of the Advanced Recon Commando unit the Muunilinst 10, led by task force commander Captain Fordo. Having achieved his mission objective though sheer firepower on Hypori, Fordo was awarded the Chancellor's Service Medal, although the clone captain transferred it to CT-43/002, who died a hero at the previous Battle of Muunilinst."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The events on Hypori echoed around the surrounding region, the planet's name being one of several that the young Luke Skywalker, a moisture farmer who lived on the nearby world of Tatooine, came to associate with the Clone Wars years after the conflict's end in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though some of the battle droids were destroyed during the rescue attempt, the droid factories on Hypori remained in operation during the war.

Jabba hoped that Zann would destroy the droideka Mark IIs in a droid factory that had been constructed by Geonosians during the Clone Wars, though the Hutt was counting on Zann dying in the process, as the two were enemies. Jabba used data stored on the planet Saleucami, which Zann had recently captured, to tempt Zann with the prospect of building an army. In order to scope out the opportunity, Zann sent his associate, Urai Fen, ahead to gather intel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After landing on the planet's surface and entering the droid foundry, Zann  and Fen proceeded to the droid controls, where they deactivated the remaining droidekas in the facility. They were then captured by the bounty hunter Bossk, but Zann bribed the Trandoshan with triple the payment he was to receive from Jabba. The Hutt then revealed himself, and ordered his minions to kill Zann and all his forces. However, the Consortium managed to capture all landing zones and defeat Jabba's forces, and in the process, Fen reached the droid works and gain control of the facility's droidekas. After the victory over Jabba's forces, Zann agreed to a ceasefire with the Hutts so long as they lifted the bounty on his head and ceased attacking his operations and he promised to avoid interfering in Hutt affairs. Upon their agreement, Hypori came under the control of the Zann Consoritum, and the criminal organization used the planet's technology to continue production of droideka Mark IIs, as well as to construct Crusader-class gunships and droid works and factories on their other worlds. These new droidekas soon began to appear in the hands of mercenary groups and private armies across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
