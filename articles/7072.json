Whilst posing as a school student on a tour of a munitions factory on Anukara, Seyn Marana was offered a piece of chocolate by Anice. After turning down the offer, Marana was told by Anice that she should have it or her brother would eat it when she got home. After realizing she couldn't go through with killing innocent school students, Marana set a delay on the bomb which would allow the students to leave before the explosion. Marana noted that Anice's brother would be able to steal her candy when she got home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
