In Verena, it was custom for the names of individuals to have the same first and last name, with the middle name being the designator, including indicating the person's gender. This is due to the fact that the city was founded by a small group of clans with similar names. The city was the location of B. J. Rordan's Collectables, Rordan's Spaceship Parts and More, Rordan's Galactic Exotic Art, and the SaSassis Bar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
