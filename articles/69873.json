The war began when he, along with his friend and apprentice Darth Malak, led an invasion of the Galactic Republic in the year 3959 BBY, returning from the Unknown Regions with a massive Sith fleet, seizing control of Korriban, revitalizing the Sith Academy there and gaining access to the Star Forge early on during a mission to Rakata Prime. With the aid of veterans from the Mandalorian Wars, the Sith members who joined them, a host of Dark Jedi converts that had served with them prior, the former Jedi hoped to take over the Republic in anticipation of a greater threat posed by a Sith Empire that lurked within the unknown regions of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war, Darth Revan brought the Republic to its knees and nearly succeeded in conquering it, however, a trap set by the Jedi and unwittingly abetted by Malak left him comatose, with his mind nearly destroyed. Barely alive, he was taken from the wreckage by the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan, whose skills in battle meditation and the Force had allowed the mission to happen. Taken to the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, Revan was healed by the Jedi Council and reprogrammed to believe that he was an agent loyal to the Republic. Revan was assigned under the command of Shan, who was then placed aboard the Endar Spire. In 3956 BBY, with the intention of drawing out Revan's fragmented memories of the Star Forge, the vast space station that was the source of the seemingly endless resources of the Sith, he was taken to the ecumenopolis of Taris where a Sith fleet under the direct command of Malak was waiting in ambush."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually escaping from Taris, Revan, along with Shan, the Republic commander Carth Onasi, and several others, fled to the Dantooine Academy, where the Jedi Masters there retrained him. After several weeks, the Dantooine Council sent him and the crew of the Ebon Hawk back out into the wider galaxy to track down the Star Forge's location, at the heart of the ancient Infinite Empire of the Rakata. Later, after a number of ancient Star Maps had been uncovered, Malak led an attack against the Enclave, devastating it and further crippling the Jedi Order. After finding the last Star Map and, from it, deducing the location of the Rakatan homeworld, Revan, the Jedi, and the Republic launched the war's final battle. Revan vanquished Malak aboard the Star Forge, and the Republic successfully routed the Sith forces. With Malak dead, the Star Forge destroyed, and the Sith fleet scattered and defeated, the long and costly war came to an end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Mandalorian Neo-Crusades"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The seeds of the Jedi Civil War were sown nearly twenty years before the conflict would come to pass. Beginning in 3976 BBY, the Mandalorians, a race of warriors that descended from the Taung of ancient Coruscant, embarked upon a second campaign of conquest after reforging themselves in the wake of the defeat of the Sith Lord Exar Kun during the Great Sith War. Taking worlds and ravaging colonies throughout the galaxy beyond the edge of Republic space, the many clans of Neo-Crusaders, under the leadership of Mandalore the Ultimate, carved out a territory greater than that ruled by the Hutts in the span of little more than a decade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After hearing of what was happening beyond the Outer Rim Territories, the Galactic Senate initially declined to respond, choosing not to act in the defense of planets outside of the Republic's borders. Many senators, still weary of war after the devastation wrought by Kun and the Krath Holy Crusade, did not wish to subject their constituents to yet another conflict unless the Mandalorians threatened the Republic itself. Once he felt that his clans were sufficiently battle-hardened, Mandalore soon obliged them, taking up the secret offer of the Sith to challenge a worthy foe.

Mandalorian fleets poured into Republic space through invasion corridors blazed through adjacent sectors along the Outer Rim, sparking the Mandalorian Wars. In the opening battles of the conflict, particularly at the Battle of Serroco, forces of the Republic Navy were overwhelmed by superior numbers and tactics. Despite these unfortunate events, the Jedi Council refused the Republic's desperate pleas for aid, sensing that there was another, hidden threat that had yet to reveal itself. Though many of the youngest and brightest members of the Jedi Order were eager to combat the Mandalorians, the Jedi Masters would not allow it, preferring to keep private their own fears and plans for war."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Revanchist Intervention"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Cathar played a large part in changing the situation. During the Neo-Crusades that predated the invasion of the Republic, forces under the leadership of Cassus Fett, Mandalore's chief tactician, attacked the world of Cathar, enslaving and killing as many Cathar as possible. It was theorized later that this flagrant attack was one of many that were calculated to draw the Jedi into the conflict. The gamble paid off; after having revealed the truth about what really happened on Cathar, the young and charismatic Jedi Knight Revan\u2014who became known as \"The Revanchist\"\u2014 defied the Council and began to rally younger members of the Jedi Order, including his friend Alek, who began calling himself \"Malak\" during the wars, to his cause. After lending their support to the battered Republic fleet, they soon proved to be more than capable commanders in the field, quickly rising through the ranks. Soon, they were given direct control over the entire Republic Navy. Revan used this newly-bestowed authority to spearhead the Republic war effort; under his inspired leadership, the all-but-defeated troops of the Republic recomposed themselves and began to push the Mandalorians back. Some time during the Mandalorian Wars, Revan visited both Malachor V and Korriban, slipping closer to the dark side and alerting the Sith Emperor of the Sith Empire to his existence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a series of bitterly-contested battles on Dxun and Althir, the war's climax was fast approaching. As the fighting reached a fever pitch, Revan began to devise a way to end the war before the Republic was too weakened by the conflict to face the threat that was to come. Working in secret, he built a new Sith academy over the crumbling ruins of the older complex on Malachor V, and used the dark side energies contained within to bind the most trusted of his Force-sensitive followers to his will. These beings became the building blocks of the order of the Sith assassins\u2014a group that he kept secret even from Malak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3960 BBY, Revan forced a final confrontation with the Mandalorians above Malachor V. During the battle, Revan lured Mandalore into a direct confrontation, facing and overcoming the Mandalorian leader in single combat. However, Revan learned from the dying Mandalore that the Mandalorian Wars were arranged by the Sith, and that Mandalore had been manipulated. After ending the Mandalorian Wars with a resounding, if very costly victory thanks to the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator by one of his Jedi generals, Revan and Malak led the remainder of their forces into the Unknown Regions under the pretense of tracking down the remnants of the Mandalorian fleet. As time went by without any word from the Jedi who had won the war for them, the Republic feared that they and the soldiers under them had been lost in some great, unknown disaster in the depths of unexplored space."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Return of the Sith"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Mandalore's directions to Rekkiad, Revan and Malak hid Mandalore's Mask in the tomb of the Sith Lord Dramath the Second, and they followed the trail to the planet Nathema and then to Dromund Kaas itself. However, they were led into a trap by the Sith Emperor, who broke the wills of the two Jedi Knights, making them his servants and anointing them as Dark Lords of the Sith. The Emperor then sent the pair back to the Republic as advance agents, tasking them with the mission of searching for the Star Forge, an ancient Rakatan superweapon, to accelerate his plans to exact revenge on the Jedi and the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan and Malak found a Rakatan Star Map in the ancient burial mounds on Dantooine, near the Jedi Enclave. After successfully passing the \"trials\" set for them by the guard droid that had been left behind by the so called \"builders,\" they were given access to the Star Map. Moments before they went beyond the door that led to the dark side artifact, however, Malak warned Revan that stepping beyond this threshold would mean that they could never return to the Jedi Order. Despite this warning, Revan accessed the Star Map, along with Malak, and they later discovered Star Maps on Kashyyyk, Manaan, Korriban, and Tatooine. Having triangulated the Star Forge's location, the two traveled to the Rakata system, but they broke free of the Emperor's control and established their own empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fueled by the dark side and drawing raw materials from the star over which it had been constructed, the space station was both an automated factory and battle dreadnaught, capable of manufacturing a virtually endless supply of ships, droids, and other materials of war rapidly and on an unprecedented scale. In the hands of Revan, the Star Forge would become the heart of a new Sith war effort. From the upper levels of the factory complex, which was hidden within the unmapped Rakata system, Revan founded his new empire, bringing with him all those who had sworn their service to his cause. Revan and Malak returned to Korriban and seized control of the tombworld, establishing a new Sith Academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The teachings of the dark side began to filter down through the rank-and-file of the Republic military that had been placed under the direct command of Revan and Malak. Nearly all of those who had served under him swore their loyalty to Revan over that of the rest of the Republic and the Jedi Order; included among them were some of the top military leaders of the Army and Navy, such as General Derred, and Mon Halan. As they forsook their oaths and followed him beyond known space, Revan's corruption spread downward, forming the core of his new Sith Empire. In addition, Revan also commissioned the creation of HK-47 and other assassin droids like him to carry out politically-motivated assassinations all over the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The war"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early campaigns"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The shipyards of Foerost"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located in the Deep Core, the shipyards at Foerost was one of the largest such facilities in use by the Republic Navy. Forty years prior, during the height of the Great Sith War, the yards had been raided by a combined force of Krath and Mandalorians, during which they stole approximately three hundred warships for use in an attack on Coruscant. When Revan and Malak, now called Darth Revan and Darth Malak, declared themselves to be the new Dark Lords of the Sith, one of their first overt acts was to execute a repeat of this raid; using codes given to them by Saul Karath, Sith bombers passed through the perimeter sensor nets without being detected and began ravaging the inner defenses. As the Republic attempted to mount a defense, many of their warships were boarded and seized by Sith troopers; these newly-commandeered vessels were quick to join with the fleet of Sith vessels that had arrived to ensure the success of the raid. Thusly armed, the forces under the two former Jedi began their assault on the unsuspecting galaxy."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Conquering an empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Remembering their leadership during the Mandalorian Wars, large numbers of Republic officers and soldiers began to defect to the new Dark Lords of the Sith. Consequently, the two Sith Lords were able to rapidly carve out a new Sith Empire without needing to commit to much fighting. Battles were fought at Roche, Axxila, Gizer and Randon as Revan and Malak expanded their empire. Additional actions at Yag'Dhul secured a pocket of space around the Rimma Trade Route and Corellian Trade Spine crossroads and delivered the Tapani sector and the shipyards of Fondor to the Sith. Other pockets of Sith space emerged around the Allanteen system and Gamorr. In the Core Worlds, Corellia, Duro and Bellassa came under Sith control. Sith attempts to break out of these pockets throughout the war were unsuccessful, however, with the Republic keeping them contained with victories at Commenor, Denon, Devaron, Rhommamool and Foless. Despite this, the new Sith Empire eventually came to control a third of the settled galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeing the need for corporate assistance in providing necessary materi\u00e9l for the war effort, Revan also entered into a partnership with Czerka Corporation, a galaxy-spanning conglomerate with such diverse interests as mining, slaving, and manufacturing items such as arms, armor, and droids. Offered a trade monopoly within Sith space, the corporation helped to sponsor the establishment and growth of the Dreshdae colony on Korriban as part of their supply network. The corporation continued to provide logistical support for the Sith Empire throughout the course of the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pollard Seario was one such high-ranking corporate officer; he offered control of one of the corporation's hidden military research facilities, dubbed Czerka 431 to the Sith. Among the activities performed there included experiments on Juggernaut war droids, performed by scientist Joni Ree. Ree, hoping to help the Republic, provided the outpost's location, hoping to escape in the ensuing attack. The Republic sent a small force, which succeeded in destroying the base. Ree, along with three other soldiers, was then sent by the Republic to AB-343, which they had captured near the start of the war, in order to acquire any possible intelligence. Not wishing to reveal their alliance, the Sith sent an assassin to eliminate the team. The GenoHaradan bounty hunter guild also sent an assassin, as they believed that it was in their best interest for the alliance between Czerka and the Sith to remain unknown.

As a test of his loyalty, he was ordered by Darth Malak to bombard the strategically-placed Republic world of Telos IV. Given command of a fleet of Sith warships, Karath surrounded the planet and demanded that its government surrender. After being rebuffed by the local government, he ordered his fleet to commence a devastating orbital bombardment. The resulting attack was carried out with brutal efficiency, scourging the surface of the once-lush and prosperous world of all animal and plant life and causing the atmosphere to degrade into a miasma of toxic vapors that produced acid rain. While some citizens were able to escape on intra-system shuttles, millions were killed, and many more died soon after due to medical supply shortages and the after-effects of the bombardment. Karath's forces, meanwhile, departed the system, allowing the evacuation ships to survive unmolested so that the refugees contained therein would stand as testimony to what the Sith were capable of. A nearby Republic task force, with which the Commander Carth Onasi was serving, arrived in the system shortly afterward, but by then it was too late to do anything more than ensure the evacuees were able to reach safety."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Strike on Iridonia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith were interested in capturing the Zabrak homeworld, Iridonia and destroying the Republic fleet based there, so they sent the former Jedi, Acaadi, to prepare the planet for an attack. He infiltrated a band of Mandalorians, who had been stranded on the planet following the Mandalorian Wars. Over the next few months, they came under Acaadi's leadership and he had them destroy a Republic military communications center on the planet, in preparation for the Sith attack. Afterward, Acaadi no longer needed the Mandalorians, so he rid himself of them by having some of them run into his old comrade, the Jedi Duqua Dar. Acaadi then killed the Mandalorians and rescued Dar from them, before proceeding to persuade him that the Jedi were holding him back and that he should leave the Order. They were overheard by a group of Jedi and spacers, who had been working with Dar, and Acaadi and Dar were forced to flee. They made their way to a secret hangar on the edge of the city of Wortan and Dar waited there along with some Sith commandos, while Acaadi and some commandos flew off in a shuttle to sabotage the flagship of the Republic fleet above Iridonia, Champion of Iridonia.

However, a large number of Republic ships defected to the Sith during the course of the battle, and the Sith were ultimately able to secure Iridonia.

However, the ship's active sensors were detected by the Republic, which sent a strike force to attack the cruiser. With Glovoc concentrating all of his attention on Nyriaan, the Sith did not detect the approaching Republic ships until it was too late for them to escape. The resulting battle was very violent and the Sith succeeded in destroying three Republic cruisers and many Republic starfighters. However, the Republic forces inflicted heavy fire on the Dying Sun and fired many torpedos at it. The ship was crippled and eventually became caught in Nyriaan's gravity well.

In the hopes of ushering in a new phase of the war, or at least to give them breathing space, the Jedi Council drafted a plan by which they could capture both Sith Lords, thus depriving the Sith of their greatest leader and tactician. A two-part plan was put into action; first, a group of Republic operatives aided by a pair of Jedi acquired data on the Sith Lord's fleet on Sernpidal. With this data, the Jedi and Republic, aided by the talents of a young Jedi Padawan named Bastila Shan, who had mastered the art of battle meditation at a young age, a small force of Republic warships engaged the fleet of Darths Revan and Malak. While the two sides fought, Shan, accompanied by a number of Jedi Knights, boarded Revan's flagship, overcoming his guards and cornering the Dark Lord on the bridge of his command ship. However, Malak became aware of what was happening and, in a bold maneuver, he ordered the ships under his command to fire upon the bridge of his mentor, intending to kill not only the Jedi boarding party, but his own friend in order to claim the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith for himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to the newly self-proclaimed Dark Lord, however, Revan was still very much alive.

Hoping to save his life and, perhaps, bring about his redemption, Shan took Revan's body from the wreckage of the warship's command deck, escaping from the battle and bringing him to the Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council.

Although he was far from Revan's equal in strategy or tactics, and was also unaware of Revan's many secret dealings and projects, such as the Sith assassins and the academy at Malachor V,[source?] the new Dark Lord did have numbers\u2014and the Star Forge\u2014on his side. Even as he shifted the scope of his military campaign from one of conquest and conversion to a series of massacres intended to demonstrate his resolve, Malak undertook an active side quest aimed at capturing or eliminating the Jedi Bastila Shan, whose battle meditation he both coveted and feared. The new Dark Lord reasoned that, if he could not have her and her talents at his side, then she had to die in order to secure the chances of success for his war to seize the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Jedi worked on the severely-wounded Revan, planting within him the belief that he was a loyal soldier of the Republic serving under Shan's command, Malak prepared a trap of his own, which he sprung on the small Republic fleet led by the Endar Spire, a Hammerhead-class cruiser, over the Outer Rim ecumenopolis of Taris. In the skirmish that resulted, Shan, Revan, and Carth Onasi, along with a small number of Republic soldiers and crewers, escaped the doomed vessel, landing in different spots on the surface of Taris; Shan landed somewhere in the Lower City while the pod containing Onsai and Revan impacted upon a pedestrian walkway in the Upper City.

With little else to do, Carth, along with Revan's new identity, began to search Taris for clues as to what had happened to Shan, believing her to be the key to eventually stopping the Sith\u2014if that was even possible. Eventually, working with members of the Hidden Beks gang and with help from the streetwise duo of Mission Vao and Zaalbar, the two Republic soldiers were able to gain an approximation of where Shan was being held and why\u2014as the Vulkars' share of the victory prize for the Tarisian Season Opener swoop race. Seeing a chance to rescue her, Revan accepted Gadon Thek's offer to infiltrate the Black Vulkars' base in order to retake a prototype swoop engine accelerator that had been stolen from the Beks; in return, Thek, leader of the Beks, would let Revan enter the swoop race under the Bek banner. After winning the race with a surprising upset, ostensibly having never piloted swoop bikes before, Revan was accused by the Vulkars' leader, Brejik, of cheating; when Brejik refused to release the hitherto unconscious Shan, she used the Force to free herself.

Sensing an opportunity to further his own interests, since Kang had not been paying him the credits that had been promised, Ordo offered Revan a deal: in exchange for the party breaking into the Sith-controlled military base on Taris and stealing the codes necessary for a ship to leave unmolested by the Sith in orbit, he would offer them access to their ticket out, Kang's personal starship, the Dynamic-class freighter Ebon Hawk. With the aid of the custom-built astromech droid T3-M4, Revan, Shan, and Onasi were able to enter the base. After clearing it out and defeating the Sith Governor in charge, the trio met up with Ordo at Javyar's Cantina in the Lower City. The mercenary then took Revan to Kang's estate, ostensibly in order to recruit him into the Exchange, however it was instead a ruse to get them inside.

As a last-ditch measure, and in keeping with his personality, he ordered Admiral Saul Karath to begin a systematic bombardment of the planet. A somewhat hesitant Admiral Karath complied, noting that it would take several hours to reposition the fleet in order to conduct such an operation. This delay would prove to be costly, as it was during that time that Revan and Ordo succeeded in stealing Kang's prized freighter, eliminating the crime boss and, in appearance, Calo Nord as well, even as the Sith bombardment began. Flying amidst a deluge of turbolaser blasts that was fast turning the city-world into flaming rubble, the Ebon Hawk swooped by the apartment where the rest of Revan's companions were staying, picking them up and angling hard for the stars.

Over the following several weeks Revan went through intense remedial Jedi training, working with Shan under the supervision of Jedi Master Zhar Lestin. After proving his knowledge of the Jedi Code, constructing a new lightsaber, and seeking out and redeeming the fallen Cathar Jedi Juhani, Revan proved to Lestin that he was ready to become a Padawan; thus proven, he, Shan, and Onasi were sent out to investigate the ruins from the vision that the two Jedi had shared. What they found within confirmed what the Jedi Order had previously thought, that Revan and Malak, after falling to the dark side, had sought out and found the Star Forge by means of a series of Star Maps.

Shortly before his departure into the Unknown Regions, Shan, concerned that Revan may not return, implored the astromech droid T3-M4 to find someone capable of helping him, which the droid did, in the form of the Jedi Exile."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Carth Onasi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A native of Telos IV, Carth Onasi was serving in the Republic Navy when the Mandalorian Wars erupted, earning the rank of lieutenant in the wake of the Battle of Serroco. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Admiral Karath, he fought with distinction during the conflict, earning many decorations throughout the course of the war. One of the few soldiers who remained loyal to the Republic after Malachor V, Onasi was shocked when Karath proposed that he \"think about his own survival,\" though he did not immediately realize that his mentor was trying to recruit him into the Sith. Onasi took this betrayal hard, but what happened during the Battle of Foreost, and particularly the bombing of his homeworld that saw the death of his wife, Morgana and the disappearance of his son, Dustil, inspired a very strong desire for vengeance against Revan's Sith, and Karath in particular, within him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stationed aboard the Endar Spire with Shan and, unknown to him, Revan, Onasi, now a commander, eventually ended up on Taris after the warship was destroyed. After escaping that world, he and the rest of those aboard the Ebon Hawk fled to Dantooine, where in time he would be sent along with Revan, Shan, and the others to seek out the location of the Star Forge. Serving as the freighter's pilot, he also participated in the successful escape of the ship and crew from his former mentor's vessel after having gotten the chance to face Karath in battle. Though the revelation that the one with whom he traveled was in fact Revan disturbed him, it nonetheless did not dispel his belief in the mission or of Revan's intentions. It was Shan who sent out the call for Republic reinforcements in the Lehon system to destroy the Star Forge, and it was he who advised Forn Dodonna and Vandar Tokare as to the situation in the unfolding battle. Following the war's conclusion, he was promoted to the rank of admiral and, acting on orders from Revan before the latter's departure from known space, took charge of the Republic's recovery efforts. Five years later, he participated in the Battle of Telos IV, as the commander of the reinforcement fleet dispatched to thwart Darth Nihilus's attack on Citadel Station."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Vandar Tokare"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A respected Jedi Master who was seated both on the Dantooine Enclave Council and the Jedi High Council, Vandar Tokare was one of the foremost leaders of the Jedi Order at the time of the Mandalorian Wars.

Giving his approval to the attempt to capture Revan, he also presided over the Council's decision to use the memories of the comatose Revan against the Sith. Later, when Revan, unaware of who he was, was brought before the Dantooine Council by Bastila Shan, Tokare kept the other Masters present, Dorak, Vrook Lamar, and Zhar Lestin, in check lest they accidentally let slip certain information; at the time Revan was, in fact, the only one present who did not know the true extent of what the Council had done. Tokare concluded for the Council present that Revan was to be retrained as a Jedi, and it was also he who set the crew of the Ebon Hawk out into the galaxy in order to track down the Star Forge. Escaping along with the other Masters the attack launched on Dantooine by Darth Malak, he returned to command the Jedi contingent that participated in the Battle of Rakata Prime. Around five years later, he would perish along with many other Jedi at the Conclave on Katarr, when Darth Nihilus used his power to destroy all life on the planet in order to feed his hunger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Chris Avellone, the retroactively applied name \"Jedi Civil War\" came from Obsidian Entertainment, and it was approved by LucasArts and Lucasfilm on the first pass, citing that the war was fought primarily between the Republic and a Sith Empire that was, at its core, made up of forces formerly of the Republic. Additionally, it could be seen as another galactic civil war in which Jedi, both light and dark, played vital roles on both sides.
