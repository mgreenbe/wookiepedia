It evoked the sentiment common on Ukio that the Galactic Republic was not worth the membership because of its dispassionate and distant Senate. The poster depicted the Senate Building at the time of the Clone Wars, and had text in both High Galactic and Aurebesh. The Aurebesh stated, \"The winds of liberty are blowing this way, can you feel them?\", while the High Galactic at the top stated, \"There are 2000 senators in this building,\" and slightly below that, \"None of them care about you.\" Written at the very bottom of the poster, in High Galactic was \"Confederacy of Independent Systems.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
