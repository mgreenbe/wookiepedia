A jungle island, Horizon Island was the site of the port town of Raider's Cove during the era of the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, and the town was located on the eastern end of the island. The Western Jungle Expanse lay to the west of the city, with hills and canyons such as Skyline River Pass and Gorge Hollow River Pass forming a barrier between the two. The Nova Blades, a pirate gang, made their headquarters in the crashed starship Aggressor that lay in the western mountains of the island. Shaclaws, known locally as shore crabs, were common along the beaches, and the jungles were filled with tonitran lizards, jungle wampas, krak'jyas, and orobirds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
