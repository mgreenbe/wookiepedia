It was first spotted during the raid on Science Station Youst just about to enter hyperspace. The shuttle was also used by Harkov to hide in space station DS 5. It was then sent out as a decoy attempt as part of Harkov's attempt to escape. However Maarek Stele not only saw through the deception, he also stopped Harkov, who was trying to escape in the YT-1300 Geddawai. It was then destroyed as there was no use for it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
