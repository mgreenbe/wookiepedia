The First Order won but before they could jump away Iden, Zay, and Shriv boarded in stolen tie fighters which were destroyed by the hyperdrive but all three of the trio lived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trio soon found schematics for the Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought. They then split up; Shriv went to find a way out while Iden and Zay went to destroy the hyperdrive so they could escape. Iden and Zay were met with heavy resistance from First Order troops. Zay was able to redirect the personnel to the communications area. Once the planted the last charge, Hask showed up and held Zay at gunpoint. Iden dropped her weapon as she couldn't hit Hask and not Zay. Hask taunted her and went to kill her however Zay broke free of his grip and pushed his shots away and made him drop his gun. Hask shoved Zay off the bridge to be grabbed by Iden. Zay gave Iden her gun and she shot Hask who fell off the bridge into the hyperdrive core to his death. They then destroyed the hyperdrive and saw Starkiller base in the distance. Iden however soon died as she had been hit in the chest by Hask earlier. This left Zay very sad but she soon saw the destruction of Starkiller Base. She and Shriv escaped to D'Qar and brought the schematics to Leia who then sent them to find allies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The schematics allowed the Resistance to destroy the Fulminatrix in the Battle of D'Qar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
