A scrounger and collector of junk, he adopted an infant Human named Mora after finding her in the rubble of her ruined home after her family was killed. As a seer, Ch'no knew that the young girl would later be revealed as the sole living heir to the ruling house of M'haeli, but he kept that secret for a long time. Other H'drachi did not enjoy the presence of Humans on M'haeli, seeing them as a scourge to the planet. Ch'no and Mora had the ability to disrupt the time-streams on M'haeli, making travel among other H'drachi without detection nearly impossible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
