When the Clantaani gunslinger Longo Two-Guns arrived on Tatooine with his gang looking to carved out a niche, he quickly made contact with Miktha. The Jawa then introduced the gang leader to the Trandoshan Frossk and two Nikto, Ona Kragg and Naktu Jeera. The three agreed to join with Two-guns, and each brought additional men of their own to boost the groups size. With his newly expanded gang, Longo and his associates, including Miktha, took over the settlement of Mos Gamos, where they established a base of operations within an old podracer warehouse. The group then began to take over local criminal operations and quickly clashed with Jabba Desilijic Tiure, a Hutt crime lord also based on the planet. The group soon allied with Jabba's rival, Gardulla Besadii the Elder in a death stick distribution deal and began targeting Jabba in some of their operations. In 31 BBY Miktha and another gang member, Radd Hardwikk, attempted to assassinate their Hutt enemy by distributing explosive chubas at the Boonta Eve Classic podracing event he attended in the Mos Eisley spaceport. The plan however was unsuccessful, with the chubas not killing Jabba, but causing a small riot instead and reducing the profits made from foodstuff sales at the event. For inciting the riot the Hutt placed a bounty on Miktha's head, offering 100 for his capture alive, or 50 for his death. The bounty gave the Jawa's last known location as the peripheral region of Mos Eisley and claimed he was affiliated with other Jawas, whom Jabba considered scum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Following year, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett traveled to Tatooine whilst pursuing leads on the Bando Gora cult, which suggested Gardulla worked with them.
