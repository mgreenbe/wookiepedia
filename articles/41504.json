Bearing a symbiotic relationship with sarlaccs, they built their nests out of sticks and mud over sarlacc pits so that wandering animals mistook the hole for solid ground and fell into it. The birds then picked clean the bones of whatever the sarlaccs did not finish. Duns thackstons could be identified by the three dark purple spots on their chests."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
