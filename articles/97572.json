Following the Confederacy's defeat at the conclusion of the conflict in 19 BBY, Ninan accompanied the Munificent-class star frigate Sa Nalaor as it attempted to flee to the outskirts of the galaxy in order to escape from the newly-formed Galactic Empire. After being crippled by fire from pursuing Imperial cruisers, the warship crash-landed on the planet Cholganna, leaving Ninan and the surviving crew stranded on the world. The Separatists established a base, known as the Retreat, in which to shelter from Cholganna's hostile wildlife, and Ninan was put in charge of running the facility's garage. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the survivors were yet to be rescued, and Ninan had began to suffer from the onset of old age. With his movements limited, he rarely left the garage, and he was assisted in his duties by several other survivors and by the astromech droid R2-6N."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
