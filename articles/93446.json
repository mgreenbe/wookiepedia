They were wrapped around the user's head and, with the aid of a built-in micro tracking processor, tracked movement and highlighted moving objects with color-coded warnings. This allowed the wearer to see moving enemies with ease, even those attempting to be stealthy. However, its effect could be disorienting, especially in the heat of combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
