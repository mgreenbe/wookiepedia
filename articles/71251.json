When Imperial troops invaded with a surface attack, his platoon set out to assist Ion Control when one of his men noticed Imperial troops approaching from the South Ridge. His squad was attacked by an AT-ST, but Jobin was able to destroy it with a satchel charge and marched into the Ion Control center, where he killed a stormtrooper with an icicle. It was Jobin who activated Echo Base's v-150 anti-orbital ion cannon, which disabled an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer in orbit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was killed in the battle at the hands of Darth Vader while attempting to escape Echo Base. When his squad tried to escape on a transport, Lord Vader and his stormtroopers came upon them. While he was running towards the transport, Jobin was shot and gave another Rebel trooper a holo-recording for his mother. Though he shot at Darth Vader, his efforts were to no avail. Vader levitated him off the ground and began to choke him. Vader attempted to interrogate the dying man, but Jobin refused to surrender any information, even spitting on him as an act of defiance.
