The Rebels were searching for schematics for prototypes of the TIE Series of vessels which Sienar designed for the Empire, hoping that they could identify weaknesses in the future products to use against them in combat. During the attack, the MI-series security droid, MI-726, who had been assigned to the board member to defend his home, went rogue and abandoned its master and his house, fleeing the scene."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack was created as part of the \"Bounties to Die For\", a 2001 article in the sixth issue of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Gamer magazine series.
