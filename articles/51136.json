This attack was timed as the station's personnel were evacuating the station due to a warning from Antan Azzameen. Ace and Aeron Azzameen were present as well. Ace, in the Otana, was picking up a container of warheads, while Aeron was getting to the safe to collect some valuables there. By the time the two escaped with what they wanted, the Furious had managed to capture the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
