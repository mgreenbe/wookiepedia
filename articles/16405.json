When the droids could not be located, the Emperor instructed the apprentice to visit Jabba Desilijic Tiure at the Hutt's Tatooine palace and use the crime lord's spy network to locate the droids. As he began his journey, Starkiller was contacted by Berrus via comlink. The captain informed Starkiller of his duty to offer assistance should the Sith apprentice require it. After the apprentice dealt with a group of Jawas, Berrus noted that an immobile sandcrawler was blocking the quickest path to Jabba's palace. Starkiller had no difficulty in removing the obstacle, Force-pushing it out of his way down into the desert below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After reaching the palace and defeating several Gamorrean guards, Starkiller was permitted to come before Jabba. Though the Hutt claimed that his spies would be unable to find two droids among the numerous others on the world, his protocol droid blurted out that a pair of droids matching the specifications of the ones that Starkiller was searching for had been located in the city of Mos Eisley. Before Starkiller could do anything, Jabba pressed a control and watched as the apprentice dropped down into the rancor pit beneath his throne room. Starkiller fought his way past the rancor and additional guards before Berrus again contacted him. He suggested that a squadron of stormtroopers be dispatched to capture the droids in Mos Eisley, but Starkiller immediately dismissed the offer, preferring to handle the task himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith apprentice continued his escape from Jabba's palace, and as he neared a hangar bay containing Jabba's sail barge and desert skiffs, Berrus attempted to warn Starkiller that their communications were being jammed.

Starkiller escaped the palace on a skiff to Mos Eisley, where he located the two droids escaping onboard the YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon.
