As it happened, Bib Fortuna, Jabba's majordomo, had plans of his own; he and six co-conspirators hoped to capture Jabba alive so that they could pry out as many secrets as possible before killing him. When the Freckers were unleashed upon the court, instead of carrying out his own plan, Fortuna ordered his men to kill the Freckers. The rodents in turn killed all of Fortuna's men save for Nivek, who had been blinded by the Freckers' bites and began yelling about \"the plan\". Fortuna, fearing discovery, shot the thug."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
