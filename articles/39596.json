When visiting the parents of Padm\u00e9 Amidala at their home on Naboo, Dorm\u00e9 was carving inside a greenhouse with Amidala's father Ruwee when he complimented her skills as a carver and suggested that after Amidala was finished with politics, Dorm\u00e9 wouldn't have any trouble finding something to do at the Naberrie house. Dorm\u00e9 thanked Ruwee before explaining that her great-grandmother had taught her how to carve, adding that it was easier for her to do now that she was older and sewing made her joints ache. Dorm\u00e9 then said that she was looking forward to visiting her great-grandmother when she swapped places with fellow handmaiden Cord\u00e9 a couple of days later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
