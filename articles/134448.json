And not just any paper, but custom-designed paper illustrated with art from the movies. Star Wars\u00ae Origami marries the fun of paper folding with the obsession of Star Wars. Like The Joy of Origami and Origami on the Go, this book puts an original spin on an ancient art. And like Star Wars\u00ae Scanimation\u00ae and Star Wars\u00ae Fandex\u00ae, it's a fresh take on Star Wars mania."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chris Alexander is a master folder and founder of the popular website StarWarsOrigami.com, and here are 36 models, clearly explained, that range in difficulty from Youngling (easy) to Padawan (medium), Jedi Knight (difficult), and Jedi Master (tricky!).
