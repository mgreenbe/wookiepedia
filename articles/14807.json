During their advance towards the Core Worlds and campaigns against the warlords of the Galactic Empire, New Republic forces moved from Kashyyyk to strike Teradoc's people at his fortress world Togoria, checking the warlord's ambitions, though with costly results. However, the Thanos system stayed in the Greater Maldrood. It was definitely liberated three years later, during the Post-Zsinj campaign. After this battle, the New Republic Third Battle Group fought its way to Lantillies where it linked up with Contruum's defense force and established a beachhead on the Perlemian Trade Route."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
