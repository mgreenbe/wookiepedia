This was part of an infiltration scheme devised by SIS Senior Agent Zane, who was determined to test the Imperial penal system to locate Dusk 9, an Imperial black ops prison and research station, though he told them they were going to rescue POWs. However, the Deadeyes didn't anticipate that the Imperials would split them up as they were shipped offworld to perform menial labor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After taking a personal interest in the situation, Meteor and Jorgan met with Republic Strategic Information Service Agent Jonas Balkar to track down the squad. Zane warned Havoc against interference in his operation, fearing it may ruin his plan. Nonetheless, Havoc Squad sought out to find the Deadeyes using information taken from Imperial databanks. They first find Torve on Tatooine before locating the rest of the unit on Hoth, though sadly two members, Trace and Koplin died from the cold."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
