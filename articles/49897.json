The ability was also capable of curing the user's target of poisoning. At least in the rare case of a Force dyad, the user was able to transfer enough of their own Force energy to bring their target\u2014the other half of their bond\u2014back to life, though at the cost of their own."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Alternate applications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An alternate usage of Force healing was described in the sacred Jedi texts, specifically the Chronicles of Brus-bu. The method in question detailed the ability to heal a damaged kyber crystal through the use of Force healing.

She was a member of the Circle of Jedi Healers and served as the overseer of the Medical Corps. Even during her deployment as a Jedi General during the Clone Wars, Allie continued to hone her healing abilities. Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee could also use this ability. Anakin Skywalker used a variation of this ability on Mortis, with help from the mortally wounded Force-wielder known as the Daughter, and drained her Force energy to revive Ahsoka Tano."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 9 ABY, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and his allies traveled to Nevarro to put an end to the bounty placed on the Force-sensitive infant Grogu. In preparation for a Skirmish on Nevarro, Djarin and his allies camped out in an uninhabited region of the planet. During the night, several native reptavians attacked the party. Although the creatures were fought off, Greef Karga sustained a venomous wound to his right arm. In response, Grogu healed Karga's wound using the Force, although the effort greatly strained the infant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35 ABY, the Jedi Padawan Rey and her comrades in the Resistance encountered a vexis on Pasaana after sinking into an underground tunnel system through the Shifting Mires. Rey's companions C-3PO and Poe Dameron feared the creature, believing that there was no way past the vexis and that it was hostile. However, Rey realized the vexis was injured and approached the creature. Using the Force, Rey healed the vexis' wound and soothed its mind. The creature subsequently slivered off, revealing a passageway back to the surface that it had initially been blocking."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, during a Mission to Kef Bir, Rey dueled Supreme Leader Kylo Ren on the ruins of the second Death Star. Although Ren was dominating most of the duel, he was caught off guard when he sensed the death of his mother Leia Organa, allowing Rey to impale him with his own weapon. Realizing she had attempted to slay Ren in an act of rage, Rey immediately regretted her actions. Rey then proceeded to heal Kylo Ren's wound using the Force, before fleeing the planet in Ren's TIE whisper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Mission to Kef Bir, Rey lost her life in battle against the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious during the Battle of Exegol. Ben Solo, who had since discarded his Kylo Ren identity and opposed Sidious alongside Rey, was a dyad in the Force with the aforementioned Jedi. As such, he was able to use Force healing to restore Rey's life. However, the amount of vitality required for her resurrection completely drained Solo, who subsequently vanished into the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Similar to the method prescribed by the Chronicles of Brus-bu, it is possible to restore a corrupted, red-colored kyber crystal. Ahsoka Tano purified two such crystals she recovered from the fallen Sixth Brother's lightsaber following their duel on Raada. With the presence of the dark side removed, the healed crystals turned white, following which the former Jedi incorporated them into her new lightsabers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
