As he fled, Vanth stole a camtono of silicax oxalate crystals from a Collective transport, but the rest of Mos Pelgo's population were forced into slavery overnight. The firm's occupation weakened the town, but it only lasted a few days, as Vanth used the crystals to buy a set of Mandalorian armor from Jawas. Now donning this gear, which had once belonged to legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett, the sheriff returned to the town to liberate it. Entering the same cantina, he killed all Collective members inside before leaving the building. Seeing another team of Collective members attempt to flee on a landspeeder, Vanth fired the rocket on the armor's jetpack, which took out the vehicle and its occupants."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vanth continued to defend Mos Pelgo with the armor, fighting enemies ranging from the Red Key Raiders to Tusken Raiders.
