The temple was constructed using carbon and nova crystals, and was placed within the range of a power core to keep the building running efficiently. It had a square base with a column on each corner and a tower in its center, similar to other types of Jedi temples. The Alaris Prime temple was gray with orange stripes on the higher level of the tower and at the midsection of each column."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi temple was constructed at some point between 39 BBY and 36 BBY, during the war for the colonization of Alaris Prime fought between the rightful Wookiee colonists and the company known as the Trade Federation. The construction came about in response to the discovery of a Jedi holocron within a camp belonging to Chewbacca's ally, Shoran. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, acting as an advisor to the Wookiees on behalf of the Jedi Order, gained permission from the Jedi High Council to build the temple, where the holocron could be kept safe. With its construction, Jinn sent his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Alaris Prime to gather the holocron and store it within the temple, as only a Force-sensitive individual could hold it. Within the temple, the holocron was able to generate a steady supply of nova crystals for Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi temple on Alaris Prime was first mentioned in the 2001 Prima Games' strategy guide for the LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds before appearing in the game itself. It appeared in the sixth level of the Wookiee tutorial campaign titled \"Allies and Jedi,\" where the player can learn how to build Jedi temples and use them to create Padawans and collect holocrons. The temple costs 180 units of carbon and twenty-five nova crystals to build. The player is instructed to create a generic Padawan unit at the temple, whom Jinn introduces as Kenobi. If the player has enough resources, they can create more Padawans and additional temples."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
