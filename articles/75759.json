After the evacuation of Hoth in 3 ABY, Keyser Salm was recruited by Commander Wedge Antilles and Lieutenant Wes Janson into the reformed Red Squadron. Janson had previously flown recon with Salm, and Janson considered him to be green, but teachable. He was assigned the callsign Red Two and flew a T-65B X-wing starfighter as Wes Janson's wingman in an attack on nearby pirates that threatened the safety of their rendezvous point. The battle got three other members of the Red Squadron killed, but they were successful in driving away the pirates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keyser Salm appeared in the 2020 short-story Rendezvous Point, written by Jason Fry. Fry intended for the character to be the unnamed Y-wing pilot \"Red Two\" who participated in the Battle of Endor seen in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi released in 1983. In that film, Horton Salm (as Gray Leader) and Red Two appear to be played by the same actor, leading Fry to establish a family relation between the two characters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
