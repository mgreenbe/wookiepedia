The two originally worked as freight haulers before learning of business opportunities on Lothal and moving there. During Oleg's time as a cadet, the Empire instituted a crackdown on any and all dissident activity on the planet, using the crackdown as a means of of providing its cadets with field experience. As part of this, Oleg was paired with fellow cadet Zare Leonis to follow up on Oleg's report of a warehouse that was dealing in barrels of ebla beer without the required tax stamps. Upon raiding the warehouse, Oleg was shocked to discover that his uncles were part of the warehouse's operation. He tried to shield them, but Leonis ordered their arrest and Oleg was cashiered out of Imperial service."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nazhros Oleg's uncles were first mentioned in the 2014 junior novel Servants of the Empire: Rebel in the Ranks written by Jason Fry. They later appeared in the follow up novel, Servants of the Empire: Imperial Justice. When questioned whether the characters were intended to be a pair of brothers or a gay couple, Fry admitted it was not something he had previously considered, but upon thinking about it, a gay couple made the most sense in his mind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
