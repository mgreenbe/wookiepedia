They grew to be several meters long, and were employed as mounts by the Mon Calamari Knights. They saw much use during the Battle of Mon Calamari that was fought in the opening months of the Clone Wars, when they bit through the battle droids and war vehicles of the Quarren Isolation League. During the same battle, the combined strength of several keelkana was used by a team of Knights to push a giant crab cannon to its destruction in a deep trench carved into the ocean floor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
