Their goal was to ensure the independence of the Hapes Consortium from the Galactic Alliance by overthrowing Queen Mother Tenel Ka and assassinating Chume'da Allana. To this end they hired the bounty hunter Aurra Sing and attacked the Hapan Royal Navy with their fleet. The coup failed and most of the Heritage Council was captured or killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
