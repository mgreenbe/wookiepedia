When the Jawas put EG-30 up for sale to a moisture farmer, Jitt was prepared to activate the device, but had a change of heart when she saw the farmer's daughter embrace the droid with a hug. She allowed the Jawas to sell the droid, wanting her friend to be a part of a family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Decades later, during the time of the war between the First Order and the Resistance, the cartographer Emil Graf would tell the story of the droid and the Jawa to his companions aboard the Star Herald.
