For being one of the few hundred Advisors who were genuinely loyal to Emperor Palpatine and his New Order, the Advisor was appointed to the Imperial Ruling Council, which was also known as the Emperor's Inner Circle. The Imperial Ruling Council was based on the galactic capital planet of Coruscant, and its members were allowed private audiences with the Emperor. While Palpatine ruled the galaxy, the Advisors managed the Empire and carried out the Emperor's will."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Advisors' duties consisted of overseeing both their home systems and those of rival Advisors as well as administrative duties that included appointing Imperial governors and Moffs.

The group arrived aboard the Death Star in Palpatine's private shuttle and landed in one of the Death Star's hangar bays, where they were greeted by an assembly of Imperial personnel and by Palpatine's Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. The Advisors accompanied Palpatine and Vader as the pair departed the hangar. A short time later, the Death Star was attacked by the Alliance during the Battle of Endor, and all six of the Emperor's Advisors were killed in the station's destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The red-and-black-robed Advisor's position in the Imperial Ruling Council was a testament to his loyalty to Palpatine and the New Order.

However, the 2013 2013 Topps Star Wars Galactic Files Series 2 card set reveals that all six Advisors aboard the Death Star were killed during the Battle of Endor, while Pestage is established to have lived past the Battle of Endor, thus eliminating any connection between the two characters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
