She was beaten and questioned, but having been several years since her service to the Hutts, she had no knowledge of this recent venture.

Ghitsa, acting uncharacteristically timid, declined to leave the ship, but later destroyed her Jedi disguise, possibly showing a newfound respect for the Jedi Order. After departing the planet, Ghitsa produced a datacard she acquired from the Rook, which contained information on Orko SkyMine, Durga's mysterious operation. Suspecting the importance, and credit value, of the datacard, Ghitsa decided to sell it to Talon Karrde, to which she had earned the distrust of, and his information network. It would later lead to the discovery of the Darksaber project."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
