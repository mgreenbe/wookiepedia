Jan Ors was apparently the pilot, who was said to be a better pilot than her companion. It was Jan's job, when she was not following mission objectives with Katarn, to ensure that he could be pulled out as quickly as possible should the operation turn desperate. This tactic almost cost Jan Ors her life, when Desann and Tavion Axmis found and abducted her, compelling Katarn to take up his abandoned Force powers and return to the Valley of the Jedi on Ruusan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Katarn started his search for Desann, Master Skywalker promised him to take care of the Raven's Claw during his search. After Desann's death on Yavin 4, Katarn and Jan Ors continued to fly this ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Disciples of Ragnos, Jaden Korr was the co-pilot of the Raven's Claw with Katarn.

As such, in cut-scenes it seems to need a level 2 or 3 force jump to get on top of it, whereas in game where ever it appears, Jaden can jump on top of it with a level 1 force jump and is just as tall, if not taller that the height of the cockpit. Furthermore, during cutscenes in Jedi Outcast the cockpit is portrayed as having room for two to sit side-by-side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite having no obvious external weapons, in one cutscene from Jedi Academy which precedes a mission to Corellia, Kyle mentions fighting off armed pirate ships with the Raven's Claw while Jaden Korr handles the liberation of a high-speed tram from terrorists.
