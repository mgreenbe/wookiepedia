It was named after the podracer Ratts Tyerell, who was a known enthusiast for the game. The object of Ratts Race was to reach the center square of the board and grab the \"Globe of Peace\" before the opponent did. The first one to do so won all the wupiupi mustered by both players during the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
