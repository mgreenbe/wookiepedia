One was deployed by Imperial forces under the command of Colonel Barris during an operation to capture smugglers on a planet in the Unknown Regions. The screen's mesh could be fine tuned to detect small threats, but when used in an area with a large number of small life forms like animals and birds, the constant movement could trigger alarms if the screen was fine-meshed too far."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
