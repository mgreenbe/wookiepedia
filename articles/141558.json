One of the Order's holiest sites, its interior was lined with galleries depicting the Order's history. Mosaics, tapestries, and sculptures were suspended in the center of the tower, suspended on repulsors and were viewed through transparisteel turbolifts that lined the outer walls of the spire. The Spire's apex contained halls and a chamber that was important to the Order, including private meditation and contemplation rooms, lecture halls, and a galaxy holomap room. The military command center of the Jedi was also located in this section of the Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within the finned portion of the Spire was the Temple Veranda, which housed the Hall of Knighthood and a private hangar for dignitaries as well as members of the Jedi High Council.
