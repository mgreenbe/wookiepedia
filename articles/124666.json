Skirkel was the youngest city on Iol and was constructed in 50 BBY. It had a smaller population than the other cities on Iol and the majority of Shirkel's residents were miners that worked at nearby sites. Tangan Industries appointed the Twi'lek Anoon'olan as Shirkel's administrator, but most of the city's residents pledged their allegiance to Kai Lunn, the leader of the Miners' Union."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
