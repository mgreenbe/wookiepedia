Rooks commanded a Krath patrol ship, and in 3996 BBY, he served on a Krath command yacht under two of the Krath's leaders; fallen Jedi Knight-turned-Sith Lord Ulic Qel-Droma and his lover Aleema Keto. While Rooks was present on the command yacht, the Tetan fleet came under attack from a Mandalorian strike force, commanded by their leader Mandalore the Indomitable. After the Mandalorians caused some damage to the Tetans, Qel-Droma ordered Rooks to open up a line of communication with the Mandalore. Rooks obeyed the Sith's order, and established a video feed to the Mandalore's flagship. The Mandalore took the opportunity to challenge Qel-Droma to single combat, an offer the Jedi accepted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rooks made his first and only appearance in the first issue of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Kevin J.
