He ruled the enslaved Wookiee children with an iron fist. Prior to the liberation of Kashyyyk, Dessard used inhibitor chips to keep the enslaved Wookiees in line. These inhibitor chips put the Wookiees in extreme pain if they disobeyed orders or tried to escape. The Wookiee charges including Lumpawaroo referred to Dessard and his men as rrraugrah or \"milk-skins\". After a team of New Republic operatives and Wookiee rebels led by Han Solo and Chewbacca disabled the inhibitors and ended Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck's rule, Dessard's camp became one of the Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dessard and his men briefly managed to reassert control over the Wookiee children by using chains, collars, shock-lances, and blasters. However, Dessard and his comrades were demoralized by the news of the Imperial defeat. They often fought among themselves and ceased to clean themselves. One day, Lumpawaroo managed to escape before Dessard could close the pylon-gate. Unwilling to let any of the slaves or his men leave the camp, Dessard and his troops gave chase."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Waroo swung through the dying trees of Mount Arayakyak but fell after he came into contact with a spore-pod.

However, Dessard's men were then gunned down by several adult Wookiee and New Republic soldiers. With the tables turned, Dessard crawled on his hands and knees and knelt before Waroo. One of the Wookiees, Chewbacca, who was Waroo's father, then forced Dessard to the ground with a tree-trunk leg. While New Republic soldiers arrested Dessard, Waroo reunited with his father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dessard was a vicious little human man with a greasy peak of dark hair.

Dessard and his men were demoralized by news of the liberation of Kashyyyk. Unwilling to concede defeat, Dessard refused to let any of his men or the Wookiee slaves escape his camp and was willing to kill them.
