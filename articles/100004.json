It was a thriving business until the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire. The business was shut down when the Imperials announced the warrants for the arrests of the two entrepreneurs, since Olin was a former Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The office of Olin/Lands was located on a quiet street in the Cloud Lake District in the city of Ussa.
