Once a deposit of spice had been found, shafts were extended from the platform into the surface. Spice-encrusted rocks were mined by prisoners and slaves using sonic hammers and cutting torches then moved via grav-cart to the platform. The raw spice was refined on the platform through the use of huge sifters and electrostatic chambers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
