The Sith Abattar was worn around the neck and held in place by a thin, silver chain. Upon donning the amulet, a being felt a heavy weight being placed on him or her despite the small size of the abattar. This Sith artifact allowed the wearer to communicate in any language, but prolonged use of the amulet weakened the wearer, eventually leading to death if not removed. Sorzus Syn also said it attuned its wearer to the maddening chatter of ghosts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side, the amulet was misspelled as \"Sith abbatar\" on page 24."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
