During his service in Twilight Company, Carver fought at the terrestrial body Phorsa Gedd as a part of the Mid Rim campaign and also at the location Switchmount, where the company intervened when civilians were killing each other, only to make the matter worse.

This was the first large scale engagement on Coyerti by the soldiers of Twilight Company, and the rebels were met with TIE fighters during the fight. Around thirty kilometers to the south of the battle, Namir and his squad, who had been on their own missions on Coyerti, noticed that the engagement was occurring in the distance.

As a result, Everi Chalis, the governor of the planet Haidoral Prime who had defected to the company shortly before Coyerti, devised a plan to board an Imperial cargo transport and seize supplies for repairs. Thus Twilight Company went and attacked an Imperial heavy freighter, sending multiple squads\u2014led by Namir and Sergeants Carver, Charmer, Fektrin, Zab and Maximian Ajax\u2014aboard the enemy transport via boarding pods.

During this time, however, an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser entered the space engagement. With this in mind, Twilight Company's Captain Micha Evon, better known as Howl, gave the squads five minutes to return to their pods and to the Thunderstrike.

During the company's time on Ankhural, Carver and a number of other senior members of Twilight Company attended daily meetings which included updates on the repairs to the vessels. In one of these meetings, Namir brought news that a handful of Twilight soldiers had been considering deserting the company out of fear that the Empire would find and obliterate them.

The former governor insisted that she understood the flow of resources in the Empire and claimed it was the reason Howl had accepted her into the company in the first place. As Chalis then left the meeting attendees to discuss among themselves, Carver and the aliens Mzun and Gadren debated the tactics of invading the Kuat Drive Yards.

After Namir interviewed the surviving member of Charmer's squad, the First Sergeant, assumed by many to be the new captain of the company, led a mission to take revenge on the vehicle and its crew. Carver was among the group that joined Namir and other who knew Charmer well as they ambushed the crew of the worm vehicle whilst they disembarked from it outside an Imperial sentry post.
