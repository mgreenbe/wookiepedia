The heat brought crowds into the streets and cantinas, which led to rioting. In 14 BBY, Colonel Belkor Dray's policy, administered in Moff Delian Mors' name, was to contain the riots and do their best to minimize fatalities and property damage. Colonel Belkor preferred not to crush the riots because he regarded them as a useful venting mechanism to dissuade the population from supporting the Free Ryloth Movement. In secret, Belkor Dray was a spy for Cham Syndulla, leader of the Free Ryloth movement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
