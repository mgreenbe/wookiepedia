Operations Group Three was led by Colonel Grang, and was stationed in the Maximum Security Section to sow chaos and clear the way while Groups One and Two continued onward into the Tomb. However, Colonel Grang's men broke open several Rakata vaults and unintentionally unleashed the Esh-kha species, which spread quickly throughout the prison. Grang's men were forced to retreat to the Imperial frontline camp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
