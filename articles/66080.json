It was the site of a top secret Imperial experiment involving the cloning of several Jedi using extracts of their DNA. Authorized by Grand Admiral Thrawn, the facility contained two entrances and was very extensive, spreading across several floors underground. A cloning machine was located in the heart of the facility, along with quarters for the clones and scientists who worked there. The experiment failed, however, as the clones went mad and killed all of the scientists there. In 41 ABY, Jedi Knight Jaden Korr received a vision through the Force and embarked on a mission to the moon, where he found the facility. There, he dueled and killed Alpha, a clone of Jedi Master Kam Solusar. However, the other clones escaped the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
