A subseries of the R2-series astromech droid designed to work closely with farming equipment and food production machinery, the model was moderately successful. In the year 22 BBY, Industrial Automaton began reusing existing shells from their cancelled R5-series astromech droid in the production of R2-AG and R4-series agromech droid lines in the hopes of recouping losses after a year of disappointing sales. However, these reshelled agromech droids did not sell very well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R2-AGs were equipped with an arc welder, a Cybot acoustic signaller, retractable manipulator arms, tripodal wheeled legs, one of which was retractable, a video display screen, and a visual sensor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
