Its public face was as an association of technologists and specialists who strove to help star systems modify their technology to fall in line with the Imperial standard. However, they were also responsible for modifying social conditions and institutions on the planet to better conform to New Order ideology, thereby increasing the loyalty of the citizens. Members of the Department of Modification would promote the achievements and careers of those individuals who were politically in line with the New Order, then create subtle problems that only their chosen individuals\u2014with the Department's assistance\u2014could solve. During the Galactic Civil War, a survey group from the department was sent to Lan Barell to assess whether or not the system could supply materials to construct a Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
