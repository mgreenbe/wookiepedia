They were sometimes also known as a mist creature. They resembled wraith-like masses of smoke that appeared almost semi-solid and would be mistaken for fog. While amazing to view, it was dangerous for beings to approach them as the vapors were capable of entering the body of another organism and practically strangle the individual from the inside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
