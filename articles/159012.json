It was located between the Western Dune Sea and the Lowland Basin, northeast of the town of Wayfar and Jabba's Palace. Among the base's occupants were a number of Valarian's armored command enforcers. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Jabba sent a spacer to the bunker to eliminate Valarian's command staff. Among those killed in the raid were weaponsmith Arkahn Greystar, slicer Iris Tanada Sinclair, warlord Careem, tactician Fnast Drexler, and assassin Emanon. The spacer succeeded and was rewarded by Jabba."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
