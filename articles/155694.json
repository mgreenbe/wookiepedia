His travels took him to planets including Tatooine, Naboo, Coruscant and Takodana. Eventually, the artist's journal ended up in the stacks of the Graf Archive on Orchis 2, where it was restored and eventually published at some point after the First Order attack on the Resistance fleet in 34 ABY. Although damage to the journal over time made the artist's true identity unclear, his work resembled the work of Ithorian artist Gammit Chond, leading some to speculate Chond was the author of the journal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
