Governed by the ruling Wyrd sisters, a group of fifty Force-witches who controlled the group through the power of the Force. The sisters were in command of a small army of 300-some soldiers who kept the peace within the village and patrolled its borders during times of crisis and ensured that the slaves did not escape. Indeed, the 400 members of the community not with the ranks of the governing caste or the military were considered slaves under the pall of the Wyrd sisters' dictatorial rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a band of mercenaries and freedom fighters known as the Heroes of Cularin led the Cularin Militia into the jungles of the world in search of the Wyrd sisters.
