The operation failed because Taria's enemies discovered the mission thanks to a corrupt functionary in Finis Valorum's office, and killed the contact. They then sent bounty hunters to track the troubleshooters, using sensors that homed in on the metal they were going to use to pay the contact. The troubleshooters eventually returned to Coruscant, and the security leak was discovered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
