The father of Sith Caretaker Varner Hilts was a member of the faction. Hilts' father worked for years to acquire the faction leader's trust, and planned to assassinate the Sith. However, before he could carry out his plans, his chosen weapon fell from his sheath and lodged in his ankle, earning him the nickname \"Slippery Hilts.\" Slippery Hilts died a month later from an infection in his ankle wound. Soon afterward, Slippery Hilts' wife planned to seduce the faction leader, but she was trapped in a ceremonial urn and left to die."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
