The First Order also blockaded the planet with at least one squadron of TIE/fo space superiority fighters. Despite the occupation, the planet was home to several Resistance sympathizers. The Resistance Commander Venisa Doza and her Jade Squadron including Hugh Sion and Norath Kev were tasked with penetrating the blockade and evacuating these Resistance sympathizers offworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeking help, they visited the Colossus refueling tanker, which was home to Venisa's husband Captain Imanuel Doza and their teenage daughter Torra Doza.
