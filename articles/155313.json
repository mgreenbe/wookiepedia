One their way, two clone troopers stepped on hidden landmines and alerted the enemies of their position. A firefight then ensued and many clones and Umbarans were killed. During the firefight, this Umbaran soldier dropped down from a tree in an attempt to surprise and kill clone trooper Fives, but the trooper managed to overpower him and flipped him onto the ground, cracking open his helmet with his elbow. The Umbaran quickly started to panic as his helmet vented gas, babbling in his native language, before Fives grabbed his blaster and shot him in the face, killing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
