He was sent by the Office of the Supreme Chancellor to work on Outbound Flight prior to its departure from Yaga Minor. He was a friend of Dean Jinzler, and brought Jinzler's Jedi sister, Lorana Jinzler, to meet him in the mess hall on Outbound Flight. He had recently repaired a defective line network and then addressed Jinzler to a possible connection to Dean. When the Jedi said that she did not know her relatives, he called Dean to him and introduced him to the Jedi. When Dean then revealed that he was Lorana's brother, Brooks withdrew from the conversation, shocked of hearing this."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
