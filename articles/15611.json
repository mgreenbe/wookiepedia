The power and usefulness of beckon calls varied considerably. However, a range of just under a planetary radius was considered to be short. Some low-end models would work only if the weather was good and the beckon call had a direct line-of-sight to the vehicle that it was supposed to be communicating with. Extremely modified beckon calls were capable of transmitting signals across hyperspace, such as the one that Lando Calrissian had in his possession while attempting to solve the mystery of the Teljkon Vagabond."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
