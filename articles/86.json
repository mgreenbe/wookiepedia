It occupied a niche similar in design to that of the T-6 \"Thunderer\" of BlasTech Industries and the C-10 \"Dragoneye Reaper\" of Czerka Arms, and it featured the highest energy output of any SoroSuub blaster pistol model. More lightweight and better priced than its competition, the Renegade dominated the super-heavy blaster pistol market, however, most enthusiasts eschewed the mass-market weapon due to its poor beam cohesion and awkwardly angeled grip, and preferred pricier but higher-quality options."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Common throughout the more dangerous locales of the Outer Rim Territories, the Renegade was a favored weapon of pirates and outlaws as a result of its massive and intimidating barrel housing. It was also commonly issued to Rebel Alliance SpecOps troops, though most who survived a few missions were known to replace it. Many smaller species, like Sullustans, added a folding stock and used the Renegade as a carbine instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
