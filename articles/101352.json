Darth Caedus used a large-scale Jedi Mind trick on the operators of the Oridin shield generator to deactivate the planetary shield, allowing him to bombard Oridin from orbit, much the same way he had with Kashyyyk, months prior. After the bombardment, electrical power in six nearby cities was lost, and the shattered underground tunnels that could be found all over the planet were ravaged by fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
