Upon discovering an opening in Sector 7, he submitted an application for it and it was accepted. On his last shift prior to the transfer, this stormtrooper was ordered to guard a landing pad occupied by a Lambda-class shuttle and several cargo containers with another stormtrooper. The stormtrooper informed the other about his transfer and the other reacted positively, commenting that it \"should be a quiet last day for him.\" However, the statement would prove to be false, since unbeknownst to both stormtroopers, Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors had infiltrated the outpost. Both stormtroopers were killed by Katarn and Ors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
