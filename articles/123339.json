New colonies and adventures await!\" on the bottom left corner with the Galactic Republic's logo just below it, with both phrases being printed in the High Galactic alphabet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This marketing campaign was the result of collusion between Republic politicians and Trade Federation lobbyists.
