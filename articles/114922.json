Reverse-engineered from alien technologies, the Retribution shield was adapted as both starship shields and personal energy shields. The shields were only moderately strong, but could be activated with an energy charge that responds to enemy attacks with energy feedback that damaged the attacking starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
