The harpoon was filled with coma gas and fired at the other ship. During flight, the weapon's armored tip was superheated and would puncture the target's hull. Once the harpoon penetrated the ship, the tip would fuse with the hull, making removal impossible; in addition the gas was released, rendering anyone who came in contact with it unconscious. This weapon, usually illegal, was used by the Myrkr strike team to incapacitate the Yuuzhan Vong warriors on the ship they subsequently commandeered for transport to Myrkr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
