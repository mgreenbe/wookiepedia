When charging completed, a large purple plasma burst was emitted from the cannon. The cannon was not turreted and the entire tank had to turn in order to line the gun up with its target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In large groups, these tanks could take down even the heaviest armor, such as the Imperial AT-AT, as well as buildings, although they often had trouble with faster-moving targets. If they had to take down faster-moving targets, the crew would move the tank and run the target over. They were known for an extremely powerful single shot, being able to take down an Imperial AT-ST or even a shielded 2-M repulsor tank in one blast, but the downside was that the blast only damaged a single target making it close to pointless against infantry. For this reason it worked well as a support unit fulfilling the same role as artillery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another downside of using these powerful tools was the fact that the highly unstable plasma they used for weaponry would often explode, destroying the tank. This was often used by the crew of the vehicle who would overload the tank to destroy nearby enemy forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
