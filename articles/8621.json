When contact with the greater galaxy was established, young Arkanians were taught Arkanian and Basic, so the majority of the population was bilingual. Among the Arkanian Offshoots, a slightly different dialect gradually emerged, emphasizing words of submission and forgetting those of victory or the desire to challenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The word \"perero/perera\" meant \"honored elder,\" and \"edessa\" meant \"triumph.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the language largely being restricted to Arkania, some non-Arkanians took up the language in order to communicate with their friends and companions. Among these were the Jedi Padawans of Arca Jeth: Exar Kun and Cay and Ulic Qel-Droma, along with Jedi Master Lucien Draay who did business with the Arkanians. Several centuries later, the Dark Jedi Kueller knew the language, as did the Vratix, Seeqov Thranx."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
