A large estate, it also operated as a farm. The marshy grounds were arranged into neat squares separated by dikes and tended to by agricultural droids. The main building was a glass-domed structure raised up out of the water on pilings, and surrounded by a stone wall. The water was filtered and heated, and made an ideal outside swimming pool."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
