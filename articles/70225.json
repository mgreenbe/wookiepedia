The Force wielder known as the Son desired to use the shuttle to escape Mortis, so Ahsoka sabotaged it to stop him from being unleashed into the galaxy. After the deaths of the Father and Son, the Jedi later woke up inside the shuttle, which was hovering in space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi shuttle 634, as an Eta-class shuttle, was 14.2 meters long, with a dorsal fin and two wings that folded up when the shuttle was landed. It could be flown by two pilots, and was equipped with a hyperdrive. The shuttle was also equipped with two Undicur-class jumpspeeders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, during the Clone Wars, Republic Military forces picked up an ancient Jedi distress signal coming from deep in the Chrelythiumn system in Wild Space. In response, the Jedi High Council dispatched Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Ahsoka Tano to investigate. The three travelled to the remote star system in shuttle 634, intending to rendezvous with a Venator-class Star Destroyer. However, when the shuttle arrived at its destination, Skywalker contacted Clone Captain Rex onboard the Star Destroyer, as he believed the capital ship had not yet arrived. Rex responded that he was in the system and waiting for them to arrive: the two starships, despite being in the vicinity of each other, could not see or detect each other, visually or on their scanners. Suddenly, the communications signal cut out, as the shuttle suddenly shut down, before powering back on just as abruptly. The three Jedi then saw an enormous octahedral monolith in space ahead of them. The monolith began to open, revealing blinding white light as shuttle 634 was pulled inside of it, and the Jedi fell unconscious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi, Skywalker and Tano woke up inside the shuttle to find it landed in the middle of a meadow on what, according to the ship's sensors, was some kind of organic mass. Disembarking, they saw an alien landscape complete with floating rocks, and were shortly met by a mysterious woman who introduced herself as Daughter, asking Skywalker if he was \"the one\". She ordered the trio to follow her, but after Kenobi and Tano were separated from Skywalker and the Daughter by a landslide, the two opted to return to the ship. However, when they got back to the meadow, Kenobi and Tano found that the shuttle had vanished. Due to the dangerous nighttime storms of their location, Mortis, the two were forced to spend the night in a nearby cave, before being abducted in the morning by the Daughter and her brother the Son at their father's request, as he wished to test Skywalker to see if he was truly the Chosen One of prophecy. After Skywalker passed the Father's test, he rejected an offer to stay, and the three subsequently boarded their returned ship to leave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, while the Jedi were attempting to depart, Skywalker fell asleep in the hold and had a nightmare vision of the Son, waking up to find that the Son had boarded the shuttle and watching as he kidnapped Tano. Skywalker subsequently took control of the ship from Kenobi and pursued the Son through the mist and rock pillars, only to crash the shuttle after nearly hitting the Son's tower. Although Kenobi thought that they should get help from the Father, Skywalker set out to rescue Tano on his own. Kenobi, remaining at the crash site, wondered to himself how to get to the Father and immediately found himself below the Father's monastery. Kenobi arrived just in time to witness the Father being attacked by the Son, which injured him too severely for him to assist the Jedi. However, the Daughter was persuaded to lead Kenobi to the Altar of Mortis, where he was given a dagger that could kill the Son. In a showdown at the Son's tower, Skywalker and Kenobi fought Tano, who had been forcibly turned to the dark side of the Force by the Son, before the Son was able to acquire the dagger, killing his sister when she jumped into the weapon's path to save her father. Subsequently, the Daughter gave her remaining lifeforce to revive Tano, and the Jedi departed the scene."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to the damaged shuttle, Tano started to work on repairs while Skywalker, worried about the Son, decided to seek out the Father. Tano informed Kenobi of a litany of problems with the ship, including cracked shilo pins and a damaged power converter, as well as recommending that the engines be fired twice to dump debris and that the backup vents needed charging. After Skywalker's departure, Kenobi, growing worried, decided to set out in search, asking Tano to disable the firing drives, something she was reluctant to do. When the Father told him that Skywalker had gone to the Well of the Dark Side in search of the Son, Kenobi left, ordering Tano to stay with the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Well, Skywalker was shown a vision of his future as the Sith Lord Darth Vader, and was so appalled that he ended up joining with the Son, to Kenobi's horror and confusion when he arrived. Skywalker took Kenobi's speeder bike and stranded him at the Well, returning to the shuttle. However, Kenobi contacted Tano before Skywalker arrived and warned her of what had happened, asking her to sabotage the ship so that Skywalker and the Son could not leave, something Tano was irritated about as she had just finished her repairs. When Skywalker arrived, Tano avoided him by clinging to the ceiling before escaping on the jumpspeeder he had come in on. Skywalker was angered to discover the sabotage. He attempted to send a transmission for help, but suspected no one could hear his signal. This did not concern the Son, who claimed that he would soon be able to draw any ship to Mortis, before leaving to secure the Dagger. Skywalker was then approached by the Father, who erased his memory of the future the Son had shown him, returning him to the light side. Tano, meanwhile, picked up Kenobi from the Well, showing him the crucial part she had removed from the shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker was taken to the monastery by the Father and, when Kenobi and Tano arrived, the group worked together to kill the Son once and for all. The Father eventually used the dagger to kill himself, which made the Son vulnerable to Skywalker stabbing him with his lightsaber. The death of the last two Force wielders caused the monastery to collapse, unleashing a blinding light. When the Jedi awoke again, they found themselves once again onboard shuttle 634 in space, where they were contacted by Rex. They found out from the Captain that from his perspective their shuttle had only dropped off the Star Destroyer's scopes for a few moments. After Skywalker insisted that they had been gone for longer than that, a claim that Rex found confusing, the Jedi Knight flew the shuttle to rendezvous with the Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the mission to Wild Space that led to the discovery of Mortis, Jedi shuttle 634 was piloted by Anakin Skywalker.
