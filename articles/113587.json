While subspace relay stations could transmit over subspace, hyperwave relay stations could transmit audio and video over hyperspace, and HoloNet relay stations were able to receive and transmit signals over the HoloNet, which also used hyperspace. The HoloNet relay stations had a boosted signal to allow real-time audio, video, in addition to holographic communication over an unlimited range, with less lag-time and increased fidelity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic used a relay station in orbit of Bothawui as a rendezvous point.
