Taloraan magister Orlin Denache had secretly signed a treaty with Dooku, who in turn ordered Canteval and a local CIS supporter Rynert to begin land battle droids within the Taloraan City. When the fact was discovered by the Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who accompanied her master Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in their negotiations with the local Denfrandi, Canteval ordered B1-Series battle droids and droidekas to engage the Jedi. After issuing the order, Canteval moved his ship into the clouds in the upper levels of gas giant's atmosphere. By the time Rynert's men and the CIS forces established control over the city, Canteval developed a plan to ambush the Republic Star Destroyer Resolute once it would it enter the upper levels of the planet's atmosphere to make contact with the Jedi. The Jedi, however, managed to get a message to Resolute and warn its commander of the upcoming ambush. Without the element of surprise Canteval's Munificent-class star frigate was unable to overpower the Venator on its own. With its shield weakening, the Munificent took several direct hits into its engines. Unable to maintain altitude, the ship, with Canteval still aboard, was sucked into the gas giant's core, thus ending his life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
