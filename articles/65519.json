They studied a group of 100 clones of 24 chronological years of age and, as they had been engineered to age at twice the rate of a normal human, they expected them to have aged to the equivalent of an ordinary Human. However, by studying key biomarkers, they found that the troopers had an age range from 34 to 65 years old, with a median of 48. They concluded that exposure to battlefield contaminants and high levels of sustained stress had combined to increase the rate at which the clones aged, although further research was needed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial Medical Review 1675 was quoted at the start of Chapter 2 in the novel Republic Commando: True Colors.
