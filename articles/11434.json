During the Battle of Starkiller Base, BB-K8 was stationed at an auxiliary hangar where he was tasked with repairing the TIE fighter pilot TN-3465's TIE/sf space superiority fighter. While in the process of performing a data update, Captain Phasma arrived and requisitioned TN-3465's fighter for a mission to hunt down for Lieutenant Sol Rivas, whom Phasma had framed for lowering Starkiller Base's deflector shield in an attempt to hide her own malfeasance.

Phasma kicked the droid in frustration. After Rivas' fighter ran out of fuel and landed on the remote planet of Luprora, BB-K8 followed Phasma and TN-3465 to the planet. Upon disembarking from their TIE/sf fighter, BB-K8 struggled to navigate through the rocky terrain.

TN-3465 scolded BB-K8 for mistranslating her words and told the droid to fix it. When BB-K8 protested in Binary, TN-3465 replied that she did not care if it made the droid look stupid.
