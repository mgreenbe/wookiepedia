One Imperial model with a conning tower was the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, and during the Battle of Hoth the Imperial II-class Tyrant's conning tower was taken out when the vessel was hit with an ion blast from the Rebel Alliance's v-150 Planet Defender. As the conning towers of the Imperial warships were so exposed, they were not included in the design of the First Order's Resurgent-class Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
