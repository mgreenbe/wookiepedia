After Gethzerion founded the Nightsisters, she developed her own brand of magic that her coven coined Shadow Magic, or more colloquially as magicks. As a result, the other witch clans took to calling their own practices Allyan Magic, believing that the Nightsisters had corrupted the beauty of Allya's original magic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were two schools of Dathomir Magic. The first, traditional Allyan Magic, followed rules put forth in the Book of Law, a tome of moral and ethical teachings kept and modified by each clan based on an original created by Allya for her daughters. The other, called \"Shadow Magic\" by its originator, Gethzerion, was the provenance of the Nightsisters that did not require chanting or other primitive rituals. The Nightsisters' book, the Book of Shadows, told of future glories that they would gather in the heavens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The practitioners of Dathomir Magic believed themselves to be casting spells rather than making use of the Force, and often were unable to make use of a \"spell\" without speaking its assigned name or performing the ritualized singing, dancing, chanting, and/or writing associated with it. The Nightsisters often attributed the work of the Force to the Spirits instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The skills in the Force that the Witches of Dathomir possessed changed the many generations since Allya's arrival on Dathomir, as knowledge was shaped by traditions and time from what Allya originally taught.
