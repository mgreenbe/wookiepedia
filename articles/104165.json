Well before the Galactic War, much of the area was underwater, but the native Voss eventually built the Err-Ka Dam on the northeastern edge of the Marches to hold back the floodwaters. The wooded area was dotted by Jedi and Sith ruins, and when the native Gormak invaded the region, they began to cut down many of the trees and building monolithic structures, resulting in the Clear-Cut Forest and the Barrenwoods. The Voss commandos maintained Kri-Ta Outpost, Outpost Overseer, and Pelath Point in the area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
