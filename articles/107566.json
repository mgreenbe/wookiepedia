Once he activated the temple however, the Presence told him that the knowledge contained within the holocron was the power of the temple's battle station and that it had the power to destroy life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 BBY, Padawan Ezra Bridger and his master, Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus, traveled with former Jedi Ahsoka Tano to the planet Malachor to find ancient Sith knowledge, which they hoped to use to defeat the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader and his Inquisitors. On Malachor, Bridger encountered the former Sith Lord once known as Darth Maul, who also sought the secrets of the Sith temple. The two worked together to enter the temple and ultimately retrieved a Sith holocron, which Maul said would unlock the temple's secret knowledge. Bridger was sent to the top of the temple alone, where Maul told him to activate the temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bridger reached the top of the temple, where the holocron levitated out of his hand and entered an obelisk. Its activation set off currents of electricity, and the female voice of the Presence asked Bridger who he was. Bridger explained that he sought the knowledge of the temple to defeat his enemies, and the Presence told him that knowledge is power. The temple, which in truth was an ancient battle station, activated its superweapon and the Presence told Bridger that the power to destroy life was at his command. Bridger said he did not want that power, so the Presence said the other who had arrived at the temple might\u2014Darth Vader. As Vader dueled Tano, Bridger and Jarrus worked together to remove the holocron from the obelisk and deactivate the weapon. With the holocron in hand, the two Jedi were forced to flee Malachor without Tano, as she and Vader were sealed within the temple dueling one another as the temple collapsed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next six months, Bridger would regularly make use of the knowledge within the holocron and speak to the Presence, as she seduced him closer and closer to the dark side of the Force.

Bridger opened the holocron once more and spoke with the Presence, who told him that his anger would make him more powerful and more focused.

In his mind, the voice of the Presence is the voice of the ancient Sith Lord who built the Malachor temple. Filoni said that he liked the idea of an ancient and powerful woman, who had domination that the audience has not yet heard of, who was creating the weapon when it was attacked by the Jedi Order and everyone was turned to stone.
