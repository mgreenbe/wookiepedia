The scrubland laid between the Ice Giant Range and the north coastline, and its rough, cold terrain was littered with sharp, slanted columns of silica and sinkholes. Filled with magma, the latter posed a peril as they could form suddenly without warning. Fortunately for travelers, the native spinner birds could be relied upon to avoid this danger, as they flew spirals around any area about to erupt. Besides these birds, the region was also home to flame tygahs, which formed their dens underneath mounds of detritus thrown up by emerging sinkholes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
