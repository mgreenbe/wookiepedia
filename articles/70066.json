The armor they wore was as imposing as it was effective. Temple guard armor composed of brown-armored robes, a helmet, and an impassive, emotionless mask. The armored mask contained a comlink and a scanner located in the helmet. After Order 66, some of their battlegear survived in private collections and the lost corners of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
