It contained many roleplaying articles, including an adventure for the West End Games Star Wars D6 system. The article was called \"The Tyaonon Ranger: A Fast Ship for Star Wars Campaigns\" and was written by Bill Smith. Like all supplements printed in Polyhedron prior to 2002, the article is considered ambiguously canon."}]}
