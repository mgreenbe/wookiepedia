She was the only deity the Shamed Ones were allowed to address; consequently, they were the only ones who did so. She was said to possess a thousand eyes, and watched the Shamed Ones and protected them from the other deities. In addition, it was believed that she alone could cure certain Shamed Ones, allowing them to resume the station they once held before becoming Shamed. She was also the most grotesque deity in the Yuuzhan Vong pantheon, much like her \"imperfect\" worshipers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite her underclass worshipers, Yun-Shuno was nonetheless accorded the full honors of a deity of the Yuuzhan Vong. As such, statues of her were placed on the bridges of their vessels, alongside more \"illustrious\" deities like Yun-Yuuzhan, Yun-Yammka, and Yun-Harla. Upper caste Yuuzhan Vong derisively called her the \"Many-Eyed Mother of Snivelers,\" though this was rare, and even then they were cautious about it\u2014even a goddess of outcasts was still a goddess."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Onimi perceived the divine glow of Yun-Shuno in Jacen Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
