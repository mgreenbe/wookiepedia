Charles Ross plays all the characters, recreates the effects, inserts factoids when appropriate, sings from the John Williams score, flies the ships, and fights both sides of the battles. The inspiration came from playing Frisbee with friends; the thrower would say a line from the movies, and the catcher had to say the following line while catching. His impersonation of R2-D2 has been described as \"spot on,\" but Ross himself has said, \"I've always thought my Yoda voice sounded too much like a goblin sucking helium.\" Ross has purportedly seen the original movie over 400 times."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ross has also used the concept with other film trilogies, including The One Man The Lord of the Rings, which was performed from 2004 to 2005.
