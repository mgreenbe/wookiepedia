They were broad and streamlined, powerfully winged, sinister in appearance and yet pleasing to look at, and their dorsal surfaces were domed with high muscle. They were described as capable of being identified by \"an alien observer in a different place and time.\" The Confederacy of Independent Systems's Manta droid subfighter presumably took its name and design from the manta ray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
