Many millennia before the start of the Clone Wars, the axis of the planet shifted dramatically after a tremendous asteroid strike. The seasons drastically shortened and a new tropical environment changed the world and how the Caarites could live. Their cities now seemed to produce toxins into the land that was slowly killing the planet. They therefore moved their homes to the clouds, building massive floating cites that aided in preserving the strange new plant life on the ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
