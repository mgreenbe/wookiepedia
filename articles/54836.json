The planet's surface was largely covered in water or swamps, with only a few clear landmasses dotting its surface. The planet had very frequent season changes, causing it to be ravaged by intense storms with some of them turning cyclonic. The climate was moderate most of the standard year round."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glee Anselm was located within a star system in the Jalor sector of the Mid Rim region of the galaxy, on the Namadii Corridor between Vaced and Ord Varee. It was a mostly oceanic planet with one moon and few large landmasses. Most of its other islands and archipelagos were little more than swamps. It had a mild climate, ranging from tropical to temperate, but intense storms and hurricanes were common. Most of the planet's aquatic life, which survived in the high-pressure oceanic depths, had not been catalogued. The planet had a rotational period of 33 standard hours and an orbital period of 206 standard days."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was home to two natural species, the Nautolan and the Anselmi. Both races evolved naturally on the planet, the Nautolans under the water and the Anselmi on what few landmasses there were. The competitions for land probably led to the Anselmi turning into a warlike race. However, as the Nautolans gradually came to the surface and acquired land, they were able to use their natural abilities and strength to ward off the Anselmi. As a result, the Nautolans made up the majority of the population, since there were very few Anselmi left on the planet; the latter's numbers continued to diminish due to internal warfare."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic War, a popular female Nautolan musician wanted to own a pair of ginxes which were considered banned as pets on Glee Anselm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glee Anselm was represented in the Galactic Senate by Darsana, who was appointed to the Loyalist Committee. Jedi Master Kit Fisto also hailed from Glee Anselm.
