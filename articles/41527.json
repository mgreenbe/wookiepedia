The Dupei monks were a rare sight in the galaxy, but one group existed on Nameel. The Dupei monks possessed outlawed weapons that a nearby Trandoshan tribe attempted to buy, but the monks stole credits from the tribe. The Trandoshans retaliated, and the Jedi Order sent Eno Cordova and Cere Junda to settle the issue. Cordove spoke with the monks, learning that they had stolen from the tribe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
