The motion involved trade between many worlds of the Mid Rim, resulting in aid being able to be sent to Bromlarch's people. Several worlds, including Joh'Cire, Kashyyyk, Malastare, Naboo, Sivad and Thiafe\u00f1a, realized they would benefit from the motion's passing, and the Congress of Malastare were one of the major bodies to vote for it. The motion passed, allowing Bromlarch to be saved from its crisis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
