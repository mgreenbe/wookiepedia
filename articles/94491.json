Nearly his entire body had been replaced by cybernetics, including his arms, neck, chest, and facial features. At some point during the Clone Wars, he was shot down over the planet of Jabiim. Both Jedi Master Plo Koon and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker took credit for taking him out. He was then imprisoned within The Prism, along with other prisoners deemed highly dangerous by the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the rise of the Galactic Empire and the subsequent Gentis coup, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, Moff Trachta and Lieutenant Laurita Tohm traveled to the Prism in order to find a safe haven where they could heal the mortally wounded Emperor Palpatine. Since they believed they could not trust anyone within the Empire, Raines was released and became part of a brutal test created by Vader, to see who among the prisoners was worthy of joining the New Order. 207 prisoners took part in the battle, which was brutal and vicious, and it wasn't long before only thirty three survivors still stood. Vader and Trachta then told the survivors that they were now Imperials, and the group moved to leave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Raines was horribly wounded during the battle, his body in shambles, yet he reached out for Lieutenant Tohm, begging for help. Tohm brought this to Vader's attention, hoping to help the wounded cyborg, but Vader felt no such pity. He ordered Tohm to execute Raines. Tohm placed his blaster against Raines's head, with the cyborg feebly attempting to put out his hand to stop him, but Vader ordered Tohm to save his ammunition and handed the lieutenant a metal pipe instead. Tohm apologized to Raines, and as Raines once more vainly tried to reach out, Tohm beat the cyborg to death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
