He then played a message he had intercepted. It was a call for help to the Resistance from a leader of a team of soldiers who were willing to fight the First Order but needed transport off Garel. C-3PO did not trust the message but R2 and BB-8 did not listen and headed out to the coordinates sent in the message."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout Garel City, C-3PO and the other droids kept getting into trouble trying to hid from the First Order stormtroopers patrolling the area.

R2 and BB-8 sent C-3PO to investigate but then a young Duros girl jumped out and shot the protocol droid with her slingshot.

C-3PO could relate to her for being ignored and the droids agreed to help her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
