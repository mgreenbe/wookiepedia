The miners answered to the First Order and staged a strike to protest the harsh working conditions there. Claiming that the New Republic had infiltrated the facility and spread dissent among them, the Stormtrooper captain Phasma executed their leaders. Although present at the event, the cadet FN-2187 hesitated and did not fire his blaster rifle against the miners. The execution led to praise from Phasma for the cadet FN-2003, who had previously been a disappointment in Phasma's eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
