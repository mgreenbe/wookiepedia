The village elder approached the shuttle with a peace overture, which was mistaken by the stormtroopers on board for an attack. The village elder was killed, inciting the villagers to attack the stormtroopers. With the timely aid of a landing party from the Alliance Blockade Runner which was still in orbit, the villagers wiped out the stormtroopers in a \"glorious battle.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the victory celebration which followed this skirmish, Hamalcal stowed away aboard the Rebel shuttle.
