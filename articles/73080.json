During 10 ABY, sent on behalf of the New Republic to negotiate a supply deal, Mara Jade arrived at the palace, but was not allowed to enter it. After fighting through aggressive Grave Tusken mercenaries, Jade found Tusken clothing and managed to fool the TT-8L gatekeeper droid that guarded the gate into allowing her access into the palace.
