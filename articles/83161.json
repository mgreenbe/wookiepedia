The fighters were then used as static torpedo launchers, allowing the corvette to unleash as many as eighteen proton torpedoes in a single attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tactic was used on two known occasions; first during the Battle of Talasea, where the tactic was created, and again at the Battle of Ession."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
