Following the Eternal Empire conquest, the Eternal Empire capital of Zakuul became the new seat of power in the galaxy and Thea relocated to the Old World of Zakuul, where information was the most valuable. She eventually became an assistant to SCORPIO, who operated under the name \"The Lady of Sorrows\". In 3631 BBY Thea contacted The Exalted regarding the recent killing of Mona Gale by the Heralds of Zildrog and presented his captured son Brennen as bait to convince the Exalted to come to the Razor. Upon arriving to meet with the Lady, the Heralds were overpowered and all of them were killed. The Exalted himself was personally killed by SCORPIO, who made Brennen into the new Exalted, leaving him to lead the Heralds. After conversing with The Commander who arrived in the company of Senya Tirall and Koth Vortena, SCORPIO decided to leave with them, leaving Thea to continue the operations in her stead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SCORPIO eventually joined the Outlander's Alliance against Zakuul, but betrayed and abandoned it when presented with the opportunity to claim the Eternal Throne.
