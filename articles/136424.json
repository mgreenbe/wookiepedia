Due to circuitry interwoven throughout the stun gauntlet, electricity was transferred from the energy cells to the impact point, and caused the weapon to glow with electrical energy when activated. Because of the way they were worn, these gauntlets could not be disarmed or dropped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the known manufacturers of stun gauntlets was Palandrix Personal Protection Gear, which claimed to have made a stun gauntlet variety for virtually all known sentient species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
