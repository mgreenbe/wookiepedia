Designed with a fiberlight chassis and solid/liquid fuel adapter, the Aratech Screamer is the favored unit for those who want altitude in a hurry. The pack fires in single increment bursts and carries enough fuel for 10 jumps, with a minimum 10 second cool down time between bursts. The unit can also slow descent to prevent injury, requiring one burst per 200 meters fallen. The loud exhaust limits covert use, but the unit provides a handy means of escape if no other vehicles are available."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
