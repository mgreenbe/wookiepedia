Grysk civilization was mysterious and alien, even within the Unknown Regions, only regarded as half myth. As a species, they were only known and seen by a few outsiders, instead choosing to twist the minds of entire species to their will. These \"client species\" would then be willing to die for their new masters. Throughout its existence, the Grysk Hegemony fought against the Chiss Ascendancy, as well as other factions and species.

Located in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, their empire established the Grysk military and fought against the Chiss Ascendancy and other groups and species, scourging a series of conquests throughout the region. At times, the Chiss Ascendancy only observed battles, instead of participating in them. In the aftermath, survivors of the conquests created art pieces in memorial, while Grysk warriors degraded the right side of their helmets and armor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars erupted in the wider-known parts of the galaxy between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Grysk Hegemony began and conducted surveillance on both the galactic government and the secessionists in order to study them, and later deduced that the Galactic Republic was more dangerous to them than the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to weaken the Republic, the Hegemony supplied Confederate Head of State Count Dooku with information on cortosis, an element that was provided an effective defense against blasters and lightsabers.

Jixtus employed agents including the Pathfinder navigator Qilori and the telepathic Agbui named Haplif to help conduct his schemes. The Grysk had correctly predicted that the Nikardun Destiny's efforts against the Chiss Ascendancy would fail, and resorted to a less direct and more covert approach based on infiltration and sabotage of the Chiss from within."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The coming invasion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grysk embanked on a expedition to the Outer Rim, and started to colonized the moons surrounding the planet of Mokivj; this action led the Galactic Empire to push back the Grysk. In the campage aftermath, Impeiral Grand Admiral Thrawn believed an Grysk were planning an imminent invasion of the known galaxy and believed he had tricked the Grysk into possibly attacking the Chiss Ascendancy before the Empire, as Thrawn believed that the Grysk would continue with their bias of attacking the nearest enemy first."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon the Grysk would reappear and begun to make advances into Imperial territory, committing multiple criminal acts against it as noted by Chiss Admiral Ar'alani. One such incident was at the wreckage of the Allanar N3 freighter at, where in hiding was an armed Grysk warship laying in wait and stuck at the Empire. The Chiss soon entered the battle to draw away the Grysk warship's laser fire. When the Grysk retreated, the Empire had been able to capture two Grysk prisoners. Meanwhile, upon examining the conjoined Grysk warships, the Imperials detected the presence of several nitrogen cylinders that were left behind to destroy all evidence within the next four hours. However, the Empire was able to detach the Grysk ships from the triad poles before the nitrogen bombs could destroy the cylinders. But this did not prevent another attack by the Grysk, who soon sent two more Grysk warships, upon exiting hyperspace. The Chiss were waiting and turned their ship to face them, demanding the Grysk Hegemony to depart Imperial-control space. The Grysk commander mockingly asks if the Chiss are serving the Empire and said recent Grysk defeats including the loss of two warships were unimportant. As the Grysk starfighters approach, the Chiss crew deploy their plasma spheres, which disable their missiles and cause them to explode. The surviving starfighters return to their warships to inform newer reinforcements about their enemy's defenses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Government"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grysk Hegemony was a hegemony, which is an authoritarian government similar to an empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Military"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grysk Hegemony maintained a military, which played a key-roles in the conquests within the Unknown Regions.

The Grysks interrogated a few members of the species to find out what matters to them and their culture.
