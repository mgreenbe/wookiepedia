The den inhabited a cave near the city of Nashal, on the planet Talus of the Corellian system.

However, the deal was fake and the Selonians were soon exploited by the smugglers. Several Selonians of the den were captured by the smugglers and kept as hostages in order to force the rest of the den into mining for them. The situation generated anti-human sentiments among the Selonian population of Talus and hostile anti-human demonstrations erupted in the city of Nashal. Despite no act of violence against Humans was reported, the local police force and the Cluster World Relations agency issued a travel warning for Nashal. Corellia News Service thus attempted to contact Kiisa Kimotte to get her to comment on the anti-human demonstrations but the den mother refused to respond to the request."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force was aware of the situation but was unable to intervene in Selonians matters. Agent Taarna thus recruited an independent spacer in order to help the Seloninans without involving the CorSec. The spacer met Kiki Dorente, advisor to the den mother, and the Seloninans accepted the assistance. The spacer worked with Tika Sileste, Ravi Thienta, Lika Fimente and Kiki Dorente in order to develop a strategy against the smugglers. The spacer then attacked the Smuggler Base and, although the outsider achieved most of the objectives, the assault was only a partial success. The spacer defeated most of the smugglers, including their leader, and crippled their ability to exploit the Selonians. However, the spacer discovered that the captive Selonians had already been shipped to Ord Mantell and sold as slaves. The spacer also discovered that a traitor in the Selonian den intentionally helped the smugglers. As the situation with the smugglers was solved, the spacer returned to the Selonian cave and was eventually introduced to the den mother. The spacer revealed that the Askura deal was fake and that a member of her Selonian mates betrayed the den. The matriarch promised that the traitor would be punished and rewarded the spacer for the assistance provided. The den mother also awarded the title of den mate to the spacer, a distinction that few non-Selonians received."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kiisa Kimotte appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
