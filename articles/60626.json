Little did the Grafs know that the helpful chef Shalla Mondatha, who helped them infiltrate the building by hiding them in a crate of live Wakizan beetles, was in fact a bounty hunter hired by Captain Visler Korda to retrieve precious cartographic data contained in CR-8R's head."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After infiltrating Rask's office, the Grafs bought time with a fake fire alarm, which allowed them to recover the droid's head. They then escaped via a water tube route that the mon Calamari uses to fill his water tank. Instead of reuniting with Shalla Mondatha, the children were rescued outside the building by Ephraim Bridger, a Lothalite who broadcast revolutionary messages."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
