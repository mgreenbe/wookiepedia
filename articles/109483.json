The slaves being armed and resisting Imperial rule saw Lord Drowl assigned to handle the uprising. As a result, he was assigned Sergeant Slarin to serve as his assistant in the creation of a new prototype toxin that became known as Quell. However, it had not been tested at the time and Drowl tasked an Imperial spacer with its deployment in the slaves water supply to see its effects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, unknown to Drowl, Slarin had grown disgusted with the Sith Lord's appetite for causing the suffering in living beings.
