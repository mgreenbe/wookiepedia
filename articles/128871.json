The landlord of the South Apartments then began to rent the apartments out to illegal aliens as it was unlikely the Tarisian Authorities would bother investigating such a run-down building. The welfare and cleaning of the Apartments was managed by the old janitor Kadir who was considered by the majority of the residents as quite a poor janitor, however Kadir believed he made the best of the limited resources he had available to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Residents"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Upper City South Apartments were used as a place of living and a hideout for oppressed aliens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Those who were present there included:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Quarren, the Ithorians and the Twi'lek were generally skeptical of Revan and his companions and showed mixed reactions to the Taris Situation and engagement in conversation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Quarren was seen wandering the halls and spoke to Revan about how he was an affluent and privileged individual before becoming trapped on Taris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ithorians were fearful and dismissive of Revan engaging them, and so was the Twi'lek, who pled Revan to not harm her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
