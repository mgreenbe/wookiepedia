The bomb broke the connections of elementary particles at a subatomic level, obliterates any matter within a radius of 20,000 to 50,000 kilometers. Such variable range made quantum bomb an unpredictability and they were rarely used during warfare. Despite this, the Eternal Empire of Zakuul used quantum bombs during the Eternal Empire conquest conflicts, such as the occupation of Denon. Zakuulan military officer Koth Vortena witnessed the destruction of Denon fleet, which pushed him to defect and later join the Alliance against Zakuul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Koth installed one quantum bomb on the Gravestone vessel to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. However, it proved a liability when the ship was taken over by SCORPIO and Vaylin with Koth still onboard and the Alliance fleet nearby. Koth and the Alliance Commander had to defuse bomb fuses throughout the ship and after bomb was triggered anyway during Vaylin's fight with Lana Beniko, he barely had the time to disarm the main component manually."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quantum bomb appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during \"Chapter III: Dark Reunions.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
