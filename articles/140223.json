During the Rebellion on Akiva, he served as an New Republic Defense Fleet ensign under Commander Kyrsta Agate onboard the frigate Sunspire. Mid battle, the vessel's scanners picked up a lone yacht headed for one of the Imperial Star Destroyers, and Agate asked Targada to track its movements. When the Klatooinian asked if they should fire on the ship, the commander decided to focus fire on the Star Destroyer instead, as the yacht might contain an intelligence asset. The yacht, which was carrying Imperial Admiral Rae Sloane, managed to reach one of the Star Destroyers and escape, but the New Republic ultimately won the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Targada was a gruff individual with a high brow and a frowning mouth.
