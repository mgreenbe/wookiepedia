The name of the Joben T-85 speeder bike, its components and manufacturer, identified in the 2014 reference book Star Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide by Adam Bray, are references to Star Wars Legends characters from the 1985 animated television series Star Wars: Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO. The name Joben itself is of course a reference to Thall Joben, while the manufacturer Zebulon Dak Speeder Corporation is a reference to the Legends company of the same name, and by extension character Zebulon Dak himself. While the components: Dusat aft-firing EMP emitter and Moll K-19 power generator, are similarly named after Jord Dusat and Kea Moll, respectively."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
