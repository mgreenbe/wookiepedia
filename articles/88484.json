At first, Gascon did not think much of his charges, considering them little more than electronic tools. In return, the droids did not think much of him, either, dismissing him as a little more than a \"map-reader\"; WAC-47 repeatedly addressed him by the incorrect rank of \"corporal.\" As their mission progressed, however, they came to form a mutual respect for each other.
