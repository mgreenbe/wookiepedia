In 3643 BBY, during the Old Republic era, a delegation of Gree droids present on Coruscant would speak in Basic while using Gree language patterns, which hindered communication with other beings. To outsiders, it would look as if they used the very same words to mean entirely different things."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It appears that the colors and geometric shapes are independent patterns. Parallel being a good state, as opposed to perpendicular. Obtuse and acute seem to have their actual meanings, while a vertex is a relationship between two objects or individuals. Concave seems to be worse then convex, although this is not very clear. A 'sphere' is undoubtedly a thought or concept, 'black sphere' being a complex or difficult idea."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Colors are a bit harder to figure out. Black and white appear to have something to do with the difficulty of a task: black being difficult and white being easy. Their colors seem to follow a pattern from advantageous to terrible, starting at purple and proceeding through the colors to blue. Purple-red-orange-yellow-green-blue. (Note:there is one instance where blue seems to be 'good,' although it is combined with parallel in that sentence which is known to be a positive)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "List of known expression patterns"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Note: suggested meanings are based on contextual clues."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
