After the Grand Army of the Republic accidentally bombed civilian territory in an attempt to destroy the Separatists' battle droids, the clone commandos of Aiwha Squad were sent in to search for survivors. They found a young boy named Evan, whose parents had been killed, in the bombed out remains of a farm house. Per their orders, Aiwha Squad escorted the child toward the nearby refugee camp, but while en route, Evan attempted to escape from the clones, only to encounter an OG-9 homing spider droid. Aiwha Squad's sergeant, RC-1013, drew the spider droid's attention to himself to protect the boy, and once he had drawn the droid's fire Aiwha Squad struck, attacking and destroying the droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the sun set over the horizon, Aiwha Squad decided to make camp for the night. Leisurely sitting around a fire without helmets and assorted pieces of armor, Evan inquired as to why the four commandos all looked the same. Sergeant RC-1013\u2014introducing himself as \"Sarge\"\u2014explained that they were clones, and introduced the other members of his squad: Zag, Tyto, and Di'kut. Evan explained his own predicament, including how he'd become an orphan during the battle, and Sarge expressed his sympathies before explaining the nature of their lives in the clone army and the importance of obeying orders in war. The following morning, Aiwha Squad arrives at the refugee camp with Evan and deliver him into the custody of Jedi Knight and General, Traavis. Traavis commended the squad on their efforts and relayed news of General Grievous' death while Sarge took a moment to offer some words of advice to Evan before parting. However, mere moments later, Sarge received the transmission from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine containing an order to carry out Order 66. Obediently, Sarge ordered his men to comply and shot down General Traavis as a traitor to the Republic, right before Evan's eyes. Seeing the child crying and confused, Sarge explained the meaning behind Order 66\u2014that the Jedi were traitors to the Republic who were to be killed\u2014and reiterated his belief in obeying the orders given to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although not stated in the comic itself, author Ryan Kaufman explains on the Jedi Council Forums that \"Orders\" takes place on the planet Garqi.
