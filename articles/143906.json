While flying in a modified LAAT/i gunship to their target area, the gunship was shot down by a B1-Series battle droid with a rocket launcher, and it crash-landed in the city. When they exited the gunship, they were surrounded by sniper-fire.

There, Fordo ordered two of his men to investigate two of the three life signs he detected. While one of his men investigated one of the life signs in the rubble and another in the rafters of the downed Acclamator assault ship, Fordo led the rest of his men to the one directly ahead of them. The life sign Fordo detected turned out to be Ki-Adi Mundi, who had just been disarmed by Grievous. General Grievous was about to deal the killing blow to Mundi when Fordo and his men opened fire on him. Grievous was able to evade the fire by ducking behind rubble. The troopers used the power of the Z-6 rotary blaster cannon, reciprocating quad blaster and under-barrel grenade launchers to destroy the cover provided by the durasteel. However, Grievous was able to continue to evade fire. Grievous attempted to scale up to the roof but was forced down by a volley of grenades. He landed next to four ARC lieutenants whom he promptly cut down with his two lightsabers. Fordo called for immediate backup. The weaponry of their ARC gunship was able to drive Grievous off, enabling evacuation of the survivors. Fordo was granted Jaig eyes for his actions on Hypori."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Muunilinst 10 were referred to as the best of the best, and were extremely effective in battle. As such, they carried many weapons, including standard issue BlasTech Industries DC-15A blaster rifles, modified DC-17 hand blasters as well as WESTAR-M5 blaster rifles, thermal detonators, heat signature detectors, PLX-1 portable missile launchers, Z-6 rotary blaster cannons, droid poppers, and reciprocating quad blasters."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "LAAT/i"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Muunilinst 10 LAAT was repainted with a Rancor nose art design.

After Kenobi's briefing in Clone Wars Chapter 2, nine clones are shown. Ten are visible after the LAAT/i is hit by a missile, and eleven disembark from the fallen gunship. The number once again reduces to ten in a scene when the clones plant the explosives on an artillery cannon. When Obi-Wan Kenobi rendezvouses with the Muunilinst 10, there are again nine clones. Finally, during the battle with Durge, the number of clones exceeds ten, which could mean that the unit has regrouped with the main invasion force in order to capture key InterGalactic Banking Clan officials. The number of ARC Alpha Lieutenants also changes from two to three, depending on the scene. Additionally, during the Battle of Hypori, nineteen clones are seen in several shots, with the number fluctuating as with previous chapters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
