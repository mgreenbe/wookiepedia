The clone trooper pilot was assigned to the starfighter unit Gold Squadron in the Republic Navy. In 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars, Confederate General Grievous planned to invade the planet Bothawui, home of the native Bothans. However, the Republic became aware of the plans, and Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, along with a battle group consisting of three Venator-class Star Destroyers, were sent to protect the Bothan homeworld. Even though the Republic forces were outnumbered, Skywalker persisted in protecting the Both system from a fleet of Confederate Munificent-class star frigates commanded by Grievous. Skywalker placed several All Terrain Tactical Enforcers on asteroids in the gas giant Bothawui Prime's asteroid belt, planning to attack the Confederate ships from behind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Confederate frigates emerged from hyperspace, Grievous ordered his ships to navigate through the Bothawui asteroid belt, as the cyborg General planned to use the asteroids to cover his ships from Republic laser fire.

The Jedi General led the clone pilots toward the approaching Confederate frigates but ordered Gold Squadron to hold positions, as he wanted the enemy ships to come closer so that the AT-TEs on the asteroids could attack them from behind. On Grievous' command, the frigates opened fire, causing damage to one of the Republic Star Destroyers. Just before one of Gold Squadron's starfighters was hit by laser fire, causing it to crash into another starfighter, the clone trooper pilot told wingmate Gold Six to watch his stabilizer. As the squadron took casualties from laser fire, Skywalker ordered the group to retreat, while he continued the assault on the approaching Confederate ships. Grievous' frigates were attacked by the Republic walkers from behind, eventually leading to the destruction of his fleet.
