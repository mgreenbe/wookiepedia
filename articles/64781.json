Both males and females had down-curved cranial horns, which gave them an aggressive aspect. The males' horns were generally a little larger, a remnant from their mountain-dwelling, caprinaen ancestors. The horns were able to regenerate if damaged."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They had limited manual dexterity because their broad hands were equipped with fatty digits; their hands were almost 1.5 times the size of a Human hand. Iktotchi measured on average 1.80 meters and had a rather significant breadth. Their life expectancy was approximately 90 years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The psychological abilities of the species should also be noted. Iktotchi had a gift of precognition (direct knowledge or perception of the future) which was relatively effective on their native world, but whose capacities became very limited as soon as they moved away from the moon. In addition, Iktotchi had powerful telepathic abilities. In spite of their rather unfriendly appearance, Iktotchi were sensitive beings who masked their deeper emotions under an appearance of stoicism."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Respectful of cultures other than their own, Iktotchi could adapt to life in differing civilizations; however, they seldom interacted with other races, and when they did, often experienced great difficulty. Indeed, their gift of precognition generally proved a curse, because it often frightened other species and Iktotchi were made the object of insults. In the same way, some unscrupulous individuals tried to deceive Iktotchi into using their gift for criminal ends. As a result, Iktotchi were barred from gambling at almost every casino in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To communicate between themselves, Iktotchi used the Iktotchese language, but could speak Basic without a problem."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First Contacts"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the early stages of their history, Iktotchi were discovered by the advanced Kwa who helped to move the primitive Iktotchi society toward true civilization, teaching them rudiments of the Force as well. Unfortunately, when the Kwa Civilization collapsed, the relations between the Iktotchi and the Kwa terminated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their contact with the Kwa long forgotten, the Iktotchi were the only sentient beings of their star system for several millennia. However, Iktotchi legends dating from the early days of their civilization made mention of the fact that they would eventually belong to a great galactic civilization. Thus when the explorers of the Old Republic discovered the Iktotchi civilization, some time approximately between 4000 BBY to 3500 BBY, they were extremely surprised to see that these beings had already prepared for their arrival for several weeks. The Iktotchi had carved the symbol of the Republic into their world's surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Indeed, when the Republic vessel entered the orbit of the moon, those aboard her thought they must have found a Republic colony rather than the homeworld of an unknown species, because they could observe with the naked eye a giant version of the Republic seal, dug into a high plateau of the largest continent. The Iktotchi heads had been assembled in this place to contact \"The Great Star Sages\". Thus the xenobiologists discovered quickly that the Iktotchi had a gift for limited precognition, in the form of dreams or visions. This natural talent fascinated the Jedi, who had established a recent Jedi Temple. It was later found that the effectiveness of Iktotchi precognition could be enhanced by way of using the Force."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Old Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iktotchi also had great aptitudes for piloting. Jedi Master Saesee Tiin was one of the best pilots of The Order during the last years of the Old Republic. They were also regularly employed as mechanics or engineers. However, few people trusted them, thinking that they were using their telepathic abilities to spy, or carrying the Omen Disease. Iktotchi tried to deny any existence of extrasensory gifts, which from a certain point of view was true. Indeed, their gift of precognition was very limited when they moved away from Iktotch. But the more time passed, and the more the memory of the strangeness of the first contact was erased from their collective memory, made it possible for the other species of the Galaxy to forget the Iktotchi's gift and to be integrated within the Old Republic. On the other hand their talent with piloting was always sought by pirates."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the forfeiture of the Old Republic, the Iktotchi diplomats had a vision of the carnage of the Clone Wars, as well as the birth of the Empire. They tried to sensitize the Old Republic to recognize the signs, but it was in vain. Once they realized that nothing would prevent the birth of the New Order, most Iktotchi returned to their native world, even those alive in the farthest reaches of the External Edge. Indeed, thanks to their precognition, they knew that a disaster awaited them if they tried to live under the yoke of the Emperor. They thus manufactured orbital colonies to manage the incredible flow of immigrants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The continuation of their race gave them reason once more; indeed, the Emperor was satisfied with their isolationist retreat, and installed a blockade around their system. The Empire did not even take the trouble to install a planetary governor. Iktotchi thus remained completely insulated, believing this their only means of safety; however, some took the risk to join the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The New Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the fall of the Empire, they were among the first to participate on the foundation of the New Republic. Strangely enough, in spite of their gift of precognition, the Iktotchi were unable to predict the invasion of Yuuzhan Vong; they were quite surprised to find out that all evil had not been purged from the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Essential Guide to Alien Species incorrectly states the Iktotchi are from Iktotchon, which is a gas giant in the Iktotchi system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Essential Atlas shows in the Galactic Explorations map that Iktotchi was discovered sometime between 20,000 BBY to 15,000 BBY, however whether this is the planet or just the system has yet to be stated. In an email, Jason Fry stated that it's possible the Iktotchi and their system were most likely known much earlier than the date which is stated in The New Essential Guide to Alien Species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
