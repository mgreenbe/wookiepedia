In its natural form, this being looked like a skeletal bird, but it could take the likeness of Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith and second-in-command of the Galactic Emperor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 0 BBY, Gyaos Vader captured the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and held him prisoner on Kessel, the asteroid-shaped planet. The young Tatooinian Luke Skywalker, who had began his Jedi training under Kenobi, came to the rescue of his Master. Once Skywalker reached the creature's lair in the temple, he faced Gyaos Vader, who had taken the shape of the Lord Vader in order to surprise him. Both opponents drew their lightsabers and engaged in a duel. During the fight, the creature turned back to its true shape and began flying around the room. Skywalker and the changeling traded several blows, but the young Jedi got the upper hand. Having killed Gayos Vader, Luke Skywalker freed Master Kenobi and set off for Iskalon, where the golden droid C-3PO had been been taken hostage by another shapeshifter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gyaos Vader was one of the stage bosses in the Japanese Star Wars 1987 video game.
