In 23 BBY, Freespan announced plans to double the number of scheduled liner departures for Ando, following the planet's secession from the Galactic Republic. Freespan predicted increased travel from Andoan expatriates wishing to return. Other major starlines, such as Romodi Interstellar and Galaxy Tours, were thought to be following Freespan's lead and were set to announce similar increases."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
