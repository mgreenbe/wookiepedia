Sidious was also the template of his cloned son, a failed strandcast who was engineered by the Sith Eternal cult on Exegol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cloning was the process of using a living organism's genetic code as a template in order to create one or more clones of the original source. Without alterations to the template, the clone would be an exact duplicate of its progenitor. By manipulating the genetic structure of the template, a clone's genotype could be modified for various purposes such as growth acceleration and greater docility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A single genetic sample taken from an original organism was sufficient to grow millions of clones. Host samples degraded over time, however, making the donor essential for replacement samples. The cloning process could be sustained without the original host, but only by rationing the last viable samples of DNA. Eventually a new template would have to be selected in order to grow more clones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cloning of a human template was an imperfect science despite the Kaminoan's efforts to perfect their craft as cloners. It was rare, but possible to find genetic and physical defects in their specimens, resulting in either desirable or undesirable clone aberrations. Furthermore, cloning a Force-sensitive template did not guarantee that the clone would share its source's connection to the Force. Darth Sidious retained the use of his Force powers despite being confined to an imperfect cloned body of himself, while his cloned son was a healthy but powerless specimen. Nevertheless, it was possible for the genetic donor's Force-sensitivity to pass to the next generation in their bloodline, as was the case with Rey, Sidious' biological granddaughter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A clone army"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the final years of the Galactic Republic, the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus recruited Jango Fett\u2014a human bounty hunter\u2014as the genetic template of a secret army of clone troopers. Fett would come to live on the planet Kamino where the Kaminoans, a species of skilled cloners, extracted samples of his DNA in order to create the first generation of clone soldiers for the Republic. In addition to the mercenary's financial compensation, Fett requested the creation of an unaltered clone of himself. The result was Boba Fett, a clone whom Jango regarded as a son."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kaminoan government's scientists modified Jango Fett's genotype for the purpose of producing loyal clones at an accelerated rate. With the exception of Boba, who was grown through pure genetic replication, the rest of Jango's clones were designed to age at twice the speed of birth-born humans. To ensure loyalty and obedience in the clones, the Kaminoans installed an inhibitor chip within the brain of every Fett clone. The chip's official purpose was to diminish the aggressive traits of the clone template so that the clones would be more compliant with orders. Although the Kaminoans believed that the chip was actually meant to serve as a contingency against rogue Jedi, the true nature of its design would compel the clones to execute Order 66\u2014a secret protocol conceived by the Sith in their plot to destroy the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In spite of Taun We's confidence in the clone army's training, Fett was indifferent to them, referring to his cloned progeny as \"livestock\" bred to fight and die as \"cannon fodder.\" He dismissed the Kaminoan aide's assumption that he would be proud of his clones, and reminded Taun We that they were the Kaminoans' creations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Separatist Crisis, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the clone army on Kamino while investigating an assassination plot against Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Prime Minister Lama Su and Taun We took him on an inspection tour of the cloning facility in Tipoca City, believing he had been dispatched at the behest of the Jedi High Council and the Galactic Senate. During the tour, Kenobi learned the identity of clone army's template, Jango Fett, who was also the would-be assassin who tried to kill Amidala. Kenobi reported his findings to his superiors, Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Master Mace Windu, who ordered him to bring the hunter to the Jedi Grand Temple on Coruscant for interrogation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the death of Jango Fett in the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, the Kaminoans were forced to conserve their remaining samples of the Fett genome in order to grow more clones for the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic. As a result, the new clones were less efficient according to Lama Su, who recommended to Jedi Master Shaak Ti that the Order should procure another template due to their waning supply of Fett DNA. As the Clone Wars continued to spread across the galaxy, the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded Kamino with the aim of halting the world's cloning production. The Republic Military successfully defended Tipoca City from the Separatist Droid Army while Jedi General Anakin Skywalker prevented Asajj Ventress from stealing the last supply of Fett's genetic samples."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the discovery of the Zillo Beast on Malastare, the Republic Military transferred the creature to the Republic capital for scientific study.

Kryze denounced Fett, declaring that he was not a Mandalorian but a clone who disgraced the Mandalorian armor he wore. Fett told her that his armor once belonged to his father, Jango, whom Kryze referred to as Boba's donor.

His new body was flawed, however, as was the transference, leaving Sidious trapped in a weak and decaying vessel. The Sith cultists who served him sought to create a more stable host for their master's essence, resulting in various failed strandcasts. The Jedi apprentice Rey was a byproduct of the Sith Eternal's experiments, being the natural-born daughter of Sidious' cloned son.
