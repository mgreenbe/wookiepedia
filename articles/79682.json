Heavy iron content in the soil gave the planet a faint blue sheen, and when combined with the red glare of its sun, gave the planet a garish and gloomy atmosphere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lan Barell was the fourth planet of the Lan system, located in the Hook Nebula of the Outer Rim Territories. A dusty, hot, and dry terrestrial world, the moisture in the planet's atmosphere was locked in thin polar ice caps. Ore-rich, the heavy iron content in the planet's soil gave Lan Barell a faint blue sheen. The planet had standard gravity and a breathable Type I atmosphere. A day lasted twenty-three standard hours, and a year was comprised of 255 local days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The most inhabitable parts of Lan Barell were located on large plateaus that served as continents, while the uninhabitable wastelands known as the Lowlands separated the plateaus like oceans. At some point, Lan Barell possessed three moons. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, only two remained as the third had been stripped mined, broken down and refined. The remnants of the moon served as bases for orbiting ore refining plants. The other two moons were scarred by strip mining."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lan Barell was the homeworld of the Qieg, a species of sentient insectoids. Mechanically minded, the Qieg lived in colony nests throughout the cacti forests that covered the habitable plateaus. Lan Barell's main exports were ore, minerals and other raw materials, which were then sold to Coreward-bound freighters and to systems in the Mid Rim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shulell City served as the planet's capital, and the planetary government, the Human-Qieg Guild, was based in the city. A space navy of one hundred vessels provided security for the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lan Barell was discovered by Galactic Republic scouts around 1300 BBY, who discovered that the inner planets of the system were extremely rich in ore. Soon after discovery, Gaminne Group, Inc., a conglomerate looking to expand its mining operations, negotiated the rights to mine the inner planets from the Qieg. Under the agreement, a charter allowed Human colonists to settle on Lan Barell and establish Shulell City."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the centuries, the original charter was lost to memory, and Gammine Group, Inc. ceased to exist. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Qieg and Human cultures considered the planet to be jointly owned. Despite Gammine Group, Inc.'s cessation, mining operations in the system continued, taken over by various companies. In turn, these companies formed the Human-Qieg Guild, a conglomeration that was established to oversee the mines that became the government for the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the years, the Human-Qieg Guild attempted to diversify their exports and attract new settlers, but such efforts ultimately failed. As a rule, more people left Lan Barell than arrived, which contributed to a low Human population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Empire came to power in 19 BBY, Lan Barell became a haven for fringers and exiles. Being isolated and possessing a lax legal system, those beings wishing to avoid the Empire started to visit Lan Barell to offload smuggled goods, refugees and exiles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 15 BBY, the Empire finally claimed Lan Barell in the name of the Emperor. The visit was brief, amounting to little more than a show of force and receiving the oaths of fealty from the Human-Qieg Guild. The mining operations were valued for taxation purposes, and then the planet was left alone with a virtually non-existent presence. An Imperial Embassy was established in Shulell City which was staffed by four diplomats who had displeased their superiors. Twice a year, representatives of the local Moff would arrive to remind the population of their allegiance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiee Chyakk clan worked out of the Shulell City spaceport, located twenty kilometers from the city of Carmelle. Under Imperial control Lan Barell's legal system suffered from poor enforcement and several less-savory mining companies opened their doors on the world. As the Empire began to strengthen its forces on the planet in 15 BBY, the Imperials allowed the local government to remain intact so long as they collected taxes on behalf of the Empire. Throughout Imperial control, many refugees fled to Lan Barell to hide in the mines of the planet in fear of persecution by the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shulell City was the capital of Lan Barell. A Human-style settlement, it was inhabited by both Humans and Qieg. All financial transactions regarding the sale of ore and materials had to be processed and authorized at the city's center of commerce, the Quilan Hive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lowlands, while being largely uninhabitable, were the location of a network of major mines on Lan Barell that had not yet been tapped out. Material from the mines was shipped via sub-orbital freighter to Shulell City for processing and refinement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plateaus were home to a number of ranches that raised Dingory, the primary meat source for both Humans and Qieg."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cultures of the native Qieg and the long-time Human population merged into a single culture by the time of the Galactic Civil War, and the two races were partners in the governing of the planet. Each community saw the planet as jointly owned with the other. Qieg who interacted with Humans on a regular basis wore special masks that translated their speech and mandible movements into basic. In turn, the Lan Barell humans learned to show emotion through hand gestures rather than facial expressions to mimic the way Qieq used their antenna."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
