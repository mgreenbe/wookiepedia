Some were used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War, a few having been stationed on the asteroid AX-456. During the battle of AX-456, Rebel defenders used some A-type droids as a makeshift barrier between them and the attacking stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire. The droid wall gave the Rebels a brief advantage, but Cadet Leader Kyle Katarn ordered his stormtroopers to use thermal detonators to tear the droid wall apart, destroying the A-types. The defenders attempted to retreat, but they were all cut down by the remaining stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A-type droids first appeared in the 1997 novella Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire, written by William C.
