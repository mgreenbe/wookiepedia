The structure was originally used by the company Nebula Consumables and when the company vacated the warehouse, they left behind thousands of tons of expired denta beans inside the structure. The beans attracted flocks of gartros to the building, which roosted in the warehouse, resulting in the development of a thick layer of guano on the warehouse floor. The Lost Ones, a Coruscanti street gang, later used rookery as part of an initiation ceremony for new recruits to the gang. The initiation involved a power cell being thrown into the building and the new member being ordered to retrieve it. The gang would then lock the new recruit inside the warehouse overnight and if the individual survived the experience and still had the power cell in the morning, the recruit would become a full member of the gang."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
