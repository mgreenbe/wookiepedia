It had been outfitted with enhanced munition firing systems, which were capable of delivering heavier and more explosive payloads into battle. The performance enhancements were built around existing systems, which visibly differentiated the Enhanced AT-MP from standard All Terrain Missile Platform walkers, with one such difference being dark colored armor plates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
