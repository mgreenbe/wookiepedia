The two wished for the Toydarians to allow the Galactic Republic to use their territory as a staging ground for relief efforts on the planet Ryloth. Though Katuunnko denied the request, he agreed to a limited version of the plan so long as it could be kept secret from the Trade Federation and also expressed an interest in joining the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
