When Gideon asked if his dark troopers had engaged, the comms officer reported that the troopers were deploying momentarily, and four dark troopers then flew down to apprehend Grogu at a temple ruin. Once the infant had been taken aboard the light cruiser, the vessel escaped into hyperspace. The comms officer later joined Gideon as he inspected and taunted Grogu.

The officer acknowledged the request, believing that Kryze was an Imperial pilot, and Gideon ordered for TIE fighters to be launched. The comms officer advised Shuttle 2743 to stay clear of the cruiser's launch tube where the TIEs were deployed.

In reality, the shuttle carried Djarin and his allies, who gunned down personnel in the hanger. Gideon ordered the activation of the dark troopers, and departed the bridge. Djarin's associates soon reached the bridge, eliminating the defending stormtroopers and officers.

According to O'Brian, on \"The Khetanna Cast,\" she auditioned with no knowledge of what the role was for, with fake scripts being used for the audition itself, as the production was allegedly extremely secretive. She was cast for her role, without being called back for another audition, around a year prior to the release of \"Chapter 12: The Siege\" and her scenes were apparently filmed in the US state of Georgia between December 2019 and February 2020, her final shoot being among the last scenes filmed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "O'Brian claimed that she received her lines the night before as a secrecy precaution, and her Imperial uniform was one of the original costumes used during the filming of the original trilogy.

She also worked closely with Moff Gideon's actor Giancarlo Esposito, even meeting his children when they visited one day. O'Brian also begged her way into meeting the puppet and robotic models for Grogu. Upon the release of \"Chapter 12: The Siege,\" O'Brian received widespread support from her fans and the LGBT community, which she is a member of.
