Located in the southwestern corner of the Market, the warehouse consisted of an entryway with two rooms branching off, and a secure vault with a blast door was accessible from one of the rooms. In 3643 BBY, the Rodian thief Vistis Garn and several Guild members brought a shipment of weapons and munitions they had stolen from the Republic Military back to the warehouse. However, a young Jedi Knight and the astromech droid T7-O1 tracked the group back to the warehouse and stormed the building, defeating the thugs and retrieving the stolen shipment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Guild warehouse is a class-restricted location, or \"story phase,\" for the Jedi Knight class's mission \"Stolen Secrets\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011.
