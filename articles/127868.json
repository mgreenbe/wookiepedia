Although seemingly a primitive weapon, this rifle was useful to a bounty hunter who was operating on a planet with strict weapon laws that banned or restricted his usual arsenal of stunning weapons, such as blasters, stun grenades, and grenade launchers. The snare rifle was quite similar to the snare gun used by slavers. The snare pistol was a smaller version of the snare rifle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The snare rifle weighed 5 kilograms and was able to fire 5 shots before needing to be reloaded. The weapon cost 1,200 credits.

Rather than firing a cord, it fired a burst of shockstun mist incapacitating the target, followed up by a liquid spraynet that covered the target, quickly solidifying to hold the target fast. This particular variant was used by Zuckuss, a Gand bounty hunter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
