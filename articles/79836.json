When Chanath asks what the Emperor has aboard his yacht, O-66 replies that she was chosen for this mission precisely because she was skilled at dealing with the unexpected. Chanath agrees and proceeds deeper into the ship. Back in the central chamber, Lando Calrissian asks Korin Pers how much the Sith helmet is worth.
