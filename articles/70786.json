The Nami were demonstrating the combat superiority of the TIE/D Defender, which they had stolen from the Imperials in an earlier raid with the intent of producing such craft for themselves and subsequently selling them to the Rebels. A retaliatory strike led by Tan Maarek Stele failed to save the cargo transfer area, but saved the Imperial personnel there from certain slaughter by the Nami. The Jester took no part in the attack and was ignored through the battle, thus it was able to flee the area with its Nami allies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
