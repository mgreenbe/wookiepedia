Their plan originally worked as they knocked Djarin off his Zephyr-J speeder bike. As Djarin fought off the other raiders, the raider attempted to capture Grogu but was shot by Djarin. The raider then pointed a rifle at him, but Djarin uses his fibercord whip to pull the rifle away, knocking the other two raiders out. The alien grabbed Grogu, holding a knife to his throat. Djarin threatened the individual, saying if he hurt Grogu, there was nowhere he could hide, but then suggested a bargain, offering to trade the valuable cargo in the wreckage, including Boba Fett's armor and a hunk of krayt dragon meat. The alien considered the offer, then demanded Djarin's jetpack. He agreed, removing the jetpack and placing it on the sand. The alien placed Grogu on the ground, grabbed the jetpack and ran away. Djarin picked up Grogu, activated the jetpack with his wrist gauntlet controls, sending the alien high into the air and dropping him to his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
