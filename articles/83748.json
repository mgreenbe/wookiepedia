His torso and arms were cybernetic. A mad scientist, Lucien used to conduct experiments on his own sons. However, prior to the Battle of Yavin, the three young boys managed to escape their father with the help of a man who would later become the Meatlump King. The man and the three Bender brothers founded the Meatlumps, a gang of technology-hating thugs. In response, Lucien Bender created the Bofa Treat Gang."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, Lucien Bender was still angered against his traitorous sons and placed a bounty on the three brothers. However, he ignored that a much larger bounty was placed on him and his gang. Around 1 ABY, the bounty hunter Bossk localized Lucien in a bunker near the city of Kor Vella. The bounty hunter then captured Louis Bender. He intended to force his brothers Hraykken and Draykken to handle Lucien for him so he could collect the most substantial bounty. Bossk was keeping Louis in custody near Lucien's bunker when a spacer affiliated with the Meatlumps arrived to rescue Louis Bender. The bounty hunter revealed that it was not interested by the bounty on Louis' head and agreed with freeing the man upon Lucien would be killed. The spacer therefore attacked the Bofa Treat Gang and finally found Lucien in the depths of the bunker. The adventurer confronted the man and finally killed Lucien Bender."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucien Bender was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
