Members of the society would single out cruel droid owners for public displays, such as splashing them with buckets of oil, or stealing droids and setting them free. While the society claimed that it was not responsible for any violent crimes, critics of the organization believed that it wouldn't be long before one of Society's targets was killed by them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
