Under Imperial and New Republic laws, the first scout to register the find claimed the credit prize. However, in cases of claim jumping, no payment was offered to the scout until an investigation was carried out. The Code of the Claim was concocted to resolve the situation; if multiple claims had been registered before the credits were paid out, the scout declared a Mutual Claim Registration and split the reward. The establishment of the Code of the Claim led to more claim jumping as many scouts felt they were entitled to jump a claim as they had either previously had to settle for an MCR, or knew that they would have to settle in the future."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
