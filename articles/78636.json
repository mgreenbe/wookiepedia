They were considered pests, as they fed on energy sources found on ships or in spaceports."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kurkuoths were spidery creatures with a square central body and four segmented legs, one on each corner. The central body, typically less than half a meter long, was protected by a hard shell that was jointed to allow the creature to fold itself nearly in half, giving it access to small openings. A mouth was on the lower part of the shell with clusters of eyes on both the top and bottom of the central body, allowing the kurkuoth to see any signs of danger while feeding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kurkuoths were cowardly, usually choosing flight over fight. However, a kwath that had developed a nest and a food source for its offspring would often be far braver. They reproduced asexually, with environmental conditions affecting the number of eggs the parent generated.  A typical kurkuoth lifespan was one to three years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
