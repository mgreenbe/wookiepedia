Khai obtained Tikk in a competition in 37.5 ABY and subsequently used Tikk as transportation on the planet of Kesh, on which she lived with the other members of the Lost Tribe of Sith. Tikk was present when Khai first encountered a Sith Meditation Sphere named Ship in 41.5 ABY. Tikk was almost killed when Khai first became a Sith apprentice to Lady Rhea. As a test, Khai was forced to watch as her uvak was taken from her and had an activated lightsaber raised above his neck. Instead of attempting to rescue Tikk, Khai suppressed her emotions, and Rhea thus spared the uvak's life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 44 ABY, Gavar Khai, Vestara's father, executed Tikk because he felt Tikk was no longer needed since Vestara was no longer around.
