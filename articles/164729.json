The Star Wars wiki is inspired by Wikipedia, but expands on Star Wars information in greater detail and with more freedom than Wikipedia can.

In January of 2005, Steven Greenwood joined Wikipedia under the screenname of \"Riffsyphon1024,\" adding articles in the subject of geography and popular culture. Immediately after working on these articles of interest, he took the job of sorting the various Star Wars articles on the site. As Wikipedia was concerned, only notable items would have complete articles, with the rest of the minor subjects with descriptions on a giant list. Planets, characters, weapons, and vehicles were all done in this manner. Over a short period of time, Steven found that he disliked this format and sought another way to gather and place information on the saga and its Expanded Universe.

The next day, Steven joined the site, using his previous Wikipedia screenname. WhiteBoy was given bureaucrat rights by Wikia on the same day.

The purge was later dubbed the \"Great LucasCruft Purge\" by Steven himself. It was Steven's goal to save as many articles from this individual before the damage was made permanent, and would then impede Star Wars Wiki's ability to grow as it did within the first month. One such article that became a focus of this battle was Order D6-66, which became one of the first stub articles added to the new wiki via the \"transwiki\" process.
