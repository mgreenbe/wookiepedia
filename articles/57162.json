During the Battle of Sarrish, he was forced to retreat into space. His transport ended up crash landing on Abafar. The crash caused him to suffer from amnesia and he was hired by a Sullustan named Borkus who had him work as a dishwasher in a local bar until he regained his memories after Colonel Meebur Gascon showed the commando information to him. He was thought to be killed in an explosion trying to protect the colonel and his companions in a firefight against Separatist droids, but survived, although he suffered from brain damage, causing him to partially go insane. Fifteen years after the end of the Clone Wars, Gregor was still alive and was living in a modified AT-TE on Seelos with Captain Rex and Commander Wolffe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Gregor participated in the Liberation of Lothal, where the Lothal resistance group and the Spectres drove the Galactic Empire off Lothal once and for all.

After covering the retreat of his allies, Gregor was reported as missing in action after the Battle of Sarrish, a battle that ended disastrously for the Republic, and was thought to be missing in space. However, he ended up in the town of Pons Ora on the planet Abafar with amnesia and was given a job working as a dishwasher at the Power Sliders diner by the Sullustan Borkus for nothing more than room and board. He worked at the diner for some time and, due to his amnesia, never realized who he was. Borkus claimed his armor, weapons, and other gear and kept it, never telling Gregor who he was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Colonel Meebur Gascon and his team of droids crash-landed on Abafar as they attempted to return to Republic lines after a mission, they eventually made their way into the town. As Gascon attempted to find food, he ran into Gregor behind the diner. Gregor offered him food but was confused when Gascon attempted to tell him that he was a clone. Gascon began to think that Gregor was working undercover, and a disoriented Gregor left Gascon and later went home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Gregor returned home from work and was greeted by a hologram of Clone Captain Rex. Shocked, Gregor listened as Gascon explained who he was. When R2-D2 scanned Gregor's arm to learn his designation, CC-5576-39, Gascon read through Gregor's report, which listed him as missing in action. Gregor began to remember who he was, recalling the wounded and dying clones from the battle. Gascon convinced Gregor to search for his gear and help them leave the planet and complete their mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gregor and his new companions broke into the diner to search for Gregor's equipment, but Borkus arrived with Gregor's gear in a large crate. When Gregor angrily accused Borkus of lying to him, Borkus raised Gregor's blaster at him. Gregor attempted to reclaim it from him and clumsily lunged at him, still not functioning to his abilities as a clone commando. Borkus easily knocked him down, but was defeated by the droids of D-Squad. Gregor then donned his gear and prepared to help D-Squad storm the landing pad at the Separatist Rhydonium mining installation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gregor began to fire on hordes of battle droids, clearing a path for his allies but leaving himself surrounded. As hostile forces closed in, Gregor yelled for Gascon and his forces to take off despite facing near-certain death.

He along with numerous other Republic Commandos were sent to an Imperial facility on Daro as a instructor to oversee the training of cadets that would become the Empire's first true Stormtroopers. However, he quickly realized that he did not want a part of it. Though escape was relatively easy, he was spotted and recaptured, but not before managing to send a distress call to Captain Rex. He was rescued by his fellow deserters of Clone Force 99.

Unfortunately, his brain took a hit and as a result, he suffered from episodes of mild insanity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Four years prior to the Battle of Yavin, the clones were approached by the crew of the Ghost, who were looking for information on abandoned military installations for the rebel network. When Kanan Jarrus identified them as clones, Wolffe, in turn, recognized him as a Jedi and let off a few shots. Gregor eagerly raised his rifle but Rex calmed the situation. When Ezra Bridger explained that they were sent by Ahsoka Tano, Rex welcomed them as friends. Later on, Gregor encouraged the Lasat Garazeb Orrelios to help the clones hunt for joopas. But he later reveals to Ezra that Zeb was in fact the bait, resulting in the Lasat being swallowed by the joopa, whom Gregor nicknamed Big Bongo. After managing to kill the joopa, Zeb was none too happy to learn that he was bait, but was calmed when Gregor pointed out that he helped catch Big Bongo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While settling down for dinner, Sabine discovered that one of the clones, Wolffe, had contacted the Empire. While Gregor and Rex had grown to trust the Ghost crew, Wolffe wanted to protect his comrades from being persecuted by the Empire for harboring these rebels. When confronted, Wolffe admitted his wrongdoing and accepted Rex's reasoning that the rebels were their friends. After discovering and destroying an Imperial probe droid, the clones and rebels prepared for the impending Imperial assault.

At Ezra's urging, the rebels returned to rescue the clones and succeeded in defeating the Imperial force, forcing Kallus and his men to flee into the desert. After that, Gregor and his fellow clones saluted Kanan and his Padawan, and Rex agreed to join the Rebellion whilst Gregor and Wolffe stayed behind on Seelos, taking the remaining AT-AT walker for their new home."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Helping Ezra"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Gregor and Wolffe were still living in the repurposed AT-AT walker, which had been christened Joopa Base.

Thrawn managed to force Ezra to meet him aboard the Chimaera by bombarding Lothal's Capital City.

Despite fierce resistance, Team B managed to reach the south tower. There, they were attacked by Thrawn's Noghri assassin Rukh and several death troopers. While Zeb fought Rukh, Gregor and Kallus dealt with the others. During the battle, Gregor was shot in the right side of the chest by an Imperial weapons technician. Despite being mortally wounded, Gregor hurled the Imperial into the depths of the reactor chamber. He then told Kallus to get the shields back up. After reuniting with Rex, who had helped restore the north tower's power terminal, Gregor told Rex it was an honor to serve alongside him, saying that he was grateful to have died fighting for something that he chose to believe in before passing away. Rex stayed by his side until the end before returning to the fight.

Gregor and Wolffe were loyal to Rex and looked up to him as their leader, and they were willing to fight to the death in order to protect their new-found rebel friends from Imperial forces led by Agent Kallus.
