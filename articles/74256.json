She served in a security squad under the command of Captain Atar. Around this time, several Jedi Knights were stricken with a mysterious psychosis that caused them to believe that everyone they knew had been replaced by impostors. The Galactic Federation of Free Alliances decided to deal with the matter by encasing the affected Jedi in carbonite."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jedi Knights Bazel Warv and Yaqeel Saav'etu developed this psychosis, they were quickly incapacitated by Imperial Remnant Head of State Jagged Fel, Jedi Knight Jaina Solo, and Solo's parents, Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo, outside of the New Jedi Temple's speeder entrance. Karpette and the rest of Atar's force were nearby, and a warrant was quickly made out for the arrest of Warv and Saav'etu. With Karpette in possession of the warrant, the Security force confronted Fel and the Solos outside the Temple, and Atar requested that the Jedi hand Warv and Saav'etu over. The group was reluctant to comply, however, and Atar ordered Karpette to step forward and hand him the warrant. Faced with no other option, Han and Leia then stalled for time by reentering the Jedi Temple and closing the gate behind them as Fel and Jaina left the scene in Fel's limousine, using Fel's diplomatic immunity to prevent the Security forces from blocking their exit and leaving Karpette and the rest of Atar's force empty-handed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karpette took joy in her duties, and she was exceptionally delighted when Atar called her forward to present the warrant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karpette first appeared briefly in Troy Denning's 2009 novel, Fate of the Jedi: Abyss, the third installment in the nine-part Fate of the Jedi series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
