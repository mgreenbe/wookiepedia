During the war, Conevor bet his starship that Tala could win any race. Jostero, the leader of the Silestro Privateers, challenged her to a swoop race. Shortly before the race finished, Gus informed Conevor that no matter the outcome of the race the privateers planned on killing the trio and taking their belongings.
