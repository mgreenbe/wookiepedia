Their origins were not entirely known, but some dated as far back as the first Jedi Exodus. In addition, their design methodology was similar to those used by the Rakatan Infinite Empire. Eventually, they came to be considered a highly rare form of technology within the known worlds. According to ancient records, such assemblers were primarily used in the shifting of crystalline resonances which were used in powering holocrons. As a result, it allowed traditional holocrons to be used by other beings, even if the user was not a Force-sensitive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
