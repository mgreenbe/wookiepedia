They contained evolutionary traits from multiple other animals, and had strong armor, jaws with double rows of teeth and purple prehensile tongues which they used to quickly devour small prey, or use to capture large prey and pull in to their jaws. They moved by taking in water through their large mouth and expelling it through small vents on its back.
