Shortly prior to the Battle of Yavin, Mon Mothma proposed an attack on Milvayne in the near future, which was supported by Bail Prestor Organa before his death. Following the Battle of Yavin, Mon Mothma ordered the attack to be carried out. Garm Bel Iblis, who rarely saw eye to eye with Mon Mothma, believed that the planet possessed an Ubiqtorate base rather than a mere Imperial garrison, and that the attack was an impossible, suicidal undertaking. The quarrel over the attack ultimately led to the split between the Alliance and Bel Iblis's forces. The battle eventually occurred but Rebel forces were defeated as expected by Bel Iblis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
