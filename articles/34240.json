As such, it measured at 1,600 meters long and was outfitted four port and four starboard octuple turbolaser barbettes, ventral turbolasers, sublight engines, a hangar bay, two deflector shield generator domes, and a solar ionization reactor. Additionally, the Dark Omen was equipped with a hyperdrive system, specifically a class 2 primary and a class 8 backup.

By the time of the Lothal campaign, the Dark Omen was under the command of Captain Corf Ferno as part of Grand Admiral Thrawn's 7th Fleet. After Grand Admiral Thrawn pinpointed the location of the Rebel Alliance's Chopper Base on Atollon, Thrawn dispatched a squadron of five Imperial I-class Star Destroyers from Lothal to Atollon under Admiral Kassius Konstantine's command, including Captain Ferno's Dark Omen, which was the lead destroyer. The Star Destroyers were accompanied by two Arquitens-class command cruisers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the arrival of Imperial forces at the Atollon system, Phoenix Cell and Massassi Group scrambled to evacuate their base of operations and disperse their fleet. Alliance Commander Jun Sato ordered Phoenix fleet forces to employ Defense Formation Aurek One, while General Jan Dodonna of Massassi Group ordered his EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates to jump into hyperspace.

Eventually, rebel forces deployed their starfighter squadrons and rearranged their vessels into a spearhead formation, with frigates and corvettes defending the transports. As a result of rebel maneuvers, Grand Admiral Thrawn ordered his ships to deploy TIE fighters and to reinforce the center of their formation.

The rebel bombers then moved to the ship's portside to conduct another bombing pass, but were forced to break off when one of their bombers were destroyed by attacking TIE fighters and the Dark Omen's port batteries.

This action destroyed both vessels and allowed the Jedi Lieutenant Commander Ezra Bridger to escape and summon reinforcements. Following Sato's sacrifice and additional losses, rebel forces fled to the surface of Atollon. Thrawn reorganized his formation, and all of his Star Destroyers launched an orbital bombardment of Chopper Base to break rebel morale, but the deflector shield generator held firm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a ground assault by Thrawn to capture the rebel leadership and the destruction of the Interdictor cruiser Constrainer by Mandalorian reinforcements brought by Bridger, the last remaining rebel ships fled Atollon's surface and moved towards the Imperial blockade.
