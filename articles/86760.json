In 43 ABY he presided over the case of Colla-Arphocc Automata versus the Galactic Alliance and was interviewed just before the trial's start. His interview was cut short when agents working under Rej Taunt seized the Mount of Justice communication center as part of a plot to kidnap the Coliciod's star witness.
