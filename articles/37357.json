This led to the Union's end as an independent state, and with its situation desperate, Desevro offered its unconditional surrender to the Republic. It was refused: the Republic opted to sterilize Desevro as an object lesson to the rest of the Tionese."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The worlds of the Union joined the Republic by 23,900 BBY as a member sector with Tion as the capital; Desevro, however, bitterly refused to follow the crowd and remained proudly independent.
