Once a petty thug for Durga Besadii Tai, Shalo later worked for Hirth, though that relationship soured and he became reconnected with the Hutts, who sent him to Tatooine. Shalo was able to take over a large portion of his employers assets when the Yuuzhan Vong invaded Nal Hutta. While setting up the Great River, Han and Jacen Solo came to investigate where he was sending his slaves to the Yuuzhan Vong. Shalo tried to take Jacen for the reward that Warmaster Tsavong Lah had offered, but Talon Karrde and Shada D'ukal brought help from the Smugglers' Alliance, to fight off Shalo's back up. Shalo latter admitted that a convoy carrying slaves, spice and weapons was en route to Ylesia, and that it would be stopping at Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shalo was mistakenly identified as a Rodian in The New Jedi Order Sourcebook."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
