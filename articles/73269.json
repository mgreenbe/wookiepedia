Directly off from the main landing platform was a reflecting-pool with a waterfall, next to which was a small cantina. Farther in, a massive waterfall overlooked the surrounding skyline, and within the base's heart was a large tank containing a trio of drugons, as well as an observation deck. There was also, not far from the main gates, a large, enclosed, market complex."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Home to both Kaerobani's pirate operations and his personal artifact collection, the base boasted a complement of at least four starfighters and a DX-9 transport.
