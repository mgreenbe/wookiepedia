When Captain Kaiya Adrimetrum refuses their demands, they begin to plan a mutiny. Crippled by a lightstorm within the Kathol Rift, the mutineers take control of the ship, seizing several key locations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The remaining loyal FarStar crew members formulate their own plans to retake the ship, and manage to recover the situation.
