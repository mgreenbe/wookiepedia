The Renunciates waged war upon the main faction, causing the Pius Dea Faithful to devote more resources away from their other enemies in the galaxy. The Renunciation and subsequent civil war began the Seventh Alsakan Conflict, in which Alsakan joined forces with the Jedi Order, the Republic Navy, the Caamasi, and several other groups against the Pius Dea-controlled Republic. After a sabotage operation by the Bureau of Ships and Services, many Pius Dea Cathedral ships were lost in space, unable to restart their hyperdrives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The remaining space forces were decimated by the Renunciates battleships.
