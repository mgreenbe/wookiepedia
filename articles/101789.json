The field could controlled and set to block substances or creatures passing through the area it covered. A model released around 20 BBY could also drain energy from air molecules passing through the field and so lower their temprature. The Republic surgeons Jos Vondar and Zan Yant slept in a cubicle during their time on the planet Drongar, where they were stationed to treat clone troopers wounded in battle, which had an entrance sealed with an osmotic field. The field was set to allow air through but not a species of insect native to the planet known as wingstingers which were considered a pest. Vondar requisitioned a field of the newer temperature controlling field and hoped to receive it before the end of the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Osmotic fields first appeared in MedStar I: Battle Surgeons, the first novel in the MedStar Duology, written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry and published in 2004."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
