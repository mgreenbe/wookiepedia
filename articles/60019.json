The cantina was designed to appear rustic, and evoke an archaic sense of the working-class past. The alleyway entrance to the Haunch of Nerf was constructed in a mock-ancient style, reminiscent of a baronial fort. The interior of the restaurant was hot, intentionally rough-hewn, and full of inaccurately designed replicas of antique rural feasting trestles. Food at the Haunch of Nerf was served on pleekwood trenchers instead of more contemporary porceplast plates, and the cantina's ale was brewed specially to retain a cloudy appearance full of unidentifiable lumps, thought to be authentic to the ancient aesthetic the Haunch of Nerf aspired to. The Haunch of Nerf typically attracted upper class clientele, and offered private tables away from the main salon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 19 BBY, the Coruscant University professor of biology, Reye Nenilin, met with the Mandalorian soldier Kal Skirata at the Haunch of Nerf. The two shared a private table with Skirata's colleagues, Mandalorian doctor Mij Gilamar and the undercover Null-class ARC trooper Mereel, while discussing genetics research. Skirata attempted to covertly enlist Nenilin's aid in halting the accelerating aging that afflicted the Republic army's clone troopers, eventually convincing the professor to look over the data he had gathered. Skirata thought little of the Haunch of Nerf's false sense of archaism and the patrons' inaccurate, romanticized ideals of how the working-class common man lived in the past. While he was leaving the cantina, he scoffed at the Haunch of Nerf's mock-ancient exterior, musing that it was likely little more than a year old despite its historical design."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Haunch of Nerf first appeared in Star Wars canon in the fourth entry in the Republic Commando series of novels, Order 66, written by author Karen Traviss and published September 16, 2008."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
