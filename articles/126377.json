Hype Fazon responds that all of them need to work together, and reminds everyone about the importance of escorting in the fuel shipment. They are then contacted by the freighter, which, due to damage from a pirate attack, can't slow down. Hype asks them to change their course, since the starship is headed straight for the Colossus, but the ship's navigation systems are down as well. In response, Hype orders the other four Aces to latch on to the ship, and they try and slow it down. On one of the loading docks, a worker is relaxing until he notices the approaching ship, causing him to panic. Fortunately, the Aces manage to slow the ship down enough that it stops just in time, reaching a halt just at the edge of the platform. The worker faints, and Hype expresses relief that this happened just in the nick of time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
