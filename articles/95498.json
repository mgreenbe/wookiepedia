After graduation, he was assigned to the Devastator. While aboard the Death Star, he witnessed the destruction of his homeworld, which wiped out his entire family and profoundly affected Windrider. However, he ultimately chose to remain in the Empire, justifying Alderaan's destruction by claiming it was necessary in order for the Empire to bring order to the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a member of the Imperial Navy, Windrider fought against the Alliance to Restore the Republic on several occasions including the Battle of Hoth. He later fought against his former friend Kyrell in a dogfight; he was shocked to find Kyrell alive, having believed Ree's fabrication that Kyrell had committed suicide.

During his first day at the Royal Academy, Nash met his two room mates: the Jelucani youth Thane Kyrell and the Coruscanti Ved Foslo. While Nash quickly befriended Thane, he found Foslo arrogant and aloof. After introducing himself to Thane, Nash remarked that they should introduced inhalers and tranquilizers for the benefit of newcomers visiting Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the next three years, Nash and his fellow cadets endured the Royal Academy's punishing education regimen, which involved hours of studying science, mathematics, piloting, and physical training. Cadets were frequently subjected to a battery of tests that pushed them to their limits. While Windrider's friend Thane found the Academy a liberating experience from his domineering parents, Nash found the Royal Academy's curriculum a grueling experience; coming from Alderaan which had a more enlightened and holistic approach towards education. Despite these challenges, Nash persevered in his training due to his belief that the Galactic Empire was a positive force that wanted to bring the best of every world and culture to the galaxy. When Thane expressed his cynicism, Nash invited him to visit his homeworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In spite of their different outlooks and Nash's untidiness, he and Thane became good friends at the Royal Academy. On one occasion, Nash and his fellow cadets took part in a training exercise that involved them riding on speeder bikes through a series Reitgen Hoops. Prior to the exercise, he asked the Flight Commander whether there would be a prize. The commander calmly replied that he should first learn the task before he could \"presume to perform it.\" Ultimately, Thane and his fellow Jelucani friend Ciena Ree jointly won the race after their bikes became entangled.

After finishing his work, Nash tried to convince Thane to explore the Coruscant nightlife. However, Thane was too preoccupied with his assignment and insisted on putting in the extra effort to maintain his class rankings. Unable to convince Thane, Windrider then teased him about his \"feelings\" for Ved Foslo before turning his attention to Thane's relationship with Ciena. Windrider's interest in Thane's close friendship with Ciena annoyed the latter who refused to discuss the topic. Despite their quarrel, Nash remained supportive of Thane during the \"laser cannon\" incident. When Nash suggested that Ciena had a role in sabotaging Thane's laser cannon, Thane insisted that Ciena was innocent."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial service"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Destruction of Alderaan"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nash Windrider graduated from the Royal Imperial Academy shortly before the battle of Yavin.

Ciena was concerned that Nash's loyalty would be questioned due to his Alderaanian roots. Later, Nash and his former classmates Ciena and Thane attended a ceremony aboard the Death Star where they witnessed the battle station unleashing a superlaser which destroyed his homeworld of Alderaan. The Imperial commander justified the planet's destruction on the grounds that the Alderaanian government had been secretly aiding the Rebel Alliance.

After finishing his duty shift, Nash and Ciena talked about their friend Thane, who had been stationed on the Death Star but had been part of a scouting mission sent to Dantooine, where the Rebellion had once maintained a base.

The following day, Nash informed Ciena that their friend Thane had deserted his post at Kerev Doi. When Ciena suggested that Thane could have crashed his ship, Nash was sympathetic but assured her that his superiors were telling the truth.

There, she discovered that he had indeed deserted the Empire due to his disillusionment with the Empire's destruction of Alderaan and the maltreatment of Bodach'i slaves on Kerev Doi. Ciena was unable to reason with Thane, who refused to return to Imperial service. While she loved Thane, Ciena was unable to break her oath to the Empire due to her upbringing.

Shortly after his new posting, Nash served aboard the Executor's quadrant section during the battle of Hoth. Prior to the Imperial assault, he confidently informed Ciena that an Imperial probe droid had found the rebel base on the frozen planet of Hoth and that the Executor was traveling with five smaller Star Destroyers to attack the rebels.

Despite their best efforts, the astromech droid R2-D2 was able to repair the hyperdrive, and the Falcon was able to escape.

However, the Sith Lord instead left the command bridge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That evening, Windrider met with Ciena and Berisse in the Executor's quadrant. He listened as Ciena and Berisse talked about why some people joined the Rebellion. Sensing that Ciena was upset, Nash asked her why, and she told them that she had been thinking about Thane lately. Unknown to Nash and Berisse, Ciena had discovered that Thane had joined the Rebellion after analyzing footage from Hoth.

Unknown to Windrider, Ciena and Thane had a romantic relationship and had made love during their last meeting on Jelucan after the battle of Yavin. Nash then discussed his suspicion that Thane had an abusive relationship with his father, Oris Kyrell, recalling that he had seen the scars on Thane's back while they were roommates. Windrider speculated that years of abuse had driven Thane to suicide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Berisse left, Nash confided his romantic feelings for Ciena. When Ciena politely declined, Windrider apologized for bringing up the topic at the wrong time since they had been talking about Thane's purported death an hour ago.

Admiral Piett informed Nash and the other pilots that they had picked up some strange readings on the edge of the Hudalla system. While he suspected it was little more than metal ores and mynocks, he told them to be vigilant for enemy spies.

Giving into his rage, Nash violated Imperial Navy protocol by initiating battle without waiting for Commander Ree's orders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the dogfight, Nash pursued Thane's X-wing with his TIE/IN interceptor, intent on killing his former friend whom he now deemed a traitor. When Nash denounced Thane as a rebel scum who had stooped so low, Thane retorted that the Empire had murdered Nash's family and destroyed his homeworld. In response, Nash angrily told Thane not to mention Alderaan again. Taking advantage of Admiral Piett's secret order, Ciena used her TIE fighter to shield Thane from the furious Nash.

Nash apologized for shouting at her over the intercom and confided that he had been heartbroken over Thane's \"betrayal.\" He mistook Ciena's efforts to save Thane for an attempt to finish off the traitorous pilot by herself. He apologized for not letting her have the honor of killing Thane. Nash then concluded that they had never really known Thane.

Following a struggle, Thane managed to rescue her and evacuated her in an escape pod before the Inflictor crashed into Jakku.
