She had replaced the original focusing crystal with a lambent crystal of her own shaping after it was badly burnt in the battle against the Sith. Cade carried the weapon with him during his mission on Coruscant to rescue Jedi healer Hosk Trey'lis where it was temporarily seized and encased in transparisteel. Cade was able to recover the weapon before his escape and carried it with him in his battles with the Sith up until the death of Darth Krayt. As of 138 ABY it was still believed to be in his possession."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hilt resembles the lightsaber used by Kol's ancestors Anakin, Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker, and shares the feature of a beveled blade emitter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
