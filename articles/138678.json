Around 9 ABY, TK-147 and another stormtrooper were traversing the corridors of the base, discussing a disturbance with scan control which TK-147 concluded to be a blown transformer. The other stormtrooper decided that they would check it out, and TK-147 contacted Section-Four, suggesting a technical crew should check the issue out. Unbeknownst to the pair, a group of infiltrators including Magistrate Greef Karga, Marshal Cara Dune, Mandalorian Din Djarin, and a Mythrol, passed behind the troopers on their way to sabotage the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TK-147 appeared in \"Chapter 12: The Siege\" of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Carl Weathers and released on November 20, 2020.
