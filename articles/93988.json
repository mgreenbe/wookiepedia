However, it was known that Murkhana City, the capital, was built on the coastline with only a delimited stretch of black beachhead as the threshold into the steep hills the city was built on. The architecture was that of graceful, spiraling rising structures appearing reminiscent of ocean coral over sentient constructions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was the Corporate Alliance headquarters during the Clone Wars and the homeworld of Oro Dassyne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the pre-Republic era, Murkhana was a member of Xim's Empire after the campaign to conquer the Thanium Worlds between 25,126 and 25,116 BBY."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Joining the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was brought into the Old Republic only just prior to the Trade Federation's blockade of Naboo. A little over two months after then-Senator Palpatine took up his post on Coruscant, Murkhana was given a seat in the Republic Senate. The move was viewed by some as a way for the Trade Federation to secure greater support in the Senate. Indeed, some senators, chief amongst them the then-delegate from Sullust, openly viewed Murkhana as a mere \"client world\" of the Trade Federation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Murkhana served as the headquarters of the Corporate Alliance during the Clone Wars. The tallest building in Murkhana was the Argente Tower, a complex of administrative offices. Murkhana was also the source for the many Confederate \"Shadowfeed Dispatches\" which were used to distribute Separatist news and propaganda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Murkhana, which occurred in the final days of the Clone Wars, the 32nd Air Combat Wing, led by Jedi Masters Roan Shryne and Bol Chatak, along with Chatak's Padawan Olee Starstone, were sent to destroy a deflector shield generator protecting a key landing platform. When Order 66 was issued, it did not reach Murkhana until after the Clone Wars were over, the Jedi Order outlawed, and the New Order created. When the order did arrive, the three Jedi escaped execution thanks to Ion Team, a unit of clone commandos led by Captain Climber, whom Shryne had befriended during the course of the war. After word reached the ears of Emperor Palpatine that the troopers had disobeyed Order 66, Darth Vader was dispatched to ensure that the clone troopers serving on the planet remained loyal to the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Second Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the years leading to the Second Galactic Civil War, Murkhana was involved in a significant commercial dispute with the Roche asteroid field. The Verpine accused Murkhana of counterfeiting Verpine technology. Nav Ekhat was its senator in the Galactic Alliance Senate at this time. The planet Kem Stor Ai also considered going to war against Murkhana and the Verpine thought that Murkhana could use this conflict to attack Roche."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
