They were stationed at Echo Station 5-7. Other soldiers included Roj, Jielu, Grond, and Sora. They noticed that the ion cannon was under attack by stormtroopers and an All Terrain Scout Transport. They then stormed the cannon and were able to save Rebel shuttles by disabling an Imperial Star Destroyer. While most were killed in the battle, at least two soldiers managed to escape to deliver a message to Mon Mothma."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
