The squad's first mission was to free several Republic prisoners of war from an Imperial outpost; however, intelligence on the mission was bad, forcing the squad to fight through more enemy forces than it expected. Despite its disadvantage, the squad was able to rescue all of the prisoners and escape with heavy injuries but no fatalities. In the years following that mission, Naja was among the squad members who were recruited into the Republic Special Forces Division's black ops program, and the squad\u2014which included fellow veterans Karsim and Eckerd\u2014was tasked by General Elin Garza with the assassination of Imperial leaders. The squad, which became known as the \"Surgeons,\" soon began to go after its targets' families. When this came to light, Naja and the others were arrested for war crimes and imprisoned in a detention center on the planet Berrun with life sentences."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A loyal soldier, Naja's time in the Special Forces black ops program turned the trooper into a killer who no longer respected the moral code of warfare.
