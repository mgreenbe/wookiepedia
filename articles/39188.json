Burning crystals covered the walls, creating a dazzling display of constantly shifting colored lights. It was believed that the overall colors and patterns changed based on the spirits of those within the cave. The leaders of the Soulworks Collective Advisory Council declared the Dome a protected space: limiting access with trained guides and armed guards to protect the entire chamber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
