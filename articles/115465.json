However, every ten years their orbits would bring the worlds within a million kilometers of each other, close enough for each planet's ground-based nuclear missiles to hit each other if launched.

During this period, the Red Knights of Life launched a violent crusade against mechanical technology and presumably Osarian collaborators as well. Their actions ranged from attacking civilians simply for using a landspeeder to rounding up all the droids they could find and dumping them at the Square of Hopeful Redemption in Redhaven. There, they would throw droids into a large pit and bombard them with rocks until they were nothing but a pile of metal, one of whom was C-9PO."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Osarian-Rhommamool conflict, Nom Anor ordered a missile strike against the Osarian capital of Osa-Prime when the orbits of both planets were at their closest, destroying the city and causing the political conflict to become a war.
