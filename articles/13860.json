During the battle on the planet Daalang, the All Terrain Recon Transports of Lightning Squadron penetrated the energy shield that protected the Separatists' antiorbital mass-driver cannon, using their walkers' speed to rush past the droid defenses and destroy the shield generator. Their actions allowed the Republic's Star Destroyer Eliminator to unleash an orbital bombardment, and Lightning Squadron were able to escape the area before the bombardment thanks to their AT-RTs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
