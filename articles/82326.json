According to legend, Xim commissioned Lyechusas, his court poet and the most renowned of Lisst'n dramatists, to script three trilogies on his life; however, by the time of the New Republic some doubt had risen over the authenticity of this legend after Professor Ransen, a scholar of Ximology, proposed that the original literature surrounding Xim could instead have originated in Hutt propaganda. Other historians, such as S. V. Skynx, disputed Ransen's hypothesis. While Lyechusas' original manuscripts perished over time, fragments of her works survived for over 25,000 years in Oor translations. The Royal Theatre of Argai, where Lyechusas had hailed from, claimed to hold an authentic molt of her skin. The Argai Players annually performed her trilogies to a sold-out audience. One such script of Lyechusas was entitled The Pirate Prince."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the latter years of the Galactic Empire, the Tion Hegemony's sole university, the University of Rudrig, had a number of luxury dermal autostripper services available for Lisst'n, as well as for members of the Pui-ui species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lisst'n were created by Brian Daley for his novel Han Solo and the Lost Legacy, published by Del Rey in 1980.
