At some point during his Imperial service, Tanbris came to work with Thul Fain, who later left the Empire and became a smuggler for the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure.

He was made a crew officer of the Emperor's right-hand man Darth Vader, answering directly to his orders. When the Rebel Alliance launched an attack on the station, Tanbris rushed to Darth Vader in the corridor of the Death Star's command center, informing him that the enemy ships were too small to be shot down by the meridian trench's turbolaser towers. After being so ordered by Vader, the lieutenant had Black Squadron, a unit of elite fliers, get to their fighters so they could shoot the Rebels one by one. A few moments later, the Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker fired proton torpedoes in the the trench's exhaust vent, triggering a chain reaction that propagated to the Death Star's core. The battlestation exploded, and Tanbris was among those killed from the explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout his military career, Tanbris had emerged as a capable pilot and skilled officer.
