Skywalker, piloting his Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor with a hyperspace transport ring, was accompanied by astromech droid R3-S6, as his usual droid, R2-D2, had been lost at the Battle of Bothawui. Unbeknownst to Skywalker, however, R3-S6 was secretly a Separatist spy, and subsequently played stupid while sabotaging the Jedi Knight, drawing the attention of General Grievous and his warships. In the ensuing skirmish, Skywalker's hyperspace ring was destroyed, stranding him in space. However, R3's sabotage also drew the attention of Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano aboard the Resolute, who arrived with Clone Captain Rex and a squad of clone troopers in the Twilight to rescue Skywalker from Grievous and the enemy fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
