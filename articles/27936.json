It was also one of the key factors that facilitated the end of the Galactic Republic and the dawn of the Galactic Empire in its place. Through the science of cloning, a vast clone army was created on Kamino for the purpose of serving the Republic. Programmed with absolute loyalty to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate and secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the clones proved to be instrumental in his rise to the position of Emperor. The military applications of cloning were further exploited by the New Order through the creation of countless more clone soldiers, all used mainly for the sole purpose of spreading and enforcing Imperial hegemony throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to create a clone, samples of genetic code had to be drawn from a subject's cells, duplicated and implanted into donor cells. These donor cells would then grow, divide and, eventually gestate in artificial wombs, filled with nutrients and organic catalysts. Altering the nutrients and catalyst solutions that the cells received could influence the physical attributes and maturation rates of the resulting clone. The most aggressive mixtures of nutrients and catalyst solutions produced fully formed adult clones in several weeks, but forced growth acceleration often led to mental instability in the clone. Some cloners, however, discovered methods to avoid this phenomenon. The genetic material donor was generally referred to as a prime clone. Using the subject's template, it was possible through many different techniques to create exact physical replicas. This process was not only capable of producing a single copy, but also multiple versions of the original subject. Furthermore, genetic engineering could further modify the clone to augment or subdue specific traits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although mass cloning was considered useful because of its military applications, individual clones generally lacked the personality of the original. As such, they often needed to be educated during the process of their development. The original clone troopers that were produced over the course of a decade on Kamino were educated at a more gradual pace in comparison to their Spaarti-engineered counterparts. Clones who fully matured in just a year's time received an extremely rushed form of education through flash training. The fastest developed clones\u2014grown in the span of a few weeks\u2014were trained through memory imprints, taken from the original donor and downloaded into the copied subjects. This essentially enabled a clone to learn all of its template's skills, but also carried with them emotional imprints, and thus the risk of mental instability as well. Such mental instability had plagued almost all early cloning experiments, with the severity of the symptomps scaling inversely to the length of the growth period. According to Captain Gilad Pellaeon of the Galactic Empire, a pre-Clone Wars era scientific paper discussing cloning concluded that clones grown to maturity in less than a year would have been entirely unable to survive outside of a fully controlled environment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the fact that growth environment was a highly influential factor, a clone could develop characteristics and identities distinct from its donor's, even if it was a genetically identical copy. A long standing debate over cloning and flash memory was whether a clone retained the thoughts and memories of its progenitor. Some believed that clones were identical to the original in every way, while others argued that clones were unique through their individual experiences."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some cultures fully embraced the possibilities of cloning, most notably the people of Khomm who abandoned natural reproduction in favor of becoming a clone society. Khommite clones from the Dorsk lineage were active in the New Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The art of cloning technology was developed by a number of civilizations in the galaxy. Some noted species that possessed the technology included the inhabitants of the worlds of Khomm, Lur, Ithor, Columus, as well as Arkania. One of the more infamous species to possess a great deal of knowledge of cloning were the inhabitants of Kamino who were renowned for their skill in the field. The Kaminoans later taught their skill in cloning to the inhabitants of Polis Massa who used it to help develop an advanced medical and genetic research station on their homeworld. The insectoid Verpines of the Roche asteroid field also made use of cloning to propagate their worker castes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the largest cloning operations was the creation of the Grand Army of the Republic, an immense army of clone soldiers\u2014all based on the genetic template of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett\u2014created by Kaminoan scientists as part of an initially clandestine program to seemingly reestablish a pan-galactic military force for the Galactic Republic. It was in truth part of a complex and masterfully executed deception conceived by the Sith that would ultimately furnish them with the means to destroy the Republic and control the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a vast facility maintained within Tipoca City, clones were grown and trained in the cloning chambers at the city's military complex. The first attempt to replicate Jango Fett resulted in twelve prototype clones, known as the Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos, and were the subject of the Kaminoans' attempts to enhance Fett's genome. While the clones would possess photographic memory and perfect recall, and substantially bulkier frames as adults, half of the twelve did not survive the gestation period and the six who did were deemed uncontrollable by their creators. But at the behest of Cuy'val Dar sergeant Kal Skirata, the clones were ultimately spared from being reconditioned\u2014a fate which, in this case, would mean death. Disappointed by their first attempt to modify Fett's genetic code, the Kaminoans proceeded with the creation of the Alpha generation, a new batch of ARC troopers personally trained by Fett. In addition, the Kaminoans also took DNA samples from Jedi Knight Falon Grey which they used to create twin Force-sensitive clones called X1 and X2."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The standard troopers were genetically altered to be more docile and susceptible to obeying orders than their genetic template, supplemented by rigorous behavior modifications to instill absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. A surgically implanted Inhibitor chip was a further safeguard against betrayal from rogue Jedi. The chip, however, proved to be an integral part of the Sith masterplan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to grow fully matured clones in half of the time it takes ordinary Humans, the Kaminoans modified the clones by implementing \"age acceleration\" into their development, thus allowing the clones to reach adulthood in ten years instead of two decades. Although the exact rate at which clones aged is unknown, it appears to be nearly twice as fast a natural-born Human and it is theorized that this rate increased as clones grew older\u2014especially under stress, thus leading to a dramatic shortening of the clones' life expectancy. Despite these modifications, the clone troopers could still think and act creatively and possessed a level of individuality that their Kaminoan creators did not anticipate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the second year of the Clone Wars, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine had established a secondary cloning facility in secret on Coruscant's moon, Centax-2. Under the supervision of Arkanian Clone Masters, the facility was operated by the company Arkanian Microtechnologies and used Spaarti cloning cylinders to produce fully matured clones within a year. Hence, the clones from Kamino were supplemented by billions of clones that were roughly a year old and instructed through flash training. But with only a year to grow the clones and prepare them for war, the fighting ability of Spaarti-grown clones was noticeably lower than their counterparts from Kamino. Thus, the overall result of Spaarti technology led to clones with underdeveloped combat and marksmanship skills, including a heavily diminished sense of individuality and self-preservation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aside from Jango Fett's considerable price to become the clone template, Fett also requested an unaltered clone for himself. Jango regarded the clone as his son and legacy, thus naming him Boba Fett. As per Jango's terms, Boba's genetic structure was not tampered with age acceleration or increased docility programming, essentially making him an exact physical duplicate of his father. Despite receiving none of the modifications that his clone \"brothers\" possessed, Boba would still experience the degradation of his DNA later in life due to the fact that he was a clone. At some point during the Clone Wars, Zeltron bounty hunter Vianna D'Pow followed Jango's example and commissioned the Kaminoans to create a single clone of herself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Clone Army was evidently a significant advantage to the Republic, which had lacked a proper military force for over a millennium, it was also recognized that clone soldiers could be one of the greatest threats to the Republic if they were not created strictly under Republic supervision. Hence, the Galactic Senate issued Decree E49D139.41 near the end of the Clone Wars, thus confining all military-purpose cloning to specifically licensed Republic facilities and banning all non-military cloning of sentients with the exception of the medical cloning on Khomm, Lur, Columus, and Arkania, although even they required a license and a case-by-case evaluation. The ban also prohibited the sale of cloning equipment, the hiring of cloning or genetic engineers with the intention of cloning, and the purchase of any cloned sentients."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Separatists also attempted to create their own army of clone soldiers to counter the Grand Army of the Republic, to which they selected the Nikto Morgukai known as Bok as a clone template. Thus, the Morgukai Shadow Army was created on the Outer Rim world of Saleucami, presumably grown from Spaarti cylinders, trained by Anzati assassins, and programmed with unconditional loyalty to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. They would never make it off-planet, however, as the facility was destroyed following the Siege of Saleucami."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Only towards the end of the Clone War did the Jedi Order learn that the Sith had been involved in the cloning program from its inception, although they knew not to what purpose. They chose to keep this knowledge a secret from the Senate, as they thought it would destabilize the Republic and undermine the war effort. Instead, they resolved to take the only path they could see available, which was to play the game they now knew to have been orchestrated by the Sith, and bring an end to the war as quickly as possible. When Palpatine ordered the execution of Order 66, the Inhibitor chip implanted in every clone ensured it would be carried out, and the Jedi were exterminated. This gave Palpatine a free hand to reorder the Republic into the Galactic Empire. Thus the clone army meant to protect the Republic became the harbinger of its fall."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Reign of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the rise of the Galactic Empire, there were strict laws placed on cloning technology to prevent anti-Imperial factions from breeding their own army of clones, which then led to the Empire's attempts at seizing the technology from other civilizations. This included an attempt to confiscate agricultural and cloning technology from the Ithorians through military force. Later, Momaw Nadon used his knowledge of cloning to create a clone of Captain Alima after the Imperial Prefect was killed. Nadon decided to obey the Ithorian Law of Life, and thus he created a clone replica of the Imperial officer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the reformations that transformed the Republic into the Empire, the former Grand Army of the Republic was reorganized into the Stormtrooper Corps. The remaining clone troopers that survived the Clone Wars were rechristened as Imperial stormtroopers. Despite the ban on cloning, the Empire continued to utilize clone soldiers in secret. With the exception of Imperial officers and GeNode clones, the Stormtrooper Corps was almost fully composed of clones based on the genetic template of Jango Fett."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Clone Rebellion of Kamino in 12 BBY brought an end to the Fett clones' proud dominion over the Stormtrooper Corps. Though they succeeded in suppressing the revolt by storming Tipoca City and annihilating an army of Fett clones designed to fight against the Empire, Emperor Palpatine lost confidence in an army cloned entirely from one man. As a result, future generations of stormtroopers were cloned from a variety of templates. Not long afterward, the ranks were opened up to non-clone Humans who served as enlisted troopers alongside the clones. The Empire's dependency on cloning also led to the creation of experimental soldiers based on the Force-sensitive template of Sa Cuis, an Emperor's Hand. Even though the 501st Legion was allowed to remain pure, the Fett clones resented their sudden status as a minority within the army that they once filled as a whole."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even before the formation of the Empire, the Kaminoan format for cloning had been virtually supplanted by Spaarti technology. In the final year of the Clone Wars, Palpatine revealed the existence of another clone army that was different from the original in two ways\u2014the new clones were engineered on Coruscant's moon Centax-2 instead of Kamino, and they grew to adulthood in one year instead of ten years. Decades later when Palpatine recorded his legacy into the Telos Holocron, he admitted his preference for the Spaarti cloning process. Though he did admire the achievements made by the Kaminoan cloners, the accelerated growth rate of Kaminoan-engineered clones was too slow in Palpatine's opinion. Even though the Spaarti clones were far less intelligent and combat effective than the clones bred on Kamino, Palpatine was unconcerned with the apparent disadvantages. The Kaminoan clone army had to meet the best standards in order to fulfill their ultimate mission in exterminating the Jedi Order; the Spaarti clones were meant to bolster the Grand Army's depleted ranks so that the Emperor would have a sufficient number of soldiers to enforce his reign the first years of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the early phase of the Galactic Civil War, Imperial scientists tried to improve on the Spaarti method by conducting an experiment to create clones that grew into adulthood in under one year. Through the \"accelerated cloning process,\" clones could be engineered to reach maturity in a mere few weeks while their minds were developed through memory flashes based on imprints of a genetic donor's brain patterns. But the procedure was consistently undermined by several flaws that resulted in highly unstable subjects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aside from the physical deformities, the accelerated clones were compromised by abnormalities in their brain development. According to the projections of Imperial scientists, all of the accelerated clones were doomed to suffer from mental instability not long after their creation. Some of the clones would remain stable enough to serve as infantry for a year before succumbing to insanity while others would never make it past their basic training. In order to correct the flaws within the accelerated cloning process, many batches of unstable clones had to be created before the system could be perfected."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Cloning the Secret Apprentice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the death of Galen Marek, Darth Vader endeavored to recreate his former secret apprentice through cloning technology. Thus, Marek's body was brought to Timira City on Kamino to be the genetic template for a single clone that would take the original's place as Vader's Sith assassin. To avoid taking the time required to train a new apprentice all over again, Vader chose to utilize the newly developed \"accelerated cloning process.\" Through the highly experimental procedure, the clone would be engineered to reach young adulthood in less than a month rather than a year or a decade. The imprints from Marek's brain patterns would also be used to impart the apprentice's knowledge and skills to the clone, effectively insuring that the \"new Starkiller\" would be just as powerful as the original prior to his death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But the experiment resulted in a \"crash and burn\" procedure due to the imperfections in the accelerated cloning process. The first wave of Marek's accelerated clones were aberrant replicas, both physically deformed and mentally deranged. The process eventually became more stable, but each version of the original Starkiller was constantly haunted by memories of a life that they never lived, thus failing to meet Vader's expectations. After many errors, one clone was able to endure Vader's training program long enough for the Sith Lord to hope that this version would be the final result of the entire project. But like his clone \"brothers\", this version was also confused by visions of a past that was not his, which Vader dismissed as a dead man's memories and a side effect of the cloning procedure. But the clone was ultimately unable to free himself from Galen Marek's memories, especially his affection for Juno Eclipse, the woman who was largely responsible for Marek's rejection of the dark side before his death. Before Vader could destroy his latest failure, the clone managed to escape from Kamino in order to find Eclipse. He was subsequently known by his template's codename Starkiller."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, however, Vader perfected the cloning process by creating a clone that surpassed all of the other imperfect replicas that came before him. Although he was also disturbed by the same memories of Galen Marek's life and his feelings for Juno Eclipse, this clone was determined to succeed where the others had failed. As his training progressed, the clone was began to compartmentalize Marek's memories and was able to hold them as separate from his own experiences. By freeing himself from his template's memories and having come to despise his progenitor as a \"broken man\" brought down by his own weaknesses, the clone was granted access to the dead body that was used to create him. The sight of the original Starkiller helped the clone realize that the cloning process had ended with him. He was the only perfect clone of Starkiller who was meant to stand at Darth Vader's side as his Dark Apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Ni-Ke-Vanz, a former slave who possessed intimate knowledge of cloning procedures, cloning was not the key to \"immortality.\" Even though clones are naturally based to a very large degree on a genetic template, each clone is a new person that possesses his own identity and memories, and is ultimately a separate individual from the original. Clones that belong to the same genetic structure also possess differences from each other. They are not the same people, just different versions of the same template."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Vader confirmed Ni-Ke-Vanz's assertions on cloning when he revealed some of the reasons behind the failures of various clones of Galen Marek. While Marek's clones possessed the problematic memories and emotions of the original Secret Apprentice, some characteristic traits were inherently more dominant than others in each clone. Some were haunted by the memory of Marek's father, Kento Marek, while others were affected by the young boy that Marek had once been before his tutelage under Vader. Overall, it became evidently apparent that engineering a clone who possessed all of the attributes and Force potential of Starkiller was not the real problem. The greatest challenge was to create a clone who could avoid an identity crisis by holding his memory imprints as separate from his own experience."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Starkiller's case, he became completely fixated on Juno Eclipse, but spared little to no feelings over other things such as his progenitor's father or even the Rebel Alliance. He dismissed everything else as irrelevant in comparison to his fixation on Eclipse, nor could he comprehend the idea that any clone of Vader's original apprentice could be distracted by something else other than Marek's love for the woman who was the most responsible for his redemption.

Similar to Spaarti cylinders in that they produced mature clones in a very short period of time, the cloning tanks were tended to completely by droids. The facility appeared to indiscriminately clone any being who entered it, collecting genetic material and even scanning the minds of those beings so that the clones could be implanted with memories. As a result, the clones were completely under the illusion that they were the individuals that they had been cloned from. The exact purpose behind this facility was not discovered. Darth Vader himself came to believe the technology found was what remained of research done by the ancient Jedi into cloning, however, it is unknown if there is any truth to this."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Immortality through Cloning"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point in his life, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious sought to discover a way to extend his lifetime in the hopes of avoiding death. Though his ambition ran contrary to the teachings of Darth Bane, who emphasized the importance of the Sith Order over the individual, Sidious had little intention of being succeeded by a Sith apprentice long after he had established his rule as emperor of the Galactic Empire. While he originally considered Darth Vader and Galen Marek as his potential successors, Vader's injuries on Mustafar and Starkiller's untimely death strengthened Sidious' resolve to preserve his reign by avoiding his own death. Thus, he looked to the science of cloning as a possible solution to his dilemma as early as the late phase of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 19 BBY, Sidious used the assets of his alter ego, Chancellor Palpatine of the Galactic Republic to track down a rogue Kaminoan scientist named Ko Sai. He had hoped that her achievements as a cloner would yield some sort of discovery on how to extend his own life.

Nevertheless, he finally discovered a way to cheat death, but at a great price. Through his new-found Force power, Essence Transfer, Sidious literally had the power to project his spiritual consciousness into another body. While still alive in his original body, Sidious secretly commissioned a large batch of clones that were based on his own genetic template. The clones were kept in stasis and maintained on the planet Byss in the Deep Core of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Dark Lord of the Sith was forced to pay a heavy price for immortality. In the Telos Holocron, he lamented on the shortcomings of cloning. Due to the fact that clones were one step removed from the natural life process itself, they were easily susceptible to the damaging side effects of the dark side. A living being of natural birth had a difficult challenge of trying to control the dark side, but was ultimately doomed to experience the lethal consequences of being heavily immersed in the dark side's energies after a long period of time. A clone's body was almost utterly defenseless against the negative aspects of the dark side, thus subjecting the clone to rapid aging and decay. Although Darth Vader succeeded in creating clones, such as Starkiller and the Dark Apprentice that did not share the same imperfections of the Emperor's clones (i.e. rapid accelerated aging, an extreme vulnerability to the dark side's harmful side effects), Darth Sidious was not as successful as his apprentice was in the field of cloning.

But even in his defeat, Sidious refused to accept his own death and finally tested his secret Force ability. With his mortal flesh destroyed, the Dark Lord's spirit endured the maddening experience of being disembodied.
