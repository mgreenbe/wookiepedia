They were in operation at Saponza's homestead on Tatooine some time after the Battle of Yavin. At that time, they were joined by a former associate of Saponza. The group killed several of Jabba's outlaws, and their base was razed in revenge. They then rebuilt it, receiving offers of help from both the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire. After joining the Rebellion, the gang was sent on various missions to combat Imperial forces, Tusken Raiders, and numerous factions of mercenaries and criminals. The gang had bases on Tatooine, Dandoran, Er'Kit, Hoth, Sullust, Takodana, and Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after the Battle of Yavin Saponza's Gang, a group of mercenaries, set themselves up at Saponza's homestead on the planet of Tatooine. At Saponza's request, one of the first things the gang did was upgrade their defenses and construct some turrets in order to retaliate if they ever came under attack. Not long after doing so they were attacked by a group of thugs sent by Jabba the Hutt but easily defeated Jabba's men. Not long after that the group were contacted by Darth Vader of the Galactic Empire demanding their assistance in destroying a Tusken village. The mercenaries obliged and were given 3 All Terrain Standard Transports and the support of TIE fighters in order to complete their goal. After destroying the village the group received a transmission from the rebel leader Leia Organa, requesting their help with stealing medical supplies from a Hutt Cartel base on the planet of Dandoran. With the help of Han Solo and a number of other rebel soldiers the group successfully infiltrated the cartel den and retrieved the medical supplies. When the gang eventually returned to Tatooine they found their headquarters in ruins before receiving a transmission from Bib Fortuna explaining that the attack was due to Saponza and his gang killing Jabba's men. Realizing they were going to need allies in order to combat Jabba and his thugs, Saponza considered allying his gang with both the Rebels and the Empire. Ultimately, the decision came down to Saponza's partner who made the choice to join up with the rebels. The Rebel agent Jennica Pierce was assigned as the commanding officer on behalf of the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Humble Beginnings"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the first missions the gang took part in after joining the Rebellion was clearing out a group of womp rat nests after being ordered by Pierce as they were becoming more aggressive and attacking locals more often. After destroying several nests the mercenaries discovered a small base and laboratory that seemed to be experimenting on the womp rats and the cause of their newfound aggression. The gang quickly destroyed that base only to be informed by Pierce that there was an even larger base that was affiliated with the one the group has just destroyed. Due to size of the second base Pierce supplied Saponza's gang with a Juggernaut Turbo Tank as well as calling in rebel hero Chewbacca to assist in the bases destruction."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Under the Twin Suns"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After destroying both labs that were experimenting on the womp rats Pierce made the suggestion that the gang should build up more walls around their homestead in order to help maintain a strong defense against any attackers. Shortly after, Pierce intercepted a transmission from the group who were breeding and experimenting on the womp rats as they were amassing for a sneak attack. When the group attack Saponza and the rest of the gang managed to fight the bulk of them off with the assistance of the Strix, although some managed to retreat. As a result, Saponza sent out scouts to try and find the rival groups headquarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to prepare for their upcoming assault, the gang upgraded their unit transport in order to ensure a larger attack force could be deployed to the rival gangs bases. Not long after construction Pierce informed the gang that two bases had been discovered so the gang prepared their assault. After destroying the first base the gang gang constructed more credit markets in order to amass more credits whilst waiting for the second base to be located.

Shortly after this the gang were attacked by a group of Tusken Raiders but managed to fight them off. In order to more efficiently manage their forces the group next built a hero command center in order to request help from rebel heroes. To retaliate against the Tusken's, Saponza's gang attacked a tribe of them who had recently taken over a local moisture farm and swiftly defeated them. After further upgrading their credit markets, the gang received word from their scouts who had located the village the sand people were using as a base for their raids so Saponza and his crew launched an ambush and destroyed this base."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Jundland General"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after a group of Tusken Raiders launched a strategic counterattack against Saponza's gang which gained the suspicion of Saponza due to the well coordinated nature of the attack. In preparation for the conflict, the gang opted to upgrade their barracks in order to train a greater deal of better trained troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after, the Tusken camp which launched the attack was located by rebel scouts so the gang, along with some Wookiee warriors supplied by Jennica were deployed and successfully managed to destroy the camp despite its unusually complex structure. As they arrived back at base, the gang were quickly overwhelmed by another group of Tusken's who had waited until the group was vulnerable before attacking. Although the Tusken's were defeated, Saponza was worried by the sudden carefulness and tactics being used by the natives so he headed into Mos Espa to try and gather some intelligence. Whilst he was away, Saponza's partner ordered the construction of more alloy refineries at the suggestion of Jennica Pierce in order to make sure the gang were producing enough resources for any upcoming conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Saponza returned with intel but just as he was relaying it to the rest of the group another squad of Tusken's raided with the aid of their Banthas but were again defeated. As discovered by Saponza, the recent attacks and improved strategy were due to the leadership of a Tusken known as the Jundland General. Fed up with the constant raids, the gang upgraded their turrets before heading out to another Tusken enclave located by rebel scouts. Although this wasn't the main headquarters of the general, the gang destroyed the base anyway as it could pose a threat to themselves as well as the local population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While needed to deal with the Tusken threat, Pierce reminded the gang that the true enemy was still the Galactic Empire and encouraged them to continue building up their HQ in preparation for the war.

Shortly after, Bib Fortuna once again contacted Saponza's gang with the threat that the Hutts would reveal the location of their base to the Empire if they didn't agree to help out the cartel, reluctantly the gang obliged without Pierce's knowledge. The first thing the rebel cell were forced to due was to improve their barracks as Jabba currently didn't see the rebel force on Tatooine as being strong enough to complete the tasks he was to set. The Hutt then sent the gang to destroy several bases that housed rival mercenary groups that he was currently in dispute with, before Jennica eventually realized that the gang was being used and started coming up with a plan to get them free from Jabba's grasp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the growing number of enemies the rebel cell was making on the desert planet, they decided to once again improve their defenses and construct more turrets. Surely enough, the group were soon attacked by the very same mercenary group the Hutt had been asking them to go after, an attack which swayed the gang to fortify themselves and build more walls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In time, Jennica was able to put together a plan to free the rebels from Jabba's control, the first stage of which involved the gang raiding a small Imperial base on Tatooine in order to steal data.

The first stage in securing this friendship was to attack a group of Tuskens and reclaim a sandcrawler they had recently stolen from the Jawas. Upon stealing back the sandcrawler, the leader of the Jawa clan, Kekit, introuduced himself to the rebel cell's leaders and agreed to help them. In return for the Jawas help, the rebels attack a group of local criminals who had been stealing from the natives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after securing their alliance, the gang were upgrading their walls when they received word from Kekit that his Sandcrawler had come under attack by more Tusken Raiders, so the rebels quickly came to the rescue.

After this, the Jawas contacted the rebels saying that they had managed to cross the desert and now needed assistance at a town named Mos Doba. The down was deemed an excellent trading location by the Jawas however it had recently been taken over by a criminal gang so the rebels reclaimed the town, leaving the Jawas free to trade at the outpost and in turn, have a better range of supplies to trade with the rebels."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Wreckage of Secrets"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A freighter bringing supplies to the rebels called the Atom Edge was shot shot down whilst entering the planets atmosphere and broke up into several pieces upon entry.

The rebels then decided it was time for them to begin targeting the Empire directly and used a range of vehicles supplied by the Rebellion to assault several nearby Imperial outposts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, a small Imperial patrol stumbled across Saponza's homestead and launched an attack. The rebels managed to come out on top and Jennica disposed of the destroyed AT-STs elsewhere on the planet in order to throw off the Empire whilst she could come up with a plan to attack the Empire's larger bases.

After surviving the initial assault, Kosh sent in the 86th legion and after a difficult battle the rebels emerged victorious.

In response, the Empire launched a counterattack on Saponza's homestead although they were quickly defeated as they only had foot soldiers since the majority of their vehicles were destroyed in the last attack on the homestead.
