The university students believed that Ludi Billane, an infant Jedi youngling, should be returned to her mother. As a result, the students, upon entering the Temple's public lobby, deployed graffiti-bombs to deface the lobby's interior. The bombs displayed several anti-Jedi messages calling for Billane's release from the Jedi Order, as well as the insignia of the People's Inquest movement, a Jedi watch group that also wanted Billane to be given back to her mother. The protest was eventually ended by the Jedi, and the students were arrested by Galactic Republic Judicials for vandalizing and storming the Jedi Temple. The students' demonstration, including their use of graffiti-bombs, was later reported by the HoloNet News."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The graffiti-bomb was first mentioned in the in-universe HoloNet News Vol. 531 51 article \"Activists Deface Jedi Temple Lobby\", written by Pablo Hidalgo and Paul Ens and released on April 11, 2002."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
