Towards the end of the battle, General Mace Windu led an assault on the capital with a grand goal to capture Tambor. The droid told Count Dooku about the current progress which was less than positive. Tambor told Dooku that the droid had exaggerated. Dooku ordered Tambor to evacuate Ryloth and scorch the planet. Tambor was less than enthusiastic of fleeing, though the droid agreed with Dooku. Tambor insisted on taking every single item on the planet that was of any value with him on. The Tactical droid constantly warned Tambor that they didn't have much time to escape. When Windu, now allied with the Twi'lek freedom fighters, breached the capital, the droid lost patience with his master. He and a pair of B1-Series battle droids approached the Emir's shuttle as Tambor was still inside the capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TA-175 ordered the droids to go ahead of him and start 'his' ship, remarking that Emir Tambor was a fool for taking so long. Just as the droids entered the shuttle, Tambor and a pair of B2 super battle droids also came out, going toward the shuttle, but were too late. The tactical droid looked back at the Emir as the shuttle doors closed, and Tambor was left shocked as he had just missed his departing ship. Leaving Tambor behind, the unit told Count Dooku of Tambor's arrogance and Dooku was less than pleased. The count then ordered the tactical droid to tell the Hyena-class bombers to destroy the capital. As the bombers approached, Mace Windu and Wat Tambor seemingly about to perish, they were destroyed at the last moment by Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano in their starfighters. Emir Tambor was taken captive, and the destruction of Lessu was halted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TA-175 has a strong sense of following orders by his superiors, even up to the point of leaving without his master to follow them.
