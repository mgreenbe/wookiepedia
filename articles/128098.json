It was situated on the Llanic Spice Run, a hyperlane that linked it to Llanic and the Bahalian system. Socorro was one of only two bodies in orbit around a red giant star and possessed no moons. A day on Socorro lasted twenty standard hours, and a year lasted 316 local days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Socorro possessed a breathable atmosphere, standard gravity, an arid climate, and terrain that included black desert swells, flatlands, mountain areas, and volcanic areas. Socorro's dormant volcanic basements contained naturally-hidden reserves of water. The planet's surface, three-fourths of which was covered by the Doaba Badlands, was composed of hardened volcanic ash. Temperatures remained at 110 degrees in the world's polar regions, where thermal winds and sandstorms were common."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "No unifying government was present on Socorro, and control of the planet was contested by various criminal organizations. A unified cultural force, resulting from integration between the planet's nomadic and criminal elements, offered formidable protection from intrusion by offworld authorities. Vakeyya was the capital of Socorro. The planet exported water, nether ice, and high-tech skills while importing metals and high technology. All of these transactions were typically performed in an illegal manner. Rare and peculiar modifications to starships were also a major source of planetary income."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located between Coyn and Tatooine, and near Duunir, Iyred, Omman, Redcap, and the Nodgra system, Socorro was home to the ferocious M'onnoks, as well as several nomadic groups: the Ibhaan'I, Bharhulai, Ndowi, and Asilyr. It was also the homeworld of Lando Calrissian and Qu Rahn. Its deserts were composed of distinctive black sand.

The Bharhulai tribe was a hostile group that dwelt in Socorro's dangerous northern polar region. It was believed by the anthropologist Arner Figgis that the Bharhulai may have descended from a crashed colony ship and regressed to a savage state."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the first beings to scout the planet was Kirr Cyrs. He was also the historian of the first colony established on the planet. Kirr Cyrs was generally credited with saying that all life born on Socorro eventually dies on Socorro."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, Socorro was under a water supply crisis because the critical wells located around a dozen settlements in the desert have gone dry.

Smugglers, bounty hunters, and other criminals were attracted to Socorro and established bases there. Small tribes of Humans and near-Humans who avoided civilization also lived on the world.
