It was staffed by a crew of eight. During the Great Hyperspace Disaster, it was threatened by hyperspace debris which also endangered the rest of the system. The crew of the Galactic Republic Longbeam Aurora IX attempted to save the space station from approaching debris, but the anomalies were moving too fast for their missiles to destroy, leading to the station's destruction. In the aftermath, Captain Finial Bright and his crew attempted to rescue any survivors of the crew from the wreckage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
