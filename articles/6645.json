Eventually, he recorded all his military expertise into a holocron so that future Jedi could learn from his experiences. Always answering Jedi's questions tersely and in an efficient manner, he left the level of detail of his answers to be decided by the holocron's gatekeeper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odan-Urr used Anavus' information about the Great Hyperspace War, when making a record to the Tedryn Holocron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
