Some species, like Killiks and Taurill, naturally featured hive minds. The Ithorian experimental creature Spore, on the other hand, was capable of absorbing other beings into its consciousness, creating a hive mind which it ruled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bilars were a sentient species of mammals whose members bonded into groups known as claqas who shared a group mind. Such pooling of intelligence meant that the more Bilars had been bonded into a single claqa, the more intelligent the group would be. The biological mechanisms involved in this process were ill understood by scientists, but they seemed to include a mixture of pheromones, physical touch, and telepathy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
