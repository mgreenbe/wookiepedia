While Coven was the primary author, several other Jedi contributed to the book, adding details that related to their specializations as Jedi. These Masters included Morrit Ch'gally, Bowspritz, Sabla-Mandibu, Restelly Quist, Crix Sunburris, Skarch Vaunk, and Gal-Stod Slagistrough."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As of 115 BBY, the book had been published in its third edition, seeing slight revision, and factual correction. Over the next one hundred standard years, one copy of the book was passed down from Jedi Master to Padawan, starting with Grand Master Yoda, who passed it along to Thame Cerulian, Dooku, Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano. This particular copy, well annotated by its various owners and filled with memorabilia from over the years, survived the Great Jedi Purge and fell into the possession of Darth Sidious. After the Emperor's death in 11 ABY, the book was recovered by Squib salvagers near the remains of Byss, and given to Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Skywalker used this material, as well as several holocrons he had gathered over the years, to rebuild the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
