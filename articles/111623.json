Most models displayed basic information, such as range, size, speed, or species, but some more advanced versions provided advanced functionality that allowed the user to lock onto a target and track it even through walls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rangefinders were commonly built into electrobinoculars, but they were also frequently integrated into combat helmets, as well as mounted on blaster sights in the form of Computerized interface scopes. Numerous military factions made use of rangefinder technology to help them on the battlefield, including the Trandoshan Mercenary Group and the Grand Army of the Republic, the latter using them on modified Clone trooper armor, such as ARC trooper armor. Both Jango Fett and his son Boba Fett used rangefinders on their helmets that allowed them to survey their surroundings without moving."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
