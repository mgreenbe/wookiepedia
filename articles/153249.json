He led four regiments of soldiers against three regiments of Alliance troops during the Battle of Tiems, losing two in an ambush carefully laid by General Carlist Rieekan. Retreating to Tiems, he reinforced his troops with four regiments of native troops, but refused to attack\u2014with three-to-one odds\u2014until he could be sure of air cover. By the time he renewed his assault, Rieekan and his troops had been extracted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
