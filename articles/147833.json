While preparing for the assault on the Balmorran Arms Factory at the Sundari Flatlands, Tosh and his squad were attacked by mutated Colicoids from a nearby laboratory. After Captain Langstrom was killed, Sergeant Tenn took over as the commanding officer and retreated with what remained of the squad, before calling for reinforcements.
