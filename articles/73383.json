The species perceived there to be two worlds, their own and everything beyond it, and did not wish to come into contact with anything from outside of their planet. Its members wore wrapped garments and masks in order to conceal themselves and remain pure, additionally believing that doing so could heal their spirit if they did become unpure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One member of the species who would come to be known as Kairos, an emissary between her people and the outside world, was taken prisoner by the Galactic Empire forces that occupied the planet and experimented on in a prison camp. Having become unpure as a result, Kairos cocooned herself in wrappings and a mask in an attempt to heal. Before her spirit could be mended, however, she suffered severe injuries during the New Republic's campaign in the Cerberon system, and in order to prevent her from dying, the surgeons were forced to remove her suit. Feeling incomplete due to the interruption of her healing process, Kairos refrained from wearing her mask after reawakening."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kairos became stranded on her homeworld with Chass na Chadic and Yrica Quell when she navigated her U-wing to the planet after its navicomputer failed to function. The three of them resided in the then-abandoned Imperial outpost while attempting to salvage equipment to repair the vessel, and a number of Kairos's people converged on the area, assuming the Empire had returned and wishing to drive them out. As Kairos refused to let her people see her, they departed the outpost to repair the U-wing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
