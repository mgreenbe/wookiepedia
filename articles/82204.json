Namuura also gave them the Sealion, a prototype of the Missile Boat starfighter. When Tan Maarek Stele found out where the missile boat had gone, the Link entered hyperspace, while the Zeplin was captured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the commander of the Link, knowing the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Garrett was in pursuit, made a desperate attempt to alert the Rebel fleet at Sullust, which resulted in an engine failure due to overusing the engine's fuel rods, which forced a drop out of hyperspace. The Link was then stranded by the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Bew'a, and with the help of Tan Maarek Stele, the Link's shields were depleted and her starfighter squadrons destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebel attempts to recover the Link through the Assassin-class corvette Crater and the Muurian transport Confal failed, as they were both destroyed by Stele. The Link was then captured and sent to Imperial Intelligence so concealed data could be extracted from its computer systems.
