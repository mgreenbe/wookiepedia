The sergeant served under the tactical droid TX-20 in the Battle of Ryloth, during which the battle droid was in charge of the gutkurrs that TX-20 intended to use against Galactic Republic forces. TX-20 used the battle droid sergeant as a test to determine if the gutkurrs would attack non-organics, and while the creatures attempted to eat the droid, they were unable to. The sergeant later released the gutkurrs under orders from TX-20."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
