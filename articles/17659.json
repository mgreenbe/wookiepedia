Although a decent fighter in its own right the 32 was still behind modern standards. The 34 planned to bring Adumar's fighter squadrons up to date with modern sensor boards, better maneuverability, lighter materials, and factory-installed hyperdrives. However, as of 18 ABY the 34 was still in the prototype stage. This was because of several reasons, among them Adumar's focus on proton torpedo production and mass wage increases for laborers ordered by the perator, leading to delays."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
