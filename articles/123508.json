It consisted of the roasted meat of a shaak slow-cooked in gamma flux boilers with space carrots, Ojomian onions, Anzati snot garlic and Deltron spice wine. It was very popular on Naboo and throughout the Chommell sector. The Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster served it to a militia camp in the Lesser Plooriod Cluster that he served as cook for and found it to be very popular compared to the Skakoan processed, additive-enhanced meat he normally served there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
