She had watched as the Jedi had pursued Ziro and his gang down the portal, leaping from speeder to speeder. A red-eyed alien, protecting Ziro, had blasted the engine of an ascending transport, causing the ship to spiral out of control. The Jedi tried to regain control of the ship and managed to avoid a populated platform but steered it right onto the other side of the portal, which was the home of the Martez family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trace explains that her parents managed to get her and Rafa out but were killed during the collision. Rafa recalls that the Jedi failed to capture Ziro and that the accident had allowed the Hutt crime lord to escape offworld.

Rafa was upset that she and her sister had been orphaned and left homeless without any assistance from the Jedi.
