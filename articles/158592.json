With his wingman CC-2237 \"Odd Ball,\" they led the squadron against the vulture droids orbiting the castle. During the battle, Odd Ball was tailed by two vulture droids, but Kenobi was able to shoot them down to save his wingman. Kenobi then joined the battle on the ground while Odd Ball and the rest of the squadron continued to engage the droid fighters. When Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano stole a freighter after rescuing Rotta from Separatist captivity, they found themselves in the firefight between the V-19s and the vulture droids. Skywalker then requested Yularen in his Star Destroyer to have them land so they can deliver Rotta to safety, but vulture droids overtook them in a suicide run, crashing into the hangar and destroying all V-19s in there, making it impossible for him to land."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They also comprised a proportion of Skywalker's fighter forces aboard his flagship, the Resolute during the Malevolence crisis.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a recent string of defeats to Grievous in the Outer Rim Campaign, Gold Squadron, led by Anakin Skywalker, used V-19 starfighters to lure the cyborg general to a trap in Bothawui. However, the fighters were seemingly outmatched by the firepower of the Munificent-class star frigates of Grievous, resulting one of them being shot down. Anakin then ordered his squadron to break off the attack as he had AT-TE walkers under the command of Rex to destroy the Separatist fleet, giving victory to the Republic, though Grievous escaped the ensuing chaos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Quell, several V-19 fighters were deployed to defend Aayla Secura's crippled fleet from vulture droids while she was waiting for reinforcements led by Anakin Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after that, V-19 fighters also saw action during the Battle of Ryloth, where Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano led a squadron against the Separatist blockade led by Mar Tuuk. However, they were caught in a trap and overwhelmed, resulting Tano's second-in-command Axe being killed by a vulture droid. The squadron was forced to retreat, with only two V-19's left out of the 15 that took part in the engagement. They would later break through the blockade with the support of BTL-B Y-wing starfighters after Mar Tuuk's Droid Control Ship was destroyed by the Venator-class Star Destroyer Defender, just as Tuuk himself escaped the destruction of his ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "V-19s also took part during the evacuation of Felucia, led by Plo Koon to protect several gunships to aid in the evacuation of Tano, Skywalker, Kenobi, and their forces as they began to be surrounded by Separatist ground forces. Koon ordered his wingman Warthog to protect the gunships while he took out Separatist fighters over their path. They reached the atmosphere after breaking through the blockade but were pursued by a group of vulture droids. Warthog was pursued by two of them, but Koon was able to turn back and shot both droid ships down, but the crashing vulture droid careened and destroyed an AT-TE walker, nearly killing Anakin and Obi Wan. Following a failure to retrieve the holocron from Cad Bane following the Battle of Devaron, Bane, disguised as clone trooper \"Denal,\" stole a V-19 Torrent from the Resolute. Though Anakin ordered Yularen to deactivate the hyperdrive docking ring, it was too late as Bane used it to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the war, V-19's would later be replaced by Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighters, though V-19's participated in a few battles such as the Battle of Malastare where they escorted Y-wing bombers and ARC-170 starfighters to assist in the dropping of the electro-proton bomb. They also provided escort to Duchess Satine's ship, the Coronet following a skirmish orchestrated by Tal Merrik, who wanted to kill Satine so Death Watch can invade Mandalore. Several V-19's were also present in Mace Windu's flagship, the Endurance, where Clone pilots used them to evacuate just as the ship was about to be destroyed by Boba Fett in a revenge plot against Windu. V-19's also participated during the Battle of Kamino where they defended Republic ships from Hyena-class Droid Bombers, and also participated in the Battle of Sullust, engaging droid fighters scrambled by a fleet led by Asajj Ventress. V-19's also acted as aerial security over Kamino's cloning facilities until the V-Wings took their place near the end of the war. They also participated in the Battle of Coruscant, where Odd Ball had a few of them shoot down droid tri-fighters to clear the way for Skywalker and Kenobi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Galactic Empire, these fighters were used by planetary defense forces, including the Botajef Defense Force, which mounted a rebellion against the Empire. Additionally, even many years after Republic's reign, the Empire continued to use the V-19, despite its age, for missions in the Outer Rim Territories. The starfighter was still well-respected, with Imperial officers recognizing the starfighter for its versatility and durability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LucasArts' Art Director Chris Williams and Concept Artist Greg Knight developed the design of the V-19 Torrent for the 2-D Clone Wars micro-series.
