They were armed with port and starboard KX-4 laser cannon turrets, fore and aft MG3 missiles, and a belly-mounted Sunfire 1000. Their armor could withstand fire from armaments as powerful as a quad laser cannon. Primary modifications for atmospheric deployment included turbojets, repulsorlifts, and antisepsis fields to protect the ship and its systems from metal- and silicate-eating fungi. The vessel could only reach speeds of .5 past supersonic, but still included artificial gravity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Turbostorm-class gunship was produced by Sienar Fleet Systems some time prior to the Clone Wars.
