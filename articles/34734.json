It had the power to reduce an entire city to ash, but Momin had a more creative plan for it: he planned to pour the Force into the weapon's engine and freeze the horrified expressions of its victims in time. Darth Momin took his superweapon to a city and prepare to execute his plan. The Jedi, however, boarded the superweapon, their presence disrupting Momin's focus. As a result, Momin missed his chance, and the superweapon destroyed the city before he could freeze it in time. When the Jedi found Momin, his body had been incinerated and his consciousness was trapped in his mask. When recounting the event to Darth Vader, Momin's conscience called the superweapon a failure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Momin's superweapon first appeared in the 2018 canon comic Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 22 in a flashback.
