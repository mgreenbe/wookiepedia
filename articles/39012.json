Jango flew through tunnels in asteroids, but Kenobi would not give up. Getting the drop on Obi-Wan, Jango was now in pursuit and fired blasters until Obi-Wan's interceptor was hit. Jango then fired a homing missile, intending to finish it off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, Kenobi told his astromech R4-P17 to release the interceptor's spare parts. The missile could not dodge the number of tiny objects and exploded, leading Jango to believe he had destroyed his enemy.
