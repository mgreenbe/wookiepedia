She was a high-ranking member who reported directly to Loppak Slusk, chief of Exchange operations in the Telos sector based on the station.

Later, after the party discovered the disappearance of the Ebon Hawk while collecting their possessions at the Telos Security Force's station, Luxa offered to introduce Surik and her party to Slusk. In a not-so-subtle manner, Luxa let on to Surik that she found her to be \"quite attractive\". She would only assist Surik if she removed the Quarren crime boss, thus allowing her to assume his position. In return, Luxa offered to assist in helping Surik find the Ebon Hawk. However, the alliance was short-lived, as Luxa betrayed Surik in an attempt to cash in on Goto's bounty on live Jedi, and was killed in the ensuing battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Judging by her behavior towards Surik, Luxa was apparently composed, confident, and flirtatious, often speaking with a somewhat sultry, yet rather calm, mature and relaxed tone, giving the impression that she may have been somewhat laid-back and easy-going. She was also slightly devious, deceptive, and manipulative, based on her convincing of Surik to \"remove\" her boss from power in the Bumani Exchange Corp, and in return, help find the then-missing Ebon Hawk ship, only to betray Surik at the last minute in an attempt to claim the Jedi bounty the Exchange boss had on them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a confrontation with Slusk, Luxa, and their respective bodyguards, Meetra Surik receives a counter-offer from Slusk, who tells her that \"all is forgiven\" if Surik kills Luxa.
