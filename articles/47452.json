Holding Nebula at blasterpoint, Shinqo ordered Fekk and fellow Sullustan Gelss to prepare for action, but the Cinzia suddenly exploded.

Several years after the Treaty of Coruscant, Fekk became associated with Nebula's Rodian first mate, Shinqo.

In the ensuing confusion, Nebula's J8O soldier droid, Clunker, grabbed Shinqo and took his blaster. The droid turned the weapon on the mutineer, who accepted his place back under Nebula's command, ending the mutiny.
