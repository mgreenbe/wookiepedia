Members of the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps sometimes used DLT-20As instead of their standard issue E-11 blaster rifles. The droid bounty hunter IG-88 sometimes used this model of rifle, and carried one with it when on board the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor answering the Sith Lord Darth Vader's summons. Another droid in the same series, IG-11, also carried this model of rifle, without the scope attached. Another type of rifle, the pulse cannon, utilized the frame assembly of a DLT-20A."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DLT-20A laser rifle was created as a prop for Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back.[source?] Its name was confirmed to be canon by the reference book Star Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide, which was written by Adam Bray and released in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
