The goal of the Outbound Flight Project was to use the combined abilities of six Jedi Masters and twelve Jedi Knights to penetrate the disturbance using the Force. The Yuuzhan Vong found that they were able to bypass it at an area they called Vector Prime. The Yuuzhan Vong also possibly entered the Crispin system, which was at the very edge of the galaxy at the outer border of Wild Space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The midline of this field that surrounded the galaxy almost exactly corresponded to the portion of the Unknown Regions that bordered the \"western\" quarter of the galactic disc.
