At some point before the Invasion of Naboo, a conflict arose between her people and the Metal Clan, resulting in the Jedi Order sending Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to Bri'n to find a peaceful resolution. After being surrounded by forces of the Metal Clan, the Jedi had to bring Th'er offworld, taking her to Coruscant for her safety.

Her homeworld became the site of a conflict in which the Metal Clan sought to destroy her trees. When the Jedi Order heard of the problem, they sent two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, to find a peaceful solution. Th'er met with Jinn, and the two of them tried to negotiate with the Metal Clan. The negotiations were unsuccessful, and they were chased by the Clan's forces. As the Metal Clan refused to give up, Jinn contacted his Padawan, telling him to ready their Eta-class shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Th'er and the Jedi Master were surrounded by the Metal Clan's forces, and their leader threatened Th'er, telling her that her trees would fall either with her word or her blood. Th'er remained confident under Jinn's protection, but was interrupted when the Jedi grabbed onto her. Th'er questioned Jinn, who could see that no peaceful solution could be reached at the time, and had summoned their shuttle. As the Metal Clan's leader ordered his forces to prevent their escape, Jinn leapt upwards into the shuttle, carrying an angry Th'er. Hearing that they were heading to Coruscant, Th'er insisted that she could not abandon her trees, but Jinn assured her that the planet's laws prevented the Metal Clan from damaging the trees without her word or blood."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Finding balance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon seeing Coruscant, Th'er was dissatisfied with the city made of metal, seeing the planet as an abomination. Jinn assured that she would be safe, but Th'er told him that she would only feel safe with the deaths of every member of the Metal Clan, requesting that he use his lightsaber to strike them down. Jinn refused to, as doing so would be against the way of the Jedi. Th'er argued that the Jedi chose her side, and that they were said to be great warriors rather than cowards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Being called a warrior unsettled Jinn, who felt that the Jedi were losing their way. He sought guidance from the Force, visiting a world. Once he returned to Coruscant, Jinn met Th'er, who was admiring small patches of garden within the city. Jinn told her that she could spend her time visiting more useful places, and Th'er questioned what he meant. Stating that the Metal Clan had recruited powerful allies to their cause, Jinn suggested that she do the same. Th'er was against asking for outside help, believing that outsiders would strip Bri'n of everything its inhabitants valued. Jinn disagreed, telling Th'er that she could find a balance between enriching her people and changing their way of life, and that there were many people from different worlds on Coruscant who had faced struggles similar to hers. This changed Th'er's mind, and she decided to give the potential allies that Jinn spoke of a chance to prove that they could help."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Being a priestess of wood, Th'er felt a connection with trees and enjoyed natural surroundings rather than artificial structures. Due to the opposition of the Metal Clan, Th'er despised metal cities such as those of Coruscant. She was protective of her trees in the conflict against the Metal Clan, and was ready to kill the entire clan to keep them safe. Legends and rumors led her to think that the Jedi were warriors, and she was shocked by Qui-Gon Jinn's retreat from the battle. She also believed that outsiders would ruin the way of life on Bri'n, but Jinn eventually persuaded her into seeking offworld help against the Metal Clan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Th'er first appeared in Age of Republic - Qui-Gon Jinn 1, a 2018 canon comic written by Jody Houser and illustrated by Cory Smith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
