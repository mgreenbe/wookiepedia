He then saw the slave's master in Zygerrian armor and that he flew one of their ships. At first, Molec was distrusful of him when he demanded to speak to the Queen about Bruno Denturri. However, Molec brought in the man known as Lars Quell before the queen. Molec was then told that a man in Zygerrian armor had tried to free one of the enslaved colonists. Molec then realized that it was Kenobi. Molec then brought Kenobi before the Queen to punish him for the Jedi's crimes against their empire. However, Molec, the Queen and their guards were then attack by Quell and his slave, who revealed themselves to be Anakin Skywalker and his apprentice, Ahsoka Tano. Though Molec was knocked down by Tano, the Queen and their guards were eventually able to subdue the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Molec visited a caged Tano and revealed that the Queen had promised that after Skywalker was tamed, Tano would be his slave to do with whatever he desired.

In retaliation, Molec electrocuted Tano several times with the shock collar she was wearing as a slave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Molec then invited Count Dooku to Zygerria to speak with the Queen about her defiance in not killing Skywalker. Dooku decided on his arrival that the Jedi should be killed immediately. Molec agreed with the Count to kill the Jedi (except Tano); Miraj, however, refused these terms and was unwilling to let Anakin die. Dooku then deemed that Scintel was unfit to be queen. Molec then stood by as Dooku Force-choked her, an act that would prove fatal.
