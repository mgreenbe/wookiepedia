Eventually, he was taken captive by the pureblood Dark Council member Darth Nyriss and her apprentice, the pure-blooded Sith Lord Scourge, in the former's fortress. There, his lightsaber was taken away and was held as a prize while its owner was tortured for many months as the captors tried to gain information from him. Three years later, Jedi Knight Meetra Surik came to save him with the help of Scourge. Together, they defeated the Dark Council member, and the lightsaber was given back to Revan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flushed with their success, Revan, Surik and Scourge stormed the Sith Emperor's Citadel, and, after three years, Revan's lightsaber was finally put to use again as it cut down members of the Imperial Guard before engaging the Sith Emperor himself. The assault failed when Scourge killed Surik and Revan became the Emperor's captive, imprisoned in stasis for three hundred years, with his weapon hanging faithfully from his belt throughout the ordeal. During the Cold War, the Republic became aware of his imprisonment due to the intervention of Meetra Surik's Force ghost, which had stayed beside Revan the entire time. A Republic strike team was sent to Taral V in order to gain access a Gree computer in order to navigate a route through the Maelstrom. They succeeded in freeing Revan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lightsaber, now changed to violet, traveled with its master to the Foundry, a massive space station located within an asteroid, which allowed it to create massive amounts of droids in a short period of time. Revan would once again use his lightsaber to fight against an Imperial strike force commanded by Darth Malgus, who ordered the capture of the station, and the death of Revan to boot. In a fierce fight, Revan appeared to have lost, but he disappeared in a flash of light before the death blow could be struck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to lead the Order of Revan which bore his name, the blade remained with the Dark Side fuelled warrior until he fell for the last time to the Yavin IV strike time led by Republic and Imperial forces. Upon merging with his Light Side self and becoming whole once more, the lightsaber was left behind along with his iconic mask and robes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
