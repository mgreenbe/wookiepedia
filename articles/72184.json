He was a prominent yet corrupt senator who gave his son, Judder Page, a pampered upbringing. Page despised his father, whom he wished could be more like the legendary Jedi Knights of the Old Republic. Inspired by tales of the Jedi, Page used his father's wealth to train himself in a variety of combat and defense techniques. The Senator indulged his son's fancy, supposing that the boy's idealism was merely a phase."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the subsequent years, Page grew into a young man with strong moral standards. The Senator sent him to the Imperial Academy, reasoning that if his son were to train to be a soldier, his skills would best be put to use in the service of the Galactic Empire. As the son of a prominent senator from the galaxy's Core Worlds, Page found that vast avenues of study were open to him. Shortly after graduating with honors, Page defected to the Rebel Alliance, a militant faction that opposed the Empire in the ongoing Galactic Civil War. Although the Imperial Senate was dissolved by Emperor Palpatine in 0 BBY, Page was still considered the scion of an influential family thirty years later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Senator was a corrupt individual and was hated by his son, Judder Page, who believed that his father had sold out and that he possessed moral deficiencies.

Page's father has been stated to be the Imperial Senator from Corulag for years, but 2003's Coruscant and the Core Worlds assigns that position to the character of Zafiel Snopps \"in the Rise of the Empire era and most of the Rebellion era,\" a time period that encompasses the Imperial Senate's entire existence.
