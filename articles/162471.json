With its streamlined hull, it was capable of air speeds of up to 1,200 kph, and it was named the \"Shooting Star\" because of the spectacular, meteor-like trail it left across the sky during re-entry maneuvers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ships of this class had a crew of one, plus a sentient droid brain with a vocaliser.
