In 0 BBY, the droid partners C-3PO and R2-D2 crashed in the Central Lowlands aboard an escape pod following their escape from the Tantive IV, a CR90 corvette affiliated with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Subsequently, the enemy Galactic Empire tracked the droids to the Lowlands and sent a Reconnaissance Troop Transporter after them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The area of the Dune Sea where the droids' escape pod crashed was identified as the Central Lowlands in only one source, the 1979 untitled story booklet that came with Kenner's Imperial Troop Transporter toy. This booklet is also the only place that reports the Reconnaissance Troop Transporter's involvement in the search for the droids. However, this booklet has multiple continuity issues with Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope and other contemporaneous official material."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
