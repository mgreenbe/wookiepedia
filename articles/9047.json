As the stormtrooper moves along his patrol, Sabine Wren appears on a rooftop and makes her way toward a TIE/ln space superiority starfighter landing platform. Once on the outer wall of the platform, Wren contacts Hera Syndulla on the Ghost, alerting the Twi'lek pilot that Wren is in place in order to create a diversion that will allow the Ghost to fly away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wren sneaks through the landing platform and begins painting her call sign in graffiti on the side of a TIE fighter, when she is spotted by two stormtroopers who overheard the sound of her painting. They question the Mandalorian as to what she is doing and command her to stand down, or else they will shoot. Wren goads them to shoot. The stormtroopers, staring at each other in bemusement prepare their blasters only to find that she had disappeared. The troopers chase her through the platform, with Wren taunting them as she moved.
