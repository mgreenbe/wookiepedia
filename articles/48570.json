That day finally came, and in 3963 BBY, Mandalore the Ultimate sent forth his ships and warriors against the planet beneath them, using the connecting atmospheres to smooth the way for his troops' Basilisk war droids to attack the walled capital city of Iziz."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the initial Mandalorian assault was launched from Dxun down onto Onderon, the resulting battle did not last terribly long...in the words of one soldier, \"their 'resistance' was laughable. We cut through their defenses like vibroblades through cloth.\" The people of Onderon had long been noted for their xenophobic refusal to adapt and incorporate cultural and defense characteristics from other peoples, and it cost them dearly when the rain of death began. The defenses of Iziz could not long withstand such a prolonged siege, and the city fell within mere hours."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From Onderon, Mandalore the Ultimate's forces now possessed a staging-point entr\u00e9e into the Core Worlds and beyond, from whence they could launch a conflict that would spread to engulf the galaxy all the way to the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
