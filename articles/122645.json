It was a pale yellow liquid that was primarily used as a sedative which allowed an individual to remain conscious while simultaneously numbing all physical sensation. It induced paralysis in the body's primary muscles, though it had no effect on vital organs regardless of the administered dosage. Senflax also interrupted an individual's mental capacities, disrupting the concentration required to manipulate the Force. The Ambrian healer Caleb kept a supply of Senflax among his many other natural herbs and remedies within the cellar of his shack. His daughter Serra recovered it ten years after Caleb's death, and furnished the Iktotchi assassin Huntress with it in the quest to apprehend Serra's enemy, Darth Bane."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
