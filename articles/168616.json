It contained several sprawls, including one referred to as City Sprawl North 7: A68. Although North 7:A68 was technically an independent \"village\" from Zone N7, its communications and sensor networks were nonetheless interconnected with Zone N7, which in turn directly reported the information to the Overbridge.
