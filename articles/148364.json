Drenn is actually a spy and saboteur codenamed \"the Wraith\", and working for Moff Kentor Sarne. During the following battle, the FarStar engages several Imperial vessels, and the Wraith poisons Adrimetrum using toxin from the planet Sebiris, and she falls into a coma. Retreating from the battle, the crew of the corvette begin an investigation into Adrimetrum's poisoning, and Breslin Drake, who had been tracking the Wraith, recommends they travel to Sebiris since the Wraith was known to frequent the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the planet, the crew negotiate with the native Sebiri, who agree to give them the antidote.
