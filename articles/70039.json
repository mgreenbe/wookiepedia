Codifying the ranks and duties of the Jedi in her handbook called The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, the term was used up until the dissolution of the Order in 19 BBY. When the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic was revealed to be a Sith Lord, he quickly ordered the Grand Army of the Republic to turn on the Jedi before they could remove the Sith from office. Darth Vader, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious' new apprentice led the 501st Legion against the Temple conducting Operation: Knightfall as part of Contingency Order 66. The snipers of the Temple defended it valiantly against the Sith and his army but were vastly outnumbered. By the end of the night, not a single sniper had survived the order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
