She was the captain of the MedStar-class frigate Golandras. She had one son, Alarik, and two daughters, Bellen and Viqi. At some point between the First Battle of Geonosis and the Battle of Christophsis, the planet Marat V was taken over by the terrorist Zeta Magnus. Captain Shard was dispatched to the edge of the Marat system, officially on a relief mission to deliver food and aid to Marat V. In truth, the captain was tasked with bringing three Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Halagad Ventor, and a clone commando unit to Marat V so they could dethrone Magnus. However, the Golandras fell victim to an orbital ambush in the form of an invisible minefield. Although Shard could not save her ship, she still managed to shoot off the escape pods that contained the Jedi and the clone commandos before it was too late. Fatally crippled, Shard died on the bridge of the Golandras, and the vessel exploded shortly thereafter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
