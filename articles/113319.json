When the Exile explored the landing pad, she encountered several Exchange thugs threatining Refugees, but the Exile stopped them. When she reached the central hub of the landing pad, Kreia taught the Exile to feel the Force around Nar Shaddaa, and some of her connection to the Force was restored. The Exile encountered a man named Ratrin Vhek, who claimed to own the Ebon Hawk, and the Exile gave it to him. However, when the Red Eclipse, led by Cahhmakt, boarded the Ebon Hawk, they killed Vhek, who was onboard. When the Exile returned to the Ebon Hawk, she fought through Red Eclipse thugs and defeated Cahhmakt. With Vhek and Cahhmakt dead, the Exile was able to keep the Ebon Hawk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Exile also learned about a trade war between two merchants, Geeda and Oondar. The Exile helped Geeda get rid of Oondar when Geeda talked about the light side and the dark side, and the Exile helped Geeda establish trade with Khoonda on Dantooine and the Mandalorians on Dxun. When Goto captured the Exile, her companions came to Tienn Tubb who helped the companions change the codes of the Ebon Hawk into a code of Vogga's freighters, allowing them to be detected by Goto's yacht. After the Exile was freed, she returned with her new companion, Mira, to the hub where Kreia taught the Exile to feel the Force around Nar Shaddaa, and here, the Exile taught Mira how to use the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
