A bounty hunter, he also served as a bouncer for one of Baruk's cantinas. At some point, the cantina was visited by the New Republic agent and Jedi Kyle Katarn, who was searching for Baruk. The Rodian and another bouncer intercepted Katarn before he could walk to far into the establishment, and demanded that the Jedi hand over his weapons. Katarn complied and handed over all of his weapons with the exception of his lightsaber. After being double-crossed by the bartender Baldarek, the Rodian tried to kill Katarn, but to no avail. The Rodian was unarmed and spared by the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rodian first appeared in the 2002 video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, during the first level that took place on Nar Shaddaa. While enemies can be routinely disarmed throughout the game and be left unharmed, this Rodian, as well as all bounty hunters during this portion of the level, had to be killed in order to trigger the next cutscene and continue the game. Rodians in Jedi Outcast were voiced by either Michael Gough or Tom Kane, who were credited as Rodian 2 and Rodian 1 respectively. It is not clear what Rodian this one was, although he was the second one to speak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
