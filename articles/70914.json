As a cover story, he presented himself as a purchasing agent of a gemstone dealer from Corulag, with a reputation for being friendly and fair, though also dull and forgettable. He was always accompanied by an A2 Accounting/Business Unit, A2-ZP, who was modified to serve as his bodyguard. Corconnan possessed a peridote Tasar crystal which granted him some ability to control pain; like many in possession of Tasar crystals, Corconnan became Force-sensitive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
