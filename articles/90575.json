Mining stations were distinct from standard mines (also known as shaft mines) in that shaft mines were fixed on the surface of celestial bodies. Mining stations were often controlled by private or state-owned mining guilds.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
