The planet's superweapon directed the star's power into a thermal oscillator as a way of collecting the dark energy it needed to function, dimming the star's light until it was snuffed out completely. However, the destruction of Starkiller Base allowed the star's energy to expand, forming a new star in the planet's place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
