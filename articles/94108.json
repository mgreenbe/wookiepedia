Led by the Boss Musori, it was at rival with Ken-Kiba's spice runner gang, which also operated in the city. In 19 BBY Ember Chankeli hired former Jedi Dass Jennir to deal with the gang, without telling him that the reason was to allow the spice runner's to fully take their place. The gang was eventually made leader-less and its members few when Dass Jennir tricked the spicers into attacking them after he made them believe Musori had ordered an attack on the spicer's operations on Telerath's second moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
