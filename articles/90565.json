The devices created vast, deep, semi-circular pits from their activities. Several mining machines operated on the Swokes Swokes homeworld Makem Te. These were built by the Galactic Republic and later operated by the Empire. The galactic government, the Congress of Caliphs, took a portion of all profits from the devices."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
