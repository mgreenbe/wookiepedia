Around 5 ABY, Core Nine was the only mining facility remaining. A remnant of the New Republic's 61st Mobile Infantry sought to use the facility as a base of operations to make hit and run attacks against the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, which had scattered their company. The fighter wing's commanding officer Colonel Soran Keize learned of Core Nine when studying the remnant's possible destinations and had his forces take control of it. Subsequently, the 61st remnant launched an attack on the 204th at the facility. The fighter wing ultimately fled aboard Core Nine's sole freighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Core Nine mining megafacility appeared in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
