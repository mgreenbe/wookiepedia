It was located along the thin line that separated the planet between the blistering heat of the Bright Lands and the deadly cold of night side. Bashka did not have much in the way of organized establishments, but during the final days of the Old Republic a Twi'lek named Cheib'Kalla owned and operated a cantina called the Fungus Pit and turned it into a popular attraction for local residents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
