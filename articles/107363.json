The many skyscrapers of Prak City were said to look like the pointed fangs of some animal when seen from a distance. Cloud cars and airspeeders were common forms of transportation, as the land terrain was difficult to navigate. The city served as the seat of power for Imperial Warlord Foga Brill, and many other companies established headquarters in the business district. Prak City was situated on the largest plateau on all of Prakith, allowing plenty of land to house a huge, Imperial-class spaceport. The Asonel cave system ran through the mountains just outside of the city border."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
