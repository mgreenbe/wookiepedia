He collected rare technology and once owned the hologram program named Holiday but according to Tharan Cedrax, he disregarded the hologram's potential. When Glorzo decided to sell Holiday, both Cedrax and a scavenger put up offers for her so Glorzo proposed a contest between the two individuals. The buyers were to head to the Vaal asteroid field, survive for more than two minutes and bring back a stone from the asteroid Rukabi Major. The first one to succeed in this would win Holiday from Glorzo and that was Cedrax, who succeeeded days ahead of the scavenger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glorzo was considered the owner of the largest, galaxy-wide collection of Rakata artifacts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
