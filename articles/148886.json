An individual known as Kraemr warned potential NR-5 buyers of their NR knockoff on Cynabar's Droid Datalog. Having been swindled by Faddo, an individual identified as Drev, via the Datalog, invited those scammed by the Tredwall con artist to meet him on the planet Selonia in the next month to help Drev exact vengeance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tredwall was first mentioned in Cynabar's Fantastic Technology: Droids, a Star Wars Legends supplement written by Drew Campbell and Eric S.
