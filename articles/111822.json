He burned an entire village alive on the planet Dantooine. In 3643 BBY, he earned the sponsorship token of the crime lord Suudaa Nem'ro to join the Great Hunt, a bounty hunting competition. Graata, a representative of the Great Hunt who was due to arrive shortly in Nem'ro's Palace on the planet Nal Hutta, then contacted Rarsk via transmission. The Trandoshan then headed to the palace of Nem'ro's rival, Voontara Fa'athra, who was holding the Republic scientist Albea for the bounty hunter. Rarsk intended to collect on the bounty and deliver Albea to the Empire, who wanted her dead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the palace, Rarsk discovered that many of Fa'athra's servants had been killed, and entered the lab where Albea was being kept with his blaster pistol drawn and two Abyssin mercenaries backing him up. Laying in wait for him in the lab, Rarsk found the slicer Mako and another bounty hunter who Nem'ro had promised sponsorship to. Nem'ro had told the hunter to kill Rarsk in order to obtain the sponsorship token, and Mako had intercepted Rarsk's transmission with Graata to learn about Albea and allow them to reach her before the Trandoshan. Rarsk threatened to kill the pair if they did not hand the bounty over, but the other hunter countered by demanding that Rarsk hand over the token. With neither backing down, Rarsk attacked, but he and the Abyssins were killed and the token taken from his corpse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The surviving bounty hunter then killed Albea in order to also claim the bounty on her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounty hunter and Mako then met with Graata at Nem'ro's Palace, who was surprised to not be meeting Rarsk, but gave the instructions he intended to deliver to the Trandoshan to his replacement instead.
