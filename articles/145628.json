Sending him to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Tholme relinquished his Jedi Watchman status in favor of training Vos. Several years later, after Vos's training had been completed, a mishap occurred in which Vos lost his memory. When he had partially regained it, Tholme took it upon himself to help the wayward Jedi, and even took up Vos's former Padawan, Aayla Secura, as his own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Separatist Crisis and subsequent Clone Wars, Tholme set up a spy network with Vos, hoping to glean information from the upper echelons of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. After sustaining grievous injuries from Count Dooku himself on Bakura, Tholme masterminded the plan to have Vos infiltrate Dooku's inner circle of Dark Acolytes. However, Vos turned to the dark side in earnest, and began participating in highly damaging Separatist activities against the Republic. In the meantime, Tholme participated in several Republic engagements, on worlds such as Devaron, where he was injured by the bounty hunter Aurra Sing, and Saleucami where he would turn Vos back to the light and the Republic. He was able to evade Order 66 and the subsequent Great Jedi Purge along with his lover, the Neti Jedi T'ra Saa, and took refuge on Kashyyyk, hidden from the new Imperial occupation.

He was able to complete his Jedi training, but instead of immediately pursuing standard Jedi activities, Tholme decided to initially follow an alternate path. On Anzat, he sought out the highly acclaimed Anzati master Akku Seii, who proceeded to teach him the art of the Anzati assassins. Tholme excelled in his training, picking up the skill to mask his presence entirely in the Force, which allowed him to feign death. In addition to those talents, he became proficient at espionage and stealth, traits that would be put to use many a time during his Jedi career. At some point after his Anzati training was complete, Tholme enlisted Seii again, this time in his hunt for the Anzati assassin Katichak.

During his time there, he became good friends with the Kiffar Sheyf Kurlin Vos, and maintained a cordial relationship with the Guardians of the sector. Kurlin's distant cousins, Pethros and Quian Vos, had a Force-sensitive son, Quinlan. Knowledge of Vos's high midi-chlorian count had evaded Tholme, and by the time he had deemed Vos suitable for Jedi training, he was older than the average candidate. To complicate matters further, Tint\u00e9, Kurlin's sister, demanded Vos to stay on Kiffu and be trained as a Guardian. As a compromise, Kurlin requested that Quinlan stay on Kiffu, but be trained by Tholme. Tholme allowed this, and began training the boy in the basic Jedi arts, stepping down from his role as Jedi Watchman."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For several years, Tholme persisted with his instruction of Vos.

She made a deal with a group of Anzati who had come to Kiffex in search of the legendary Dark Jedi Volfe Karkko. She encouraged their destructive ways, and allowed their murder of the prisoners held in colonies on the planet. Eventually, they demanded more of Tint\u00e9, namely in the form of a blood relative.

He screamed for three days, until Tholme arrived to comfort him and bring him back out of his state. Kurlin was disgusted with Tint\u00e9's actions, and Tholme convinced him that only orthodox Jedi training would allow Quinlan to master his talents and use them properly. The Sheyf agreed, and Tholme took the boy to the galactic capital Coruscant for proper training at the Jedi Temple. There, he took Quinlan as his first Padawan. Tholme's Watchman duties were filled by T'ra Saa, a Neti Jedi whom Tholme knew very well.

The Council eventually dispatched Tholme on a mission involving tracking a dealer of interdicted beasts, such as wampas. He deduced that Clan Secura was involved in the illegal activities, and so journeyed in 46 BBY to their homeworld of Ryloth with Vos to investigate. While discussing the matter with brothers Pol and Lon Secura, Vos wandered off to follow a disturbance he had felt from Aayla Secura, Pol's and Lon's niece. He discovered the illegally held creatures during his wanderings, and saved Aayla, from whom he sensed a degree of Force-sensitivity.

Her count was sufficiently high, and she was taken back to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the smuggler Iaco Stark's actions against the Trade Federation on the Outer Rim attracted the attention of the Republic, the Jedi were appointed to intervene. On Thyferra, an alazhi processing plant exploded, causing a galaxy-wide bacta shortage. The Trade Federation was one of the few conglomerates that dealt in the substance, and so when Stark's ships began raiding them, they were able to sell it off at greatly inflated prices. Jedi Master Tyvokka, who was in charge of the Jedi team, suspected that the explosion was part of a ruse to deliberately lower bacta supplies, and turn profits for the Federation. He, along with the Council, decided to send Jedi to investigate. Tyvokka settled upon Tholme, due to his highly regarded espionage and subterfuge skills. Vos accompanied Tholme to Thyferra, where they began exploring the ruins of the Xucphra Corporation bacta refinery. Judging by the age of the wreckage, Tholme deduced that the explosion was, as Tyvokka had suspected, a Federation/Xucphra ruse. The investigation almost ran to its conclusion without incident, but the two Jedi were forced to do battle with HKB-3 hunter-killer droids on their way out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, on Troiken, the Stark Hyperspace War had broken out, and was escalating rapidly.

Coincidentally, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, were present at the same time, escorting Senator Valorum and Adi Gallia off-planet and away from the combat zones. Jinn took Tholme and Vos back to Mount Avos, where Jedi Master Plo Koon and Senator Ranulph Tarkin's Republic Army had taken refuge. Tholme was saddened by the news of Tyvokka's death during the war's opening confrontation, but Vos took the news even harder. He went off, seeking solitude, but stirred the mountain's challat eaters in his explorations. He and Kenobi, who had followed Quinlan at Jinn's request, were only saved thanks to the intervention of Tholme, Jinn and Koon, who, once the padawans were safely behind them, called upon the Force to seal off the challat eater cave from the rest of the encampment.

He organized a Jedi meditation circle in the hopes that he would be able to communicate with his niece on Coruscant, Sha Koon. With the aid of Tholme, Vos, Jinn, and Kenobi, Koon was able to do so, and requested the support he needed to keep his men alive. As a result, Koon then planned for and executed the Fifth Battle of Qotile. Tholme and Vos infiltrated the Raptor, the flagship of the Stark Commercial Combine, in order to broadcast the patch to the navcomputer virus that had stopped hyperspace travel and had allowed Stark to cripple Tarkin's fleet at the opening of the conflict. Jinn and Kenobi were able to secure the patch from the Combine Headquarters, which allowed Tholme and Vos to execute their part of the mission.

Later, the Kiffar took Secura as his Padawan learner, and the two roamed the galaxy on missions for the Council. A few years after the Invasion of Naboo, both Vos and Secura were captured and drugged by criminals. The incident resulted in complete amnesia for both. Due to her Twi'lek physiology, Aayla was eventually able to reclaim her memory, but Vos was not as successful. The ordeal had left him changed, and despite re-training by both Jedi Councilman Mace Windu and Master Sora Bulq, the Council was troubled by the increased level of darkness in him. Vos was subsequently dispatched by the Council to Kiffex at his aunt Tint\u00e9's behest, where he was to investigate the massacre of a security compound. The Council also warned him of a disturbance in the Force in the system, as reported by Master Saa. Despite sending Vos alone, the Council had little faith in his abilities to properly execute the mission, and so dispatched Tholme to watch over him.

Also at the compound was the Devaronian bounty hunter Vilmarh Grahrk, who had aided Vos immediately after the memory loss incident. The trio set out from the compound to the town of Deadend, where they were attacked by a group of thugs. Despite Vos's memory loss, the two Jedi fought in perfect unison, disarming the guards before making a smooth and relatively unnoticed entry into the locale. In Grahrk's secret lair, Tholme taught Vos more about his past, specifically, Tint\u00e9's manipulation of him as a child. Vos, who experienced his mother's death for a second time in his visions, began to hallucinate, seeing Tholme as one of the Anzati killers. Enraged, he attacked his former Master, who in turn quickly subdued Vos by pushing him into a pile of junk. Vos was sobered, but the visions served to heighten his suspicions of Tint\u00e9's actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force drew Tholme and Vos to the Black Hole cantina, where they met the blind wandering Jedi Master Zao. Zao was subsequently set upon by thugs, which prompted Tholme and his former Padawan to intervene. Eventually, the bar fight turned into an all-out battle, when a pack of feral Anzati arrived unexpectedly. Even more shocking to Vos than the surprise attack was the identity of the Anzati's leader\u2014lost Jedi Aayla Secura. Secura and her Anzati were beaten back and able to escape, but Vos was enraged at the fact that he had been played for a fool by Tholme and the Council.

Tholme was pleased to see Saa, a Jedi he had admired, respected, and been good friends with even before her appointment to the role of Watchman of the Kiffu sector. Saa had been dispatched from Coruscant, where a holocron had revealed information about Volfe Karkko, the fallen Jedi who had drawn the Anzati to Kiffex. Karkko, an Anzati himself, had been imprisoned on Kiffex by a team of Jedi Masters, and Tholme correctly deduced that Secura must have reawakened and freed him. Though Saa's mission was to bring Vos back to Coruscant, she understood his need to save Secura, despite Tholme's concerns that Vos's previous \"experience\" with Anzati would cloud his judgment. Nevertheless, he continued to follow Vos, and the four Jedi set off for Karkko's temple.

Tholme sensed that Vos was losing the battle, both with Karkko and the dark side, so he, Saa, and Zao, joined together to strengthen him through the Force. Vos dispatched Karkko with one strike, and rescued the injured Secura. At that moment, the Guardians of Kiffex began their orbital bombardment of the Anzati temple, but the Jedi were saved due to the timely return of Grahrk in his ship, the Inferno. Tholme's mission was complete, but Vos, having been influenced by Zao, decided to roam the galaxy, and let the Force guide him.

Fenn was facing the penalty of exile, due to the fact that he had been part of the Ruling Clan during Pol Secura's death, as per the Ryloth tradition of cleansing an entire Ruling Clan when one member died. Secura picked up on the fact that Fenn, in a bid for clemency, was planning to have Lon's child, Nat Secura, kidnapped and used for leverage.

Tholme made his return in conjunction with Vos's declaration, and helped him battle the Morgukai clones. Secura, at the same time, laid charges with which to destroy all the cloning tanks. Bulq, enraged at the double-cross, viciously attacked Tholme, while Vos kept Tol Skorr, another of Dooku's acolytes, at bay. Tholme was bested in his duel, but Vos saved him from Bulq's killing blow, and in turn slew the Dark Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Siege of Saleucami had succeeded, and Dooku's plans for a Morgukai army crushed, due to Tholme's five months of sabotage. After the battle, Vos declared his plans to leave the Jedi Order following the Clone Wars, as he had conceived a child with Khaleen Hentz, and wished to take care of the baby. Tholme respected his decision, and was glad that Vos had finally acknowledged the dark side's presence within him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The end of the war, and the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even after the Siege of Saleucami, Vos's intelligence from Dooku's Dark Acolytes proved useful. The Jedi Council was hot on the trail of the real second Sith Lord, but they needed clues as to locations he had used for his schemes and machinations. Information passed on to the High Council by Tholme identified the abandoned LiMerge Power building in The Works on Coruscant as one such location. Although the information was reliable, and the Jedi did follow it up, the subsequent Battle of Coruscant prevented further investigations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tholme and T'ra Saa were able to escape Order 66, in which Jedi across the galaxy were gunned down by the clone trooper battalions they commanded on the fields of battle. During the pan-galactic massacre, Tholme and Saa were on Nar Shaddaa, meeting up with Vos's lover, Hentz. They stayed with her, and had no knowledge of Order 66 until the newly formed Galactic Empire began announcing the deaths of other Jedi. Vos had been in the presence of his troops on Kashyyyk when the order went through, and was gravely injured. However, help came from an unlikely source: Vilmarh Grahrk. He helped Vos survive the attacks, and for eight months, Vos stayed with Grahrk as he recovered from his wounds. In time, Tholme, Saa, Hentz, and her child, Korto Vos, were reunited with Quinlan on Kashyyyk, and the small group of survivors stayed hidden, far from the prying eyes of Palpatine's New Order. Eventually, Tholme passed away. His long time companion, T'ra Saa, was later said to have taken root in meditation at the site of Tholme's funeral pyre on Anzat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tholme was a firm believer in the old ways of the Jedi, as noted by Count Dooku during their duel on Bakura. Although Dooku tried to sway Tholme from serving the Republic, the Jedi Master was resilient, staying true to his beliefs even while held at Dooku's swordpoint. However, Tholme was not averse to bending the rules to fit the situation. He did not technically break the Jedi Code by entering into his relationship with Master Saa, but he did enter territory usually frowned upon by the upper echelons of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tholme was very proud of his two students, and would often defend their actions. When the Jedi Council suspected that Quinlan Vos was slipping too far into the veil of the dark side, Tholme would always come to his defense, citing a multitude of reasons as to why his \"Dark Acolyte\" operation should continue. To this end, Tholme was also highly protective of his machinations and plans, and was loath to see them abandoned. He also felt deep regret for his actions, or lack thereof. When Saa was severely wounded at Null, he kept a dedicated vigil beside her bacta tank, blaming himself for her injuries, despite the fact that he could not have helped her. He lamented the possible fall of Vos to the dark side, and was disappointed by his fanatical devotion to the murder of Sora Bulq, but this was offset, again, by his pride in Secura, his second apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tholme disliked cybernetics, and initially refused to have enhancements installed on his shattered leg, preferring to limp rather than be a machine. Eventually, he swallowed his pride in favor of taking a more active role in the war, as he felt he had sent too many people to their doom instead of getting his own hands dirty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his Anzati training, Tholme's skills included combat, espionage, subterfuge, and manipulation. Unlike most Jedi, Tholme was more of a mastermind of events, rather than a diplomat or a warrior. His talent with the Jedi mind trick was considerable, as was his ability to shield his presence in the Force. Tholme would frequently slip into his \"death-trance\" when the tide of a conflict turned against him or he found himself on the wrong end of a trap. For the most part, his Jedi powers were put to waste during the Clone Wars following his maiming at the hands of Count Dooku, but during the Outer Rim Sieges, his Anzati skills came to the fore, when he harried the production of Morgukai clones through sabotage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tholme wielded a single-bladed lightsaber with a green blade. His skill with a lightsaber often came into question because of his tendency to resort to deception when the tide of a duel turned against him. However, he proved proficient enough to survive duels with both Sora Bulq and Count Dooku, who were considered among the greatest swordsmen during that time. Dooku himself praised Tholme's dueling skills, and respected the Jedi Master's choice to follow the more traditional arts, such as fencing, rather than purely train to deflect blaster bolts like many other Jedi of that age did. Another of Tholme's skills was healing\u2014his aptitude for which earned him official recognition as a Jedi healer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tholme was created by John Ostrander and debuted in the Star Wars: Republic story arc Darkness. He would appear in most \"Quinlan Vos\" Republic arcs to follow, but only as a supporting character. All of Tholme's comic renderings, bar one, have been created by Jan Duursema. The exception was in The Stark Hyperspace War, where Tholme was drawn by David\u00e9 Fabbri. Outside of Star Wars comics, Tholme has been illustrated by Chris Trevas for the reference book Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force. Ostrander has stated that Tholme's name and characterization are inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. As a play on Tholme's inspiration, his alias of \"Miles Croft\" is derived from the name of Holmes' older, smarter brother, Mycroft Holmes. Tholme's death was later confirmed in Legacy 25, although when he died remains unclear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
