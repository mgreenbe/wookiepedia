There she found the remains of stormtroopers, inexplicably present from millennia ago. She soon met a Spirit named Tilotny, who claimed to have thrown a shape and created the human. Three more Spirits appeared to her along with four stormtroopers who had been pursuing Leia. Tilotny claimed creation of the stormtroopers as well, playing with them and turning them into diamonds. She also turned Leia's heart into a diamond. After she finished playing with the humans, the Spirit named Splendid Ap resurrected all of them. As he was not very good with time, Splendid Ap accidentally transported the stormtroopers back 8,000 years into the past, explaining the remains Leia had found."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By placing both the Bedlam Pulsar and the Bedlam system in its list, The Essential Atlas Online Companion indicates the Bedlam Pulsar is not in the Bedlam system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
