He and his pet Loth-cat initially hid out there after he escaped an Imperial prison with the help of Ephraim and Mira Bridger and returned to his homeworld. When their son Ezra returned to Lothal looking for his parents, he eventually tracked down Ryder at the hideout. Later, Ryder was forced to abandon the hideout after Imperial troops tracked him down there.
