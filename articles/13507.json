It took place in deep space, likely within or very close to the Airam sector in the Outer Rim Territories, when Imperial Assault Gunboats attempted to disable the Rebel CR90 corvette Intrepid near Airam Platform, where Rebel and Airam representatives were meeting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperials, under the impression that the Rebel Alliance's ambassador to the Airam was an important enemy leader worthy of capture and interrogation, mustered a strike force of Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wings, better known as Assault Gunboats, to attack and disable the Intrepid as it departed Airam Platform. The Airam reacted coolly, warning the Imperial marauders that if they passed within range of the XQ1 Platform, they would be fired on. They dispatched Shiv Squadron, a group of R-41 Starchasers, to patrol the perimeter of the Airam station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Airam looked on, the Rebel VIP escort of T-65 X-wing starfighters from Green Squadron sprang into action. They attempted to destroy the Assault Gunboats before they could disable the Intrepid, as the Rebel ambassador knew that the Airam had a Muurian transport with a repair crew aboard based out of Airam Platform in case the ship was heavily damaged. However, it was felt that the Airam would disrespect and never join the Alliance if they had to intervene in such a way. Meanwhile, the small Imperial force of Gamma-class ATR-6 assault transports from flight group Omega entered the area shortly after the Assault Gunboats, which had exited hyperspace a considerable distance from Airam Platform, began making their attack runs. Once they entered the system, they became the Rebels' primary targets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A handful of A-wing interceptors from Gold Squadron were apparently on standby near the battle zone, as the Rebels had the option of calling for them to join the fight as reinforcements. Similarly, the Empire had several additional Assault Gunboats nearby that could hyperjump into the area if needed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As players can participate in the mission \"Ambush of Rebel Leader at Airam Platform\" in the computer game Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter on either the Rebel or the Imperial side, both sides have conflicting mission objectives, and victory is not essential to access the next set of missions, the battle itself is considered canon but the canon outcome is unknown."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ships listed in this article are those found in the battle Imperial Fleet Operation: Clean Sweep, using the default craft assigned to the player."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This combat engagement apparently predated both the battle Balance of Power in the Airam Sector, which is featured in the expansion pack to X-wing vs. TIE Fighter, and the campaigns Spreading the Rebellion and Imperial Task Force Vengeance, all of which largely take place in the Airam sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
