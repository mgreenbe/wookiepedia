Along with his friends, Korkie broke into the food ration warehouse, only to discover that the food shortage was a lie, fabricated in order to strengthen the black market economy on Mandalore, which had become the only source of food during the false shortage. Recording the situation on a hologram, they took the evidence to the Duchess Satine Kryze, who informed them that she would handle the issue, and that the students should not get involved."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korkie suggested they bring the evidence to Prime Minister Almec, since he considered Almec to be a more trustworthy individual. Almec arranged a meeting with the cadets to obtain the evidence of corruption, but it was a setup to arrest the students."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano was able to rescue Korkie and his friends from captivity. Performing an analysis on the hologram, Tano revealed it was Almec who was behind the dealings. After attempting to take the new evidence to Satine, they soon discovered Satine had been captured by Almec. Tano formulated a plan to present the students as prisoners to Almec in order to find Satine's location, however Almec didn't fall for their ploy. After being recaptured, Korkie and his friends were forced to wait while Tano attempted to find Satine on her own. During her search, Tano was captured by Almec, and the students were brought in to be tortured in the hopes that Satine would sign a confession for committing treason. Tano escaped from capture, and with the help of the students, she neutralized the guards and captured Almec, removing a source of corruption from the Mandalorian government."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, the Shadow Collective took over Mandalore under the leadership of Pre Vizsla and Darth Maul. Korkie, along with Amis, Soniee, Lagos, and Bo-Katan Kryze and the Nite Owls, rescued the Duchess from the Sundari prison. They were pursued by Mandalorian super commandos, but they were able to get Satine out of Sundari so that she was able to send a message for help to Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unfortunately, Satine was recaptured, but Korkie and the other students managed to escape the Mandalorian super commandos during the Battle of Sundari, but not before being knocked to the ground from a punch by one of the commandos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korkie is portrayed by voice actor Whit Hertford."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
