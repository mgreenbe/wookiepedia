She can appear on a variety of planets randomly selected during the event including Ord Mantell, Coruscant, Nal Hutta, Dromund Kaas, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine, Alderaan and Voss. The player has the option to ask her for information nicely, rudely or neutrally. In any case, she provides the location of a local crime lord's henchman. As such, her role in the game is almost entirely random or player-driven and a canonical path currently cannot be determined."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When initiating conversation, players of any gender and faction alignment can select the neutral option, which allows them to flirt with Freen.
