Cam grew up with an older brother named Lew, who at one point served the Hutt crime lord Suudaa Nem'ro in the industrial town of Jiguuna. Lew eventually left Nem'ro's gang, but Cam decided to follow in his brother's footsteps and joined the gang himself. During a fight between Nem'ro's men and those of a rival Hutt named Voontara Fa'athra, Cam lost his nerve and attempted to surrender and join Fa'athra's men. Cam, however, was captured by Nem'ro's street captain, Rex Geer, and imprisoned for his treachery. Lew hired an Imperial-aligned individual to get his brother to leave the gang, whom he believed were simply pinned down by Fa'athra's men. The individual arrived at Geer's house where Cam was imprisoned and discovered his predicament. Geer, who had previously known Lew, claimed that the younger brother was to be brought before Nem'ro and offered to pay the individual to leave the Brell to his fate. The individual agreed, much to Cam's horror, and left without him despite his protests."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, Brell lived on the planet Nal Hutta, the adopted homeworld of the Hutt species, with his elder brother, Lew Brell, who worked for a Hutt crime lord named Suudaa Nem'ro. Brell eventually left Nem'ro's gang, however, as he began to feel the work was too violent. In the year 3643 BBY, Cam decided to follow in his brother's footsteps and joined Nem'ro's gang as Lew had. Cam found himself in a fight alongside Nem'ro's men against a rival Hutt named Voontara Fa'athra in an industrial town on Hutta named Jiguuna, which Nem'ro ruled. Cam, however, lost his nerve during the fighting and attempted to surrender and join the opposing forces. Geer, who was working for Nem'ro as the captain of his street gang, caught Cam attempting to change sides and imprisoned the traitor, intending to take him before Nem'ro. Whilst Cam was imprisoned, Lew began searching for someone to help save his brother from the gang."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lew found an Imperial-aligned individual in the Poison Pit cantina in Jiguuna who was willing to help him save Cam. The individual successfully fought their way through Fa'athra's men and reached Rex Geer's house, where Rex and Cam were holding up along with three other prisoners. The individual discovered Cam within a cage in the house and asked Rex for his release. The captain instead offered the individual credits to leave Cam in his custody and tell Lew that Cam had been killed in the fighting. The individual agreed, much to Cam's horror, and left Geer's house, returning to Lew at the cantina. As the individual left, Geer taunted Cam, who cried out and pleaded with the individual not to leave."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cam Brell respected his elder brother enough to follow his career choice and join Nem'ro's gang. In the gang, however, he proved less brave than his brother as he attempted to surrender and join the opposing force during a fight with Fa'athra's thugs. When Rex Geer informed Cam that the individual Lew had sent to save him was leaving him, Cam cried out in dismay, begging the individual for mercy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cam Brell first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. In the game, Brell is located in the town of Jiguuna, on the planet Nal Hutta, the location in which players of the Bounty Hunter and Imperial Agent class start the game. Brell is involved in the quest \"Gang Warfare\", where his brother asks the player to save him. The player has a choice, upon finding Cam, to either leave him to his fate in exchange for credits (dark side), or to save him (light side). This article assumes that players chose the \"dark side\" option and left Cam, as only players of the Imperial faction, specifically Imperial Agents and Bounty Hunters, can take this mission. If the player leaves Cam, when they return to Lew they can choose to tell him the truth about leaving Cam or claim he was already dead when they arrived. Neither of these options corresponds with a specific alignment, so this article makes no assumption about which was chosen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
