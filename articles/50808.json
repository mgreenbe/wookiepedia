Frog Lady seemed able to speak only her native tongue, and unable to speak Basic.

There, she located and bathed in a natural hot spring, which allowed her to incubate her remaining eggs. The peace did not last however, as their presence eventually roused the many ice spiders in the den, including the menacingly large parents of the hatchlings. In fleeing the spiders, Frog Lady revealed a prehensile tongue, that could be used to grasp objects.
