During the Galactic War against the Galactic Republic she served as an advisor to Dark Council member Darth Arkous. Investigating Arkous' unusual activities in the wake of the Korriban Incursion, Beniko discovered that Arkous was a traitor secretly working for the Order of Revan. To expose Arkous, Beniko teamed up with unusual allies, including Republic SIS agent Theron Shan, a Wookiee smuggler named Jakarro, and other figures of importance on galactic scale. The group tracked Arkous and his Revanite ally Rian Darok to Rakata Prime, where both were killed, only for Revan himself to enter the scene and attempt to kill Beniko and her allies. Proclaimed a traitor to the Empire, Beniko was forced into hiding along with Theron Shan and Jakarro. The three eventually tracked the Revanites to Rishi and were able to expose the conspiracy to Darth Marr. To stop Revan from resurrecting Sith Emperor Vitiate, Beniko and Marr joined forces with Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan and traveled to Yavin 4, forming a temporary coalition between the Republic and the Empire. Beniko stood against Revan himself alongside Darth Marr, Satele, Theron Shan, Jakarro, and Shae Vizla. Though Revan was defeated, the Emperor nevertheless returned to life. Darth Marr appointed Beniko as the new head of the reformed Sith Intelligence. As the new Sith Intelligence Minister, Lana opposed Vitiate's resurgence on Ziost, working with her assistant Rane Kovach and her partners from the Yavin Coalition to stop the rampage caused by the former Emperor. Though Shan and Beniko were able to shock a large number of Vitiate's victims unconscious and remove Sixth Line Jedi Master Surro from the planet's surface, Vitiate still performed the ritual that wiped out all life on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, the galaxy was invaded by the Eternal Empire of Zakuul, which overwhelmed both the Republic and the Sith Empire within a single year. Sith Intelligence effectively ceased to exist, and Beniko ventured into Eternal Empire space, looking for her partner from the Revanite crisis, believing them to be the galaxy's last hope of defeating the Eternal Empire. Over five years, Beniko made multiple contacts, such as former Knight of Zakuul Senya Tirall and exiled Zakuulan naval officer Koth Vortena, with whom she eventually managed to find and free the one Zakuulans had taken to calling the Outlander from being frozen in carbonite. While escaping pursuit, Beniko's group located and repaired the Gravestone - a legendary vessel capable of opposing the might of the Eternal Fleet. Beniko called her multiple contacts from the Sith Empire, the Republic, and the criminal underworld to converge on the remote planet Odessen, where she laid the foundations of an Alliance dedicated to defeating Eternal Emperor Arcann, becoming the right hand to her old associate, who became the Alliance Commander. In a bid to remove the advantage of Arcann's Eternal Fleet, the Alliance agreed to SCORPIO's plan to remotely take control of the GEMINI captains, but SCORPIO followed her own agenda and used that opportunity to claim the Eternal Throne for herself. In the resulting battle of Odessen, Beniko accompanied the Commander to their duel with Arcann, which ended with the Emperor defeated and taken away by his mother Senya Tirall. Arcann's sister Vaylin allied herself with SCORPIO and became the new Eternal Empress, and Beniko stood by the Commander's side as they battled her forces on Voss. An attempt by Vaylin to take control of the Gravestone led to the discovery of the hidden artificial world Iokath, which Alliance forces had to temporarily abandon when it was covered in deadly radiation. Beniko assisted in the mission to sabotage the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin and accompanied the Commander on a mission to Nathema. Vaylin soon launched an assault on Odessen, in which Beniko fought on the front lines and which led to Vaylin's death at the Commander's hand. Alliance forces then traveled to Zakuul, where the Commander claimed the Eternal Throne and took control over the Eternal Fleet, transforming the Alliance from an anti-Zakuul insurgency into the Eternal Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As one of the highest-ranking members of a new galactic power, Beniko had to contend with new threats from the earliest hours of its existence. She identified and ordered the neutralization of several local uprisings against the Alliance and personally led a mission to Iokath once its radiation levels had subsided. Faced with both the Republic and the Sith Empire fighting over control of an Iokath superweapon, Beniko followed the Commander's decision to ally with the Republic. Beniko soon discovered that the War on Iokath was orchestrated by an outside party that had leaked information to all three sides, hoping to start a war between them over control of Iokath. She began to search for a traitor within the Eternal Alliance, which led to the shadow world of Umbara. Lana Beniko, Theron Shan, and the Commander traveled there to intercept the traitor, only for Theron to reveal himself as the traitor and sabotage the hovertrain the Commander and Beniko were on. Escaping the train before the crash, Beniko and the Commander were unable to stop Theron before his shuttle left Umbara. They returned to Odessen, where Beniko began to search for Theron's whereabouts. After failing to apprehend him on the Chiss world of Copero, Beniko and the Commander eventually followed Theron and the Order of Zildrog to Nathema, where Theron revealed himself to be a double agent working for the Alliance the whole time. Together, they rushed to stop Vinn Atrius from awakening Zildrog, but were too late to prevent the complete destruction of the Eternal Fleet, the Gravestone, and the Eternal Throne. Though the Alliance lost its most powerful assets, Lana ensured the Commander that she would remain at their side through whatever would come.

She trained under Overseer Harkun, who took sadistic pleasure in demeaning his acolytes. As part of her final trial, Beniko and acolytes Greck, Kagan, and Bensyn were sent into the Valley of the Dark Lords to retrieve the helm of Tulak Hord. Knowing that Harkun deemed the task impossible, Beniko told the other acolytes that they could only survive by working together. Upon entering the Tomb of Tulak Hord the group was overwhelmed by k'lor'slugs, which left Greck dead and Kagan severely wounded.

Beniko accepted the offer to become his advisor despite not being impressed with Arkous, her initial impression of him being that of a vain and pompous statesman. Her first military engagement in her new role was the Imperial invasion of Talay, a major Republic outpost and communications hub. Arkous' plan was to minimize resistance while maximizing confusion among the locals, but the Talay initiative was endangered when the Republic sent a team of Republic Strategic Information Service agents to infiltrate her ship as it departed from Dromund Kaas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meditating aboard the ship, Beniko sensed four individuals using mind-shielding techniques commonly taught to spies and confronted one of them. The interrogation revealed to her their plan to slice all possible data and then detonate a hidden explosive device from the safety of an escape pod. Beniko informed only Arkous of the danger to avoid alerting the other three spies, and the Sith managed to silently eliminate two of them. The final SIS agent had surgical enhancements that allowed her to escape Beniko when the Sith found her priming the explosive device. Beniko sounded the alarm but had to stay behind to disarm the bomb, allowing the SIS agent to reach and launch the escape pod, from which she detonated a secondary device hidden inside the ship's electrical hub. Without weapons or jamming devices, the Imperials were unable to stop the agent from broadcasting their plans to the Republic, but Darth Arkous himself put on a spacesuit and rocketed towards the pod, where a single plunge of his lightsaber was enough to decompress it and kill the agent inside.

This changed in 3637 BBY, when she assisted Darth Arkous and Lord Goh in planning the Assault on Tython's Jedi Temple. Arkous recruited a prominent Imperial figure to lead the first wave of the attack. Beniko met them on Vaiken Spacedock and remotely guided them as they progressed from the landing point in the Gnarls to the Jedi Council chamber. Lord Goh stayed behind to search for additional hidden stores, and Beniko learned that the goal of their attack was to retrieve a Rakatan artifact from the Temple. The fact that Arkous hid the true objective from her made Beniko lose her trust in him, which was only compounded by a growing presence she felt in the Force. As Arkous' associate returned, he and Lana were informed by Sergeant Tarsten about the Korriban Incursion, in which the Republic forces took the Sith Academy and killed Dark Council member Darth Soverus. Furious, Arkous ordered a retaliatory strike and Beniko again guided her new acquaintance through the Lower Wilds of Korriban, barely hiding her anger at the audacity of the Republic's invasion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Dark Council Chambers were reclaimed, Beniko again congratulated the Imperial on their service, asking them to meet in private, away from Arkous' ears. There, she confided to her new ally her suspicions regarding Arkous' motive for the attack on Tython, revealing that in her mind the simultaneous timing of the two attacks was neither coincidence nor retaliation for one another, but instead planned from the beginning. Believing that Darth Arkous was involved in a conspiracy that could threaten the entire Sith Empire, Beniko put her trust in her new ally and revealed to them that she felt a growing presence in the Force, asking them to stay alert and promising to let them know about Arkous' activities. Pretending everything was business as usual was not easy, as Beniko was concerned that the man she had once trusted was now lying to her, and she was no longer given a reason for why she was not privy to some of his activities. Eventually, her suspicions proved correct when Arkous made arrangements for a shuttle trip to Onderon, but traveled to Manaan instead.

Meanwhile, Lana met with Republic SIS agent Theron Shan, who was investigating a similar ploy on the part of Darok. Shan alerted Beniko's associate to the location of Jakarro, a Wookiee smuggler imprisoned by the Selkath geneticist Gorima. The Imperial freed the Wookiee and his droid C2-D4 and together they discovered that Gorima had received Rakata technology from Arkous and Darok, and was using it to build self-repairing cyborg warriors for an \"Infinite Army\". Arkous and Darok revealed themselves to be working together and escaped in a submarine, detonating a bomb to sink and flood the facility, though Beniko's new allies managed to make it to the surface in an emergency pod. Meeting them alongside Shan, Beniko revealed their joint discovery that Arkous and Darok were both members of the Order of Revan, once believed to be a minor cult operating on Dromund Kaas, and now seeking to destroy both Republic and Empire to establish a new order.

The Revanites were building their new Infinite Army there based on Gorima's research, and to stop them Shan and Beniko arranged for Jakarro and their other ally to assault the Temple of the Ancients, while they provided tactical intel from onboard Jakarro's XS stock light freighter. Asking Theron Shan to leave the cockpit and check the ship's sensors, Beniko asked her Imperial ally to secretly retrieve the data on the Infinite Army cyborgs from a Rakata console for further study. Jakarro and their ally confronted the Revanite leaders on the Temple roof and were forced to kill them when it became clear that they would not cooperate. It was then that the true leader of the conspiracy revealed himself to be none other than Revan, the \"growth\" in the Force that Beniko had sensed.

After their associate followed the trail of breadcrumbs left by Lana and Theron to their safe house in Raider's Cove, the duo revealed themselves and explained that they needed to manually slice the files in the Nova Blades' base of operations while avoiding drawing the Revanites to themselves, hence the masquerade to make it look like a common pirate rivalry."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Activities on Rishi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Theron and Lana sent their ally, masquerading as the faux pirate gang leader, out to harass the Nova Blades, attacking their operations and slave camps, threatening the pirates' alliance with the Revanites.

He found it intriguing, however, and acquiesed that the Sith Code never specifically called for the usurption of the master by the apprentice, just the pursuit of greater power. Lana agreed, further stating that it was only natural for the strongest to lead, but that the ultimate goal was power, not necessarily leadership, and that if one was truly strong leadership would inevitably come.

She spoke in a very serene and considerate manner, and possessed a keen mind with a preference for analyzing a problem rather than charging in head on. She was a patriot of the Sith Empire and seemed to care more about its safety than her own goals or achieving new titles. She frequently used the saying \"May the Force ever serve you (serve you well)\" when addressing people she respected. As advisor to Arkous, she felt bad when her suspicions of him turned out to be true, and even years later would remember him, wishing that Arkous could see what she had become. Her patriotism made her pragmatic enough to ally with unlikely individuals against threats to the Empire. She genuinely grew to care for her friends on both sides and would show worry when they were in danger. Unlike many other Sith, Beniko held no disdain for non-Humans, people without Force-sensitivity, and even loyal citizens of the Galactic Republic; neither did she have the urge to remind them of their place. Her outward appearance showed little to no effect of Dark Side corruption apart from yellow eye irises, and she possessed a healthy sense of humor, free from the sadistic tendencies typical of Sith. She easily fit in with unlikely companions for weeks, and it took the combined force of an extremely stressful situation and constant annoyance to get her to even raise her voice in a situation most Sith would choose to settle with either a Force-choke or their lightsaber. Despite all this, Beniko was able to make hard decisions and remained a loyal Imperial even after she was branded a traitor, and refused an offer to defect to the Republic. Beniko sincerely regretted when Theron lost his trust in her after Rishi, and she parted with him on good terms though she was already prepared to made his life difficult in her new role at Sith Intelligence. Her calm outward demeanor was also contrasted by her prowess in combat, and she had no qualms about using Force lightning against Revan during the fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The stress of her new post as Sith Intelligence Minister combined with the power Vitiate displayed on Ziost took a toll on Lana, visibly wearing her out. She put her trust in Rane Kovach and when his betrayal was revealed to her, immediately ordered his death. Though Theron still mistrusted her, she had no problem working with him to stop Vitiate. She became angry when he refused to let her experiment on Master Surro, though only because she believed sacrificing the Jedi's life could help save the entire galaxy from annihilation by Vitiate. Despite being a patriot, she abandoned the Sith Empire after the Zakuul\u2013Imperial treaty and went to search for her old ally in Wild Space, believing from their past efforts that they were the only person capable of stopping Arcann. She made multiple friends and contacts during her years in Zakuulan space, enough that when called upon quite a few showed up to start the Anti-Zakuulan Alliance. Lana worked alongside Koth Vortena for years, growing to genuinely like and trust him. Although not violent or cruel by nature, she was prepared to sacrifice the innocent when she believed the fate of the entire galaxy at risk, at evidenced by her desire to experiment on Master Surro and to let the Sun Generator on Zakuul explode to cover their escape. Despite leaving the Sith Empire behind, she still thought of herself as Sith, taunting the Zakuulan Knight Tanek that the Knights were never taught to properly channel their anger like she was. After becoming the master of HK-55, Beniko had become quite attached to the bodyguard droid and when SCORPIO insensitively labeled the HK-series droid inferior, she threatened to deactivate her.

Putting her trust in the Commander, Beniko expected trust in return and did not take lightly to being lied to. Protective of the Commander, she promised to tear the Scion Sanctuary apart should something happen to them and was extremely worried when the Commander was trapped in the Odessen wilderness by Valkorion. When the Commander took harsh actions against traitors, Lana always stood by their side, even if she had brought the people in question in to begin with. She tolerated ruthless decisions only if they were pragmatic, and was quick to point out when mindless violence only led to more problems down the line. Lana was furious at Theron's supposed betrayal on Umbara and blamed herself for being unable to foresee it, vowing to use all of her efforts to hunt him down and make him pay. Despite this, she was able to overcome her anger and work with him again, after Theron revealed himself to be a double agent who had had Alliance interests in mind the whole time. Lana was extremely loyal to her ally from the Revanite crisis who later became the Alliance Commander, spending five years searching for them in Wild Space and following them through whatever hardships fell upon them, to the point where she stopped associating herself with the Sith Empire and had no desire to visit her homeworld of Dromund Kaas again, a far cry from her previous devotion.
