The singer, who was billed as Chanteuse of the Stars, was in high demand and frequently toured, which made it rare for her to settle in one place for too long. However, Dryden Vos was able to book her for an extended residency on his yacht by offering her a large sum of money. While performing on Vos' ship, she was paired with classic supper-club singer Luleo Primoc. Ventafoli used a multi-vocoder to boost her voice to non-human frequencies and performed in a corded auropyle dress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aurodia Ventafoli was portrayed by Sema-Tawi Smart (on-camera) and Baraka May (singing voice) in the 2018 Star Wars Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story.
