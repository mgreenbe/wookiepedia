The two groups targeted three prison camps on the Solleu River. After Bravo Flight destroyed the defensive turrets on the camps with their starfighters, the three Rescue Boats of Rescue Flight each proceeded to a different camp. After loading up all the prisoners, Rescue Flight regrouped and, with Rescue Leader going first, proceeded down the Solleu. Under continued cover from Bravo Flight, Rescue Flight made it to the Europa Islands where they rendezvoused with the Mercatan. All of the Rescue Boats were able to transfer all of their passengers to the Mercatan, which then took off to take the civilians to a safer location."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
