Gryph created the recording in order to preserve his memoirs, although he twisted some of the details in order to enhance his contributions to the events he encountered. Zayne Carrick saw the opportunity to use it as a part of his plan to help clean up his name from an accusation in the Padawan Massacre of Taris. Alek Squinquargesimus and Shel Jelavan sent the hologram to Vandar Tokare, the only member of the Jedi Council Zayne could trust, to enlighten him on the events that really happened on Jebble. Vandar was convinced and decided to meet Squinquargesimus and Jelavan in person."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hologram eventually ended up in a cache of artifacts, mostly containing gems and precious metals, on the planet of Muunilinst. It attracted the attention of historian Fane Peturri as he used the hologram to research Dreypa's Oubliette and the Muur Talisman. Upon obtaining the previous two items in 19 BBY, Peturri showed a segment of the hologram to Sith Lord Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
