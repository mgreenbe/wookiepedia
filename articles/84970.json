His exploits on the frontline served as a reminder of his reputation as a renowned Jedi warrior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the war drew to a close, Windu became increasingly suspicious of the chancellor's motives, as Palpatine had amassed near-dictatorial control over the Galactic Senate, and sensed the rising power of the dark side in the galaxy. His suspicions were confirmed when Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight and the Chosen One of ancient prophecy, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith who manipulated the Republic and the Separatist Alliance into war. Windu, along with Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin, confronted Palpatine with the intention of arresting him. Instead, the Dark Lord attacked them, striking them down one by one until only Windu was left. Windu bested Palpatine in the confrontation and\u2014deciding the chancellor was too dangerous to be left alive due to his influence over the government\u2014prepared to strike him down, but the intervention of Anakin Skywalker, who saved the chancellor's life, led to Windu's death.

Through propaganda, the Empire portrayed Windu as the leader of a criminal gang of Jedi who caused the outbreak of the Clone Wars. In spite of the propaganda, some of Windu's actions were remembered with fondness; General Cham Syndulla, who served alongside Windu during the Battle of Ryloth, remembered Windu with great respect and told the tale of how Windu helped him liberate Ryloth during the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mace Windu was born on the planet Haruun Kal approximately fifty years before the Clone Wars.

During Windu's apprenticeship, a man named Drooz had taken residence in a Jedi outreach temple on the planet Mathas. With the local populace suffering from the effects of the Niffin plague, Drooz convinced the people that he was a Jedi prophet who could heal the sick and the dying in return for their faith and servitude. Upon receiving reports of Drooz's activities, the Order dispatched Myr to assess and apprehend him. At the same time, Myr sought to teach Windu how to channel his frustrations into an appropriate emotion and therefore brought him to Mathas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they made their way to the temple, Windu observed the people's situation and pondered on what the Jedi could do to alleviate their suffering. He also denounced Drooz as a heretic and swindler who perverted the Jedi doctrine in order to take advantage of the people's misery. At that point his Master cautioned him to suppress his hostile feelings, having noticed how the thought of Drooz using the Jedi's teachings to prey on others frustrated Windu.

Using the distraction they created, he tried to escape from the temple but was pursued by Windu. Although Drooz's Gamorrean bodyguards were defeated by the Padawan, Drooz managed to injure Windu's left arm with his blaster pistol. He taunted Windu and mocked the Jedi's ways, sneering at their commitment to peace as he believed they should use their power to gain wealth through the faith of millions. Using the Force to immobilize Drooz, Windu disarmed him and vowed that he would never hurt anyone else. However, Myr intervened by ordering Windu to lower his lightsaber.

As one of the most distinctive members of the Order, Windu crafted a new lightsaber which\u2014in addition to its specially designed handgrip and electrum finish, indicating his status as a member of the High Council\u2014also emitted a plasma blade of amethyst, making it one of the most distinctive Jedi weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one of his missions, Windu rescued Depa Billaba from pirates and brought her to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant where he trained her to become a Jedi Knight.

Nevertheless, Windu assured them that the full resources of the Order would be utilized to verify the truth of Jinn's claims\u2014and more specifically, the identity of the dark warrior who attacked him on Tatooine. It was then that Jinn revealed another significant discovery that he made during the course of his mission. Prior to his departure from Tatooine and subsequent return to Coruscant, Jinn encountered Anakin Skywalker.

Although Skywalker possessed the highest concentration of midi-chlorians in his cells, Windu was skeptical of Jinn's claims, but nonetheless agreed to meet the boy in the Council's chamber where they would evaluate his aptitude with the Force. The Council was impressed by Skywalker's ability to use the Force without any formal training, but they also sensed his emotional attachment to his mother and a great amount of fear within him.

During the funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn, Yoda and Windu realized that Jinn had been correct; the Sith had indeed survived and endured over the last millennium. Yoda quoted the Rule of Two, an ancient Sith philosophy that limited their ranks to two Sith Lords\u2014a master and an apprentice\u2014causing Windu to ponder over which of the two was defeated by Kenobi.

After mentioning that Skywalker's training was an extremely difficult task for Kenobi, Windu politely declined the chancellor's offer to help guide the young Jedi. However, Palpatine claimed that as the Jedi were under the jurisdiction of the Senate, by extension they also reported to the Senate's chancellor.

Yoda concurred with Kenobi, but also felt that Skywalker was not an isolated case. In his assessment, other Jedi had grown overconfident in their skills as well.

During a meeting with the chancellor, she revealed to Windu and Yoda her suspicion that Count Dooku was involved in the attack. Although Dooku had renounced his Jedi status before becoming the leader of the Separatist movement, Windu refused to believe that even a former Jedi could be involved in a plot to assassinate the Naboo senator\u2014or anyone for that matter. Nevertheless, Windu heeded Yoda and Palpatine's warning that Amidala's life was in grave danger, regardless of whether Dooku was personally involved or not. As such, he dispatched Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to serve as temporary bodyguards for the senator. After the death of Amidala's would-be assassin, Zam Wesell, Windu and the Council instructed Kenobi to track Wesell's accomplice who evaded capture.

During the fight, Windu swiftly killed Jango Fett with relative ease, decapitating the bounty hunter, as Boba Fett\u2014a clone whom Jango regarded as a son\u2014watched in horror. Overwhelmed by the droids' superior numbers, the Jedi were cornered into the center of the Geonosian Petranaki Arena.

Reporting directly to Windu, Clone Commander CT-411 \"Ponds\" and five special commando units accompanied the legendary Jedi champion to the forefront of the battle. Windu kept Ponds by his side during the rest of the battle. Under the Jedi's leadership, the clone army forced the Separatists into full retreat, abandoning Geonosis to Republic occupation. Windu returned to the capital, content that the first battle resulted in a Republic victory, but was also morose over the failure to capture Dooku.

Windu nonetheless recommended that the Council maintain a watchful eye on the Senate, having never trusted the highly corrupt government in the first place.

Seeking to ascertain the purpose of the Separatist presence on the planet Hissrich, the Council assigned the task to Windu. However, because of the mission's covert purpose and the Republic's thinly spread resources, they were unable to provide him with a squadron of clone troopers.

Skywalker reacted with anger to the Council's decision to withhold the status of Jedi Master from him, but was quickly put in his place by Windu. At this time, the Council grew doubtful that Palpatine would surrender his wartime powers. As such, Windu agreed that the Chancellor would have to be removed by force and further added that the Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to maintain peace during the transitional period. Shortly after, Ahsoka Tano, alongside the recently-promoted Commander Rex, reported a successful capture of Maul during the Siege of Mandalore. Tano requested to speak with Skywalker, but was refused due to Skywalker's task with the Chancellor. Upon learning that Kenobi had located and engaged General Grievous, Tano believed that the war could be over soon, but Windu noted that the war's conclusion depended on Palpatine.
