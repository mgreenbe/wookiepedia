By the end of the Clone Wars, which had been manipulated by Darth Sidious from both sides, the Separatists were in disarray following the death of their political leader, the Sith Lord Count Dooku, and the death of the cyborg Supreme Commander of the Droid Army, General Grievous. The surviving Separatist council members, led by Gunray, sought protection on Mustafar, where they and Gunray were killed by Darth Vader at the behest of Darth Sidious.

Gunray questioned the legality of such an action, but Sidious quickly silence his concerns by telling the Viceroy that he would \"make it legal\" in the Galactic Senate. Under Gunray's orders, the emissary's ship Radiant VII was destroyed and poison gas was released into the reception room hosting the two Jedi. Gunray also dispatched a group of security battle droids to finish off the Jedi.

The diminished Trade Federation naval presence enabled Queen Amidala, her entourage, her Jedi allies, and Binks to land their starship on Naboo. Queen Amidala managed to rally the Naboo resistance and to forge an alliance with the Gungan leader Boss Rugor Nass. Seeking to drive out the Trade Federation, Amidala devised a three-pronged battle plan which involved the Gungan Grand Army marching on Theed to draw away the droid army.
