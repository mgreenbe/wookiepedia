At some point, she was photographed with both of her parents on Batuu. Around ten years prior to the start of the First Order/Resistance War, she and her mother attended a race that her father and her uncle Marcus Speedstar were participating in. In an attempt to beat his older brother, Speedstar used heavy amounts of coaxium to fuel his ship. During the race, the coaxium-fueled ship combusted and crashed, killing Yeager's daughter and wife in the process. This incident led to Yeager and Speedstar becoming estranged for over ten years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
