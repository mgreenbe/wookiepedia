A group of Spice Runners, including the Klatooinian Vigilch, sought refuge from New Republic starships on Yungbrii, and became cornered in the Trune family farm. The Spice Runners used the farm's residents as living shields, and eventually escaped aboard a stolen vessel. The gunfight between the Spice Runners and the New Republic cost lives on both sides, and resulted in the deaths of the family of Sela Trune. The Spice Runners would steal a ship and use it to escape the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
