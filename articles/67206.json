Although the first five\u2014Nipaltoo, Orvek, Rebb, Stell and Daren\u2014 were swayed to pursue revenge against the Empire, the sixth, Verla was force-sensitive and so Barr swore to teach her.

Barr began influencing the negotiations between the Mon Cala and the Empire. This caught the attention of Palpatine, who suspected the negotiating to be of Jedi technique. Being just one year into the Empire's reign, Palpatine wanted to show the galaxy his iron fist and decided that silencing Mon Cala's defiance would make it a great example for this. Palpatine told Darth Vader to investigate the possible Jedi presence on Mon Cala and left the military aspects to Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who parked his Imperial-class Star Destroyer, the Sovereign, above Mon Cala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard the Sovereign Tarkin briefed his top military officers on how they would invade Mon Cala if one became necessary to them. He then discussed the readiness of Major Rantu's troops and a possible military opportunities for their invasion with Commander Jordo.

Meanwhile, on Mon Cala, the Imperial ambassador Telvar was negotiating with Lee-Char and his subjects. When asked the king if Mon Cala wished to remain in the Empire, Lee-Char argued that his proposed trade deal would allow the Empire to strip the planet of its exports.

Vader and his group turned on the Mon Calamari and began fighting them on the landing pad, soon liberating it from the defending Mon Calamari and Quarren. The Ninth Sister asked Vader where they were going next and Vader directed the three towards the palace. Inside the palace, Lee-Char assigned Ackbar and Raddus to the defense of each hemisphere and they left the king to do their duties. Lee-Char then attempted to negotiate a ceasefire with Tarkin, but the man refused, stating that the fact an Imperial asset had been killed in the hands of the Mon Calamari meant that Lee-Char had to stand down first."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time, Barr announced the arrival of \"Anakin Skywalker\" to his disciples. Barr claimed he was at the center of Order 66, the Chosen One. Barr had his R1-series astromech droid Endee show a file on Skywalker and showed his disciples what he knew of the man, eventually presenting the image of Skywalker leading the Siege of the Jedi Temple. Barr told the disciples that Skywalker was a pivotal aspect of Order 66, being responsible for the deaths of many young Jedi. Furthermore, Barr explained that Skywalker now took the name Darth Vader and how he hunted the surviving Jedi with the Inquisitors. After this, Barr contacted Lee-Char, who asked him of whether they should give in to Tarkin's demands. Barr claimed the Empire would never leave and told him to take drastic action."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader and the Inquisitors arrived inside the palace and the Ninth Sister began interrogating Lee-Char for the location of Barr.

There he saved himself from the ocean by making himself an air bubble with the force. Vader was then attacked by a squid-like creature which he killed by using the force.

Her campaign, however, was cut short when Ackbar attacked her base with over half a dozen aquatic vehicles. They emerged from under Bergon's sky-base and fired their missiles at it. Before Bergon could respond, she was incinerated as her platform exploded. By this time, the Sovereign had been joined by two more Star Destroyers above Mon Cala.

Endee blew up the refuge once they left on their aquatic machines. However, upon leaving the refuge, the disciples were cut off by Vader's submarine. Nipaltoo attacked Vader's submarine but Vader crushed his helmet, killing him. The others made towards Bel City, and Orvek turned around to slow Vader down. Eventually they made it to Bel City and Rebb decided to stay behind in order to slow Vader down even more. Stell pledged to stay with her, and Barr and his final two disciples made for a landing pad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on the Sovereign, Tarkin received word from his Lieutenant that the Imperial forces were succeeding in their engagements below. However Tarkin was worried that there were too many engagements. He had noticed that the Mon Calamari and Quarren defenders were either holing up in their underwater cities and forcing the Imperial forces to fight them corridor to corridor in unfamiliar territory; or were scattering to the far reaches of the oceans in order for the Imperial forces to split up to hunt them down, requiring constant resupply. As Tarkin explained this to his Lieutenant, Raddus emerged from hiding with his own strategy. Raddus had taken vessels from the Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet and linked them together. With their strong shields combined, the five Star Cruisers and the many smaller ships connected to them generated a protective bubble around them able to repel the Imperial forces without receiving a single dent. Tarkin considered it a fortress."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Pursuit in Bel City"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader and the Inquisitors reached Bel City and marched through it with the Purge troopers at their rear.

Barr and his last two acolytes reach a landing pad to find it empty. As Barr stressed about their situation, the Inquisitors had already found them. Sixth Brother threw his lightsaber and cut Daren in half. They then cornered Barr and Verla. Verla attempted to confront the Inquisitors but Barr already had a plan stepped in first, dropped his lightsaber to the floor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a following exchange of words, Barr used his knowledge of the Inquisitors' past to claim that they were still truly Jedi, despite their protest at this.

The troopers opened fire, shooting down the Tenth Brother in the process. Barr and Verla took advantage of the fighting and they leapt over the firefight, landing and escaping on the other side. As the two sprinted down the hallway, Barr parted with Verla, telling her to leave Mon Cala and find another surviving Jedi. The Sixth Brother and Ninth Sister force pushed the other troopers to the side to make way for them.

Lee-Char recalled one of Barr's prophesies in shame. Barr told Lee-Char that he wasn't wrong about that and explained that the Mon Calamari vessels would be at the forefront of a great rebellion.

They found him barely alive and on life support. They recorded a message from him to his people and stormtroopers intervened, killing Lee-Char.
