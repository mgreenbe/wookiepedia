It had been an ongoing problem and the local populations were falling to dangerous levels by the time that he learned of Snee-Roos, an offworld tourist, who recorded a killing of a gronda. He hired an individual to retrieve the holorecording from the tourist and bring it to him. Though Gilker thought this would stop the poaching, he later located a secret Black Sun base who he thought were in fact responsible for the poaching. He once again hired the previous individual, this time to take out the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gilker Budz appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
