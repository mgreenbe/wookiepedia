It was considered a 'sacred ground' by the Grumani Hierophants, a religious sect operating in the Grumani sector. It contained a cave which led to an underground lake and a large temple which contained the Helm of Ieldis, a Sith relic created by Lord Ieldis prior to the Great Hyperspace War. During the Invasion of Sarrassia in the New Sith Wars, the hill was assaulted by Odionate Sith forces under General Beld Yulan who slaughtered the Grumani defenders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
