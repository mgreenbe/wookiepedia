The store owners agree to take a look at the droid, and Orka drags a reluctant R4 behind the counter to have a look, while Hype, worried, hopes his droid isn't damaged. R4 refuses to be worked on, however, and deploys a spark projector, fighting back against Flix and Orka. As Hype panics at the counter and the store is thrown into disarray, Orka manages to jump atop R4 and subdue the droid. Flix points out that that wasn't so hard, and Orka, exhausted, sardonically agrees before slumping to the floor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
