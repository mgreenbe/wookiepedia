Some weeks after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, it began serving the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing along with two other cruiser-carriers. However, after the New Republic carried out a devastating attack on the 204th at its stronghold in the Pandem Nai system, the Allegiance and fellow Quasar Fire-class cruiser carrier Aerie escaped with much of the fighter wing's personnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 5 ABY, the Allegiance assisted in the 204th's mission at the planet Jarbanov, picking up the 204th's Squadron Four on the far side of Jarbanov's moon and escaping into hyperspace. Shortly after, the 204th captured the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Edict from the New Republic in the Pormthulis system.

Some weeks after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, it was one of three Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carriers acquired by Colonel Shakara Nuress after her unit, the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, occupied the planet Pandem Nai to use as its base of operations. The cruiser-carriers were used to transport select TIE squadrons from the 204th to carry out missions to stop the New Republic's reconnaissance efforts. However, the 204th's base soon came under attack from a New Republic battle group. The Allegiance and the Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier Aerie were forced to flee the system with many of the 204th's personnel after the fighter wing suffered a number of losses, including Nuress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Pandem Nai, the 204th fell under the command of special advisor Major Soran Keize. Around 5 ABY, the fighter wing traveled to the barren world Jarbanov, home to a colony which processed junk from the planet's orbitting junk rings. The 204th's Squadron Four attacked the colony while the Aerie salvaged wreckage from the junk rings. Meanwhile, the Allegiance awaited at the far side of Jarbanov's moon. As planned, Squadron Four rendezvoused with the cruiser-carrier, which escaped into hyperspace immediately after. Following the operation, the Allegiance's captain, Rogart Styll, attended a meeting with Keize, the 204th's six squadron commanders and the acting commander of the Aerie to discuss their mission outcome and the fighter wing's next course of action."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short while later, the 204th captured the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Edict from New Republic occupation in the Pormthulis system. The Edict lacked a working hyperdrive or the resources to repair it, so Keize decided that the Allegiance would be sacrificed to fulfill this need. The decision came without question, and the cruiser-carrier's engine was disabled and disassembled to repair the Edict, the parts being guided down the zero-gravity corridors and out of the vessel through the hangar to reach the Star Destroyer's maw. The repairs took within six hours, and Keize had the 204th's Squadron Three strip apart the Allegiance after. Styll objected to the obliteration of his cruiser-carrier, but his sentiment was overridden."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Edict and Aerie exited into hyperspace from the Pormthulis system following the Allegiance's destruction. Styll, having lost his cruiser-carrier, was given command of the Edict. Keize held a celebration to welcome the remaining crew of the Edict into the 204th, which ended up with him and the crew of the Allegiance, Edict and Aerie. The major advised the crewmembers to tell stories of the Allegiance and the astronomical object Andara, which had reportedly fallen from Imperial control to New Republic hands. One of the late Allegiance's crew told a story of repairing a power conduit during the attack on Pandem Nai."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keize soon proposed a new mission to the squadron commanders and senior staff of the Aerie and Edict: an intervention with the New Republic's invasion of the Cerberon system.
