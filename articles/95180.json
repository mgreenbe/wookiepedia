She was imprisoned in the Chamber of Banishment; however, at some point she escaped along with her pet rancor Gorvo. She hungered for revenge against the Singing Mountain Clan and especially against its Arch Witch, Azzenaj. She began informing the occasional encounters of her intentions, and soon a spacer came to her looking to perform the job. Nandina instructed him to go to the Singing Mountain village and kill Azzenaj, promising him a rich reward for killing the witch she long hated. The next day, the spacer returned and presented a piece of Azzenaj's jewelry as the proof of the job done."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nandina appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
