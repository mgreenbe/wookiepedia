LG3-18 was programmed to lead incoming starships to public landing platforms. When the droid's sensors picked up the HWK-290 light freighter Moldy Crow in 5 ABY, the droid contacted the pilot Jan Ors and, after introducing itself, provided Ors a landing vector, which Ors agreed to follow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LG3-18 was introduced in the 1998 Dark Forces: Rebel Agent audio drama, which was based on the novella of the same name written by William C. Dietz, a story in which LG3-18 did not appear in. The droid's voice actor was uncredited. As LG3-18's name was only spoken in the audio drama, the spelling of the droid's name in this article is conjectural."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
