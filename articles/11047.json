The Chimaera then arrived at Lansend while it was under attack and helped defeat the rebel attackers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Chimaera traveled to the planet Botajef in order to confront its Governor Quesl, who had declared that the world was seceding from the Empire, Thrawn had the major and his men standby ready for battle before arriving. There proved to be little need however, as Thrawn realised that the secession was simply a cover created by Quesl to allow him to steal a collection of valuable art work onboard a CR90 corvette.

The communication instructed Ayer to lead a squad of his men onto the transport; which had been carrying Wookiee slaves, but to not inform his colleagues on board the Star Destroyer of the nature of the transport's passengers. Ayer then met with Thrawn, Senior communications officer Lomar and First Officer Karyn Faro on the Chimaera's bridge to inform them of his instructions to board the Sempre."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As he spoke to the group, Lieutenant Commander Eli Vanto approached and Thrawn explained the situation to him. Vanto guessed the rebels were aiming to kill the troopers on board the Sempre, at which point Thrawn prompted Ayer to explain that there were no troops onboard.

With the need for secrecy over, Ayer reluctantly permitted Thrawn and Vanto onboard the Sempre but tasked his men with keeping them out of the slaves' quarters. Despite this, Thrawn ordered his way inside and quickly deduced that the room had been altered to accommodate slaves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After learning that the slaves were Wookiees from the Sempre's audio logs, Thrawn worked out that the transport had originated from the Imperial base Lansend Twenty-Six.

The governor hoped that the destruction of the palace would lead most to assume that he and the art had been destroyed, allowing them to escape onboard a CR90 corvette, but Thrawn saw through the ruse and had the corvette pulled aboard the Chimaera by tractor beam without destroying the palace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When informing his superiors onboard the Chimaera that he was not able to provide more information about the Sempre, Ayer was apologetic and seemed particularly uncomfortable when looking at Thrawn.
