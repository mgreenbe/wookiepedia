Reverse-engineered from a BlasTech design, the E-5 was adapted for use by B1-series battle droids and BX-series droid commandos, who used it throughout the Clone Wars, making it the most common weapon of the Separatists. The blaster generated excessive heat, which made it uncomfortable for organics to use but was more than adequate for a battle droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Clone Wars, a police droid model that resembled the BX-series commando droid also used the E-5. These police droids wielded E-5s while patrolling a decommissioning facility in Coronet City on the world of Corellia. Additionally, many E-5s and their B1 owners were set to be melted down in the facility, although a number of the droids were reactivated during an infiltration. Many reactivated B1s again wielded E-5 blaster rifles, using them to fire upon the police droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
