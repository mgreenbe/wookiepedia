By 1032 BBY, the Sith Lord Daiman has established a princedom known as the Daimanate within the Grumani sector. The Jedi Master Vannar Treece launches Operation Influx, a hit-and-run raid with the intention of disrupting the export of baradium from Chelloa. The Jedi infiltrate Jenith Spaceport in a cargo liner, quickly killing and immobilizing the Daimanate Sith troopers guarding the port facilities. During the fighting, the main protagonist Jedi Knight Kerra Holt saves Gorlan Palladane, a Chelloan resistance leader from being killed by two of Daiman's henchmen. The Jedi task force are subsequently welcomed as liberators by the local population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, differences quickly emerge between Vannar and Gorlan. Vannar had intended to launch a hit and run raid to disrupt the distribution of baradium, a volatile compound used in munitions. In contrast, Gorlan had envisaged an invasion to drive out the Sith. As a compromise, the Jedi agree to evacuate some of the civilians. However, this victory is interrupted by the arrival of another invasion force led by Daiman's rival and estranged older brother, Sith Lord Odion. Odion's forces engage the Jedi while Gorlan evacuates the civilians onto a cargo liner. During the subsequent fighting, all the Jedi with the exception of Kerra are killed when Odion uses his kinetic corruptor to ignite the underground baradium shales, generating volcanic activity. Kerra is saved and given refuge by Gorlan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
