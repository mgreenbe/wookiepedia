Their services also included appraisal of precious stones harvested on newly catalogued worlds, and they would pay top prices for what they sought. Both were present in the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata on the planet Takodana when the smuggler Han Solo arrived with the scavenger Rey, the former stormtrooper Finn and the astromech droid BB-8. Soon after the groups arrival, many of the establishment's occupants rushed outside to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon. The castle itself was soon attacked and destroyed by the forces of the First Order. Munduri had blue skin and sensitive eyes that required protective goggles while the gemologist was on Takodana."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Munduri first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in North America on December 18, 2015.
