Indeed, her family had already made ties with the Order, the Force running strong through her bloodline; renowned Jedi Master and diplomat Adi Gallia was the cousin of Stass Allie. A student of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Allie ascended to the rank of Jedi Knight after constructing a green-bladed lightsaber for her own use and passing her Trials of Knighthood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Knight, Jedi Allie began independent studies in the ways of the Jedi Consular. Following in her cousin's footsteps, Allie trained rigorously in the art of diplomacy, becoming a top adviser to many high ranking officials in the Galactic Senate. Additionally, Allie chose to pursue a specialization in healing, a technique she perfected, eventually earning herself a seat on the Circle of Jedi Healers. During this time, the Republic was undergoing a massive Separatist Crisis, pushing her diplomatic skills to the limit. Dispatched by the Jedi High Council, Allie served alongside Jedi Tassida Judrelle and Quarmall as the three overthrew the salt cartel of Lojrak Shrag based on Cona."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the attempted assassination of Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala put the Order on edge, the High Council received word that Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Senator Amidala had been captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems leadership on Geonosis and sentenced to death. Responding to Master of the Order Mace Windu's call to action, Jedi Allie accompanied Master Windu's task force to rescue their fellow Jedi and the Senator. Landing on the dusty plains of Geonosis, Allie entered the Petranaki arena and alongside her fellow Jedi, fought against the Separatist Droid Army. As many of her friends and mentors died around her, Jedi Allie remained calm and stood with the survivors in the center of the arena as Count Dooku prepared to have them all slaughtered. Just as the outcome looked bleakest, Grand Master Yoda arrived from the sky with several gunships of the Grand Army of the Republic. Making a perimeter around the survivors, the gunships landed swiftly and the Jedi boarded them. Alongside herself, Stass Allie escaped in a ship with Masters Shaak Ti, Luminara Unduli, Saesee Tiin, Agen Kolar, Plo Koon and Roth-Del Masona. Flying out of the arena, Allie would lead clone troopers in the first battle of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the war effort moved into high gear, Jedi Allie found herself on far flung worlds leading troops against droids, as she had accepted the role of General in the Grand Army. Leading valiantly, Allie continued to perfect her healing abilities, taking on Padawan Barriss Offee as an acolyte, teaching her the ways of Force healing while Offee continued to study under Master Luminara Unduli. Allie had been promoted to the rank of Jedi Master by the time of the Battle of Boz Pity, a costly battle on a graveyard world."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Council member"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of the demise of Allie's cousin, Jedi Master Adi Gallia, a seat was left vacant on the High Council. Not long after the aged diplomat's passing, the surviving members of the august body voted to give Master Allie membership due to her invaluable role as a Jedi Consular, an offer she accepted. In the months that followed, Master Allie continued to serve as a general, but found herself stationed on Coruscant more frequently. Indeed, Allie was at the Jedi Temple when General Grievous' flagship, the Invisible Hand appeared over Coruscant with a major invasion force. Accompanying Master Shaak Ti, Allie rushed to the Senate District to find the Supreme Chancellor and escort him to a secure bunker. Unable to find him at his executive building suite, the pair rushed over to the Senate Building where they asked Senators Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and Vice Chair Mas Amedda about Palpatine's location. While none of them knew his exact location, Allie and Ti ordered the group to get to the bunkers, with Allie offering her airspeeder to the group to get to safety."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving at 500 Republica, Allie and Ti were successful at locating Chancellor Palpatine. Palpatine, stubborn to leave despite the pleadings of his trusted aides and security forces, was arguing with the Jedi's demands to leave with them when Grievous himself crashed through the panoramic window in the office. Grabbing the Chancellor, Ti and Allie rushed him out of the building and, after a tiresome chase through the city, the two Jedi left the Chancellor in the care of Jedi Foul Moudama, Roron Corobb, Roth-Del Masona, and B'ink Utrila. Standing at the entrance to the underground bunker, Allie and Ti awaited the attack that was inevitable. Grievous attacked fast and furiously, his MagnaGuards hitting the landing platform with rockets that incapacitated Allie while Ti stood her ground. Despite the Togruta's ability to keep the guards at bay, she failed to see Grievous slip past and down into the bunker, until it was too late. With Allie rendered unconscious, Ti rushed alone to the bunker, which she found filled with four dead Jedi and no Chancellor. She managed to catch up with Grievous and Palpatine, but was subdued by the cyborg. Returning to the surface in defeat, she found Master Allie being tended to by Masters Windu and Kit Fisto. The Jedi returned to the Temple, defeated; Master Ti and Master Allie rested in the Halls of Healing, not partaking in one High Council meeting in the immediate aftermath of the battle."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Order 66"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having made a full recovery in the days following the attack on Coruscant, Master Allie prepared to leave Coruscant on a mission that would bring reinforcements to Felucia to aid Master Aayla Secura and Jedi Barriss Offee in the struggle there. As she prepared to board her transport, Allie was halted by Jedi Anakin Skywalker, recently elected Knight to the High Council, who informed her that she had been reassigned to lead clean-up operations on Saleucami, a planet which had been fought over for some time. With Master Vos moving to Boz Pity, it was up to Master Allie to see the recovery of all valuable intelligence and machinery from the battlefield."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving on Saleucami, Master Allie joined the 91st Mobile Reconnaissance Corps members Clone Commander Neyo and his wingman, CT-3423 in patrolling the bleak battle-ridden landscape of the world on BARC speeders. As they traveled along a small stream, Commander Neyo received an executive order from Coruscant. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, unbeknownst to any within the Grand Army, was the alter-ego of the mysterious Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. Sidious, in his persona as Chancellor, issued Contingency Order 66 across the galaxy, demanding the immediate execution of all Jedi, branding them as traitors. As Master Allie continued her flight unaware, Neyo and his wingman backed off and opened fire on their general, obeying their orders without questions. As her speeder bike was struck by the blasterfire, Master Stass Allie was killed instantly as the explosion tossed her corpse into the grasses of the dreary planet."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Jedi were slaughtered across the stars, both the Republic and the Jedi Order were disbanded, replaced with the Sith-run Galactic Empire. In order to cast the Jedi in a bad light, Emperor Palpatine ordered his aide, Sate Pestage, to compile an official piece of propaganda which detailed the Empire's version of events. The public was made aware by these reports that Master Stass Allie, devoted healer and well-known political adviser, was executed while heading to a rendezvous point arranged by Separatist terrorists to aid in a plot against the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years after her death, the Aleena Jedi, Kazdan Paratus, had erected a massive replica of the Jedi Temple on the junk world of Raxus Prime. Inside a cobbled together replica of the High Council Tower, the insane Paratus had built a junk puppet of Master Allie, reenacting Council meetings in his solitude. Paratus' pitiful existence was ended however when Sith apprentice Starkiller raided the compound, killing the unhinged Jedi and beheading the Allie puppet in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A tall, slender woman, Stass Allie was devoted to the art of healing and diplomacy, following in the footsteps of her cousin Jedi Master Adi Gallia. Described as clever and valiant by her fellow Council members, Stass Allie was extremely loyal to the Jedi and the Republic. Despite her Jedi heritage, Allie researched her native people of Tholoth and, like her cousin, she adorned her head with a traditional Tholoth headdress. While she preferred diplomacy when at all possible, Allie conceded her belief that in many cases peace could only be achieved through battle.  Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker considered her a friend and personally thanked her for saving Padme Amidala's life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all Jedi, Master Stass Allie was educated in the ways of lightsaber combat, becoming proficient enough to withstand the mass volume of blaster bolts flying her way during the opening battle of the Clone Wars. A wise and powerful healer, Allie sat on the Circle of Jedi Healers, overseeing the work done by the Medical Corps. Her knowledge of the Force and her diplomatic ties were considered so valuable that she was given a seat on the High Council of the Jedi Order during a time of war and chaos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The creation of the character of Stass Allie is in many ways a retcon which took place prior to the release of any Attack of the Clones products. It was the filmmaker's intentions to use the majority of Jedi High Council members in the film's climatic Battle of Geonosis; however, as the majority of the film was being shot in Australia instead of England, local model Lily Nyamwasa replaced Gin Clarke who portrayed Adi Gallia in the first film. Nyamwasa filmed all of the battle scenes as well as the scene in Palpatine's office wearing Gallia's costume. However, similarly with the case of Eeth Koth/Agen Kolar, the filmmakers found that Nyamwasa's appearance was too distinct from Clarke's to cast her as the same character. Therefore, to correct this, Gallia's cousin Stass Allie was created and a suitable backstory was created, and an explanation crafted for Gallia's seeming absence from the battle. As this discrepancy of appearance was noted early on, virtually no sources misidentify either Jedi aside from color differences in lightsaber blades in some promotional images."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nyamwasa returned to reprise her role as Allie for the filming of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, appearing in several pieces of promotional art and in the Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary. However, Nyamwasa was not available for pick-up shoots, and was replaced by two different actresses. Portrayed in hologram form during the second Council scene by Tace Bayliss, the role would then go to Nina Fallon during her death scene. While Nyamwasa was cut entirely from the film, her likeness continues to represent the official appearance of Stass Allie, being the only model to appear in any licensed merchandise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dave Filoni, Supervising Director of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, stated in January 2013 that his crew had already made a model for Stass Allie to appear at a future date in the series, following the death of Adi Gallia in \"Revival.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
