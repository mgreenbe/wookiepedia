However, the orbital bombardment of the planets Uba I, Uba II, Uba IV, and Uba V accidentally ignited superweapon caches, ravaging the planets' surfaces with radioactive firestorms. The only survivors were found on Uba IV, some of whom were relocated to the Ubertica system.

Upon further investigation by local sector observers, the combined worlds launched a preemptive strike in the form of a tactical planetary bombardment of the Ubese weapons manufacturing plants.
