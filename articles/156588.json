Doctor Chelli Aphra discovered the idol and stole it, but was swallowed alive by the Shadowfang Beast. She hired several hunters to subdue the beast and kill it so she could safely escape her situation with the treasure she had stolen. The hunters Winloss and Nokk managed to subdue the beast, which was then killed by another hunter. Once the creature was dead, Aphra shot her way out with a blaster, and left the temple with a jetpack, not realizing that Winloss had stolen the idol from her as revenge for being tricked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
