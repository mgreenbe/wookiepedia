Its duties were to supervise the Galactic Alliance Intelligence Service, advise the Chief of State on matters of galactic and governmental security, and conduct special investigations. With a majority vote, the Council could also authorize special powers for security forces to take special measures including the internment of civilians without a trial. This power was used by Jacen Solo after the Council gave him a commission as a colonel and authorized the establishment of the Galactic Alliance Guard. Coruscant Senator G'vli G'Sil was the chairman during the Second Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
