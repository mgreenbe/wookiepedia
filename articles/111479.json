Fighting for a seat in the Galactic Senate, she argued that the planet Andara lessened Ieria's importance, and by giving her world a separate seat, her people could flourish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Secretly, Halion hired a squad of rebellious mercenary students who'd found refuge within Andara's elite Leadership School to help rally people to her cause. The son of her opponent, Senator Berm Tarturi of Andara\u2014Gillam Tarturi\u2014was leading the rebel group, however. When Gillam faked his own kidnapping as part of Halion's plot to assassinate the senator, the scheme went terribly awry. Only with the assistance of the Jedi High Council, who sent two undercover \"transfer students\" to the school (Anakin Skywalker and Ferus Olin, with their Masters lending support) to investigate Gillam's disappearance was the criminal attempt thwarted. The presence of the Jedi Knights and their Padawans, as they successfully infiltrated Halion's network of plotters, at last brought resolution to the Andaran conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Halion was a tall, lanky humanoid with short white hair twisted into spikes.
