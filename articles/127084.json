It was 40 meters long, and armed with turbolasers, and heavy duty tractor beams . The ship was specially equipped with a belly mounted landing claw, as well as specialized plasma torches, allowing the ship to dock with nearly any ship, and cut through it's hull to the plunder within. Propulsion consisted of a double Ion drive engine, located in the rear and providing excellent speed and maneuverability. Due to the ship's design, it was more than capable of traveling underwater, and at deep depths."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of them was employed by the pirates on Thonner led by Korraj."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
