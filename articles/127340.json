Captured slaves were kept from escaping by the combined threat of these blades and the ACP array guns carried by the Trandoshan guards. In 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Republic assault ship Prosecutor reappeared in the Corbantis system after disappearing. The clone commandos of Delta Squad were sent to investigate, and there they encountered numerous Trandoshans, several carrying these blades. They later encountered more blade-wielding Trandoshans on their mission to the planet Kashyyyk in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Slaver blades were first depicted in the video game Star Wars: Republic Commando, released in 2005.
