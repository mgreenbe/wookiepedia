In 33 BBY, Gargachykk and a fellow enforcer named Asa Naga were dispatched by Darnada to collect a gambling debt from the Sullustan Feen Fenoob aboard Darnada's space station.

They then encountered a tattooed Zabrak close by, in possession of a partially-ignited, red-bladed lightsaber. Naga ordered the stranger not to move, but the Zabrak deactivated his weapon and told the enforcers that they should not fear him.

Gargachykk was the first to react and charged at the Zabrak with his blaster rifle, but Maul cut off his right arm and beheaded him with one swift strike, killing the Wookiee.
