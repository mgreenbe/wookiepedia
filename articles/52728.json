The millitile inhabited its branches. The plant would be covered in fungus that smelled like \"moldy cheese\". Arblis Forest was primarily composed of Ganktos. The gankto tree reached heights of 12 meters, but its small pale leaves were all located on the bottom of the trunk, within a meter of the ground. A bare, gray trunk complete with exposed branches jutted from the center of the low bush-like leaves. The tree evolved this growth pattern to thwart a bird species which nested in its upper reaches and picked clean the branches. Over time, the tree's leaves came to only grow on the lowest branches. The birds continued to nest in the leaves, and as a result, the birds were caught and killed by their predators, including the myntor. Although the birds became extinct, the tree continued this pattern of growth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
