The square-shouldered vehicle had a long, narrow, rectangular forward section housing the powerful and noisy T-RA950 MagnaDrive engine. The cockpit lay at the rear of this section in front of a larger, reinforced cargo box mounted in the rear. From the factory, the cargo box had a single door with an extendable ramp which was reinforced. It could also be equipped with a hydraulic lift for heavy cargo, smaller side doors that were lockable, and even armor to protect cargo. The cargo box included a modular cargo-handling system to organize pallets, crates, or loose cargo so that loading and unloading the vehicle could be done quickly and efficiently. Passengers could also ride in the cargo section."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The A-A4B proved to be an excellent short-haul cargo truck and attracted the favor of smugglers, crime syndicates, and other individuals who wished to move large amounts of precious freight in semi-anonymity. The vehicle was known to be sturdy and relatively fast, resembling a tank, with a favorable capacity. It could also be customized and had plenty of room in the hull for hidden compartments, retractable weapons, battering rams, shield generators, and other less-than legal modifications."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grindalid gangster Moloch owned a modified A-A4B while working for Lady Proxima on Corellia. As his species was sensitive to light, the henchman would don protective armor and travel in his truckspeeder when conducting business on the planet's surface. Moloch used his truckspeeder to chase down Han and Qi'ra when the scrumrats escaped with a vial of coaxium. He rammed Han's stolen M-68 landspeeder but was unable to run them off the concourses leading to the Coronet Spaceport, and eventually gave chase on foot with his Corellian hounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As shown in The Art of Solo: A Star Wars Story, the Baja desert-racing trophy trucks with their powerful suspensions and engines were an early source of inspiration for the A-A4B."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
