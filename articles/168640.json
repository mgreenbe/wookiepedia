As a consequence, Goodvalor claimed Zongorlu were outraged, and those abroad in the Galactic Republic returned en masse to their homeworld, including their Senator, who asked for a leave of absence and a heavy assault cannon. All of this information was false, meant only to scare the Mandalorians out of attacking Zongorlu. It seemed somewhat effective, since it led many Mandalorians on Taris to pester Koblus Sornell with questions about what Zongorlu looked like."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In truth, the Zongorlu were big, lumpy plants that moved about a meter per day. When the Mandalorians landing on their homeworld, the Zongorlu \"kind of blinked.\" The Mandalorians grew so bored on the planet that some of them began to set fire to the natives. Koblus Sornell forbade this entertainment to continue, fearful the entire Mandalorian camp might catch on fire due to the rainless weather that week."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
