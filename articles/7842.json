Despite not being full Inquisitors, known Apprentice Inquisitors like Brakiss were sent on field assignments for training. One of the best known of these operations was when Brakiss infiltrated the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. Luke Skywalker was, however, aware of the infiltrator's true allegiances, yet sought to draw the young man to the light side. In a training exercise, Brakiss discovered the darkness in his spirit, and went on the run.
