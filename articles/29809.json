It effectively heightened the security of the planets of the Core Worlds, and reassigned various military and security assets to the protection of planets such as Coruscant, to ensure that they were safe from the advancing war machines of the Droid Army. Opponents of the law argued that it was enacted to appease business and financial supporters in the Core, and left the far-flung worlds in the Mid and Outer Rim undefended against the Separatists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
