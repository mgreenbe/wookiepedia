Its role was to transport Clone troopers as well as offering air-to-ground and air-to-air support for the Galactic Republic against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The LAAT/i gunship saw extensive use in numerous battles and campaigns of the Clone Wars. During the Imperial Era, the ships were used by both the Galactic Empire and Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship was a military repulsorcraft. Besides serving as an infantry transport, the LAAT/i gunship was also used to provide air-to-ground and air-to-air support for Republic forces. The front of the gunship had two double cockpit bubbles where the pilot and co-pilot/gunner sat in single file. The LAAT/i gunship had a pair of chin-mounted laser cannon turrets and a pair of dorsal rocket launchers fed by rear-mounted missile belts. Some LAAT gunships were also equipped with a pair of laser-beam turrets. When faced with overwhelming enemy fire, the gunship could close its blast shields."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LAAT/i gunships were capable of traveling at a speed of 620 kph.

LAAT/i gunships attacked the Petranaki Arena and rescued Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and members of the Jedi Order from Count Dooku. LAAT/i gunships then saw action against the Separatist Droid Army alongside Low Altitude Assault Transport carriers and AT-TE walkers and proved instrumental in inflicting heavy damage on the Separatist droid forces.

Jedi Masters Mace Windu, Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin traveled on an LAAT/i gunship to confront Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who was the Sith Lord Darth Sidious.
