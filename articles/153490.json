When the Sith Darth Maul landed his ship on Tatooine, the Jawa captured one of Maul's tracker droids in a net. The tracker droid dragged the Jawa along with it, and was seen during the duel between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn. Later, when the Queen Amidala's Royal Starship left Tatooine to return to her planet Naboo, the Jawa was stuck on the outside. The Jawa, still holding the tracker droid in its net, flew into Darth Maul in the Theed Plasma Refinery Complex, knocking Maul into the shaft and saving Obi-Wan Kenobi. Afterward, the Jawa was seen being dragged around during the celebrations in Theed. Ten years later, the Jawa was dragged along to Geonosis and went past Jango Fett's spaceship. The Jawa later bumped into Jango Fett and dragged him away from the Petranaki arena."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jawa appears in the 2012 young-readers books, LEGO Star Wars: Darth Maul's Mission and LEGO Star Wars: Anakin to the Rescue, a humorous re-imagining of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, respectively, using LEGO figures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
