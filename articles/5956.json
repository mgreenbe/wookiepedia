It safeguarded the Dagger of Mortis, a weapon that was capable of killing such powerful Force-wielders such as the Father and his children. It was the Daughter who brought Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi here to find the means of killing the Son. The futile attempt to kill the Son resulted in the death of the Daughter when the dagger fell into the hands of the Son bringing unbalance to the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
