Energy pudding was edible by a wide array of species, including Humans, Chagrians, Ansionians, and Mirialans; however, it was widely considered to lack a pleasant taste. The food, which came in wrapped bars and was brown in color, was available as early as the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, and the combat medic Archiban Kimble survived almost entirely on pudding. In 22 BBY, the Jedi Knight Barriss Offee discovered the Ansionian Tooqui raiding her supplies during a mission to the planet Ansion, and the thief tried to threaten her with packs of energy pudding as weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Energy pudding first appeared in the 2002 novel The Approaching Storm by Alan Dean Foster, and it is mentioned frequently in BioWare's 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic during conversations with Kimble\u2014or Doc, as the companion character for the Jedi Knight class is known in-game.
