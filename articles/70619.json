Its decor was markedly different from cantinas on Coruscant and the other Core Worlds, including gaudy wall hangings, old plumbing and polished droid parts from before the Clone Wars. The cantina had unbreakable mugs and stone-topped tables, both signs of the frequent blaster fights that took place there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 ABY, Mara Jade Skywalker met with Huxley at the cantina to terminate Talon Karrde's working relationship with the Huxlings.
