While the specific powers and duties of ambassadors varied across governments, planets and eras, they typically oversaw any embassy functions, staff and property, and as such were afforded diplomatic immunity. Sometimes when the diplomatic mission was too dangerous, Jedi Knights were sent in their place, because of their negotiation skills. In the often turbulent times of the galaxy, ambassadors played an important role in facilitating cessations of hostilities or expansions of friendly relationships. Ambassadors were also another name for members of the Imperial Senate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known ambassadors"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
