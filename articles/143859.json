The poster was commissioned by Resistance leader Leia Organa in the wake of the rising conflict between the grouping and the First Order, after Resistance pilot Poe Dameron witnessed a mass execution in the Jakku village of Tuanul. The poster placed particular emphasis on the flametroopers and their use of flamethrowers, as well as having the words \"The threat of the First Order is Real! Never Forget!\" written in High Galactic, with the last statement being highlighted orange, and the use of the name of the poster in larger font below it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
