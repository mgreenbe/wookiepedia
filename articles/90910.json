They were commonly found near the Grand Falls. They clung to trees with small claws that can rip through the bark of their favorite trees, the Jopto tree. The bark was thin and chewy and when ripped off, revealed a sticky green sap that was often used in Firrerre custard. They were marsupials, and carried their young in a pouch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
