When Gita fired her sniper rifle and only injured the animal, the woman stated that the meat from the animal would spoil, as the creature would run until it bled out.

At some point prior to the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, she disguised herself as a Tusken Raider sniper known as \"Urrr'k\" and attracted the attention of the Hidden Hand criminal syndicate. Gita was eventually discovered and recruited by Gwi, the leader of the syndicate, who was pretending to be a mere messenger for the organization, and Gita was inducted into a team tasked with hunting down and eliminating the Sith Lord Darth Vader. When recruiting the team's leader, the cyborg bounty hunter Beilert Valance, Gwi described the disguised rebel as a skilled sniper with mysterious origins. Along with Valance, Gita was also accompanied by so-called Jedi hunter droid Arr-Nine-Nineteen, Ardennian slicer Chio Fain, Gamorrean tracker Honnah, and the bounty hunter Dengar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Valance met the team, Gita witnessed the destruction of Arr-Nine-Nineteen at the hands of the cyborg, who revealed that the droid was a Hutt Clan spy and a fake Jedi hunter. With the team fully assembled, the group embarked on its mission. Gita then contacted the rebel base within the Fellio Asteroid Belt in the Outer Rim and informed her superior, Aeliar, that her team had begun its mission. Gita's actions allowed the rebels to begin purchasing arms from the Hidden Hand, as Vader was preoccupied with hunting down the individuals attempting to assassinate him. Unbeknownst to Gita, Valance had deduced that she was no Tusken Raider, owing to the fact that Tuskens never left their homeworld of Tatooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard Valance's cruiser, the Broken Wing, the team traveled to the astronomical object of Arvina in the Outer Rim, where the group contacted the Besalisk arms dealer Fetya in order to acquire weapons. Valance ordered Gita to stay behind and provide long-range support while the rest of the team met with the weapons dealer in Fetya's Hollow, a settlement in the area. In addition, although Valance stated that he did not trust her, he expressed confidence in Gita's skills as a sniper. When the deal with Fetya went sour and the Empire began attacking the settlement, Gita eliminated the Besalisk's associates and covered her team's escape, shooting down a number of TIE fighters in the process."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Skirmish on Heva"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Departing Arvina, the team then traveled to a Hidden Hand outpost on the astronomical object Heva, contacting another arms dealer named Wef and requesting several bot-drones, weapons originally intended for use by the Empire that were abandoned due to their unstable technology. Using a pair of electrobinoculars, Gita observed the conversation between Wef, Dengar, and Honnah. Vader and his forces soon arrived aboard the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Formidable; the Sith Lord had received information on the group's whereabouts from Dengar, his informant in the team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The disguised rebel then accompanied Valance and Fain in the Broken Wing as they utilized the bot-drones to assault the Star Destroyer, with Gita manning the cruiser's laser cannons and engaging TIE fighters. However, Vader attacked the Broken Wing in his personal TIE Advanced x1 and knocked Gita out of her position. After Fain successfully destroyed the Star Destroyer with the bot-drones, Valance landed his damaged starship, and Gita fled the vessel with the others.

When Vader deflected the blaster bolts, one of them shattered Gita's mask, while Valance was struck in the chest by another. With her face exposed, Gita then rushed to the injured Valance, revealing her true identity to the cyborg. As Valance prepared to intercept Vader, Gita witnessed the deaths of Fain and Honnah, much to her horror. Remembering what she was taught on Mytar, the sniper distracted Vader by shooting him but was then incapacitated by Vader's Force abilities. Gita's actions gave Valance enough time to dash toward the Sith and place an electro-pulse on his cape.

Sometime later, she suggested to Aeliar that she could resume her mission as Urrr'k again but was informed that the Hidden Hand had gone silent and that the rebels would therefore have to search for another weapons dealer. Hearing the news, Gita replied that no one would conduct deals with the Alliance. The two were then greeted by Valance, who had been freed by Vader. He displayed the location of a Hidden Hand outpost, claiming he knew where the rebels could find more weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Valance headed toward the Hidden Hand's main outpost in an asteroid field, Aeliar voiced her concerns about trusting the cyborg. Gita stated they had no other option and assured her that Valance would get them the weapons they desired to fight the Empire. While Valance was at the outpost, the two rebels allowed the people of Chorin, Valance's homeworld, to seek refuge in the rebel base in return for the weapons Valance would supply to the Alliance. Thus, the immigrants avoided a massacre at the hands of the Empire. Following the cyborg's return, Gita offered Valance a position in the Rebellion. However, he refused and left to continue his bounty-hunting career, but not before supplying the rebels with the weapons he had promised using the payment from their failed mission to assassinate Vader. By around 3 ABY, Gita and Aeliar's position at Lowik was succeeded by Lieutenant Kondra."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her time as Urrr'k, Gita only spoke to her team in the Tusken language, conveying a stoic personality to them. Despite Beilert Valance not trusting the disguised rebel, Gita took notice of the cyborg's expertise in combat and later assured Aeliar that he was skilled in battle and could help the Rebel Alliance greatly. When inviting Valance to join them, Gita remarked to the cyborg that although he was not very smart, he was a brave warrior.
