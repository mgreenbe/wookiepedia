Many Security Guards were natives of Naboo who had performed off-world military service, though it was known for nobles or businesspeople to receive martial training within the Security Guard before joining its ranks. Training was roughly similar to the galactic standard for a local police force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Security Guards commonly served as sentries and patrolmen in Theed, and the group was adept at handling riots and other civic disturbances, though military analysts did not believe the corps could defend Naboo against a military ground assault\u2014such as that performed by the Trade Federation during the Invasion of Naboo. Security Guards commonly served fifteen standard hours a week on average, and most tended to remain with the unit for two years. They were outfitted with a yellow-and-brown armored uniform, and carried CR-2 heavy blaster pistols, though in times of peril, the guards were equipped with blaster rifles. Sometime between 32 BBY and 22 BBY, the Security Guards adopted a darker uniform."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the assassination of King Veruna, the Security Guard quelled uprisings by elements of the Ralthar Syndicate.
