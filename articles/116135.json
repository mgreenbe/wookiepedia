As such, the pirate often used DAS-430 Neural Inhibitors and stun grenades. These also proved useful when encountering hostile stormtroopers. In the final years of the Rebellion, at what Rislar considered a career low point, the pirate signed up with the Alliance to Restore the Republic as a privateer. While having an Alliance observer aboard was not particularly pleasant, the privateer did appreciate the shipping schedules the Alliance provided.
