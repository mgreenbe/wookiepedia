The trees of Krant were a spectacular multi-colored variety, which glowed in the diffuse sunsets and shed their enormous leaves in two seasonal cycles. The predators of Krant were few and far between, leaving a large ecological niche in which herbivores and insects thrive. The Krantian songbirds filled the night sky with their calls and melodies, making for a bucolic, if noisy, setting for the newly-arrived colonists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its two major cities, Peche and Theenes, were agricultural in nature. Le'Roche, another city, was on an island. Krant had two moons and numerous orbiting asteroids that were caught in its gravity well. One of the main moons, Aereen, was mineral-rich.

After the Battle of Yavin, the Empire took over the Alliance's Ghost Base, which was subsequently liberated, along with Peche and Theenes, by an Alliance strike force led by Shen-Jon and Leia Organa\u2014whose ship, the Cretacian, had crashed on the planet previously.
