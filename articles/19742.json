The Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk was displeased when two Ranat and Nimbanel bounty hunters that he encountered on the Outer Rim world of Lothal failed to honor the Code and attempted to collect an Imperial bounty on his head. The Code forbade to slay another hunter, or steal another hunter's bounty. It also forbade hunters from asking about their bounties once delivered, requiring that the events that transpired from accepting the bounty to its delivery to be immediately forgotten. Beilert Valance was well known for flouting the Code, whilst Bossk believed in upholding the Code at any cost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
