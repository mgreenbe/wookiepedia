While clearing space for the first buildings, a species of greel tree was discovered. Although the bark was rough and of no use, the wood below was found to be smooth and a deep scarlet-violet in color. After consultation with xenobiologists and xenoarborists, Kayson found that the specific species had an amazing fast growth rate; if the stump was left intact, it would grow back to its original height within five years. Kayson abandoned his plans for the nature reserve and established the Greel Wood Logging Corporation. By instituting a careful program of logging and allowing harvested trees time to regenerate, Kayson laid the foundation for a successful company."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Greel Wood Logging Corporation was responsible for harvesting greel wood from the worlds of Pii III and Pii IV in the Arkanis sector. Greel trees were harvested on both Pii III and Pii IV, and the differences in the planetary weather conditions led to planet produce a different variety of greel wood. Pii III's greel wood was known as the \"grassland scarlet greel wood.\" The greel wood from Pii IV was known as the \"band crimson greel wood.\" The bushland scarlet was bushier, denser, and lighter in color. The band crimson was lighter, but darker in color. It commanded a higher price due to the elaborate and ornate spirals, waves and bands in the near-black flaws."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Industrial Automaton, the Greel Wood Logging Corporation developed the FLR \"Lumberdroid\" for its tree-felling operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a teenager, Tirs Maladane spent a summer on Pii III working in the greel wood industry to earn some money."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Uses"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some models of groundcoach including the Ubrikkian Transports LuxurPort Zisparanza, utilized greel wood in both interior and exterior paneling.
