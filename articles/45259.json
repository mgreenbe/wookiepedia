After its restoration around 15,000 BBY, the navy of the Galactic Republic moved aggressively beyond the Republic's frontier to defend its colonies and commerce. Although few records survived from that time, millennia later naval songs continued to mention deeds of bravery committed by members of the Republic Navy during conflicts at Esaga, Caulbon, and the Sundered Veil. During the Pius Dea Era, a period of time lasting from approximately 12,000 BBY to 11,000 BBY, Esaga was situated outside of the Republic's borders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Esaga was introduced in the 2012 reference book The Essential Guide to Warfare, authored by Jason Fry and Paul R.
