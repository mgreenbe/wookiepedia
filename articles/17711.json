In 0 BBY, the lieutenant was stationed in Detention Block AA-23 on the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon. Blagg was responsible for preparing the IT-O Interrogator droid for the interrogation of Princess Leia Organa, and grew anxious when a necessary part had not arrived by the time Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin came to personally check that everything was on schedule. When Blagg ordered the delivery droid, an MSE-6 series repair droid designated MSE-6-G735Y, to leave quickly, the droid collided with Tarkin and accidentally activated a holorecording of the stormtrooper TK-421. Tarkin was briefly distracted by the recording, then resumed telling Blagg not to make excuses or cast blame for the delays. Blagg asked if they should begin the interrogation, but Tarkin stated that it would be conducted by Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blagg appeared in the short story \"Of MSE-6 and Men,\" written by Glen Weldon for the 2017 anthology From a Certain Point of View.
