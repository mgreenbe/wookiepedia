It consisted of several rules and was the definition of what it meant to be a Mandalorian. It required Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin to return Grogu to the Jedi. Djarin, who was unknowingly a Child of the Watch, also followed the Way of the Mandalore, mandating that he never removed his helmet in front of another person. However, Bo-Katan Kryze and two other Mandalorians did not have their helmets on in front of Djarin, while discussing a plan to take back Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
