Her parents, a couple of hydroponic gardeners, frequently bought water from the moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars, who lived in the Jundland Wastes. As a result, Camie became acquainted with Luke Skywalker, the Larses' nephew and adopted son. In her late teens, Camie lived in Anchorhead and spent her free time at Tosche Station with Skywalker, Biggs Darklighter, Deak, Windy, and her boyfriend Laze \"Fixer\" Loneozner. Like the other members of that small circle, Camie nicknamed Skywalker \"Wormie,\" which sometimes made him doubt the sincerity of their friendship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Skywalker's dream"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 34 ABY, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker experienced a dream whilst living in exile on Ahch-To. In his dream, he married Camie during the early stages of the Galactic Civil War, and remained in the moisture farming business with his uncle and aunt. While dreaming of a different life, Skywalker stood outside of his homestead, gazing at the sunset with his wife as they reminisced of the time they shared together during the war between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance. Camie became unsettled by her husband, suspecting that he wanted to be far away from her, but Skywalker assured her that it was not the case."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A human female, Camie Marstrap had fair skin and blue eyes.

The only girl in the group was Camie, portrayed by the American actress Koo Stark. Although those scenes were not used in the final film release, they still appeared in the first issue of the Marvel Star Wars comics adaptation of A New Hope. They were also retained in the 1981 Star Wars Radio Drama broadcast by National Public Radio. In this dramatization, Camie was voiced by Stephanie Steele. Camie made a few more appearances in various stories and sourcebooks. These sources are part of Star Wars Legends, previously known as the Expanded Universe, and are therefore not official canon. However, Camie and her backstory were partially canonized by Topps's app Star Wars: Card Trader, which was released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
