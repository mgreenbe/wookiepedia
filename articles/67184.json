The conquest of Alanciar had been one of the goals of Grand Lord Varner Hilts who had ushered in the Hilts Restoration in 3000 BBY. The Tribe managed to find a way to cross the ocean after the High Lord Edell Vrai managed to develop a fleet of airships, which were held aloft by gas-filled bags and propelled by tethered beasts known as uvaks. The invasion was preceded by a reconnaissance mission led by Vrai, which had sustained heavy losses at the hands of the Alanciari."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to the Tribe, the Alanciari were prepared for the Sith since the Keshiri Herald Adari Vaal had managed to escape Keshtah and warn the Alanciari of the threat posed by the Sith. Thus, the Alanciari developed a militaristic society based on resisting any invasion. Despite these losses and the poor intelligence available on the Alanciari, Vrai's rival High Lord Korsin Bentado chose not to await Vrai's return from the continent and instead led the Ebon Fleet on a full-scale invasion. The Ebon Fleet was a fleet of sixty military airships. As before, the Alanciari destroyed the intruders with their ballistae. However, Bentado and several Sith survivors managed to regroup and infiltrate the Alanciari capital of Sus'mintri where they slew the entire War Cabinet, Alanciar's military government. This deprived the Alanciari military of their centralized military command and enabled the Sith to control the capital's main signal station. The Alanciari were unaware about this development."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bentado then rebelled against his liege Grand Lord Hilts and attempted to use the Alanciari ballistae to shoot down Hilts' airship so that he could create a \"Second Tribe\" on Alanciar. However, he was stopped by Vrai, Quarra, and his own Keshiri assistant Squab, who was actually an agent of Hilts. Squab personally executed Bentado while Vrai took control of Bentado's followers and the signal stations. Ultimately, the Sith were able to conquer Alanciar with minimal resistance after Hilts managed to manipulate the Alanciari man Jogan Halder into convincing his people that the Sith were not a threat but were in fact the benevolent Protectors, legendary deities in Keshiri religion. He also claimed that the Sith had wiped out the Destructors of whom Vaal had warned years before.

Under the leadership of the first Grand Lord Yaru Korsin, the Sith conquered the Keshiri living on the continent of Keshtah Minor by claiming to be the Protectors, ancient gods in Keshiri mythology. While the Keshiri woman Adari Vaal had initially collaborated with the Sith since it provided her with the opportunity to improve her social standing, she came to oppose the Sith offworlders following the mass poisoning of Keshiri villages during the Red Sith Purge in 4985 BBY and the way that the Sith exploited her people as slave labor. In 4975 BBY, Adari Vaal led an unsuccessful uprising on Keshtah which coincided with an unsuccessful coup d'etat against Grand Lord Korsin by his estranged wife Seelah and her son Jariad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Adari Vaal's uprising failed after her son Tona Vaal betrayed the Keshiri resistance by leaking news of the planned uprising to Nida Korsin, the daughter of Yaru and his successor to the Grand Lordship. Vaal and a thousand of her followers fled across the turbulent western sea to a new continent known as Alanciar. By the end of the journey, only Vaal and three hundred of a her followers had survived and landed on a remote offshore island. Eventually, Adari and her followers made contact with the Keshiri living on Alanciar. Vaal succeeded in warning the Keshiri living in Alanciar about the threat posed by the Sith Tribe. She became a revered figure in Alanciari civilization and was known as the \"Rock of Kesh\" and the Herald. While she later passed away, Vaal's memory and legacy was preserved in a historical tome known as the Keshtah Chronicles and Observance Day, a holiday held every ten years where passion plays focusing on the threat of the Sith were staged in many Alanciari cities, towns, and villages. Thus, successive generations of Alanciari were indoctrinated to regard the Sith as a threat to their freedom and way of life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next two millennia, the Alanciari developed a highly-militaristic society over the past. The Alanciari were led by a centralized military government known as the War Cabinet. They also developed an intricate network of semaphore signal stations, large anti-aircraft ballista capable of downing enemy aircraft, and a large industrial base. In addition, the Alanciari made use of Force-sensitive individuals as thoughtcriers, who were capable of sending messages through the Force. Most importantly, the Alanciari developed a large and well-equipped citizen army that was based on conscription. Galactic Basic Standard also replaced the Keshiri language as the main language of the Alanciari. Adari Vaal wanted the Alanciari to know the language of the Sith in order to prepare them for contact with the offworlders.

In 3000 BBY, the Caretaker Varner Hilts succeeded in ending the Time of the Rot after he discovered a map at the Kesh Sith Temple which confirmed the existence of another continent beyond Keshtah Minor. Hilts succeeded in reuniting his divided people by making the goal of reaching \"Keshtah Major\" an important part of the Tribe's agenda. Under the leadership of his chief engineer High Lord Edell Vrai, the Tribe experimented with developing a reliable and safe means of reaching Alanciar. Following twenty-five years of failed experiments with long-distance uvak flights and watercraft, Vrai managed to develop airships that were held aloft by gasbags powered by hydrogen and propelled by uvaks, winged reptiles native to Kesh."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First Contact"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2975 BBY, Edell Vrai obtained permission from Grand Lord Hilts to lead an overflight reconnaissance of \"Keshtah Major.\" His plan was to fly eastwards across Keshtah Major and then return by crossing the small ocean to the west coast of his home continent. This reconnaissance mission consisted of three airships: the Candra, the Lillia, and the Dann Itra. Vrai's expeditionary force succeeded in reaching Alanciar's Garrow's Neck peninsula one night but was spotted by two Alanciari stationed at Point Defiance, one of the six signal stations in the Six Claws, a series of six peninsulas which jutted out into the eastern ocean facing Keshtah Minor. These Alanciari individuals turned out to be the signals officer Jogan Halder and his secret lover Quarra Thayn, the wardmaster and chief military administrator of Uhrar.

Vrai's flagship Candra was attacked by three uvak diamond-flak riders from the Alanciari air force. Vrai along with five other Sith personnel, which included a Keshiri translator Tellpah, were the only known survivors from the wrecked Candra. They managed to evade their Alanciari pursuers and seize the signal station at Point Defiance.

The crew fought to the death and the Sith were unable to extract intelligence from the lone survivor who was tortured to death by his Sith interrogator Peppin. Prior to the downing of the Candra, the ship's thoughtcrier Taymor had succeeded in sending a signal to the Tribe's leadership in Keshtah's capital Tahv which indicated that the Sith had successfully made contact with Alanciar.

However, Hilts and Iliana wanted to wait until Edell returned since Iliana's thoughtcriers had sensed that some sort of harm may have befallen Vrai and his followers. When Iliana speculated that Edell and his airships may have crashed into the Southern Ocean, Hilts replied that he was still alive since he would have sensed his death. Despite his superiors' objections, Lord Bentado was persistent and Hilts reluctantly gave in to his demands and allowed Bentado to make preparations to invade Keshtah Major. In private, Hilts and his wife regarded Lord Bentado as a hot-headed fool who was sending his forces to a watery death.

Edell then made up new orders ordering himself to embark on a ground reconnaissance mission of Alanciar. For this he needed a local guide: Quarra Thayn. Edell managed to acquire Quarra's cooperation in exchange for attending to the wounds of her lover Tahyn. Edell agreed but stated that they had to return by two weeks or she would never see her lover again.

From its headquarters at Vaal Hall in the capital city of Sus'mintri, the War Cabinet ordered the deployment of military forces to the western regions while troops scoured the peninsulas for any trace of the attackers. That year, the Sith incursion also coincided with Observance Day, a patriotic holiday held every ten years which commemorated the memory of Adari Vaal and reminded the population of the threat posed by the Lost Tribe.

Following the play, the pair slept in a dry culvert near the Kerebba canal station. That night, Quarra experienced a Force vision where she encountered the former Sith woman Orielle Kitai and her Jedi husband Jelph Marrian who gave her encouragement. Orielle compared her former life as a high-ranking member of the Sith tribe to Quarra's station in the Alanciar military. She also warned Quarra of the dangers of \"living within a dream.\" During their time together, Edell and Quarra developed a reluctant friendship. Edell learnt about Quarra's family life and her affair with Jogan.

These black-colored airships had fearsome designs painted across their gondolas, which were made from heavy vosso wood frames. To provide a fearsome appearance, each of these airships had spears in front of the gondola. Due to the highly-organized Alanciari communications networks of semaphore machines and thoughtcriers, the Alanciari military was able to respond quickly to the Sith invaders.

Ballista units stationed at a nearby fortress also entered the fray, downing more airships. Within minutes, the Ebon Fleet had been decimated and many wrecked airships crashed on the ground. While many Sith crew and warriors aboard were killed, several Sith managed to survive but were immediately hunted by the Alanciari soldiers.

Amidst the fighting, Edell made contact with the Tyro who recognized him. Vrai asked the Tyro why his forces had not awaited his return to Keshtah Minor when the rest of the airships were finished. Before he could finish, the Tyro saw Quarra raising her weapon and lunged at her, bisecting her hand ballista. Before he could finish her off, Edell and Quarra combined their Force powers and hurled the Tyro and his lightsaber into a nearby field.

Vrai was initially reluctant to go on a detour since Uhrah was situated three-days away to the south-east of the capital Sus'mintri. However, Quarra insisted on going home to check that her family was safe. When Edell attempted to use her lover Jogan as leverage, Quarra insisted that her family came first always.

There, the Sith used their dark side powers and their lightsaber combat skills to murder the entire Alanciari government without arousing the Alanciari citizens and garrison. Even the sentries guarding Vaal Hall were unaware of this development since the Sith were hiding within the building.

However, he noted that effecting the control often failed due to the presence of too many variables like slaves with conflicting goals and other Sith working in the opposite direction. To emphasize his point, Korsin used the Force to throw several miniature airships across the table. Bentado argued that the Tribe's founder Yaru Korsin had only succeeded in winning the Keshiri over but had failed to conquer them.

A defensive Bentado responded that the Sith followers in the building were loyal to him. Edell countered that he could not always rely on the loyalty of his Sith followers since they would eventually tire of hiding indoors.

Edell also used the semaphore machines to communicate with the newcomers at Port Melephos, updating them about the recent developments in Sus'mintri and the defeat of Bentado's mutiny."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A \"Peaceful\" Conquest"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grand Lord Hilts' airship landed peacefully outside Port Melephos's anti-aircraft ballistae where it was greeted by several diamond-uvak riders. The Tribe's \"ambassador\" Jogan Halder emerged on the Good Omen's front balcony to greet the uvak riders and assure them of the ship's peaceful intentions. The airship was crewed entirely by Keshiri from Keshtah, whose social status had improved significantly under Grand Lord Hilts' leadership. The sole Human aboard the Good Omen was Hilts himself who pretended to be the Kesh-born minion of the Bright Tuash, an avian Keshiri deity, and claimed to be two thousand years old. To perpetuate that deception, Hilts donned a cloak made of gem-festooned feathers and a sharp beak. Halder delivered his testimony about how he was kidnapped by the Sith but came to learn that they were actually not a threat to the Alanciari. Hilts then supported Halder's testimony by promoting a message of unity and reconciliation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Good Omen then travelled to the Alanciari capital of Sus'mintri where it was greeted by a large crowd of Alanciari spectators. Edell Vrai and Quarra Thayn were also present. Jogan Halder delivered his testimony from the front balcony of the airship. He described he had been taken by the Sith beyond the Southern Ocean to Keshtah Minor following Edell Vrai's Mission to Alanciar. Upon landing, Jogan was blindfolded and transported on a cart to Tahv, the capital of the Tribe. There, Jogan recalled that he had his blindfold removed and was allowed to roam the city freely. The city was filled with Keshiri craftsmen, painters, sculptors, and musicians who greeted him. The Keshtah Keshiri told him that they were a \"happy and free\" people who lived under the protection of the Sith, whom they called the \"Protectors\", ancient gods in Keshiri mythology. He claimed that the Keshiri in Keshtah had lived in peace for two millennia and had been able to commit themselves fully to leisure pastimes like the arts, painting, music, and singing. By contrast, the Keshiri in Alanciari were said to have spent the past two millennia in drudgery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Halder was also allowed to visit the Tribe's capitol building where he had befriended the Circle of Lords. He described the Circle of Lords as a council where no man or woman ranked above the other. The Sith told Jogan that they Sith did not actually pose a threat to the Alanciari. While they acknowledged that Adari Vaal had been right about the presence of the \"evil\" Destructors among the Sith in her home continent, he claimed that the Tribe had already purged the Destructors one day after Vaal had left the continent for Alanciar. According to Halder, if Adari had waited just one more day, those that she had feared would have been destroyed and her warning would have been unnecessary. He argued therefore that the militarization of Alanciari civilization therefore had been unnecessary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Jogan also mentioned that a servant of the Destructors had risen in Keshtah again two thousand years later but had been driven from the continent. This same individual had also built a fleet of airships and had sought to conquer Alanciar. Jogan then mentioned that the Sith Edell Vrai and his airships had been sent in pursuit of those criminals. Vrai had been startled by the military and technological power of the Alanciari. He claimed that Vrai and his followers had brought him to Keshtah because they wanted to verify that the Alanciari were not the \"vile enemies of legend.\" According Halder, the clash between the Alanciari and Vaal's forces had thus been an unnecessary and needless misunderstanding. Jogan then recalled that he had assured the Sith that the Alanciari had always been on the side of good and that they would resist any evil that came their way. He then concluded by arguing that the Alanciari were not deserving of their wrath."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jogan Halder's testament was immediately followed by a speech by Grand Lord Hilts, who had disguised himself as the \"Keshtah-born\" minion of the Bright Tuash. Hilts claimed that he was two thousand years old and that both the Sith and Keshiri were his children. He also claimed that Adari Vaal, the revered founder of Alanciari civilization, was his daughter and that she had been well-meaning but misguided. He backed Jogan's account and professed to be saddened that the Destructors had attacked and killed the Alanciari War Cabinet. He also assured the Alanciari that the Destructors and their leader had been defeated by his agent Edell Vrai and the Alanciari woman Quarra Thayn, whom he described as a well-trained soldier. To facilitate peace between the two continents, the \"Bright Tuash\" decreed that both Human and Keshiri relief workers in white robes would arrive from Keshtah over the next few days to promote reconciliation and unity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Halder's testament, the Good Omen landed on the Sus'mintri parade grounds. He was immediately mobbed by thousands of cheerful Alanciari who regarded him as a hero for saving Kesh. Halder traveled to the city's signal station in order to transmit his message to the rest of Alanciari. He also briefly encountered Quarra Thayn but was too preoccupied to see her. Instead, he promised to meet up with her another time. Halder managed to transmit his message to the rest of Alanciar through the continent's semaphore network. As a result of Jogan Halder's diplomacy, the Alanciari peacefully submitted to Sith rule. Thus, Grand Lord Hilts succeeded in fulfilling his long-time ambition of conquering \"Keshtah Major\" while eliminating a major threat to his rule: Korsin Bentado."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In reality, Jogan Halder's Testament had been part of a \"grand deception\" staged by Grand Lord Hilts. To counter the deep-seated anti-Sith sentiment promoted by Adari Vaal, the Sith had to convince Halder and his people that while the Keshtah Chronicles were true, the Sith were actually the Protectors. To deflect attention from the Tribe, Hilts managed to depict his rival Bentado and his supporters as followers of the Destructors. This was helped by the sinister appearance of Bentado and his followers, many of whom had come from the former Korsinite League. Hilts had reasoned that Bentado's Ebon Fleet would give the Alanciari the fight that they would win. Despite knowing about the military capabilities of the Alanciari from Vrai's followers, Hilts had withheld this information from Bentado since that High Lord was too headstrong to listen to reason and because Hilts wanted to eliminate his political rival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hilts had also tricked Jogan into believing that Keshtah was a utopian paradise by putting the Tribe's most loyal Keshiri on to the streets of Tahv to create a false carnival atmosphere. Meanwhile, the Tribe had withdrawn from public view. To perpetuate the deception that the Tribe were actually the Protectors, Hilts also repainted the Tribe's remaining airships including his flagship Good Omen white and decorated them with jewels, tassels, and silken bunting. Ultimately, this deception worked and most of the Alanciari bought the message that the Sith were actually benevolent. While several Force-sensitive Alanciari including Quarra sensed some deception, they did not object because they were tired of the militaristic nature of Alanciari society and were willing to accept change."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Invasion of Alanciar was an important development in the history of the planet Kesh. As a result of its conquest, the Lost Tribe gained access to a large and wealthy continent which had substantial industrial base and was rich in lumber. This enabled the Sith to develop a large fleet of wooden sailing ships which replaced the dangerous airships as the planet's main mode of long-distance transportation. This new fleet of wooden sailing ships enabled the Sith to explore the uncharted regions and seas of Kesh including the unexplored northern hemisphere. High Lord Edell Vrai was appointed as the new de-facto governor of Alanciar. He was tasked with evaluating and cataloging Alanciari innovations that would be used by the Tribe. Vrai also presided over the demilitarization of Alanciari society. Ballista, both large and small, were destroyed in large quantities as a show of trust and reconciliation. In reality, the Sith were afraid that armed Keshiri would pose a threat to their rule. Hilts would regard the act of bringing the Alanciari Keshiri willingly into the Sith's service as a greater victory than capturing new slaves in combat. This victory was recorded in Hilts' testament, which was read to the Tribe's leadership every twenty-five years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Sith annexation, the Tribe's \"ambassador\" Jogan Halder became a professional hermit who visited the various cities of Alanciar in the airship Good Omen to repeat the story of his adventure. Halder's story was dramatized with the help of Keshiri actors and song-writes imported from Keshtah and gradually replaced the Observance Day plays which were based on the life of Adari Vaal, whose teachings were regarded by the new Sith authorities as outdated if not subversive. According to official rhetoric, Adari had merely been found on a rock. By contrast, Jogan had lived on a rock before his revelation to the truth. Thus, Jogan was regarded as the new \"Rock of Kesh.\" Due to his services to the Tribe, Halder gained a place of honor in their society. This prestige was also enhanced by the fact that he was the first recorded Alanciari visitor to Keshtah Minor, the domain of the Tribe. Finally, he broke off contact with his one-time lover Quarra since he was preoccupied with his new role and status."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Quarra Thayn joined the clean-up crew which removed the dead bodies from Vaal Hall and restored the building to its proper functions. She met up with Edell Vrai following the Sith annexation but declined his offer to join the Lost Tribe despite the privileges and powers that came with the job. Recalling her Force vision with Orielle Kitai, Quarra accepted that the Sith takeover of Alanciar was inevitable but she decided to remain loyal to her family rather than becoming the consort of Edell Vrai. Since her countrymen did not share her skepticism of the Sith, she decided that it was better to collaborate with them.
