The sergeant was onboard the gunship that carried General Skywalker, Commander Tano, Captain Rex, and clone trooper Ridge. As the gunships neared the B'omarr Order Monastery atop a tall mesa, the contingent of gunships came under Separatist anti-air fire, sustaining minor damage. After the gunships managed to land in proximity to the base of the mesa, Rex ordered all troopers to exit the gunship, including the sergeant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Republic forces scaled the mesa's surface with grappling guns and captured the B'omarr Order Monastery on the planet Teth, the sergeant was one of the clone troopers who accompanied Skywalker, Tano, Captain Rex, and several other clone troopers, including two others with faded blue markings, into the monastery in an attempt to investigate the area. After encountering the secret Separatist operative 4-A7 inside, Skywalker ordered Rex and the others to stay at the entrance of the monastery while he and Tano would go further inside and rescue the Huttlet Rotta.

Shortly afterwards, however, the Separatists launched a counterattack on the monastery, and the clone troopers moved forward to engage them at the entrance of the courtyard, including the sergeant. Eventually, after the destruction of the sole AT-TE, Republic troops were forced to retreat inside the structure. The sergeant was among the contingent of troopers remaining as General Skywalker relayed orders to the unit with input from Tano. Skywalker and Tano retreated further inside, while the remaining clone forces held the entrance to the monastery. Once Separatist forces breached the doors, a firefight ensued inside and the company sustained heavy casualties. Eventually, the remaining clone forces of Torrent Company were taken prisoner, and by the time that Rex and the surviving clones were held captive in the courtyard, the sergeant had perished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, the sergeant was a human male that stood at 1.83 meters tall, had natural black hair, tan skin, and brown eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone sergeant made use of Phase I clone trooper armor, which included blue markings.
