Fourteen years before the Battle of Yavin, a tragedy hit the family when a band of anti-Empire rebels attempted to steal scrubbers from the farm and accidentally killed Xea in the process. Not long after the incident, the farmer received a visit from the Imperial Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. When his son expressed the desire to join the elite troops of the Imperial Army to avenge Xea, the farmer refused, as he did not want to lose both his children. The boy, however, left the family home in secret, leaving only a note on the kitchen table. When his son graduated from the Junior Academy of Phelar, the farmer did not attend the ceremony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
