Tann had been challenged by a professor at the Chiss Academy to train a group of Yresilini into an army, overcoming the species' perceived untrainable nature. Tann began by appointing one Yresilini as a general and giving him several rudimentary commands, which the general and his fellow creatures laughed at. Tann had the general executed in front of the other Yresilini, and then chose a successor who obeyed her instructions implicitly and led the other Yresilini to do likewise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yresilini general was mentioned in Sev'rance Tann's databank entry in the 2002 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
