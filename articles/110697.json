They detected the presence of radiation, and provided an effective screen for low-level radiation. The device could protect the user from low and medium levels of radiation for up to fifty hours before the power cells were depleted. High levels of radiation still remained a potential hazard. The badge would also sound an alarm and change color as radiation levels increased. They were often worn by soldiers operating in theaters where radiation was a concern."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
