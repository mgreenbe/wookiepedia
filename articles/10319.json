However, Senior Captain Thrawn was prepared for this possibility, disobeying an order from Ar'alani in order to successfully save the Picket Force from being overwhelmed by Paataatus forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the battle, Ar'alani and her second-in-command Senior Captain Kiwu'tro'owmis were questioned by a group of Syndics on Csilla as to why Thrawn was apparently allowed to disobey an order. Wutroow responded that Thrawn had done what was necessary and proper, because a foolish Chiss diplomat had once pointed in the direction of Csilla from the Paataatus homeworld and warned the Paataatus of the vector by which the Chiss would launch an attack if provoked. Only Thrawn realized that the Paataatus had thus anticipated the Chiss' angle of attack, and saved the day by adapting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next year, Mitth'raw'nuruodo's forces would return to the space above Nettehi, but this time as liberators. The Chiss and the Paataatus were thus no longer adversaries, but allies. According to Syndic Prime Mitth'urf'ianico, the Diplomatic corps of the Chiss Ascendancy did not know whether to \"salivate\" or be furious over that \"first breakthrough in relations with the Paataatus\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
