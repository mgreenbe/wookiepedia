They go after this Jedi to find Ezra Bridger in caves on Lothal trying to practice his training. After a short chase they quickly overcome Ezra and kidnap him. Later on, Kanan Jarrus is curious onto where Ezra has gone off to. Hera Syndulla then tells him that Ezra told her he was going on an errand for him. Kanan then realizes Ezra may be in trouble and goes after him. The bounty hunters have knocked out Ezra and gagged him; they comment that the Empire better pay them handsomely for the Jedi's capture. Kanan then reveals himself to them and rescues Ezra. Ezra comments that now they know there are Jedi on Lothal and Kanan tricks them into thinking there are no Jedi and sends them back to where they came from."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
