Like the rest of his brethren, CT-8770 was a clone of the 1.83 meter\u2013tall Human male bounty hunter Jango Fett, and was born and raised on the planet Kamino to fight in the Grand Army of the Republic. In 19 BBY, during a battle on the planet Cato Neimoidia, CT-8770 was stationed in a clone staging area in one of the planet's bridge cities. When Order 66 was issued, a command that commanded all clones to kill their Jedi Generals, and General Plo Koon's Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor was shot down, it crashed into the staging area, killing CT-8770 and 140 other clone troopers. Moff Marcellin Wessel later reported on CT-8770's death to Palpatine, the Emperor of the newly proclaimed Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "CT-8770 was first mentioned in the article \"Order 66: Destroy All Jedi,\" written by Daniel Wallace and published in Star Wars Insider 87 in April of 2006.
