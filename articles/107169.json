Named for the Maximum Security Power Center, which supplied power to the Galactic Republic's prison facilities in the Tomb and Maximum Security Section, it was also home to a complex that the Esh-kha species converted into their sanctuary, and was split across the middle by a volcanic rift. Two transporters created by the Rakata were located in small caves along the cavern's walls."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
