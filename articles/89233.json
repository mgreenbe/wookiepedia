He could either appear as a brown haired, brown eyed Human male wearing either an officer's uniform or a pilot's jumpsuit, or as a brown haired, brown eyed Human female wearing either the officer's uniform or pilot's jumpsuit. Because the quest dialogue identified Dolv as male, this article assumes that the Human male depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity. However, the type of clothing he wore cannot be definitively determined."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
