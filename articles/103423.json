In areas where their food was plentiful, a M'shinn would give birth to a single infant once every three standard years. All M'shinni looked almost identical, although each generation's genetic code was subtly altered. The reptilian Sekct were fully parthenogenetic. Every individual would lay a single egg every two years, from which a single infant hatched.

Among the Ebranite, for instance, children were seen as little more than slaves, and had very little freedom. Neimoidian young were raised in communal hives from birth, where they had only limited amounts of food. Many died as a result. The Ortolans had few children. Education of the offspring was the responsibility of the parents, who pass their knowledge and skills they learned from their parents on to their children. When a child showed extraordinary aptitude in skills that are beyond the parents' expertise, they asked another Ortolan family to teach the child in return for some other service. However, parental obligations ended when the child reaches an age equivalent to seven years old, at which time they are simply thrown out of the house to forage on their own and fend for themselves. This is done in order to conserve the family's supplies, although exceptions are sometimes granted for children with a talent particularly valuable to the family's well-being. Tusken Raiders cared for their children, but they were not considered people until they had endured a ceremony that declared their adulthood. Babies often perished because of the harsh desert life, and Tusken Raiders took great pride knowing that only the strongest survived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, there were many species where parents were expected to love their children and be their teachers and protectors. The planet Cona, for instance, was a dangerous place for the immature and uninitiated, and the Arcona society arose from the need to ensure the safety of the young.

The married couple resides with and bears children for the clan that currently has the fewest infants. Yarkoran children were few and far between, and every child was doted upon and treated as a firstborn. Kubaz also loved to dote on their families.

Relationships built on love would usually last. They mated for life and would bear children as soon as their lifestyle permitted. Gotals took great delight in the raising of progeny, and their cone sensitivity enabled them to function well as a spouse and parent. Kel Dor couples would begin having children soon after marriage. Some Humans viewed sex as forbidden unless sanctioned by marriage; Boba Fett, for example, believed that sex between those not married was immoral. Having a child out of wedlock was considered scandalous by some Humans. The Arcona regarded a commitment to marry as a commitment to parent, whereas the Nautolans would mate for life and saw a happy mating, or marriage, as a necessary requirement for existence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This was in stark contrast to species like the Goroth, who had no concept of marriage at all.

For the Bith, reproduction was entirely a matter of rational selection. Prospective parents took a sample of their DNA to a Computer Mating Service (CMS), which matched it with samples from members of the opposite sex. From these comparisons, CMS developed a series of computer models projecting the outcome of a union between the customer and a dozen suitable mates. A prospective parent ranked each combination according to their preferences, and a meeting was arranged between clients who selected the same combinations in approximately the same order. The prospective parents or their agents would negotiate the number of offspring and how many each parent will receive.

As they had reproduced in this manner for so long, Bith lost the ability to conceive naturally, because the organs necessary to reproduce organically had atrophied past the point of being able to function in procreation. Amongst the Issori, breedings were negotiated between families, and the female Issori laid eggs which were fertilized by an agent packet produced by a male.

The Treka Horansi, on the other hand, shared a rough equality in regards to responsibility for their young. When Arcona reproduced, the males usually raised the children, as females were considered more reckless and irresponsible. Devaronians had vastly different personalities, and while the females would live their lives in comfortable homes and raise their young in villages, the males were driven by irresponsible wanderlust and preferred to live their life as vagrants. This kept males and females nearly constantly separated. After choosing a mate and siring children, male Devaronians typically took to the rivers and roads of their homeworld, and many left the planet entirely, rarely ever returning. However, the males would always send some of the money they earned back home to their wives and children.

Among the insectoid Flakax species, one singular female ruled each community and produced all of its young. The sole job of the males was to aid in reproduction, and after they had served their purpose, they were eaten by the female. In the traditional H'nemthe mating ritual, the female disembowels the male with her razor-sharp tongue.

Among the Brubb, the parents went their separate ways after their egg hatched, and the hatchling became a ward of the haba, a group of 10-10,000 couples. Every youngling was considered property of the haba, and every adult takes responsibility for rearing each child. A Ranat female moved her children into a nursery after giving birth to them. There, she and the other mothers would take turns providing minimal care to all the children of the tribe.

The only time when a male and female Rybet lived together for any length of time were in the first years of raising their young. For the first year or two, the parents would stay together, slaving their starships together and taking their parts in raising the young.

Because of this, they usually died at a younger age than males (in order to prolong their lives, an increasing number of females refused to lay eggs). Because of the toll that process took on their bodies, a Brubb female would lay only a single egg each Barosian year (567 days). The female would select her mate with great care before the mating process. After mating, the male and female would usually protect the nest together.

As a result, the Human Algarians strictly regulated the number of children the Xan were allowed to have. The Kaminoans controlled their genetic codes through cloning and selective breeding. As such, they were one of the most genetically homogenous species in the galaxy, while the children were made within a set of strict, predetermined genetic parameters.

The Qieg was a sentient insect species, where the females lay eggs that were fertilized by many males. There were no family units, but all the offspring were raised communally. The Qieg did not consider it important to claim offspring as one's own, and made no effort to determine whether a given infant was their child. The Ishi Tib of Tibrin had no spouses, and mating was governed by momentary desires on the part of the Ishi Tib. Ishi Tib would only mate to reproduce. Once fertilized, the eggs were laid in special hatcheries on the sandbars. The number of eggs allowed to mature was determined by the population requirements of the community, or \"school\", and the resources of the area where the school lived. The responsibility for raising the young fell to the community as a whole, and no one ever knew which hatchlings came from with parents. Potential partners were tested to verify that no problems would arise for their offspring. The Rakaans had five life phases which corresponded to unique sexes: Child, neuter, female, male and andro. Each Rakaan would normally experience at least three phases during a lifetime. In the female phase, the Rakaans laid eggs, which were fertilized by the males. The female would then keep the eggs inside her body. After the gestation period was over, the eggs were released into a nesting chamber where the andros cared for the fertilized eggs. The Lyra were cephalopods with a rigid caste system intricately linked to the number of tentacles possessed by the individual Lyra.

After a time, the Priapulin gave birth to, and cared for, the food-kin's babies, who in turn would act as food, and so on.

These arthropods resembled beetles, and were one of the rare species with true hive intelligence. One of the highest priorities of a Fefze swarm was to recruit new hatchlings in order to spread its mind base and to prolong its life. This was usually accomplished through a \"swarm dance\", which were ritualistic gatherings in which swarms met for the purpose of reproducing. Males from each swarm fertilized the eggs of females from other swarms. Most of these eggs were brought back to the swarms' home territory of hatching. The two swarms would then work together to form an egg globule belonging to neither of them. This new globule was abandoned in the hope that it would mature into a new swarm. In this manner, the race was perpetuated through the formation of new swarms.

The Sekct, who were also parthenogenetic, would lay a single egg every standard two years, although only one in two eggs would hatch, because the species was highly susceptible to random mutations.

In times of famine, the neuter population would skyrocket, while in times of severe depopulation, children would mature more quickly, and the male, female and andro population increased at a rapid rate. Bilars ate and slept in groups in order to survive. Bilars born within a few days of each other developed special affinities and became lifelong members of defensive communities. Within a few generations, the Bilar reproductive circle evolved to maximize each youngling's chance to bond with as many children as possible.
