However, the weapon had an effective range of twenty-three meters, which was comparable to more common models. It fired red energy bolts, which caused brute-force damage to the blaster's target. The barrel of the Zabrak Tystel Mark III was gold in color, while the parts of the gun around the handle and trigger were metallic green. Human-sized species could wield the pistol with one hand. The weapon could do considerable damage to an individual's face."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the time of the Jedi Civil War, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the Zabrak Tystel Mark III was used in various areas across the galaxy. The weapon was sold by members of the Zabrak species, who killed a number of pirates who attempted to steal shipments of the pistols. Not caring who bought the weapons as long as the sellers got paid, the Zabrak offered the Mark III on the black market. In 3956 BBY, Mark IIIs sold for around 1,500 credits each. One of the pistols found its way to the Upper Shadowlands of the planet Kashyyyk, where an individual who possessed the weapon had died, leaving it on the corpse. During the same year, another of the pistols was located in a settlement headed by a Rakatan known as the One on the planet Lehon. The weapons were still used in the galaxy at some point after 3662 BBY. By the start of the Galactic War between the Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire around 3642 BBY, Corso Riggs, a Human mercenary partner of a smuggler working for the Republic, was familiar with the weapon and its capabilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zabrak Tystel Mark III first appeared in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, a 2003 video game produced by BioWare. In the game, it was only found on a corpse in the Upper Shadowlands of the planet Kashyyyk and in a footlocker located in the One's Rakatan settlement on the Unknown World. Compared to the generic heavy blaster pistol from the game, the weapon had an increased attack bonus and had a small increase to its energy damage value, as well as a physical-damage bonus. The game does not specify whether or not the Zabrak designed the Mark III; it only states that they were selling it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2011, the weapon was mentioned again in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a MMORPG produced by BioWare that was a sequel to Knights of the Old Republic. In the game, the weapon's name was spelled \"Zabrak Tystel Mark 3\" and could be mentioned in \"Heist of the Millennium\", a quest for players of the smuggler class. The weapon is only mentioned if the player has Corso Riggs in their party and chooses the light side path of a conversation with Lieutenant Palinx, an Imperial who attempts to stop the player while they sneak aboard the Imperial treasury starship King's Ransom. With any other companion or alignment choice, the Zabrak Tystel Mark 3 will not be mentioned, and it is not mentioned in any other conversation in the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
