The weapon was capable of controlling hyperspace travel, potentially locking out populations of entire planets from being able to access hyperspace. In 2 ABY, the weapon was discovered by the Imperial astrocartographer Essio Galassian, who attempted to make it work for the Empire. However, in an attempt to stop Galassian, a Rebel Alliance squad led by Han Solo destroyed the weapon along with the entire planet it was located on."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
