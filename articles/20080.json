When Charle Remmot Organa and a Republic operative arrived to meet the Baron to discuss terms in freeing the prisoners, Jharkus wanted to have the operative as his prisoner since the operative was more valuable. After the operative complied to be taken, Brant Sonn and the prisoners were freed, but he joined the Republic in rescuing the operative, who in turn stopped the Thul advance on House Organa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
