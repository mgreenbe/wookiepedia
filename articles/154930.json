He communicated the pact via a sealed datapack, which the Rebels were instructed not to unlock until returned to their superior officers in the Alliance. Upon completion of their mission, the Rebels did so, and a huge holographic image of Ebareebaveebeedee appeared above them to swear the pact. The Squib diplomat Spilferithimus-narlamos attested to the deal, and the Squibs awaited the signature of Rebel leader Mon Mothma to finish the alliance. The king requested that the Rebel operatives who had aided the Squibs be named ambassadors to his species, a position that afforded them special rights and discount privileges from the Squibs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
