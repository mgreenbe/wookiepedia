She succeeded in rallying the warring covens, styling herself as the Queen of the Nightsisters. She conceived a daughter, Ros Lai, with an enslaved Jedi Knight, and used her mate's powers to augment her own connection to the dark side of the Force. When she became strong enough to dispense with him, Zalem murdered her husband and started to rear her daughter as a witch. The child, however, appeared to be deformed, which prompted Zalem to reject her. At some point, the self-styled queen discovered the Star Chamber on Dathomir, and she sought to unlock its secrets and gain access to the Infinity Gate. The effect of Zalem's meddling with that ancient technology resulted in the destruction of the planet Ova. That incident attracted the attention of the Jedi High Council, who sent the Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos to Dathomir. While Vos was unable to stop Queen Zalem by himself, Ros Lai wished to avenge the death of her father, and she ended up killing her mother."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zalem was born on the planet Dathomir within a community of Nightsisters, a society of female darksiders.

Her plan was complicated when Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos arrived on the planet, investigating the disappearance of the planet Ova. Shortly after Zalem finally gained access to the Gate, she sent a shockwave to destroy the planet Coruscant. However, before the shockwave could hit, Vos and her daughter Ros Lai arrived.

Eventually, the shaman Talzin was appointed to the leader of the Nightsisters. She succeeded in reuniting the battling Nightsisters clans and stopped the infighting. Under her guidance, the Sisters would have a chance to explore the galaxy as Force-sensitive assassins and mercenaries\u2014which might be considered a fulfillment of Zalem's desire to free the Nightsisters from their prison planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zalem rejected any form of ethics, considering morality acted as a brake on supreme power.
