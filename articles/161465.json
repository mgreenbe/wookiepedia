In 3 ABY, the Imperial Prelate Verge had multiple TIE interceptor squadrons positioned near a number of worlds along the Rimma Trade Route inpreparation for a predicted attack by the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry, Vixus Squadron being positioned near manufacturing planet Sullust. After the 61st's starships were reported at Sullust, Seiteron, aboard the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Herald, had the bridge crew open a channel with Vixus Squadron for him. The squadron, already prepared to move, was travelling to Sullust within an hour. When arriving at Sullust, Vixus Squadron hid behind the nearby moon in wait for the 61st's troop carrier, the CR90 corvette Thunderstrike, and its escorts to return for the rebel company."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Thunderstrike and its escorts\u2014the Braha'tok-class gunship Apailana's Promise and two X-wing starfighters\u2014soon returned to Sullust to retrieve the 61st.
