In the case of extensive repairs, sections of the spacedock could be sealed off with individual atmospheric shields to provide an easier working environment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The design's central spine structure contained power generators, engines, thrusters, crew quarters and machine shops. When traveling through hyperspace, the metal frame's ribs had to be retracted beforehand, a maneuver that often needed 12 to 24 hours of preparations. In an emergency, this could be shortened to only two hours, but required a thorough maintenance check for days afterward, as partially stored segments of the vessel would suffer damage from the journey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Alliance Core Fleet managed to acquire one such spacedock.
