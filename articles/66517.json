It was built from the foundation of a standard BARC speeder, a speeder bike that was considered a lighter variant of the ISP. As such, and because of its powerful and unique turbofan and repulsors, it was highly maneuverable and able to easily operate on most terrain quickly and smoothly, making the speeder convenient for a range of combat situations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The speeder could attain speeds of 100 kilometers per hour, had a length of five meters, and was equipped with two frontal twin swiveling blaster cannons, which were capable of disabling larger vehicles. Between the cannons was a blaster pre-charge capacitor. The ISP also had a forward-terrain laser scanner on both sides as well as two mudshields on the front."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The unique turbofan produced less noise than most ion thrusters and could be reversed to provide a sudden stop. Two pilots sat toward the rear beside the craft's central repulsorlift, directly above which was the turbofan. Like most of the Galactic Republic's vehicles, the speeder was mostly gray with red accents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ISP could travel through most terrain and was originally designed for patrolling swamps. The ISP's weapons allowed it to combat larger enemy vehicles like shielded gunships and fighters, allowing the speeder to effectively support infantry units, especially those under direct threat. The speeders were especially strong when fighting against the NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer, a droid tank of the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ISPs were utilized by the Galactic Republic toward the end of the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide war waged between 22 BBY and 19 BBY against the Separatist Alliance. The ISPs were first used during the Battle of Kashyyyk in 19 BBY, where they earned the nickname \"swamp speeder\" from the Republic's clone troopers. On the planet Kashyyyk, the ISPs were used in conjunction with HAVw A6 Juggernauts, AT-AP walkers, clone scout troopers, and Wookiee warriors against the Separatist Droid Army. They served as an equivalent of the Wookiees' Oevvaor Jet Catamarans and Raddaugh Gnasp fluttercrafts. In that same year, Infantry Support Platforms were also utilized in the Battle of Felucia as part of the Outer Rim Sieges, where they escorted AT-APs, AT-TEs, and AT-OTs in search for any signs of droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Infantry Support Platforms first appeared in the prequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, released on May 19, 2005.

The article also introduced \"ISP\" and \"swamp speeder\" as alternative names for the vehicle. The speeder was first identified in the new Star Wars canon as the swamp speeder in the Star Wars Expert Guide in 2016, while the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia introduced the names \"clone swamp speeder,\" \"Infantry Support Platform\" and the abbreviation \"ISP.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vehicle was developed by concept artist T.J.
