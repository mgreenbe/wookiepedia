In 27 BBY, a small scout force encountered a Chiss fleet under Admiral Ar'alani, and attacked with immediate ferocity. Despite being outnumbered by the Chiss, the Yuuzhan Vong fleet force was only destroyed with great difficulty and casualties. There were no survivors for the Chiss to recover, although they did learn some of the Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the attack, Commander Thrawn encountered the Bargain Hunter, leading to fears that the Galactic Republic and the Yuuzhan Vong were allies staging a joint invasion against the Chiss."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Special Task Force One arrived in the Unknown Regions and Kinman Doriana used the threat of Jedi falling into the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong as a pretext to destroy the Outbound Flight, Thrawn was convinced to agree to the plan due to the knowledge of the difficulty the Chiss had faced against the limited Yuuzhan Vong scout force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, at the start of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Panha would mention the skirmish to Sarkkin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
