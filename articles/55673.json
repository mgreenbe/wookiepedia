Over several decades of criminal activity, Seron amassed a fortune and became one of the more prominent crime lords on Korbin. Seron's illegal activities stretched from Korbin to several other worlds, and his primary interest was illegal gambling, although he was known to dabble in extortion, smuggling, and arms running. Seron's handling of his businesses was so adept that little evidence of his illegal activities could be found. The New Republic resorted to charging Seron with underreporting the income of his legitimate business holdings. The New Republic believed that the companies were fronts of handling contraband goods and laundering dirty credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seron benefited from the death of Jabba the Hutt by absorbing elements of his organization. The crime lord once acquired detailed information on the New Republic's plans to deal with the remnants of the Galactic Empire. Seron's agents contacted the New Republic, demanding 20,000 credits which was reluctantly paid although no evidence was found that Seron was directly involved. As a result, all New Republic agents had standing orders to arrest Seron on sight, and the New Republic posted a reward of 75,000 credits for Seron's capture on charges of intent to defraud the New Republic government of tax revenues. In 10 ABY, Seron killed Sub-Prefect Neris for refusing to be corrupted. Seron had also killed Neris' predecessor, Bregless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seron was a male Hethas who stood two meters tall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seron was skilled with a blaster, and knowledgeable about alien species, cultures, languages, and planetary systems.
