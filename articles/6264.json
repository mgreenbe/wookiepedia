He had confirmed to Darth/Legends Vader that the Rebels had taken the bait to attack the Empire's new Death Star at Endor, believing it to be under construction and unguarded. In reality, the Death Star was fully operational and armed, although still under construction and that the Imperial Navy was hiding and laying in wait to destroy the Rebel Fleet. Stele was then assigned to delay the Rebels for Emperor Palpatine to prepare for the upcoming battle. To that end he was to destroy the first three starships that arrive at Nav bouy Sul-34. The Secret Order wanted Stele to destroy a large portion of starfighters so that the Alliance would have to commit all of their reinforcements and leave nothing in reserve."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stele arrived at Sul-34 to find a Strike Cruiser Red Dog present with X-wings and A-wings after dealing with the starfighters two more medium ships arrived and launched their own fighters.
