Although made out of rubber in the scene where Jabba ate one, in other appearances it was portrayed by a real frog. Toby Philpott, one of the puppeteers for Jabba, recalled that the frog used was a giant from the Zoo, possibly of African origin, although he wasn't quite certain whether it was a frog or a toad. He commented that during filming, it once jumped out of the prop where it was to be \"eaten\" by Jabba, and caused a commotion that he deduced from hearing the panic, but was unable to actually witness due to being in the Jabba costume."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ambiguously canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
