It was home to around thirty percent of the Pijali population of the system, most of whom were hidden from censuses by the Czerka Corporation, who exploited the moon's inhabitants and resources. The inhabitants of the moon, including the Opposition, attempted to make the monarchy of Pijal aware of their situation. The monarchy was eventually put to an end after a failed revolt by the newly-crowned Queen Fanry, and Governor Orth canceled the contracts that Pijal had with the Czerka Corporation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
