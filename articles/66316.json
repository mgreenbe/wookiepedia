After Tomasso, the leader of a smaller Spice Runner cell, killed the Zualjinn high commander while meeting with the syndicate under the guise of a diplomatic mission, he was left stranded on Quintil, with the Zualjinn searching for him. The remaining members of the cell, led by Vigilch, embarked on a mission to save Tomasso, who was located by Zorii Bliss, the daughter of the Spice Runners' leader Zeva Bliss, and the new recruit Poe Dameron. The Zualjinn located the remaining Spice Runners, pinning them down in a blaster fight. Dameron attempted to trick the Zualjinn leader into thinking he was betraying the Spice Runners as a distraction, but Tomasso was caught sneaking onto their starship, and the Spice Runner cell was captured and imprisoned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the smugglers were freed by a group of Kyuzo associates led by Zatticha, who were associates of Tomasso and had been passing by at the time, picking up his distress signal. The Kyuzo aided the Spice Runners in reaching their vessel and escaping the planet, though the smugglers were pursued by three Zualjinn ships. With Dameron piloting, the Spice Runners managed to escape the Zualjinn by hyperspace skipping, crash-landing on the planet Sorgan. Following Dameron's feat, the Spice Runner cell officially recognized him as a member."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
