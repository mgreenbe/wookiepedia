Around the time of the Battle of Yavin, it was under the command of Captain Hove. The captain, however, was forced to answer to Alecia Beck, a senior commander in the Imperial Security Bureau, and took the Star Destroyer wherever she ordered him to. By the senior commander's order, the Vehement was directed to the planet Cyrkon, where Beck wanted to arrest Caluan Ematt, a member of the enemy Alliance to Restore the Republic. Upon arrival, the Vehement took position to block all flight traffic to and from Cyrkon. The Vehement later took part in and was destroyed during the Battle of Endor, which also saw the destruction of the second Death Star and the demise of Emperor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
