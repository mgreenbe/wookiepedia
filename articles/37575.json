The detect life spell allowed the caster to detect life forms that were hidden from their normal range of senses. When activated, the spell allowed the Ascendant to locate all sentient beings within ten meters. Particularly proficient Ascendants could also detect if the targets possessed Ta-Ree abilities or were Force-sensitive. Because the power evolved on Kathol, using the detect life spell on Human and Near-Human species had a particular side-effect of making the targets nauseous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
