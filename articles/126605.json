During his raid, Mon used the Darkstaff, a powerful Sith artifact that he sought to repair, to rip the Force essences from a number of his slaves and transfer them into a crystal pyramid. He then returned to the Animiasma with the pyramid and the Jedi Order subsequently dispatched the Jedi Knight Oden Malksch and a team of freelance agents to board the vessel and free the Force essences that were trapped within the crystal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Malksch and the agents landed on the Animiasma and made their way through the ship, and they confronted Mon inside his throne room.
