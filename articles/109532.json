They had two brains, one located in their head and the other inside their chest cavity. Possessing no spines, Quermians were notable for their towering stature, with an average member of the species standing over three feet taller than most other humanoids. Quermians had two sets of thin arms with hands that terminated in several slender digits, and a pair of legs that ended in large toed feet. The second pair of arms was often hidden and was supported by the braina located in the chest cavity. Lacking noses, Quermians instead smelled using olfactory glands in their hands. Quermians could live up to 200 years of age, possibly more. Due to the Quermian's many physical and genetic similarities to the Xexto, xenobiologists believed them to share a common ancestor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some Quermians, such as Jedi Master Yarael Poof, preferred to conceal their second set of arms beneath clothing, and traditionally wore cannom collars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Quermians in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Native to the Outer Rim world of Quermia, four Quermians were members of the Jedi Order during the Trade Federation's Invasion of Naboo, the most senior of which being Jedi Master Yarael Poof.
