Designed to both protect the hands of the wearer and deal damage to an opponent, shockboxing gloves emitted electricity with every blow. Unlike stun gauntlets, shockboxing gloves had variable levels of electrical outputs that ranged from a stun setting, to a light shock as often used during sparring sessions, all the way to a lethal output. The way shockboxing gloves were worn kept the gloves from falling from the wearer's hands and to prevent forceful disarmament. They weighed approximately 0.4 to 0.5 kilograms on average, and ran around five to six hundred credits in price."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
